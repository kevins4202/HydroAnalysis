1145,large floodplains are complex ecosystems at the land water boundary because of rainy and dry seasons most tropical floodplains are subjected to annual water level fluctuations during typical low water periods extensive areas of the floodplains are dry however relatively small geomorphological differences within the boundaries of the floodplains result in comparatively large differences in the length and depth of inundation and in turn the establishment of distinct plant communities called macrohabitats the specific ecological conditions of these macrohabitats have to be taken into consideration in the development of sustainable management methods and protection measures extreme floods and droughts have very strong effects on flora and fauna the low hydrological buffer capacity of floodplains makes them vulnerable to anthropogenic changes in hydrology and to the impacts of global climate change this study presents a macrohabitat classification system that has been applied to three large brazilian floodplains the forested amazonian várzeas and igapós and the savanna floodplains of the upper paraguai river pantanal of mato grosso examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of this system in comparative inter and intra wetland studies and therefore its utility in assessing environmental changes including those arising from global climate change our approach can also be used to guide the implementation of sustainable management methods and as a focal point for the development of environmental legislation keywords floodplains classification macrohabitats management protection legislation 1 introduction many of the large floodplains of brazil cover thousands of square kilometers the pantanal of mato grosso extends over 140 000km2 the araguaia floodplain over 88 000km2 irion et al 2016 and the amazonian várzeas and igapós over 400 000km2 and 300 000km2 respectively wittmann and junk 2018 seasonal rainfall in the tropics and subtropics leads to predictable changes in the water levels of these areas during the hydrological cycle depressions are permanently covered by water whereas higher lying areas are inundated for longer or shorter periods depending on the intensities of the flood and drought phases and on the soil conditions different plant communities become established these differ not only in their species composition but also in the quality and quantity of their primary production thus providing living conditions for different communities of animals including species specific to a particular floodplain area and species using different areas for feeding breeding and or the avoidance of excess flood and drought stress thus both terrestrial and aquatic species are not randomly distributed in large floodplains but are characteristic of certain areas several approaches have been undertaken to describe the interaction between rivers and their floodplains welcomme 1979 described the impact of the flood pulse on fishery in the tropics junk et al 1989 published the flood pulse concept which describes structures functions and ecological processes in river floodplains and has since been updated several times junk and wantzen 2004 junk 2005 based on the fluvial landscape structure in the floodplains of temperate regions petts and amoros 1996 developed the fluvial hydrosystem concept hydromorphological units were also used by drago 1990 in assessments of the lower paraguay and middle paraná river by latrubesse and franzinelli 2005 for the negro river and by latrubesse 2008 for large rivers in general nunes da cunha and junk 2011 2014 and junk et al 2012a 2014b 2015 used the flood pulse concept to develop a macrohabitat classification of the pantanal of mato grosso and the amazonian várzea and igapó that takes into account the hydrological conditions of those areas and the species composition of their higher vegetation for a definition of macrohabitat see section 3 the simplified approach enables comparisons not only within a particular floodplain but importantly also with similar areas in different floodplains moreover because the classification system can easily be understood by planners politicians and the local population it provides a tool for management in the design of practicable measures aimed at floodplain protection human activities and major natural changes in environmental conditions such as climate change strongly affect floodplains in very specific ways that can best be described at the macrohabitat level this article summarizes our hierarchical approach to the classification of brazilian wetlands and our macrohabitat based classification of the country s large floodplains we also provide examples of the use of this system in comparative scientific studies in sustainable management and in environmental protection legislation and analyses of human impact including the effects of climate change 2 the brazilian wetland classification system many countries have their own wetland classification systems that consider both the territorial features of the wetlands and to a certain extent the political considerations in their regulation different classification approaches are also used by scientists depending on their field of interest for instance neiff 2001 differentiated nine wetland types in argentina using 12 parameters to characterize geomorphology soils fire stress vegetation animals water origin and several hydrological parameters brinson and malvárez 2002 also differentiated nine major wetland types in argentina but used the climate hydrology soils and vegetation of geographic regions as criteria recently a wetland inventory of the la plata basin was published that included hydrological and ecological information on the wetlands in 79 macroregions of the five participating countries cic 217 however none of those classifications and inventories had any hierarchical structure by contrast the brazilian classification of junk et al 2014a is a hierarchical one it recognizes hydrology as the principle determinant of the ecological conditions in wetlands and that the large majority of tropical and subtropical wetlands are subjected to different types of flood pulses the frequency duration amplitude and predictability of inundation and drought influence the occurrence distribution and life cycles of organisms living in the wetlands other factors are climate and water and soil quality accurate indicators of the ecological conditions in wetlands and their macrohabitats are higher plants because they are fixed in the soil herbaceous plants reflect the environmental conditions of weeks months and a few years and woody plants those of years decades and even centuries animals are a less appropriate classification basis because they are mobile and often use different environments to meet their needs furthermore indicator animals may become extinct by human actions even though environmental conditions may still be appropriate for their occurrence the brazilian classification system divides the country s wetlands into three hierarchical levels the first comprises three systems coastal wetlands inland wetlands and artificial wetlands the second is based on wetland hydrology as the principle element in the definition of a wetland and therefore a key aspect in any functional analysis and includes subsystems orders suborders classes and functional units in the case of brazilian natural inland wetlands a hydrologically based classification demonstrates their large hydrological diversity the third hierarchical level references the occurrence of higher plants and the structures of their communities it is divided into subclasses and macrohabitats however given the size and difficult access to many large wetlands or wetland subsystems this classification may require revision as the future availability of additional botanical inventories will certainly increase the number of subclasses and macrohabitats needed to accurately describe internal wetland structures nonetheless an advantage of the classification system is that it is flexible enough to allow the inclusion of new categories without invalidating the entire system summary of the brazilian classification system first level systems three systems coastal inland and artificial wetlands second level subsystems three coastal subsystems influenced by the tide or characterized by a relatively stable water level or by a fluctuating water level two inland subsystems either a relatively stable or a fluctuating water level orders three orders of inland wetlands monomodal predictable flood pulses of long duration or polymodal unpredictable flood pulses of short duration or multi annual unpredictable flood pulses of short duration in semi arid regions suborders two suborders of inland wetlands subject to monomodal predictable flood pulses of long duration with high or low amplitudes classes four classes with high amplitudes e g amazonian várzeas and igapós and seven with low amplitudes e g pantanal matogrossense functional units six functional units permanently aquatic periodically aquatic periodically terrestrial permanently terrestrial swampy and artificial third level subclasses numerous in coastal and inland wetlands macrohabitats numerous in coastal inland and artificial wetlands the fluctuating water levels of flood pulsing wetlands create major ecological and legal problems for the determination of wetland extent brazilian scientists have proposed the following definition of the floodplain area the extent of a wetland can be determined by the border of the permanently flooded or waterlogged area or in the case of fluctuating water levels by the limit of the area influenced during the mean maximum flood the outer borders of wetlands are indicated by the absence of hydromorphic soils and or hydrophytes and or specific woody species adapted to grow in periodically or permanently flooded or waterlogged soils the definition of a wetland area should include if present internal permanently dry areas as these habitats are of fundamental importance to the maintenance of the functional integrity and biodiversity of the respective wetland junk et al 2014a this definition introduces two new concepts the first is the mean maximum flood level as the outer boundary of the wetland however this boundary is heavily contested by many brazilian planners and by representatives of agroindustry who instead propose the area flooded during normal level defined as the low water level of the connected rivers the problem with that definition is that it excludes most of the floodplains from wetland status and allows their exploitation for conventional agriculture and infrastructure purposes moreover its practical impact is that it threatens the ecological integrity of the wetlands and their commercial and non commercial values in addition to leading to heavy economic losses during high floods these losses often have to be compensated in part by the government and thus finally by the taxpayer whereas the benefits occurring in normal periods are reaped solely by private owners piedade et al 2012 the second new concept is the inclusion of internal permanently dry areas in the definition of a wetland during floods many domestic and wild animals seek shelter at least transiently in the dry areas of the floodplain furthermore a considerable number of the herbaceous and woody plants found in large floodplains are only slightly flood resistant and thus depend on the existence of dryer areas as shown by junk et al 2006 for the pantanal if these areas are modified the functional integrity and biodiversity of the respective wetland are seriously threatened 3 why is a macrohabitat classification in floodplains necessary brazilian wetlands with a rather stable or unpredictably pulsing water level are relatively small and therefore do not need a subdivision that reaches the macrohabitat level by contrast large floodplains occupy the level of classes and require a subdivision in smaller units as has been done by several authors dubbs 1994 described different woodlands and wet savanna habitats in a ranch in the southern pantanal schessl 1999 distinguished eight major vegetation types in the aquatic terrestrial transition zone attz of the northern pantanal but does not consider aquatic macrohabitats wantzen et al 2005 developed a classification system adopting the ordination of the fluvial landscape structure developed in the fluvial hydrosystem concept by petts and amoros 1996 their classification recognized different types of river channels and lakes and provided many important hydrological and limnological details the attz makes up the major part of the floodplain but the classification system of wantzen et al 2005 is unsuitable for the development and implementation of management and protection measures as the macrohabitat diversity in this area is underrepresented the macrohabitat classification of nunes da cunha and junk 2014 which encompasses the pantanal of mato grosso as well as the amazonian várzeas junk et al 2014a b and igapós junk et al 2015 makes use of the entire set of macrohabitats from permanently terrestrial to permanently aquatic ones the system developed by these authors provides an easily understandable framework for 1 comparative scientific studies between different floodplains and their macrohabitats 2 the development and application of specific management methods and protection measures including monitoring and ecological restoration 3 environmental impact analyses and 4 the formulation of specific environmental legislation and policy sustainable management and protection can only be achieved with the collaboration of the local population which owns large parts of the floodplains and uses their resources to reach these goals the classification considers as much as possible the subunits already known and referred to by local populations the major challenge for a subunit based classification of floodplains is the inclusion of the annual dynamics of their water levels we therefore introduced at the class level an additional category the functional unit this technical term is also used by wantzen et al 2005 but in a slightly different context to avoid confusion we provide the following definition a functional unit is a large landscape unit in a floodplain that is subjected to specific hydrological conditions during the annual cycle we differentiate between five functional units permanently aquatic predominantly aquatic permanently terrestrial predominantly terrestrial and permanently swampy fig 1 a sixth functional unit includes all anthropogenic macrohabitats independent of their hydrological condition a subclass is defined as a subunit of a functional unit with specific hydrological conditions and a characteristic cover of higher vegetation mcgraw hill 2003 defined a macrohabitat as an extensive habitat presenting considerable variation of the environment containing a variety of ecological niches and supporting a large number and variety of complex flora and fauna we have adapted this general definition to the brazilian wetland classification as follows a macrohabitat is a subunit of a subclass characterized by indicator plant species or groups of species it is the smallest unit of the classification system and the one most sensitive to natural environmental changes and to human impacts therefore it is best suited for comparative scientific studies environmental impact analyses and the development of legal approaches to wetland management and protection as an example of the characterization of a macrohabitat in the following we describe macrohabitat 3 6 2 of the pantanal of mato grosso it belongs to functional unit 3 predominantly terrestrial which includes six subclasses subclass 3 6 refers to areas covered with monospecific forests and includes five macrohabitats with number 3 6 2 representing forests dominated by vochysia divergens cambarazal and inundated up to 8 months of the year description from nunes da cunha and junk 2014 this macrohabitat is very flood tolerant arieira and nunes da cunha 2006 and during very wet periods it expands to include the surrounding grasslands nunes da cunha and junk 2004 the expansion of v divergens is counteracted by the wildfires that occur during very dry years which lead to the retraction of these forests in the pantanal there are cambarazal stands of different ages depending on their degree of protection against wildfires old stands form dense forests made up of several tree species normally associated with riparian forests such as eugenia spp tocoyena foetida and psychotria carthagenensis because these stands are of high ecological value as habitats for different animal species they should be protected 4 macrohabitats as the basis for comparative studies table 1 lists the number of functional units subclasses and macrohabitats in three large already classified floodplains the pantanal of mato grosso contains the highest number of macrohabitats which reflects its impressive geomorphological diversity ab saber 1988 jiménez rueda et al 1998 assine 2003 assine et al 2016 including savanna as well as forested habitats amazonian várzeas rank second and in addition to forested wetlands include a considerable variety of macrohabitats covered by herbaceous plants representative of the strong erosion and deposition processes that affect these areas and the high nutrient status of their sediments and water junk 1997 junk et al 2010 the negro river igapó is also a forested wetland albeit with a much lower macrohabitat diversity due to the lower declivity of the river course where most of the fringing floodplains occur and the smaller sediment load compared to that of the solimões amazon river thus both erosion and deposition are less prominent and many macrohabitats related to river dynamics are absent junk et al 2015 the low nutrient status of the water and sediments limits the occurrence of herbaceous plants and accordingly macrohabitat formation macrohabitats can also be used for comparisons of vegetation types in different floodplains all floodplains have low lying macrohabitats that are inundated for long periods and characterized by pioneer shrub communities for the amazon várzea two macrohabitats are described one in areas with low and the other in areas with high sedimentation rates species composition in the two areas differs because the alluvial soils in highly flooded topographies are sorted as coarse grained soils near river channels and fine grained soils in backwater depressions coarse grained soils in lowland rivers mostly sand and fine sand impose specific conditions for colonizing shrub communities because the sedimentation rates are usually high such that shrub seedlings as well as the superficial root layers of established shrubs may be covered by sediments in the case of well aerated coarse grained soils their low water retention capacity may result in their rapid desiccation when they fall dry for this reason many shrub communities on coarse grained alluvial substrates make use of deep primary roots that may reach ground waters when the water levels of the river are low conversely high sedimentation rates require that plants have the capacity to establish new root horizons near the soil surface after flooding this capacity is exemplified by salix martiana alchornea castaneifolia and in western amazonia tessaria integrifolia wittmann et al 2010 wittmann and parolin 2005 in backwater depressions fine grained soils tend to silt up slowly because river waters have already lost most of their sediments by the time they reach these sites fine grained soils have a high water retention capacity but are often poorly aerated even when the water levels of the river are low in amazonian várzeas eugenia spp symmeria paniculata coccoloba ovata ruprechtia ternifolia and myrcia sp are characteristic species seedling establishment is rare because of long lasting flood periods and vegetative propagation by root sprouting is frequent pioneer shrubs inhabiting fine grained soils grow much more slowly and have longer life cycles than their counterparts in better aerated soils they may reach ages of up to 60 80 years while those in coarse grained soils usually complete their life cycles within 10 15 years in sediment poor rivers there is typically only one shrub community because river dynamics are generally low and the life cycles of pioneer shrubs are usually longer at these sites than along sediment rich rivers however this picture may change as more inventories in different river stretches become available wittmann et al 2013 5 macrohabitats as indicators of the impact of global climate change worldwide major changes in hydrology are expected in response to changes in the global climate junk et al 2012b floodplain organisms are adapted to the normal flood pulse but they react sensitively to extreme floods and droughts multiannual very wet and very dry periods can have dramatic effects on different macrohabitats the major climatic processes that will affect floods and droughts in the pantanal are as yet unknown in part because models of global climate change and its impact have yielded contradictory results in contrast to amazonian floodplains the water level of the pantanal is not impacted by el niño and la niña events marengo et al 2016 however increases in the frequency of extreme climatic events and in temperature are expected with a worst case scenario of a 2 5 3 5 c increase in temperature and a 10 20 reduction in precipitation between 2011 and 2040 and a 5 7 c increase in temperature and a 30 reduction in precipitation for the period between 2071 and 2100 these figures do not consider the increase in water loss due to evaporation because of the higher temperatures climate related changes will greatly reduce the total floodplain area and affect all macrohabitats favoring those situated in the functional units permanently terrestrial and predominantly terrestrial between 1962 63 and 1972 73 a multiannual dry period occurred in the pantanal of mato grosso the resulting wildfires destroyed large stands of woody vegetation as shown for the above described macrohabitat 3 6 2 forests dominated by vochysia divergens cambarazal during the following wet period there were large losses of cattle several macrohabitats used as pastureland were invaded by shrubs and trees among them also vochysia divergens junk and nunes da cunha 2012 animals are also affected at the macrohabitat level in the pantanal for example the flooding of low lying sand bars in response to higher low water levels destroys important nesting places for shore birds the general impact of extreme floods and droughts on wildlife was described by alho and silva 2012 in central amazonian floodplains the minimum water level is mainly influenced by the cross equatorial atlantic sea surface temperature gradient and the atlantic multidecadal oscillation while the maximum water level is shaped by the el niño southern oscillation and the inter decadal pacific oscillation barichivich et al 2018 at manaus harbor 14 severe droughts 15 8m and 14 severe floods 29m have been registered since 1903 the frequency of severe floods has increased steadily since the 1970s with exceptionally high water levels in recent years during the same period severe droughts have remained at more or less the same frequency with a slight increase during the last 15years the intensification of the hydrological cycle in the world s largest watershed is a result of increasing sea surface temperatures in the tropical atlantic and a simultaneous cooling in the central and east equatorial pacific resulting in a strengthened walker circulation barichivich et al 2018 these forces are expected to increase in strength with global warming in addition despite a large degree of uncertainty studies suggest that drought will intensify through the 21st century marengo and espinoza 2016 the impact of these extreme events in amazonia has already been demonstrated in several studies such as that of piedade et al 2013 at the beginning of the 1970s a 4 year period of high low water stages led to the mass mortality of trees and shrubs at the lowest areas of the flooding gradient of the várzeas and igapós near manaus junk 1989 among the areas most impacted areas by extreme droughts were the igapó forests along the negro river and other guyana shield tributaries which in 1925 26 williams et al 2005 1997 98 nelson 2001 flores et al 2014 and 2015 16 suffered el niño induced droughts that coincided with low water periods making these ecosystems periodically vulnerable to wildfires resende et al 2014 schöngart et al 2017 this greater susceptibility to wildfire of igapó forests than non flooded forests terra firme or the nutrient rich dynamic white water floodplains várzea can be explained by the superficial root mats large amounts of accumulated litter and mostly sandy soils that characterize these forests santos and nelson 2013 flores et al 2014 2017 consequently the higher temperatures enhanced frequency and intensity of drought gloor et al 2013 2015 marengo and espinoza 2016 and the resulting fires associated with climate change against a setting of changes in land use associated with deforestation and the construction and operation of hydroelectric dams will severely impact macrohabitats at low topographies in the igapó 6 the importance of macrohabitats for the implementation of sustainable management methods in the past human interference in large brazilian floodplains was small such that vital structures and functions as well as biodiversity were mostly maintained however management methods introduced during the last several decades have been more aggressive than traditional ones and have impacted much larger areas cattle ranchers own about 90 of the land in the pantanal traditional cattle ranching maintains macrohabitat diversity and in some areas is conducted alongside ecotourism which relies on the preservation of landscape beauty a large biodiversity with a high number of emblematic plant and animal species and local cultural practices junk 2017 by contrast the shift in some regions to large scale intensive cattle production has destroyed habitats that are essential to the multiple functions provided by the pantanal the substitution of a variety of vegetation units by the large scale planting of exotic grasses used for grazing such as urochloa humidicula and u decumbens has diminished the species diversity of native herbaceous plants and thus that of the associated fauna as well in addition navigation authorities propose channelizing the paraguai river to allow the passage of larger ships hydrovia hamilton 1999 conservatively estimated that a deepening of the river channel by 10 25cm could reduce the flooded area by 11 7 31 4 this view was supported by ponce 2011 furthermore in addition to a reduction in the size of the pantanal the existing arrangement of macrohabitats along the flooding gradient would be seriously affected thus any change in the hydrological status imposed by a deepening of the river channel will have far reaching consequences for the entire floodplain unsuitable agricultural methods have accelerated erosion processes in the upland of the pantanal the increased sediment load of the taquari river a large tributary of the paraguai river has led to congestion of the river bed and the long term flooding of about 11 000km2 of the adjacent floodplain galdino et al 2006 the result has been the conversion of a macrohabitat rich region into a homogeneous hypoxic swamp covered by eichhornia spp and other floating aquatic macrophytes in amazonian várzeas the floodplains have been used and settled for centuries by european immigrants however agriculture together with cattle and water buffalo ranching not only destroyed important forested macrohabitats and their valuable timber resources but also the food basis of commercially valuable frugivorous fishes the extraction of timber and non timber products forms the basis of plywood industries as well as smallholder and community based forest management in the várzea floodplains higuchi et al 1994 schöngart and queiroz 2010 but in many cases forestry practices do not consider the ecological peculiarities of floodplain forests and have thus threatened their sustainability forest succession in the várzea is driven by geomorphological and environmental modifications that are a consequence of sedimentation and erosion processes worbes et al 1992 wittmann et al 2004 2010 after the establishment of herbaceous species on freshly deposited alluvial sediments first colonizing pioneer trees form monodominant stands which rapidly develop into early and late successional stages along this successional gradient tree density declines and tree species richness increases leading to changes in canopy architecture and a reduction of the solar radiation on the forest floor wittmann and junk 2003 with increasing stand age the wood densities of the characteristic tree species increase whereas diameter increment rates decrease reflecting the substitution of light demanding pioneer species by both long living pioneer species and shade tolerant late successional species schöngart 2003 the result is the establishment of different forested macrohabitats that have to be managed appropriately to be sustainable based on the mean age size relationships of commercial tree species from the central amazonian várzea floodplains growth models have been developed that integrate species specific age diameter and diameter height relationships into allometric equations schöngart 2008 this gol growth oriented logging modeling approach considers the differences between the different types of forested macrohabitats the impact of hydroelectric power plants on specific macrohabitats is well demonstrated by the balbina reservoir in central amazonia the dam was completed in september 1987 fearnside 1990 and its operation increased the annual minimum water level of the uatumã river below the dam by 100cm compared to pre dam conditions this created permanent flooding conditions during several consecutive years at the lowest topographies in the igapó thereby inducing the mass mortality of highly flood adapted tree species such as macrolobium acaciifolium and eschweilera tenuifolia assahira et al 2017 7 macrohabitats as focal points for environmental legislation the implementation of environmental protection measures and sustainable management methods depends on informed environmentally friendly legislation large floodplains are too complex to be protected by a general uniform legislative approach rather regulations must be specific focusing on landscape units that can be recognized by the local population only when the local population supports the regulations and participates actively in their implementation will the desired positive effects be achieved the respective landscape units are the macrohabitats as exemplified by those in the pantanal in interviews ranchers recognized nearly all of the macrohabitats established by nunes da cunha and junk 2011 as well as the importance of these landscape units for cattle ranching and the maintenance of wildlife duarte et al 2017 studies on the encroachment of shrubs and trees in pasture areas have highlighted the need to eliminate invasive species to maintain both pasture areas for the benefit of ranchers and the biodiversity of macrohabitats dominated by herbaceous plants and their related wildlife barbosa da silva et al 2016 current legislation hinders pasture clearing considering it as forest removal which is prohibited by law however encroachment is a dynamic process one that will be interrupted by the next wildfire a recognition of these conditions will facilitate the negotiation of agreements between ranchers and environmentalists in the pantanal to allow pasture clearing in certain macrohabitats in exchange for the total protection of other environmentally important ones junk and nunes da cunha 2012 in 1988 the federal brazilian constitution declared the pantanal as national patrimony thus mandating that its use comply with laws guaranteeing protection of the environment including natural resources a federal law no 750 2011 is currently being crafted that will regulate policies regarding the management and protection of the pantanal scientists participating in those discussions are seeking to include in the legislation macrohabitats to be granted total or partial protection restricted use or restoration nunes da cunha et al 2017 irigaray et al 2017 activities that severely modify the hydrology of the pantanal such as the channelization of the paraguai river must be avoided all permanently aquatic macrohabitats are important to fishes and aquatic wildlife during the dry season these areas and the adjacent floodplain forests should be managed in favor of fish stocks this includes protecting the access of fishes to spawning grounds in up river areas free of hydroelectric reservoirs in amazonian várzeas the simplified brazilian forest legislation normative instruction no 5 december 11 2006 established by the brazilian institute for environmental and renewable natural resources ibama and resolution no 406 february 2 2009 from the national council of environment conama define a common minimum logging diameter mld of 50cm and felling cycles of 25 35 years this legislation does not address the highly varying growth rates of dozens of commercial tree species from different macrohabitats schöngart et al 2010 by contrast the results of the above mentioned gol have been included within innovative forest legislation for várzea floodplain forests normative instruction no 009 november 12 2010 and implemented by the ministry of environment and sustainable development of amazonas state sds the positive impact of this innovative approach on the use of the varzea forests however will depend on the application of this legislation in practice 8 discussion and conclusions wetlands are among our planet s most valuable ecosystems costanza et al 1997 but they are also highly threatened ones to be efficient management practices and environmental legislation aimed at wetland protection must consider the ecological economic and social differences that distinguish large wetlands finlayson et al 2011 current management approaches are not adapted to deal with their water saturated or periodically flooded soils minor wetland areas have been and continue to be drained for civil construction or used for the dumping of liquid and solid waste large wetlands are lost as floodplains become physically separated from their parent rivers or are destroyed by the construction of large reservoirs davidson 2014 the agricultural practices recently developed in europe and north america and applied in brazil have modified the hydrological character of the country s wetlands by drainage and dike construction to allow dry land agriculture by contrast the traditional flood adapted methods still practiced in large tropical wetlands maintain the integrity biodiversity and thus the ecological economic and social benefits of these ecosystems nonetheless these methods are becoming increasingly side lined even though their continued use in many tropical regions such as those of africa has confirmed their validity nepad 2003 emerton 2005 european settlers benefitted from the knowledge of the indigenous people regarding the ecological peculiarities of specific geomorphological structures and vegetation types however they dramatically modified the use of south american floodplains by introducing domestic animals and new crops not previously known to the indigenous people thus in forested floodplains such as the amazonian várzeas forest clearing was a very early activity because fertile soils encouraged agriculture and animal husbandry on the high lying ground occupied by floodplain forest junk et al 2000 goulding et al 1996 the resulting large scale destruction of forested macrohabitats destroyed not only valuable timber resources but also the fruit trees essential to commercially important stocks of fruit feeding fishes in periodically flooded savannas enough natural pasture was initially available for cattle and horses forest clearing occurred only on a small scale such that the structure function and biodiversity of savanna wetlands were preserved the pantanal of mato grosso is one of the few examples where during several centuries europeans sustainably managed a complex tropical wetland ecosystem yet by the beginning of the 1970s this was no longer the case as the economic pressure exerted by cattle ranchers in the uplands forced ranchers in the pantanal and in other periodically flooded savannas to increase the productivity of their own ranches overgrazing and the destruction of valuable macrohabitats were the consequences ioris 2012 the lack of a politically recognized brazilian definition of wetlands has created serious problems in the discussion about wetland delimitation piedade et al 2012 use of the definition provided by junk et al 2014a b has been recommended by the ministry of the environment in 2015 but this recommendation has no legal status preoccupation with the ongoing environmental destruction led to several studies on the wetlands in the entire paraná paraguay river basin in 2014 ioris published a study on the impact of global climate change on the pantanal and the upper paraguay basin with a focus on socio economic institutional and legal aspects in 2017 an inventory of wetland regions was published by the intergovernmental coordination committee of the countries of the la plata basin cic 2017 this inventory provided general ecological information on the wetlands in different geographic macro regions including human impact on the wetlands in 2018 an ecological risk assessment of the paraguay river basin was published by wwf brazil an ecological risk index calculated for different regions was used to evaluate both the extent and intensity of human activity within a given landscape and the respective risk of water quality and environmental degradation mattson and angermeier 2006 these approaches are certainly important at the macro scale but recommendations and actions aimed at sustainable management and protection require the recognition of smaller ecological units as geographic targets this can be achieved using macrohabitats as described by nunes da cunha and junk 2011 for the pantanal and by junk et al 2014b 2015 for amazonian várzeas and igapós in the ongoing discussion about the sustainable management of the pantanal many ranchers have defended the establishment of large uniform pasture areas while failing to acknowledge the negative impact on macrohabitat diversity however a high macrohabitat diversity represents a high functional and species diversity as well as complex inter habitat interactions the argument of managers that a macrohabitat based classification is too complex to be considered in management plans is not valid indeed unless management methods adapt to the complexity of macrohabitats the use of these environments will not be sustainable nonetheless the acceptance of regulations stipulating management and protection will be facilitated by the use of local terms to describe and identify the target areas in the pantanal most scientifically described macrohabitats are recognized by the local population duarte et al 2017 a similar approach has been used in other regions of the world such as in india gopal and sah 1995 in addition columbian scientists are elaborating a wetland classification according to the brazilian approach this is a remarkable development considering the many frontier crossing rivers and wetlands which require a harmonized environmental legislation between the two countries the most important ecological driver in floodplains is hydrology and it depends strongly on the discharge of the connected rivers about 80 of large brazilian floodplains fall dry during normal low water periods in very dry years this number can reach or exceed 90 the fact that climate models yield conflicting results and do not allow precise predictions about the total amount and seasonal distribution of precipitation should not be used to justify the neglect of measures that recognize and offer solutions to major changes in hydrology in the pantanal and in amazonian floodplains all models indicate an increase in the occurrence of extreme events of precipitation and drought in amazonia an increase in the number of extreme floods and droughts is already the case barichivich et al 2018 these events do not affect floodplain macrohabitats randomly as those situated at the upper and lower parts of the flooding gradient are especially sensitive to long term disturbances and are therefore good indicators of environmental changes including global climate change dryer climates reduce the frequency and duration of floods at the upper part of the gradient favoring the invasion of terrestrial plants and animals in what were previously floodplain macrohabitats permanently aquatic macrohabitats such as lakes and river channels as well as permanently swampy areas are of specific importance for the maintenance of biodiversity and aquatic productivity in floodplains because they serve as refuges for aquatic organisms only 20 of the pantanal and amazonian floodplains belong to this category however in response to very dry periods which will become more frequent according to the predictions of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2013 these areas will likely shrink with dramatic consequences for the aquatic fauna of the entire floodplains these examples show that macrohabitat classification is only the first step in the ecological characterization of large floodplains macrohabitats are not randomly distributed but are often clustered in

1145,large floodplains are complex ecosystems at the land water boundary because of rainy and dry seasons most tropical floodplains are subjected to annual water level fluctuations during typical low water periods extensive areas of the floodplains are dry however relatively small geomorphological differences within the boundaries of the floodplains result in comparatively large differences in the length and depth of inundation and in turn the establishment of distinct plant communities called macrohabitats the specific ecological conditions of these macrohabitats have to be taken into consideration in the development of sustainable management methods and protection measures extreme floods and droughts have very strong effects on flora and fauna the low hydrological buffer capacity of floodplains makes them vulnerable to anthropogenic changes in hydrology and to the impacts of global climate change this study presents a macrohabitat classification system that has been applied to three large brazilian floodplains the forested amazonian várzeas and igapós and the savanna floodplains of the upper paraguai river pantanal of mato grosso examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of this system in comparative inter and intra wetland studies and therefore its utility in assessing environmental changes including those arising from global climate change our approach can also be used to guide the implementation of sustainable management methods and as a focal point for the development of environmental legislation keywords floodplains classification macrohabitats management protection legislation 1 introduction many of the large floodplains of brazil cover thousands of square kilometers the pantanal of mato grosso extends over 140 000km2 the araguaia floodplain over 88 000km2 irion et al 2016 and the amazonian várzeas and igapós over 400 000km2 and 300 000km2 respectively wittmann and junk 2018 seasonal rainfall in the tropics and subtropics leads to predictable changes in the water levels of these areas during the hydrological cycle depressions are permanently covered by water whereas higher lying areas are inundated for longer or shorter periods depending on the intensities of the flood and drought phases and on the soil conditions different plant communities become established these differ not only in their species composition but also in the quality and quantity of their primary production thus providing living conditions for different communities of animals including species specific to a particular floodplain area and species using different areas for feeding breeding and or the avoidance of excess flood and drought stress thus both terrestrial and aquatic species are not randomly distributed in large floodplains but are characteristic of certain areas several approaches have been undertaken to describe the interaction between rivers and their floodplains welcomme 1979 described the impact of the flood pulse on fishery in the tropics junk et al 1989 published the flood pulse concept which describes structures functions and ecological processes in river floodplains and has since been updated several times junk and wantzen 2004 junk 2005 based on the fluvial landscape structure in the floodplains of temperate regions petts and amoros 1996 developed the fluvial hydrosystem concept hydromorphological units were also used by drago 1990 in assessments of the lower paraguay and middle paraná river by latrubesse and franzinelli 2005 for the negro river and by latrubesse 2008 for large rivers in general nunes da cunha and junk 2011 2014 and junk et al 2012a 2014b 2015 used the flood pulse concept to develop a macrohabitat classification of the pantanal of mato grosso and the amazonian várzea and igapó that takes into account the hydrological conditions of those areas and the species composition of their higher vegetation for a definition of macrohabitat see section 3 the simplified approach enables comparisons not only within a particular floodplain but importantly also with similar areas in different floodplains moreover because the classification system can easily be understood by planners politicians and the local population it provides a tool for management in the design of practicable measures aimed at floodplain protection human activities and major natural changes in environmental conditions such as climate change strongly affect floodplains in very specific ways that can best be described at the macrohabitat level this article summarizes our hierarchical approach to the classification of brazilian wetlands and our macrohabitat based classification of the country s large floodplains we also provide examples of the use of this system in comparative scientific studies in sustainable management and in environmental protection legislation and analyses of human impact including the effects of climate change 2 the brazilian wetland classification system many countries have their own wetland classification systems that consider both the territorial features of the wetlands and to a certain extent the political considerations in their regulation different classification approaches are also used by scientists depending on their field of interest for instance neiff 2001 differentiated nine wetland types in argentina using 12 parameters to characterize geomorphology soils fire stress vegetation animals water origin and several hydrological parameters brinson and malvárez 2002 also differentiated nine major wetland types in argentina but used the climate hydrology soils and vegetation of geographic regions as criteria recently a wetland inventory of the la plata basin was published that included hydrological and ecological information on the wetlands in 79 macroregions of the five participating countries cic 217 however none of those classifications and inventories had any hierarchical structure by contrast the brazilian classification of junk et al 2014a is a hierarchical one it recognizes hydrology as the principle determinant of the ecological conditions in wetlands and that the large majority of tropical and subtropical wetlands are subjected to different types of flood pulses the frequency duration amplitude and predictability of inundation and drought influence the occurrence distribution and life cycles of organisms living in the wetlands other factors are climate and water and soil quality accurate indicators of the ecological conditions in wetlands and their macrohabitats are higher plants because they are fixed in the soil herbaceous plants reflect the environmental conditions of weeks months and a few years and woody plants those of years decades and even centuries animals are a less appropriate classification basis because they are mobile and often use different environments to meet their needs furthermore indicator animals may become extinct by human actions even though environmental conditions may still be appropriate for their occurrence the brazilian classification system divides the country s wetlands into three hierarchical levels the first comprises three systems coastal wetlands inland wetlands and artificial wetlands the second is based on wetland hydrology as the principle element in the definition of a wetland and therefore a key aspect in any functional analysis and includes subsystems orders suborders classes and functional units in the case of brazilian natural inland wetlands a hydrologically based classification demonstrates their large hydrological diversity the third hierarchical level references the occurrence of higher plants and the structures of their communities it is divided into subclasses and macrohabitats however given the size and difficult access to many large wetlands or wetland subsystems this classification may require revision as the future availability of additional botanical inventories will certainly increase the number of subclasses and macrohabitats needed to accurately describe internal wetland structures nonetheless an advantage of the classification system is that it is flexible enough to allow the inclusion of new categories without invalidating the entire system summary of the brazilian classification system first level systems three systems coastal inland and artificial wetlands second level subsystems three coastal subsystems influenced by the tide or characterized by a relatively stable water level or by a fluctuating water level two inland subsystems either a relatively stable or a fluctuating water level orders three orders of inland wetlands monomodal predictable flood pulses of long duration or polymodal unpredictable flood pulses of short duration or multi annual unpredictable flood pulses of short duration in semi arid regions suborders two suborders of inland wetlands subject to monomodal predictable flood pulses of long duration with high or low amplitudes classes four classes with high amplitudes e g amazonian várzeas and igapós and seven with low amplitudes e g pantanal matogrossense functional units six functional units permanently aquatic periodically aquatic periodically terrestrial permanently terrestrial swampy and artificial third level subclasses numerous in coastal and inland wetlands macrohabitats numerous in coastal inland and artificial wetlands the fluctuating water levels of flood pulsing wetlands create major ecological and legal problems for the determination of wetland extent brazilian scientists have proposed the following definition of the floodplain area the extent of a wetland can be determined by the border of the permanently flooded or waterlogged area or in the case of fluctuating water levels by the limit of the area influenced during the mean maximum flood the outer borders of wetlands are indicated by the absence of hydromorphic soils and or hydrophytes and or specific woody species adapted to grow in periodically or permanently flooded or waterlogged soils the definition of a wetland area should include if present internal permanently dry areas as these habitats are of fundamental importance to the maintenance of the functional integrity and biodiversity of the respective wetland junk et al 2014a this definition introduces two new concepts the first is the mean maximum flood level as the outer boundary of the wetland however this boundary is heavily contested by many brazilian planners and by representatives of agroindustry who instead propose the area flooded during normal level defined as the low water level of the connected rivers the problem with that definition is that it excludes most of the floodplains from wetland status and allows their exploitation for conventional agriculture and infrastructure purposes moreover its practical impact is that it threatens the ecological integrity of the wetlands and their commercial and non commercial values in addition to leading to heavy economic losses during high floods these losses often have to be compensated in part by the government and thus finally by the taxpayer whereas the benefits occurring in normal periods are reaped solely by private owners piedade et al 2012 the second new concept is the inclusion of internal permanently dry areas in the definition of a wetland during floods many domestic and wild animals seek shelter at least transiently in the dry areas of the floodplain furthermore a considerable number of the herbaceous and woody plants found in large floodplains are only slightly flood resistant and thus depend on the existence of dryer areas as shown by junk et al 2006 for the pantanal if these areas are modified the functional integrity and biodiversity of the respective wetland are seriously threatened 3 why is a macrohabitat classification in floodplains necessary brazilian wetlands with a rather stable or unpredictably pulsing water level are relatively small and therefore do not need a subdivision that reaches the macrohabitat level by contrast large floodplains occupy the level of classes and require a subdivision in smaller units as has been done by several authors dubbs 1994 described different woodlands and wet savanna habitats in a ranch in the southern pantanal schessl 1999 distinguished eight major vegetation types in the aquatic terrestrial transition zone attz of the northern pantanal but does not consider aquatic macrohabitats wantzen et al 2005 developed a classification system adopting the ordination of the fluvial landscape structure developed in the fluvial hydrosystem concept by petts and amoros 1996 their classification recognized different types of river channels and lakes and provided many important hydrological and limnological details the attz makes up the major part of the floodplain but the classification system of wantzen et al 2005 is unsuitable for the development and implementation of management and protection measures as the macrohabitat diversity in this area is underrepresented the macrohabitat classification of nunes da cunha and junk 2014 which encompasses the pantanal of mato grosso as well as the amazonian várzeas junk et al 2014a b and igapós junk et al 2015 makes use of the entire set of macrohabitats from permanently terrestrial to permanently aquatic ones the system developed by these authors provides an easily understandable framework for 1 comparative scientific studies between different floodplains and their macrohabitats 2 the development and application of specific management methods and protection measures including monitoring and ecological restoration 3 environmental impact analyses and 4 the formulation of specific environmental legislation and policy sustainable management and protection can only be achieved with the collaboration of the local population which owns large parts of the floodplains and uses their resources to reach these goals the classification considers as much as possible the subunits already known and referred to by local populations the major challenge for a subunit based classification of floodplains is the inclusion of the annual dynamics of their water levels we therefore introduced at the class level an additional category the functional unit this technical term is also used by wantzen et al 2005 but in a slightly different context to avoid confusion we provide the following definition a functional unit is a large landscape unit in a floodplain that is subjected to specific hydrological conditions during the annual cycle we differentiate between five functional units permanently aquatic predominantly aquatic permanently terrestrial predominantly terrestrial and permanently swampy fig 1 a sixth functional unit includes all anthropogenic macrohabitats independent of their hydrological condition a subclass is defined as a subunit of a functional unit with specific hydrological conditions and a characteristic cover of higher vegetation mcgraw hill 2003 defined a macrohabitat as an extensive habitat presenting considerable variation of the environment containing a variety of ecological niches and supporting a large number and variety of complex flora and fauna we have adapted this general definition to the brazilian wetland classification as follows a macrohabitat is a subunit of a subclass characterized by indicator plant species or groups of species it is the smallest unit of the classification system and the one most sensitive to natural environmental changes and to human impacts therefore it is best suited for comparative scientific studies environmental impact analyses and the development of legal approaches to wetland management and protection as an example of the characterization of a macrohabitat in the following we describe macrohabitat 3 6 2 of the pantanal of mato grosso it belongs to functional unit 3 predominantly terrestrial which includes six subclasses subclass 3 6 refers to areas covered with monospecific forests and includes five macrohabitats with number 3 6 2 representing forests dominated by vochysia divergens cambarazal and inundated up to 8 months of the year description from nunes da cunha and junk 2014 this macrohabitat is very flood tolerant arieira and nunes da cunha 2006 and during very wet periods it expands to include the surrounding grasslands nunes da cunha and junk 2004 the expansion of v divergens is counteracted by the wildfires that occur during very dry years which lead to the retraction of these forests in the pantanal there are cambarazal stands of different ages depending on their degree of protection against wildfires old stands form dense forests made up of several tree species normally associated with riparian forests such as eugenia spp tocoyena foetida and psychotria carthagenensis because these stands are of high ecological value as habitats for different animal species they should be protected 4 macrohabitats as the basis for comparative studies table 1 lists the number of functional units subclasses and macrohabitats in three large already classified floodplains the pantanal of mato grosso contains the highest number of macrohabitats which reflects its impressive geomorphological diversity ab saber 1988 jiménez rueda et al 1998 assine 2003 assine et al 2016 including savanna as well as forested habitats amazonian várzeas rank second and in addition to forested wetlands include a considerable variety of macrohabitats covered by herbaceous plants representative of the strong erosion and deposition processes that affect these areas and the high nutrient status of their sediments and water junk 1997 junk et al 2010 the negro river igapó is also a forested wetland albeit with a much lower macrohabitat diversity due to the lower declivity of the river course where most of the fringing floodplains occur and the smaller sediment load compared to that of the solimões amazon river thus both erosion and deposition are less prominent and many macrohabitats related to river dynamics are absent junk et al 2015 the low nutrient status of the water and sediments limits the occurrence of herbaceous plants and accordingly macrohabitat formation macrohabitats can also be used for comparisons of vegetation types in different floodplains all floodplains have low lying macrohabitats that are inundated for long periods and characterized by pioneer shrub communities for the amazon várzea two macrohabitats are described one in areas with low and the other in areas with high sedimentation rates species composition in the two areas differs because the alluvial soils in highly flooded topographies are sorted as coarse grained soils near river channels and fine grained soils in backwater depressions coarse grained soils in lowland rivers mostly sand and fine sand impose specific conditions for colonizing shrub communities because the sedimentation rates are usually high such that shrub seedlings as well as the superficial root layers of established shrubs may be covered by sediments in the case of well aerated coarse grained soils their low water retention capacity may result in their rapid desiccation when they fall dry for this reason many shrub communities on coarse grained alluvial substrates make use of deep primary roots that may reach ground waters when the water levels of the river are low conversely high sedimentation rates require that plants have the capacity to establish new root horizons near the soil surface after flooding this capacity is exemplified by salix martiana alchornea castaneifolia and in western amazonia tessaria integrifolia wittmann et al 2010 wittmann and parolin 2005 in backwater depressions fine grained soils tend to silt up slowly because river waters have already lost most of their sediments by the time they reach these sites fine grained soils have a high water retention capacity but are often poorly aerated even when the water levels of the river are low in amazonian várzeas eugenia spp symmeria paniculata coccoloba ovata ruprechtia ternifolia and myrcia sp are characteristic species seedling establishment is rare because of long lasting flood periods and vegetative propagation by root sprouting is frequent pioneer shrubs inhabiting fine grained soils grow much more slowly and have longer life cycles than their counterparts in better aerated soils they may reach ages of up to 60 80 years while those in coarse grained soils usually complete their life cycles within 10 15 years in sediment poor rivers there is typically only one shrub community because river dynamics are generally low and the life cycles of pioneer shrubs are usually longer at these sites than along sediment rich rivers however this picture may change as more inventories in different river stretches become available wittmann et al 2013 5 macrohabitats as indicators of the impact of global climate change worldwide major changes in hydrology are expected in response to changes in the global climate junk et al 2012b floodplain organisms are adapted to the normal flood pulse but they react sensitively to extreme floods and droughts multiannual very wet and very dry periods can have dramatic effects on different macrohabitats the major climatic processes that will affect floods and droughts in the pantanal are as yet unknown in part because models of global climate change and its impact have yielded contradictory results in contrast to amazonian floodplains the water level of the pantanal is not impacted by el niño and la niña events marengo et al 2016 however increases in the frequency of extreme climatic events and in temperature are expected with a worst case scenario of a 2 5 3 5 c increase in temperature and a 10 20 reduction in precipitation between 2011 and 2040 and a 5 7 c increase in temperature and a 30 reduction in precipitation for the period between 2071 and 2100 these figures do not consider the increase in water loss due to evaporation because of the higher temperatures climate related changes will greatly reduce the total floodplain area and affect all macrohabitats favoring those situated in the functional units permanently terrestrial and predominantly terrestrial between 1962 63 and 1972 73 a multiannual dry period occurred in the pantanal of mato grosso the resulting wildfires destroyed large stands of woody vegetation as shown for the above described macrohabitat 3 6 2 forests dominated by vochysia divergens cambarazal during the following wet period there were large losses of cattle several macrohabitats used as pastureland were invaded by shrubs and trees among them also vochysia divergens junk and nunes da cunha 2012 animals are also affected at the macrohabitat level in the pantanal for example the flooding of low lying sand bars in response to higher low water levels destroys important nesting places for shore birds the general impact of extreme floods and droughts on wildlife was described by alho and silva 2012 in central amazonian floodplains the minimum water level is mainly influenced by the cross equatorial atlantic sea surface temperature gradient and the atlantic multidecadal oscillation while the maximum water level is shaped by the el niño southern oscillation and the inter decadal pacific oscillation barichivich et al 2018 at manaus harbor 14 severe droughts 15 8m and 14 severe floods 29m have been registered since 1903 the frequency of severe floods has increased steadily since the 1970s with exceptionally high water levels in recent years during the same period severe droughts have remained at more or less the same frequency with a slight increase during the last 15years the intensification of the hydrological cycle in the world s largest watershed is a result of increasing sea surface temperatures in the tropical atlantic and a simultaneous cooling in the central and east equatorial pacific resulting in a strengthened walker circulation barichivich et al 2018 these forces are expected to increase in strength with global warming in addition despite a large degree of uncertainty studies suggest that drought will intensify through the 21st century marengo and espinoza 2016 the impact of these extreme events in amazonia has already been demonstrated in several studies such as that of piedade et al 2013 at the beginning of the 1970s a 4 year period of high low water stages led to the mass mortality of trees and shrubs at the lowest areas of the flooding gradient of the várzeas and igapós near manaus junk 1989 among the areas most impacted areas by extreme droughts were the igapó forests along the negro river and other guyana shield tributaries which in 1925 26 williams et al 2005 1997 98 nelson 2001 flores et al 2014 and 2015 16 suffered el niño induced droughts that coincided with low water periods making these ecosystems periodically vulnerable to wildfires resende et al 2014 schöngart et al 2017 this greater susceptibility to wildfire of igapó forests than non flooded forests terra firme or the nutrient rich dynamic white water floodplains várzea can be explained by the superficial root mats large amounts of accumulated litter and mostly sandy soils that characterize these forests santos and nelson 2013 flores et al 2014 2017 consequently the higher temperatures enhanced frequency and intensity of drought gloor et al 2013 2015 marengo and espinoza 2016 and the resulting fires associated with climate change against a setting of changes in land use associated with deforestation and the construction and operation of hydroelectric dams will severely impact macrohabitats at low topographies in the igapó 6 the importance of macrohabitats for the implementation of sustainable management methods in the past human interference in large brazilian floodplains was small such that vital structures and functions as well as biodiversity were mostly maintained however management methods introduced during the last several decades have been more aggressive than traditional ones and have impacted much larger areas cattle ranchers own about 90 of the land in the pantanal traditional cattle ranching maintains macrohabitat diversity and in some areas is conducted alongside ecotourism which relies on the preservation of landscape beauty a large biodiversity with a high number of emblematic plant and animal species and local cultural practices junk 2017 by contrast the shift in some regions to large scale intensive cattle production has destroyed habitats that are essential to the multiple functions provided by the pantanal the substitution of a variety of vegetation units by the large scale planting of exotic grasses used for grazing such as urochloa humidicula and u decumbens has diminished the species diversity of native herbaceous plants and thus that of the associated fauna as well in addition navigation authorities propose channelizing the paraguai river to allow the passage of larger ships hydrovia hamilton 1999 conservatively estimated that a deepening of the river channel by 10 25cm could reduce the flooded area by 11 7 31 4 this view was supported by ponce 2011 furthermore in addition to a reduction in the size of the pantanal the existing arrangement of macrohabitats along the flooding gradient would be seriously affected thus any change in the hydrological status imposed by a deepening of the river channel will have far reaching consequences for the entire floodplain unsuitable agricultural methods have accelerated erosion processes in the upland of the pantanal the increased sediment load of the taquari river a large tributary of the paraguai river has led to congestion of the river bed and the long term flooding of about 11 000km2 of the adjacent floodplain galdino et al 2006 the result has been the conversion of a macrohabitat rich region into a homogeneous hypoxic swamp covered by eichhornia spp and other floating aquatic macrophytes in amazonian várzeas the floodplains have been used and settled for centuries by european immigrants however agriculture together with cattle and water buffalo ranching not only destroyed important forested macrohabitats and their valuable timber resources but also the food basis of commercially valuable frugivorous fishes the extraction of timber and non timber products forms the basis of plywood industries as well as smallholder and community based forest management in the várzea floodplains higuchi et al 1994 schöngart and queiroz 2010 but in many cases forestry practices do not consider the ecological peculiarities of floodplain forests and have thus threatened their sustainability forest succession in the várzea is driven by geomorphological and environmental modifications that are a consequence of sedimentation and erosion processes worbes et al 1992 wittmann et al 2004 2010 after the establishment of herbaceous species on freshly deposited alluvial sediments first colonizing pioneer trees form monodominant stands which rapidly develop into early and late successional stages along this successional gradient tree density declines and tree species richness increases leading to changes in canopy architecture and a reduction of the solar radiation on the forest floor wittmann and junk 2003 with increasing stand age the wood densities of the characteristic tree species increase whereas diameter increment rates decrease reflecting the substitution of light demanding pioneer species by both long living pioneer species and shade tolerant late successional species schöngart 2003 the result is the establishment of different forested macrohabitats that have to be managed appropriately to be sustainable based on the mean age size relationships of commercial tree species from the central amazonian várzea floodplains growth models have been developed that integrate species specific age diameter and diameter height relationships into allometric equations schöngart 2008 this gol growth oriented logging modeling approach considers the differences between the different types of forested macrohabitats the impact of hydroelectric power plants on specific macrohabitats is well demonstrated by the balbina reservoir in central amazonia the dam was completed in september 1987 fearnside 1990 and its operation increased the annual minimum water level of the uatumã river below the dam by 100cm compared to pre dam conditions this created permanent flooding conditions during several consecutive years at the lowest topographies in the igapó thereby inducing the mass mortality of highly flood adapted tree species such as macrolobium acaciifolium and eschweilera tenuifolia assahira et al 2017 7 macrohabitats as focal points for environmental legislation the implementation of environmental protection measures and sustainable management methods depends on informed environmentally friendly legislation large floodplains are too complex to be protected by a general uniform legislative approach rather regulations must be specific focusing on landscape units that can be recognized by the local population only when the local population supports the regulations and participates actively in their implementation will the desired positive effects be achieved the respective landscape units are the macrohabitats as exemplified by those in the pantanal in interviews ranchers recognized nearly all of the macrohabitats established by nunes da cunha and junk 2011 as well as the importance of these landscape units for cattle ranching and the maintenance of wildlife duarte et al 2017 studies on the encroachment of shrubs and trees in pasture areas have highlighted the need to eliminate invasive species to maintain both pasture areas for the benefit of ranchers and the biodiversity of macrohabitats dominated by herbaceous plants and their related wildlife barbosa da silva et al 2016 current legislation hinders pasture clearing considering it as forest removal which is prohibited by law however encroachment is a dynamic process one that will be interrupted by the next wildfire a recognition of these conditions will facilitate the negotiation of agreements between ranchers and environmentalists in the pantanal to allow pasture clearing in certain macrohabitats in exchange for the total protection of other environmentally important ones junk and nunes da cunha 2012 in 1988 the federal brazilian constitution declared the pantanal as national patrimony thus mandating that its use comply with laws guaranteeing protection of the environment including natural resources a federal law no 750 2011 is currently being crafted that will regulate policies regarding the management and protection of the pantanal scientists participating in those discussions are seeking to include in the legislation macrohabitats to be granted total or partial protection restricted use or restoration nunes da cunha et al 2017 irigaray et al 2017 activities that severely modify the hydrology of the pantanal such as the channelization of the paraguai river must be avoided all permanently aquatic macrohabitats are important to fishes and aquatic wildlife during the dry season these areas and the adjacent floodplain forests should be managed in favor of fish stocks this includes protecting the access of fishes to spawning grounds in up river areas free of hydroelectric reservoirs in amazonian várzeas the simplified brazilian forest legislation normative instruction no 5 december 11 2006 established by the brazilian institute for environmental and renewable natural resources ibama and resolution no 406 february 2 2009 from the national council of environment conama define a common minimum logging diameter mld of 50cm and felling cycles of 25 35 years this legislation does not address the highly varying growth rates of dozens of commercial tree species from different macrohabitats schöngart et al 2010 by contrast the results of the above mentioned gol have been included within innovative forest legislation for várzea floodplain forests normative instruction no 009 november 12 2010 and implemented by the ministry of environment and sustainable development of amazonas state sds the positive impact of this innovative approach on the use of the varzea forests however will depend on the application of this legislation in practice 8 discussion and conclusions wetlands are among our planet s most valuable ecosystems costanza et al 1997 but they are also highly threatened ones to be efficient management practices and environmental legislation aimed at wetland protection must consider the ecological economic and social differences that distinguish large wetlands finlayson et al 2011 current management approaches are not adapted to deal with their water saturated or periodically flooded soils minor wetland areas have been and continue to be drained for civil construction or used for the dumping of liquid and solid waste large wetlands are lost as floodplains become physically separated from their parent rivers or are destroyed by the construction of large reservoirs davidson 2014 the agricultural practices recently developed in europe and north america and applied in brazil have modified the hydrological character of the country s wetlands by drainage and dike construction to allow dry land agriculture by contrast the traditional flood adapted methods still practiced in large tropical wetlands maintain the integrity biodiversity and thus the ecological economic and social benefits of these ecosystems nonetheless these methods are becoming increasingly side lined even though their continued use in many tropical regions such as those of africa has confirmed their validity nepad 2003 emerton 2005 european settlers benefitted from the knowledge of the indigenous people regarding the ecological peculiarities of specific geomorphological structures and vegetation types however they dramatically modified the use of south american floodplains by introducing domestic animals and new crops not previously known to the indigenous people thus in forested floodplains such as the amazonian várzeas forest clearing was a very early activity because fertile soils encouraged agriculture and animal husbandry on the high lying ground occupied by floodplain forest junk et al 2000 goulding et al 1996 the resulting large scale destruction of forested macrohabitats destroyed not only valuable timber resources but also the fruit trees essential to commercially important stocks of fruit feeding fishes in periodically flooded savannas enough natural pasture was initially available for cattle and horses forest clearing occurred only on a small scale such that the structure function and biodiversity of savanna wetlands were preserved the pantanal of mato grosso is one of the few examples where during several centuries europeans sustainably managed a complex tropical wetland ecosystem yet by the beginning of the 1970s this was no longer the case as the economic pressure exerted by cattle ranchers in the uplands forced ranchers in the pantanal and in other periodically flooded savannas to increase the productivity of their own ranches overgrazing and the destruction of valuable macrohabitats were the consequences ioris 2012 the lack of a politically recognized brazilian definition of wetlands has created serious problems in the discussion about wetland delimitation piedade et al 2012 use of the definition provided by junk et al 2014a b has been recommended by the ministry of the environment in 2015 but this recommendation has no legal status preoccupation with the ongoing environmental destruction led to several studies on the wetlands in the entire paraná paraguay river basin in 2014 ioris published a study on the impact of global climate change on the pantanal and the upper paraguay basin with a focus on socio economic institutional and legal aspects in 2017 an inventory of wetland regions was published by the intergovernmental coordination committee of the countries of the la plata basin cic 2017 this inventory provided general ecological information on the wetlands in different geographic macro regions including human impact on the wetlands in 2018 an ecological risk assessment of the paraguay river basin was published by wwf brazil an ecological risk index calculated for different regions was used to evaluate both the extent and intensity of human activity within a given landscape and the respective risk of water quality and environmental degradation mattson and angermeier 2006 these approaches are certainly important at the macro scale but recommendations and actions aimed at sustainable management and protection require the recognition of smaller ecological units as geographic targets this can be achieved using macrohabitats as described by nunes da cunha and junk 2011 for the pantanal and by junk et al 2014b 2015 for amazonian várzeas and igapós in the ongoing discussion about the sustainable management of the pantanal many ranchers have defended the establishment of large uniform pasture areas while failing to acknowledge the negative impact on macrohabitat diversity however a high macrohabitat diversity represents a high functional and species diversity as well as complex inter habitat interactions the argument of managers that a macrohabitat based classification is too complex to be considered in management plans is not valid indeed unless management methods adapt to the complexity of macrohabitats the use of these environments will not be sustainable nonetheless the acceptance of regulations stipulating management and protection will be facilitated by the use of local terms to describe and identify the target areas in the pantanal most scientifically described macrohabitats are recognized by the local population duarte et al 2017 a similar approach has been used in other regions of the world such as in india gopal and sah 1995 in addition columbian scientists are elaborating a wetland classification according to the brazilian approach this is a remarkable development considering the many frontier crossing rivers and wetlands which require a harmonized environmental legislation between the two countries the most important ecological driver in floodplains is hydrology and it depends strongly on the discharge of the connected rivers about 80 of large brazilian floodplains fall dry during normal low water periods in very dry years this number can reach or exceed 90 the fact that climate models yield conflicting results and do not allow precise predictions about the total amount and seasonal distribution of precipitation should not be used to justify the neglect of measures that recognize and offer solutions to major changes in hydrology in the pantanal and in amazonian floodplains all models indicate an increase in the occurrence of extreme events of precipitation and drought in amazonia an increase in the number of extreme floods and droughts is already the case barichivich et al 2018 these events do not affect floodplain macrohabitats randomly as those situated at the upper and lower parts of the flooding gradient are especially sensitive to long term disturbances and are therefore good indicators of environmental changes including global climate change dryer climates reduce the frequency and duration of floods at the upper part of the gradient favoring the invasion of terrestrial plants and animals in what were previously floodplain macrohabitats permanently aquatic macrohabitats such as lakes and river channels as well as permanently swampy areas are of specific importance for the maintenance of biodiversity and aquatic productivity in floodplains because they serve as refuges for aquatic organisms only 20 of the pantanal and amazonian floodplains belong to this category however in response to very dry periods which will become more frequent according to the predictions of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2013 these areas will likely shrink with dramatic consequences for the aquatic fauna of the entire floodplains these examples show that macrohabitat classification is only the first step in the ecological characterization of large floodplains macrohabitats are not randomly distributed but are often clustered in specific regions while a geographic information system gis based quantification is necessary to fully exploit the scientific and practical potential of the classification system sufficient data are

1146,wetland protection and recovery needs scientific foundations for a better understanding of wetland floods since the flooding existence and its dynamics are the key aspects in the formation and evolution of wetland ecosystems the honghe national natural reserve hnnr in the northeast china has been listed in the ramsar convention on wetlands since 2002 the specific dates for determining of an average inundation boundary caused by a regular flooding were firstly fixed from multiple rainfall events by a hydro meteorological analysis based on the long term rainfall data the flood inundation areas in the hnnr marshes were mapped according to the correlation between hydro geomorphology and regular flood progress the mapping of the flood inundation areas were supported technically from the application of remote sensing images combining the hydro geomorphologic analysis with meteorological statistical data the final map with the spatial temporal content of an inundation created by hydro geomorphological analysis and remote sensing data was validated by the long term rainfall soil moisture and surface water level data in the hnnr the results indicated that the flood inundation areas were mainly distributed in large patches along the two main river courses of nongjiang river and its branch of woyalan river in the northern and central hnnr the flood inundation patches were scattered as seasonal marshes and permanent ponds in the southern and eastern hnnr the extracted flood inundation area accounted for more than a quarter of the total area of hnnr the flood inundation

hamper a further understanding of flooding processes in marsh wetlands n li et al 2011 xie et al 2015 zhou et al 2008a b used the high resolution digital elevation model dem to extract digital features of river courses in the honghe national natural reserve hnnr and zhou et al 2008a b subsequently analysed the hydro geomorphology of the hnnr in a preliminary study of flood features however their results are subject to a considerable uncertainty due to the lack of long term observation of hydrological and soil moisture data the following four objectives were setup in this study 1 to determine the flooding period based on the meteorological and hydrological data in the marsh wetland 2 to examine the high resolution dem and map the potential flood inundation areas based on the topography of the study area 3 to map the historically occurring inundated areas in the two selected periods flooding dry based on remote sensing imaginaries 4 to produce a final map of flood inundation areas by integrating the two maps validated with field observation data of the long term rainfall soil moisture surface water level the general objective of the study was to understand the maximum and minimum spatial extent of the flood inundation area in the marsh wetland of the honghe national natural reserve hnnr confirmed by the meteorological and hydrological service offered by prototype monitoring system 2 the study area data sources 2 1 the study area the hnnr 133 34 38 e 133 46 29 e 47 42 18 n 47 52 n is located in the sanjiang plain in heilongjiang province northeast china the hnnr protects a large number of wild plant species it covers 250 9km2 and keeps various habitats for rare and endangered waterfowl it is known as the wildlife special gene bank in the sanjiang plain due to its epitome of the original landscape of freshwater marsh wetlands in the sanjiang plain rivers in the hnnr are all marshy nongjiang river crosses its northern boundary and woyalan river goes through the central and core catchment fig 1 woyalan river runs from south to north through the hinterland of the hnnr to enter the nongjiang as a branch river of nongjiang river the middle of the nongjiang river has a slightly high topography affecting the water flow resulting in backwater between the nongjiang river and woyalan river the overall topography of the hnnr is relatively low and flat and the longitudinal slope of the river bed is reduced which causes the surface water to move slowly within non obvious river channels and a vary of marsh wetlands 2 2 data sources 1 dem data dem data was generated from a topographic map scale 1 10 000 with contour interval 1m and around 2000 elevation points per km2 averagely the spatial resolution of dem data was 5m produced by the heilongjiang provincial bureau of surveying and mapping geographic information in 1994 2 imagery data landsat 8 data was obtained from the chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn the data contained 11 wavelength bands including a panchromatic band of 15m spatial resolution and 10 multispectral bands of 30m spatial resolution landsat 8 imagery was selected as the high level image data on september 18th 2013 and water bodies were extracted after band fusion in this study spot 5 imagery contained multispectral and panchromatic data it included multispectral data of 10m spatial resolution 20m spatial resolution for shortwave infrared data and one panchromatic data of 2 5m spatial resolution spot 5 imagery was selected as image data on september 15th 2010 for extracting water bodies at low water level after band fusion airship imagery was obtained on august 1st 2009 which was acquired by a fat 130a unmanned airship with a 0 4m maximum resolution after subsequent processing the classification results of li s li et al 2011 based on the airship data was used to validate water body identification from the other two remote sensing images 3 meteorological and hydrological data daily rainfall data for 2013 were obtained from an automatic weather station in hnnr and daily rainfall data for 2004 till 2012 were acquired from the ecological experimental station in the marsh wetland of sanjiang plain which was located 30km away from the study area a field monitoring system was setup for surface water level and soil moisture monitoring along two river courses as shown in fig 1 surface water level data were obtained using odyssey logger with a temporal resolution of 6h from the period of 2010 and 2013 all field water table data were transformed mathematically into the dem standard for the hydro geomorphological analysis purpose some field soil moisture data were obtained by using ym 01 and analysed for the inundation validation purpose in this study 3 methodology 3 1 methodology in general the periods of high and low surface water levels were determined by the analysis of historical precipitation data which helped to determine two periods of expected extreme hydrological events then two remote sensing images for the inundation interpretations within the envi software were selected for the two periods spatial analysis was used to superimpose and eliminate the inundation areas which were extracted by remote sensing image interpretation the hydro geomorphologic method was applied to delineate the inundation area from dem data with the support of the prototype field monitoring system data set up in the study area these two inundation maps were compared and superimposed into the final inundation map with the validation from the field data the general technical flowchart was presented in fig 2 3 2 flooding period determining to quantify flood inundation areas accurate period information of the flooding process needs firstly to be fixed by the long term precipitation statistics data this provides a basis for choosing the hydrologic monitoring data and remote sensing images as many as 10 daily rainfall events exceeded 40mm with a maximum record of 79mm during the nine year period according to the rainfall data from september 2004 to august 2013 as shown in fig 3 therefore august 12 2013 was selected as the date with an expected high water level for the normal flooding with daily rainfall of 41 4mm and persistently moderate rainfall intensity in the prior period while july 16 2010 was selected as the date with a low water level with daily rainfall of 0mm and no heavy rainfall in the prior period indicated with triangles in fig 1 according to the hydrological records the water level in nongjiang river was 50 70m a s l and 51 47m in woyalan river on july 16 2010 on august 12 2013 the water levels in nongjiang and woyalan rivers were 52 06m in both rivers from the field monitoring data in fig 4 the water levels were at their lowest points in both rivers on july 16 2010 in the two years while those levels at the measurement stations on the two rivers were essentially identical and relatively high on august 12 2013 this monitoring data validated the typical flooding period and was quantified as a representative of flooding progress meanwhile analysis of surface water level data provides the required water level data for extraction of the flood inundation areas soil moisture was also used to identify the flooding period which indicated the same highest and lowest soil moisture records in the corresponding period hence the flooding period was also validated as for its accuracy from the soil monitoring 3 3 hydro geomorphologic analysis catchment boundary was delineated based on the hnnr dem by running the hydrologic analysis module in the arcgis 10 0 platform hence nongjiang catchment and woyalan catchment were extracted as two separated hydrological catchments for the inundation study which requests compiled and integrated spatial hydrological analysis with the field monitoring data from both the historical reference zhou et al 2008a b and recent prototype monitoring fig 5 the runoff supply mainly comes from the snow melting water in the later spring season and precipitation in the summer and earlier autumn and the topographic variation is not obvious in hnnr therefore non fountainhead flooding analysis was applied for delineating flooding areas based on the dem data guo and long 2002 yu et al 2008 yan et al 2014 the raster calculator tool was used to extract the corresponding dem low water level areas fig 6 and dem high water level areas fig 6 based on the elevation value of surface water levels corresponding to the selected flooding periods referred in section 3 2 the vector erase tool was used to obtain those water areas that appeared in the high water level area but did not appear at the low water level which were defined as the dem inundation areas fig 6 all the complied and digital work was implemented within the arcgis 10 0 platform 3 4 remote sensing interpretation ratio calculation method was selected to identify water bodies from the remote sensing images and two different ratio indexes were selected to process the images from different sensors in this study the ratio b3 b1 b3 b1 was calculated from the spot 5 imagery where b1 and b3 were the first and third wavelength bands of the spot 5 image identifying specific pixels as the low water level areas deng et al 2005 with the ratio calculation the water brightness threshold 0 10 was obtained to identify the brightness values of the known water bodies the rs low water level areas were identified firstly based on band calculation and correction of visual interpretation fig 7 the landsat 8 image was selected to identify the high water level by calculating the specific bands through the water body index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 the authors analysed the characteristic of wave bands before they used the water body threshold as t 0 22 to identify the water bodies the rs high water level areas were thus identified by the band calculation and artificial visual interpretation fig 7 finally the vector erase tool of arcgis 10 0 was used to obtain those water body areas that appeared in the high water level area but did not appear at the low water level which were defined in this study as the rs inundation areas fig 7 3 5 synergy of two methods and validation due to the limited field monitoring data and a very flat geomorphology caused by the unstable flooding feature in wetland environments in the hnnr hydro geomorphological method with dem used in this study can provide a reasonable inundation map in the northern and central hnnr while leading to a loss of some scatter seasonal inundation areas in the south however the interpretation of remotely sensed images can help to produce these scatter inundation areas while missing some of them in the north and central hnnr due to the intensive vegetation there therefore authors compiled and synergized the inundation maps from the digital extraction method and the remote sensing method as the final map within the arcgis 10 0 platform fig 8 to check the accuracy of the water level extent delineation using the proposed analysis the error matrix method was used based on the 76 sampling sites from the field monitoring system selected from the two remotely sensed images the validation results are shown in table 1 kappa coefficients of water bodies could reach 0 885 and 0 842 respectively on the extracted results based on two phases of remote sensing images which could meet the research objective the interpretation of the result of the remote sensing images was further validated for its accuracy by using the classification results of li s li et al 2011 based on airship imagery in the central hnnr the validation results were presented for identifying the low and high water level areas in fig 9 4 results as shown in fig 8 the flood inundation areas were mainly distributed along the south bank of nongjiang river and the central hnnr due to its relatively low and flat topography and the linkage with the woyalan river there were some patchy and scattered inundation areas in the southern and eastern hnnr which existed as seasonal inundation areas due to the flat topography and no linkage with any river course the inundation areas along the nongjiang river reach 43 26km2 which is 1 5 times that of the woyalan river approximately according to the spatial analysis the characteristics of water patches and flooding areas extracted by different methods at different time periods were shown in table 2 the low water level areas presented from fig 6 were mainly distributed in the main river channels which were generated by a hydro geomorphologic analysis based on table 2 in conjunction with fig 6 the high water level areas presented from fig 6 expanded outward along the low water level areas and were distributed on the rivers of the concentrated rivers the resulting flood inundation areas fig 6 were also mainly distributed along the main river channel and the wuyalan river with large patches and basically distributed in patches as can be seen from fig 7 the low water level areas extracted from spot 5 images have a small patch area and scattered patches the high water level areas extracted based on landsat 8 fig 7 have larger plaque areas the resulting flood inundation areas fig 7 are discretely distributed with patches scattered it coincides well with the flooded inundation area extracted from the hydro geomorphologic analysis in the main river channel and the middle of the study area and the flooded areas reach 37 20km2 the flooded submerged areas extracted by hydro geomorphologic analysis reach 48 96km2 which are slightly higher than the remote sensing image interpretation and extraction results but the patch density of low water level areas extracted based on the remote sensing image interpretation result is 26 82n km2 which is about 80 times that of the corresponding time period of hydro geomorphologic analysis and the extraction result based on remote sensing image interpretation and scattering fragmentation is relatively high 5 discussion wetlands are defined as areas of land water interface mitsch and gosselink 2011 flooding is one of the important hydrological processes in most wetlands the spatial boundaries of flood inundated areas are not stable which is determined by the spatial reaching of the storm runoff generated in different hydrological years hydrological regime models especially those distributed hydrological models are the best options for quantitatively simulating flood inundation catchments however the boundary of wetlands within the floodplain is not always closed like most hydrological catchments or watersheds and the gauge data always lacked critically for hydrological model validation in most wetland environments zhou et al 2013 therefore few hydrological models can adapt to wetland environment for the inundation study in flooding plain hence a new approach was presented by integrating the remote sensing interpretation hydro geomorphological digital analysis and prototype monitoring in this paper yearly and seasonal flooding keeps the marsh wetland habitats along the nongjiang river and its back water provides the river flow to its branch woyalan river in the central of hnnr zhou et al 2016 therefore the yearly and seasonal flood plays a key role to the healthy marsh wetland habitats the delineation of the flood inundation area is critical for scientists to understand the process and evaluation of wetland ecosystems however the intensive field monitoring is hampered by the hard access to wetlands for delineating such inundation areas which yet is difficult to be defined due to its high spatial temporal dynamic caused by different yearly or seasonal flood events in the wetland environment it is well known that river flow is controlled by the topography feature hence the fundamental hydrological characteristics can be identified based on the high resolution dem with the additional technical support of the prototype field monitoring system which can be further improved from the interpretation of multiple remote sensing images brivio et al 2002 some inundation areas were not interpreted by remote sensing technology due to the coarse spatial resolution of the landsat 8 during the period of high water level during which wetland vegetation was intensive in the north hnnr in contrast scattered inundation areas were identified in the southern and eastern areas which could not be extracted via hydro geomorphic analysis therefore remote sensing interpretation can compensate the limitations of hydro geomorphologic analysis the two methods complement with each other producing more complete flood inundation areas however some uncertainties should be noticed especially due to the different spatial temporal resolutions caused by the limited data resources the landsat 8 images with a 15m resolution after fusion was selected as the data source for identifying high water level water bodies which was inconsistent with the spot 5 imagery with a 2 5m resolution used for the low water level areas extraction in addition the selected time of the remote sensing images was inconsistent with that of the lowest and highest surface water levels due to the lack of quality image this also caused a source of error in the results 6 conclusions this study integrated hydro geomorphic analysis and remote sensing interpretation to quantify the flood inundation areas in the honghe national natural reserve hnnr the non fountainhead method was combined firstly with spatial analysis to identify the inundation areas based on the hydro geomorphic characteristics then multiple remote sensing images were interpreted to identify inundation areas by using visual interpretation method in combination with spatial analysis method a higher accuracy was achieved by combining results of the two methods and accuracy evaluation was approved by using a high resolution unmanned aerial vehicle image and intensive field monitoring data the results demonstrated that the flood inundation areas were mainly distributed along nongjiang river and woyalan river in the northern and central of hnnr respectively and there were some inundation patches in the southern and eastern areas though relatively scattered the approach can provide technical supports to generate scientific strategies for hnnr decision makers by a better understanding of flooding features within marsh wetlands conflict of

validated for its accuracy by using the classification results of li s li et al 2011 based on airship imagery in the central hnnr the validation results were presented for identifying the low and high water level areas in fig 9 4 results as shown in fig 8 the flood inundation areas were mainly distributed along the south bank of nongjiang river and the central hnnr due to its relatively low and flat topography and the linkage with the woyalan river there were some patchy and scattered inundation areas in the southern and eastern hnnr which existed as seasonal inundation areas due to the flat topography and no linkage with any river course the inundation areas along the nongjiang river reach 43 26km2 which is 1 5 times that of the woyalan river approximately according to the spatial analysis the characteristics of water patches and flooding areas extracted by different methods at different time periods were shown in table 2 the low water level areas presented from fig 6 were mainly distributed in the main river channels which were generated by a hydro geomorphologic analysis based on table 2 in conjunction with fig 6 the high water level areas presented from fig 6 expanded outward along the low water level areas and were distributed on the rivers of the concentrated rivers the resulting flood inundation areas fig 6 were also mainly distributed along the main river channel and the wuyalan river with large patches and basically distributed in patches as can be seen from fig 7 the low water level areas extracted from spot 5 images have a small patch area and scattered patches the high water level areas extracted based on landsat 8 fig 7 have larger plaque areas the resulting flood inundation areas fig 7 are discretely distributed with patches scattered it coincides well with the flooded inundation area extracted from the hydro geomorphologic analysis in the main river channel and the middle of the study area and the flooded areas reach 37 20km2 the flooded submerged areas extracted by hydro geomorphologic analysis reach 48 96km2 which are slightly higher than the remote sensing image interpretation and extraction results but the patch density of low water level areas extracted based on the remote sensing image interpretation result is 26 82n km2 which is about 80 times that of the corresponding time period of hydro geomorphologic analysis and the extraction result based on remote sensing image interpretation and scattering fragmentation is relatively high 5 discussion wetlands are defined as areas of land water interface mitsch and gosselink 2011 flooding is one of the important hydrological processes in most wetlands the spatial boundaries of flood inundated areas are not stable which is determined by the spatial reaching of the storm runoff generated in different hydrological years hydrological regime models especially those distributed hydrological models are the best options for quantitatively simulating flood inundation catchments however the boundary of wetlands within the floodplain is not always closed like most hydrological catchments or watersheds and the gauge data always lacked critically for hydrological model validation in most wetland environments zhou et al 2013 therefore few hydrological models can adapt to wetland environment for the inundation study in flooding plain hence a new approach was presented by integrating the remote sensing interpretation hydro geomorphological digital analysis and prototype monitoring in this paper yearly and seasonal flooding keeps the marsh wetland habitats along the nongjiang river and its back water provides the river flow to its branch woyalan river in the central of hnnr zhou et al 2016 therefore the yearly and seasonal flood plays a key role to the healthy marsh wetland habitats the delineation of the flood inundation area is critical for scientists to understand the process and evaluation of wetland ecosystems however the intensive field monitoring is hampered by the hard access to wetlands for delineating such inundation areas which yet is difficult to be defined due to its high spatial temporal dynamic caused by different yearly or seasonal flood events in the wetland environment it is well known that river flow is controlled by the topography feature hence the fundamental hydrological characteristics can be identified based on the high resolution dem with the additional technical support of the prototype field monitoring system which can be further improved from the interpretation of multiple remote sensing images brivio et al 2002 some inundation areas were not interpreted by remote sensing technology due to the coarse spatial resolution of the landsat 8 during the period of high water level during which wetland vegetation was intensive in the north hnnr in contrast scattered inundation areas were identified in the southern and eastern areas which could not be extracted via hydro geomorphic analysis therefore remote sensing interpretation can compensate the limitations of hydro geomorphologic analysis the two methods complement with each other producing more complete flood inundation areas however some uncertainties should be noticed especially due to the different spatial temporal resolutions caused by the limited data resources the landsat 8 images with a 15m resolution after fusion was selected as the data source for identifying high water level water bodies which was inconsistent with the spot 5 imagery with a 2 5m resolution used for the low water level areas extraction in addition the selected time of the remote sensing images was inconsistent with that of the lowest and highest surface water levels due to the lack of quality image this also caused a source of error in the results 6 conclusions this study integrated hydro geomorphic analysis and remote sensing interpretation to quantify the flood inundation areas in the honghe national natural reserve hnnr the non fountainhead method was combined firstly with spatial analysis to identify the inundation areas based on the hydro geomorphic characteristics then multiple remote sensing images were interpreted to identify inundation areas by using visual interpretation method in combination with spatial analysis method a higher accuracy was achieved by combining results of the two methods and accuracy evaluation was approved by using a high resolution unmanned aerial vehicle image and intensive field monitoring data the results demonstrated that the flood inundation areas were mainly distributed along nongjiang river and woyalan river in the northern and central of hnnr respectively and there were some inundation patches in the southern and eastern areas though relatively scattered the approach can provide technical supports to generate scientific strategies for hnnr decision makers by a better understanding of flooding features within marsh wetlands conflict of

1147,hydrological changes due to climate change will impact the sustainability of social ecological systems ses it is essential to develop methodologies capable of addressing economic as well as the environmental aspects to take care of the water associated system through improving the system adaptive capacity particularly in arid and semi arid areas through the application of the post modern portfolio theory pmpt we propose a new approach to water allocation problem in the face of climate change as a case of lake tashk bakhtegan basin southern iran the economic model based on pmpt is adapted for designing water allocation schemes to maximize local economic return minimize its risk and minimize the gini coefficient indicative of social inequities the climatic variables were generated by three atmosphere ocean general circulation models the temperature and precipitation will increase and decrease by about 2 4 and 10 on average in the future compared to those in the historical period respectively in order to identify hydrological and socio economic implications of climate change in the basin an integrated system dynamic model was developed finally the decision space of equally effective solutions has been determined in the form of pareto points at the efficient portfolio plane the findings showed a decrease in the economic return on average by 5 7 in the both rcps and the ratio of employment to unemployment average 10 in most of sub basin owing to the reduction of water resources especially in agriculture base on portfolio results the ratio of economic return to risk doubled and tripled in optimized condition compared to the normal condition in the future the efficient plane of the portfolio can be used to allocate water to economic activities according to a risk taking attitude of a decision maker following the model results services and industrial sectors would need to be developed in order to sustain local water resources with possible additional allocations for environmental requirements with simultaneous improvement of economic return on water resources keywords climate change adaptive capacity economical water allocation integrated assessment 1 introduction climate change adversely affects hydrological economic social and environmental sub systems resulting in unstable conditions in the entire system in most of the regions it affects water availability which impacts the environment furthermore climate change would be more challenging specifically regarding water allocation where each group of stakeholders has their utilities and priorities machalaba et al 2015 yang et al 2018 since water is an integral input for several economic activities water scarcity can lead to adverse changes in the water related economic outputs that could stimulate social conflicts and challenges leading to chaos thus alleviation of the impacts due to climate change is a global goal in order to sustain the social ecological systems in the future one approach to overcome the negative impacts of climate change is to enhance the adaptive capacity of the system under study by adaptive capacity a system continues to survive by either returning to its initial equilibrium or transforming into a new one regarding the economic dimension of a water associated system hydro economic models can be used to address the economic outputs co related to the changes in the availability of water input see e g rosegrant et al 2000 harou and lund 2008 harou et al 2009 you and ringler 2010 connell buck et al 2011 varela ortega et al 2011 rojas et al 2013 balali and viaggi 2015 esteve et al 2015 kahil et al 2015 koopman et al 2015 there are different hydro economic studies addressing groundwater resources surface water resources and agricultural systems separately see e g tzabiras et al 2016 de moraes sá et al 2017 gemitzi et al 2017 gosling et al 2017 liu et al 2017 hurd et al 2004 developed water allocation and impact models water aim to detect the effect of climate change and reallocate water resources to different activities this model simulates the impacts of changes on water and the number of economic consequences the sudan hydro economic optimization model shom was developed to allocate optimal surface water to upstream agricultural uses and downstream hydropower consumption satti et al 2015 although the water was allocated based on a dynamic approach in that research the benefits and costs were seen as fixed factors furthermore the risks of economic return of water due to different uses were not addressed nevertheless in the context of climate change effects there is still a gap to integrate all inter related systems in a comprehensive model furthermore it is also necessary to consider the risk of economic return and the risk of simultaneous performance of a set of activities the present paper contributes to filling the gap by adopting a system dynamic sd modeling approach sd models have been applied to analyze water resources problems see e g füssel and klein 2006 biesbroek et al 2010 venkat 2011 rahimikhoob et al 2015 gohari et al 2017a b the mpt is initially a financial economic theory in order to invest under uncertainty markowitz 1952 crowe and parker 2008 but it has been recently used in other fields such as water resources management to face the future uncertainties and possible changes it recommends diverse economic activities with the lowest correlation the model considers two criteria economic return and risk simultaneously models based on the mpt have been built in energy sector for electricity supply options and policy making white 2007 huang and wu 2008 menegaki 2008 allan et al 2010 allan et al 2011 bhattacharya and kojima 2012 chuang and ma 2013 dellano paz et al 2015 especially under climate change situations awerbuch and berger 2003 chalvatzis and hooper 2009 kumar et al 2015 for providing adaptation strategies to climate change in groundwater and surface water resources management mariño et al 2014 hua et al 2015 water quality marinoni et al 2011 dealing with extreme phenomena like floods and droughts buchecker et al 2013 finger and sauer 2014 and land use changes changes in cropping pattern and crop yields in agriculture gaydon et al 2012 bodin et al 2014 mitter et al 2015 in all of the mentioned studies the core idea of the mpt has been distributing risk in different investments according to uncertainties associated with the economic activities related to water the implementation of the portfolio theory to allocate water resources to different activities can provide suitable and stable economic performance under climate change conditions despite the mpt capabilities there are restrictions and defects using the model in water resources management problems in this theory every kind of fluctuations of average return is known as a risk and is calculated by using variance whereas in water resources allocation positive return fluctuations mean that the supplied water for economic activities is more than the average therefore this extra amount should not be considered as a risk in this paper the post modern portfolio theory pmpt geambaşu et al 2013 will be applied in order to avoid the mpt defect the pmpt theory measures the risk by semi variance moreover in the pmpt only two criteria of return and risk are embedded those criteria will be satisfactory on an individual scale while in a basin level some social scale considerations should also be met therefore a third dimension is added to the model in this paper to respect the social concerns the social dimension will be taken into account regarding the gini coefficient to embrace the social justice in wealth distribution this paper couples the outputs of a sd model which embrace the social economic as well as the water resources sub systems with a water allocation model built based on the pmpt under different scenarios of climate change in the lake tashk bakhtegan basin with the aim to propose a new method of dealing with water allocation problem from ecosystem and social perspectives therefore increasing adaptive capacity and sustainable condition are meet through the effective allocation of water also the model proposes a decision platform for the tashk bakhtegan lake basin which verifies appropriate climate change adaptation strategies 2 method 2 1 study area located in southern iran the lake tashk bakhtegan basin is drained by two main streams named kor and sivand rivers into two major inter connected water bodies known as tashk and bakhtegan lakes at the most downstream fig 1 for the past ten years the river discharge has decreased substantially leading the lakes to dry up which is an environmental catastrophe furthermore since the dominant and also the most profitable economic activities in the basin are irrigated agriculture mostly from kor river the economic life of the local communities has also been impacted due to water scarcity imposed partly by the effects of climate change 2 2 integrated modeling of the basin water resources system to simulate the interaction of water resources sub system with the socio economic sub system the system dynamics model developed jointly by jalali 2017 using simulink has been adopted a simplified flowchart of the model is shown in fig 2 the model comprises of the water sub system which includes the elements of hydrologic cycle groundwater and surface water interaction water supply and environment as well as sub models associated to economic and social sub systems and sub models associated to the water withdrawal and return flows the ordinal priorities for allocating water are assumed to services industrial and agricultural uses respectively moreover the return flows due to the non consumptive water uses of those sectors return to the surface and groundwater resources fig 3 illustrates a schematic of the hydrological sub system the economic sub system consists of services agricultural and industrial sectors which interact with each other as described in fig 4 in the agricultural sector the income plays the role as a driver for economic development the farmers motivation to earn more income compared to their previous year income will determine the expected cultivated land area for the next time step that expected cultivated area will be modified in the next stage according to the available water and labor force potential then the realized amount of water consumption and the corresponding return flow according to the final expected cultivated land area will be calculated also the value added and employees are fed into the model from the look up tables which have been built based on the observed data in the industrial sector the rate of annual investment rather than the availability of water and labor force is dominating the growth rate in that sector the water consumption in that sector will be calculated corresponding to the number of industrial units each year at last the value added of the industry sector is determined based on water consumption in the services sector water is not considered as an input indeed the water consumption in that sector is calculated based on the per capita water use and the number of population in the next step based on water availability expected services workforce is determined and the corresponding value added will be obtained the social subsystem includes three population cohorts 0 10 years old 11 60 years old and more than 60 years old this subsystem is related to the economic subsystems by supplying labor force from the 11 60 population cohort to each economic sector and receiving retired population into the third cohort fig 5 2 2 1 calibration and verification the model is calibrated and verified over the 2001 2006 and 2007 2011 periods respectively the water sub system was calibrated versus the discharge rates of surface water and the volume of groundwater the coefficients of runoff infiltration returned water a portion of surface water for supplying water and amounts of groundwater seepage were applied to calibrate the water resources sub system furthermore in the economic sub system the terms of cultivated area industrial units employees value added and water consumption were calibrated in each sector also the social subsystem was calibrated versus each population cohort by coefficients of population transfer between cohorts birth rate and death rate terms some figures should be presented calibration and validation of the dynamic model are depicted as follows in figs 6 a c and 7 a d jalali 2017 2 3 generating climate change scenarios and simulating the impacts of climate change 2 3 1 generating climate scenarios from the aogcm models in this research to simulate climate changes in the basin outputs of the atmosphere ocean general circulation model aogcm in the fifth assessment report of ipcc were applied ipcc 2014 mean daily precipitation maximum daily and minimum daily temperature changes were extracted from the canesm2 1 1 second generation canadian earth system model mpi esm lr 2 2 max planck institute earth system model low resolution and gfdl esm2g 3 3 geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory earth system model 2g models by new extreme scenarios of greenhouse gasses rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 in the current 1984 2013 and future 2020 2049 periods table 1 2 3 2 downscaling data produced by the aogcm models are not appropriate for direct use due to the low power of spatial resolution hence to alleviate the problem various downscaling techniques have been presented the downscaling models are divided into two categories based on their performances in the study 1 single site and 2 multisite the output of single site downscaling models is calculated for one site per se and the relations among multiple sites and the individual correlation of the variables are not considered thus the outputs of the adjacent sites do not possibly show high correlations consequently the issue affects the results of models and calculations depending on different climatic variables unlike in single site models in multisite methods downscaling is performed for several sites in an area or some variables concurrently thus three multisite downscaling methods including modexds 4 4 modular expanded downscaling bürger 1996 sknn 5 5 sequential k nearest neighbor imputation method kim et al 2004 kim and yi 2008 and msdsm 6 6 statistical downscaling model decision centric wilby et al 2002 wilby et al 2003 harpham and wilby 2005 wilby and dawson 2013 were applied in order to minimize the uncertainty in the output of multisite downscaling modexds method is created to downscale the daily climatic variables especially for those variables not following a normal distribution bürger 1996 exds is based on the premise that the local events are close to the normal atmospheric circulation on which the model can rely still it produces the real local variability in variables and sites concurrently the k nearest neighborhood approach k nn is a non parametric imputation method that can be used for regression altman 1992 it is a kind of instance based learning algorithm which identifies k number of its nearest neighbors of query data devak et al 2015 although the k nn method is described in detail in some research lall and sharma 1996 rajagopalan and lall 1999 buishand and brandsma 2001 yates et al 2003 kowarik and templ 2016 it is briefly explained here in order to apply k nn method for downscaling climatic data the input includes the k closest training set from historical daily weather data that are divided to predictors and predicted for training database devak et al 2015 at first step the composition of the feature vector includes means of precipitation and temperature of stations yates et al 2003 is defined for specific day t missing value rajagopalan and lall 1999 yates et al 2003 at second the nearest neighbors days within a temporal window to the current day yates et al 2003 king et al 2015 and their mean vectors are determined then the covariance matrix is computed for day t yates et al 2003 for the fourth step distances between the mean vectors of day t and nearest days are calculated also the distances are sorted and the first k nearest neighbors are retained therefore k is determined in the next step all of the k nearest neighbors are weighted based on their metric distances euclidean distance lall and sharma 1996 kim et al 2004 kim and yi 2008 thus each neighbor is weighted based on its importance kowarik and templ 2016 indeed the nearer neighbors have more contribution in the average than further neighbors finally the feature vector of day t weather variables is obtained by calculating a weighted average of amounts of k nearest neighbors these steps are repeated for as many days of required simulation rajagopalan and lall 1999 in the sknn method all of the steps are implemented as a k nn method except two steps with main points that lead to reducing execution time in sdsm method wilby et al 2002 wilby and dawson 2013 atmospheric circulation index and local meteorological variables will be used to estimate scheduling variables such as precipitation incident or the maximum temperature showing daily weather on site more information concerning the methods is accessible in bürger 1996 kim et al 2004 wilby et al 2002 and wilby and dawson 2013 2 3 3 simulation of temperature and precipitation in each sub basin in order to simulate precipitation and temperature the output of three models of aogcm and three methods of downscaling nine existing scenarios were built in an ensemble of each station and resulted in a time series finally for investigating the temperature and precipitation variations in the five sub basins the average regional values of these two variables were calculated over each sub basin by thiessen method 2 3 4 simulating the impacts of climate change and generating time series of economic efficiency in future periods in order to identify climate change impacts future precipitation and temperature variables were entered into the dynamic integrated water resources simulation model as exogenous variables for 2020 2049 as a 30 year time series the changes in the amount of precipitation led to changes in groundwater and surface water resources reservoirs as well as changes in the runoff and water infiltration in addition the increasing temperature caused the water requirement of the plants to increase consequently affected the total water demand regarding the interactions among different sectors the change of water would have some effects on other sub systems thus the time series of economic activities return in every part of the basin related to those resources in the future years will differ from that of the base period 2 4 water allocation optimization 2 4 1 development of three dimensional post modern portfolio theory the mpt model was initiated by harry markowitz in 1952 for determining investment strategies under uncertainty based on the mpt the utility of an investor is a function of the expected returns and risks because of maintaining an acceptable return investors prefer to invest in various activities rather than an individual activity in the other word the feature of the risk aversion of investors leads them to invest in different financial assets ekholm et al 2013 zhang 2016 which is called diversify in investing in case of returns of assets are not perfectly correlated diversification causes to a buffering effect that reduces the total risk however the risk of investing is reduced by diversifying investments combinations of financial assets that produce more return are not identified zhang 2016 the mpt resolves this problem and determines combinations portfolios of assets which maximize return for a preferred level of risk therefore it can be suitable for attracting investors mpt can be applied under the four following conditions which make diversification base useful elton et al 1995 fraser et al 2005 1 more than one possible investment option exists at any time 2 these investment options are exposed to risk 3 there is data for historical expected return of assets 4 all investments are not equally affected under the same conditions according to mpt the expected return of an individual asset is calculated based on actual returns of asset and the probability of their occurrence in different states eq 1a moreover individual asset risk is defined as deviations volatility of the expected return of investment and is calculated by the variance of expected return eq 3 portfolio return is a weighted average of the individual assets expected returns eq 2 it considers the assets expected returns and their shares in the portfolio the portfolio risk depends on of variance of assets and the covariance between them eqs 4 and 5 the covariance composed of correlations of each pair of assets and squares of their variances so that the positive correlations between two assets indicate that return of them changes in the same way above or below its expected return under the same condition therefore high correlations will increase the covariance as well as the portfolio risk as a result the asset correlations which lead to the portfolio risk would be less than each asset s risk every possible combination of assets can be shown as a point on the return risk graph some points are more efficient because they have the same expected return but a lower risk or the same risk but a higher expected return aerts et al 2015 all of these points called efficient portfolio will form the efficient frontier curve points lying on the frontier are called pareto points and are not strictly dominated by each other fig 8 even though the mpt is widely applied it is based on the assumptions that they have built limitations in using it 1 mpt assumes investors are generally rational and risk adverse while behavioral finance represents they are normal instead of rational curtis 2004 2 the investment of assets should be over the same time horizon while an asset may not be useful in the short time it will be useful in the long time 3 return assets are assumed to follow normal distribution within an asset class because of many financial assets returns do not follow a normal distribution using of mpt to different issues is limited 4 backward looking analysis based on historical results therefore a large number of historical data is needed and the validity of the results depends on the accuracy of them to adopt the mpt for water allocation the water will be dealt with as the capital then the returns and risks associated with the allocated water in different cases of water use activities will be dealt with as the return and risk components of the mpt since the excess share of water allocation does not have a risk attitude in this paper the modified version of the mpt known as post modern portfolio theory pmpt has been applied the latter model takes into account only the deficit water allocation as a risk regarding the necessity of considering social issues for water allocation planning the gini coefficient was considered as the third component to achieve a maximum economic return minimum economic risk and minimum gini coefficient simultaneously corresponding to the allocated water table 2 shows the corresponding components of the mpt with those applied in the case of water allocation the steps to implement the pmpt in the problem of water allocation in this paper are explained below step 1 totally e r i is an expected return that is obtained based on actual return value added water consumption and the probability of state k occurs ρ in water allocation the annual average value of water productivity as a surrogate of the expected economic return e r i is separately calculated for agricultural service and industrial activities by eq 1 1a e r i k 1 m ρ k r k 1b e r i k 1 m r k n k 1 m added value water consumption k n k 1 m in which i number of economic activities k number of years r individual return step 2 expected return portfolio function e r p is obtained corresponding to the total weight of the expected activities returns by eq 2 2 e r p i 1 n w i e r i w agr e r agr w ind e r ind w ser e r ser i 1 n w i 1 0 w i 1 i 1 n in which i number of economic activity w water allocation for every activity step 3 the expected return risk is calculated regarding the semi variance of economic return in different parts σ p by eq 3 the portfolio risk is then calculated as the variance of the return portfolio by eqs 4 and 5 3 risk σ k k 1 r i e r i m r k e r i 2

gini coefficient of the income distribution the efficient plane is produced by solving an optimization problem with a three objective function consisting of eqs 1 3 for this purpose the method of nsga ii non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii was applied all the points on this plane are pareto points and indicate the return risk and the gini coefficient while showing the amount of water allocations of x1 x2 x3 for different activities agriculture industry and services fig 8 illustrates schematically a comparison between the classic two dimensional mpt efficient frontier curve as indicated by markowitz 1952 and the three dimensional efficient frontier plane as adopted in this paper 2 5 making decisions to enhance the adaptive capacity an efficient frontier plane is generated in every sub basin according to climate change conditions those planes would be used to make decisions on water allocation in the sub basins as a way to achieve the maximum return and the minimum gini coefficient in accordance with the decision makers level of risk taking 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of the existing condition in the basin using the simulation model the outputs of the system dynamic model would be referred to as a baseline to investigate the consequences of economic activities on the hydrological economic social indicators the proportions of water withdrawal and return flow for different economic activities according to the simulated results for the period of 2001 2011 are depicted in fig 9 as can be seen most of the water is abstracted for the agricultural sector with the least portion of return flow due to high water consumption in the agricultural sector the discharge into the downstream lakes has decreased to a level far below that is required for maintaining the ecosystem services of the lakes sajedipour et al 2017 fig 10 that reveals the necessity of revision in the path of agricultural development in the area 3 2 simulation of temperature and precipitation in the future results of precipitation and temperature simulation of aogcm models show that the precipitation in all sub basins except the first one will decrease in each scenario in the future figs 11 and 12 overall the precipitation of the whole basin will decrease by about 10 1 according to the rcp2 6 and by 10 3 according to rcp8 5 in the future compared to those in the historical period 2001 2011 also as depicted in fig 12 the temperature would be increasing in all five sub basins leading to increasing the annual temperature of the whole basin to 2 37 c in rcp2 6 and 2 52 c in rcp8 5 3 3 surface water groundwater and ecosystem change simulation in the future in order to simulate the surface and groundwater conditions of the sub basins from 2020 to 2049 the ensemble time series data of temperature and precipitation variables were introduced to the system dynamic simulation model according to table 3 the basin runoff will decrease by 6 4 in rcp2 6 and 4 in rcp8 5 in the future period compared to those in the baseline condition the inflow into the lakes will be reduced compared to its historical records in the last ten years therefore the average number of flamingoes and produced fig in the two climate change scenarios as an indicator of ecosystem performance will decrease compared to the historical period missing these ecosystem services might be the effect on the benefit of agriculture and attracting ecotourism and consequently on the income of resilient in sub basin 5 moreover the average volume of the groundwater would decrease in 2020 2049 according to the results the study area will face lack of water and increased water demand due to high temperature fig 12 in the future which might result in a more severe economic loss due to high dependency of the local economy on agricultural activities 3 4 investigating the economic and social conditions in the future table 4 demonstrates the changes in economic and social indicators in each sub basin regarding value added and rate of employment respectively under different climate change scenarios compared with those associated with the historical period since the industrial and services sectors are not as sensitive as the agricultural sector to water changes their associated indicators in both scenarios remained the same as access to water resources get more restricted from upstream to downstream the economic and social indicators also get worse correspondingly it implies that adaptation policies need to be oriented toward decoupling the social economic welfare from the water it means a part of agricultural activities should be replaced by other economic activities to compensate for the economic and social losses due to lack of water in the climate change conditions 3 5 portfolio production tools of decision making the water allocation options will be revised in each sub basin as the adaptation policies for the conditions of climate change in the future based on the efficient frontier planes generated by running the three dimensional pmpt model each point on the plane is associated with a choice of water allocation with optimum values of economic return risk and gini coefficient for instance fig 13 illustrates the portfolio pareto points and a related efficient frontier plane associated with sub basin1 which has been produced under climate change conditions rcp 2 6 here comes an illustrative comparison between conditions of reallocating water by the portfolio model and water allocation according to the historical trend in the future period determination of baseline water allocation the amount of return risk and gini coefficient were calculated without optimizing in the next step the available water was reallocated to economic activities optimally by solving the portfolio in order to address more precisely the points are shown in two dimensional charts as shown in fig 14 a the portfolio pareto points have significantly more return than that of baseline with the same gini coefficient also more appropriate options are also produced with less gini coefficient and higher economic return by portfolio model fig 14b indicates that in the same risk portfolio points have less gini coefficient compared to the baseline fig 14c shows increasing return is associated with increasing the risk the process of choice will be finalized among the pareto points according to the level of risk accepted by the decision maker to illustrate the process the results associated with the two extreme conditions of the highest return and the lowest risk are depicted in table 5 fig 13 shows two extreme points on the efficient frontier plane which were chosen as examples with a risk aversion attitude compared to a risk taking one water allocation is higher to agriculture than to industries and services irrespective of risk taking attitude the water allocated to agriculture under the climate change scenario will be reduced and shifted to industries and services in comparison with the historical condition however in those sub basins with agricultural dependent industries the saved water from the reduced share of agricultural water is allocated to services within the risk taking attitude owing to the buffering characteristic of the portfolio which prevents reducing total return overall portfolio allocations in both attitudes to risk produced more proportions of return to risk and return to gini coefficient criteria in the basin compared to the baseline table 6 4 conclusions climate change negatively affects the amount of accessible water in arid regions leading to economic loss therefore increasing the system adaptive capacity to survive from the climate change impacts will play an important role in building sustainability in this paper the post modern portfolio theory pmpt was adapted to redesign the scheme of water allocation among three economic sectors of agriculture industries and services in tashk bakhtegan basin located in southern iran in addition to two criteria of economic return and risk which are initially embedded in the pmpt the third component of gini coefficient was added to the model to embrace the social dimension of equity as well a system dynamic model was applied to simulate the social ecological system of the basin under climate change scenarios changing of climate variables in the future was simulated using three aogcm models and downscaling methods according to the results the basin is expected to confront less precipitation due to climate change effects in the future which will result in an economic loss regarding reduction in agricultural productions and employment since the dominant economic activity in the basin is agriculture there is a big concern for climate change impacts therefore making economic activities more diverse regarding relying on resources would be the leading strategy of adaptation to climate change effects applying a three dimensional pmpt the paper generated the plane of efficiency which provides optimum points of water allocation with a different combination of economic return risk and gini coefficient the ratios of return to risk and return to gini coefficient on the efficiency plane are improved compared to the water allocation in the baseline conditions that it is supporting the increase of the system adaptive capacity instead of giving a single optimum solution the efficiency plane let the decision maker choose his her own choice from the points of the plane according to his her level of risk acceptance attitude that will provide policymakers with a practical tool for attracting the participation of stakeholders in the process of decision making respecting their attitudes of risk taking or risk aversion vis a vis economic return and social equity also the tashk bakhtegan lakes are of high environmental values due to their ecosystem services they serve to provide habitats for migrating birds such as flamingoes esthetic landscapes as well as serving to moderate the microclimate through a process of evaporation the evaporation process is also important from an economic point of view because it will supply the humidity for the rain fed orchards of figs and almonds in the local area therefore releasing water to the lake lead to revive valuable ecosystem services which effect on the socio economic system by enhancing the productivity of rain fed fig providing resident for birds improving ecotourism industry and conserving human health through avoiding salt distribution the items can be evaluated in the form of economic benefit currency and considered as one of the economic sectors in the portfolio equation to allocate water that will be suggested for future research conflict of interest none

1147,hydrological changes due to climate change will impact the sustainability of social ecological systems ses it is essential to develop methodologies capable of addressing economic as well as the environmental aspects to take care of the water associated system through improving the system adaptive capacity particularly in arid and semi arid areas through the application of the post modern portfolio theory pmpt we propose a new approach to water allocation problem in the face of climate change as a case of lake tashk bakhtegan basin southern iran the economic model based on pmpt is adapted for designing water allocation schemes to maximize local economic return minimize its risk and minimize the gini coefficient indicative of social inequities the climatic variables were generated by three atmosphere ocean general circulation models the temperature and precipitation will increase and decrease by about 2 4 and 10 on average in the future compared to those in the historical period respectively in order to identify hydrological and socio economic implications of climate change in the basin an integrated system dynamic model was developed finally the decision space of equally effective solutions has been determined in the form of pareto points at the efficient portfolio plane the findings showed a decrease in the economic return on average by 5 7 in the both rcps and the ratio of employment to unemployment average 10 in most of sub basin owing to the reduction of water resources especially in agriculture base on portfolio results the ratio of economic return to risk doubled and tripled in optimized condition compared to the normal condition in the future the efficient plane of the portfolio can be used to allocate water to economic activities according to a risk taking attitude of a decision maker following the model results services and industrial sectors would need to be developed in order to sustain local water resources with possible additional allocations for environmental requirements with simultaneous improvement of economic return on water resources keywords climate change adaptive capacity economical water allocation integrated assessment 1 introduction climate change adversely affects hydrological economic social and environmental sub systems resulting in unstable conditions in the entire system in most of the regions it affects water availability which impacts the environment furthermore climate change would be more challenging specifically regarding water allocation where each group of stakeholders has their utilities and priorities machalaba et al 2015 yang et al 2018 since water is an integral input for several economic activities water scarcity can lead to adverse changes in the water related economic outputs that could stimulate social conflicts and challenges leading to chaos thus alleviation of the impacts due to climate change is a global goal in order to sustain the social ecological systems in the future one approach to overcome the negative impacts of climate change is to enhance the adaptive capacity of the system under study by adaptive capacity a system continues to survive by either returning to its initial equilibrium or transforming into a new one regarding the economic dimension of a water associated system hydro economic models can be used to address the economic outputs co related to the changes in the availability of water input see e g rosegrant et al 2000 harou and lund 2008 harou et al 2009 you and ringler 2010 connell buck et al 2011 varela ortega et al 2011 rojas et al 2013 balali and viaggi 2015 esteve et al 2015 kahil et al 2015 koopman et al 2015 there are different hydro economic studies addressing groundwater resources surface water resources and agricultural systems separately see e g tzabiras et al 2016 de moraes sá et al 2017 gemitzi et al 2017 gosling et al 2017 liu et al 2017 hurd et al 2004 developed water allocation and impact models water aim to detect the effect of climate change and reallocate water resources to different activities this model simulates the impacts of changes on water and the number of economic consequences the sudan hydro economic optimization model shom was developed to allocate optimal surface water to upstream agricultural uses and downstream hydropower consumption satti et al 2015 although the water was allocated based on a dynamic approach in that research the benefits and costs were seen as fixed factors furthermore the risks of economic return of water due to different uses were not addressed nevertheless in the context of climate change effects there is still a gap to integrate all inter related systems in a comprehensive model furthermore it is also necessary to consider the risk of economic return and the risk of simultaneous performance of a set of activities the present paper contributes to filling the gap by adopting a system dynamic sd modeling approach sd models have been applied to analyze water resources problems see e g füssel and klein 2006 biesbroek et al 2010 venkat 2011 rahimikhoob et al 2015 gohari et al 2017a b the mpt is initially a financial economic theory in order to invest under uncertainty markowitz 1952 crowe and parker 2008 but it has been recently used in other fields such as water resources management to face the future uncertainties and possible changes it recommends diverse economic activities with the lowest correlation the model considers two criteria economic return and risk simultaneously models based on the mpt have been built in energy sector for electricity supply options and policy making white 2007 huang and wu 2008 menegaki 2008 allan et al 2010 allan et al 2011 bhattacharya and kojima 2012 chuang and ma 2013 dellano paz et al 2015 especially under climate change situations awerbuch and berger 2003 chalvatzis and hooper 2009 kumar et al 2015 for providing adaptation strategies to climate change in groundwater and surface water resources management mariño et al 2014 hua et al 2015 water quality marinoni et al 2011 dealing with extreme phenomena like floods and droughts buchecker et al 2013 finger and sauer 2014 and land use changes changes in cropping pattern and crop yields in agriculture gaydon et al 2012 bodin et al 2014 mitter et al 2015 in all of the mentioned studies the core idea of the mpt has been distributing risk in different investments according to uncertainties associated with the economic activities related to water the implementation of the portfolio theory to allocate water resources to different activities can provide suitable and stable economic performance under climate change conditions despite the mpt capabilities there are restrictions and defects using the model in water resources management problems in this theory every kind of fluctuations of average return is known as a risk and is calculated by using variance whereas in water resources allocation positive return fluctuations mean that the supplied water for economic activities is more than the average therefore this extra amount should not be considered as a risk in this paper the post modern portfolio theory pmpt geambaşu et al 2013 will be applied in order to avoid the mpt defect the pmpt theory measures the risk by semi variance moreover in the pmpt only two criteria of return and risk are embedded those criteria will be satisfactory on an individual scale while in a basin level some social scale considerations should also be met therefore a third dimension is added to the model in this paper to respect the social concerns the social dimension will be taken into account regarding the gini coefficient to embrace the social justice in wealth distribution this paper couples the outputs of a sd model which embrace the social economic as well as the water resources sub systems with a water allocation model built based on the pmpt under different scenarios of climate change in the lake tashk bakhtegan basin with the aim to propose a new method of dealing with water allocation problem from ecosystem and social perspectives therefore increasing adaptive capacity and sustainable condition are meet through the effective allocation of water also the model proposes a decision platform for the tashk bakhtegan lake basin which verifies appropriate climate change adaptation strategies 2 method 2 1 study area located in southern iran the lake tashk bakhtegan basin is drained by two main streams named kor and sivand rivers into two major inter connected water bodies known as tashk and bakhtegan lakes at the most downstream fig 1 for the past ten years the river discharge has decreased substantially leading the lakes to dry up which is an environmental catastrophe furthermore since the dominant and also the most profitable economic activities in the basin are irrigated agriculture mostly from kor river the economic life of the local communities has also been impacted due to water scarcity imposed partly by the effects of climate change 2 2 integrated modeling of the basin water resources system to simulate the interaction of water resources sub system with the socio economic sub system the system dynamics model developed jointly by jalali 2017 using simulink has been adopted a simplified flowchart of the model is shown in fig 2 the model comprises of the water sub system which includes the elements of hydrologic cycle groundwater and surface water interaction water supply and environment as well as sub models associated to economic and social sub systems and sub models associated to the water withdrawal and return flows the ordinal priorities for allocating water are assumed to services industrial and agricultural uses respectively moreover the return flows due to the non consumptive water uses of those sectors return to the surface and groundwater resources fig 3 illustrates a schematic of the hydrological sub system the economic sub system consists of services agricultural and industrial sectors which interact with each other as described in fig 4 in the agricultural sector the income plays the role as a driver for economic development the farmers motivation to earn more income compared to their previous year income will determine the expected cultivated land area for the next time step that expected cultivated area will be modified in the next stage according to the available water and labor force potential then the realized amount of water consumption and the corresponding return flow according to the final expected cultivated land area will be calculated also the value added and employees are fed into the model from the look up tables which have been built based on the observed data in the industrial sector the rate of annual investment rather than the availability of water and labor force is dominating the growth rate in that sector the water consumption in that sector will be calculated corresponding to the number of industrial units each year at last the value added of the industry sector is determined based on water consumption in the services sector water is not considered as an input indeed the water consumption in that sector is calculated based on the per capita water use and the number of population in the next step based on water availability expected services workforce is determined and the corresponding value added will be obtained the social subsystem includes three population cohorts 0 10 years old 11 60 years old and more than 60 years old this subsystem is related to the economic subsystems by supplying labor force from the 11 60 population cohort to each economic sector and receiving retired population into the third cohort fig 5 2 2 1 calibration and verification the model is calibrated and verified over the 2001 2006 and 2007 2011 periods respectively the water sub system was calibrated versus the discharge rates of surface water and the volume of groundwater the coefficients of runoff infiltration returned water a portion of surface water for supplying water and amounts of groundwater seepage were applied to calibrate the water resources sub system furthermore in the economic sub system the terms of cultivated area industrial units employees value added and water consumption were calibrated in each sector also the social subsystem was calibrated versus each population cohort by coefficients of population transfer between cohorts birth rate and death rate terms some figures should be presented calibration and validation of the dynamic model are depicted as follows in figs 6 a c and 7 a d jalali 2017 2 3 generating climate change scenarios and simulating the impacts of climate change 2 3 1 generating climate scenarios from the aogcm models in this research to simulate climate changes in the basin outputs of the atmosphere ocean general circulation model aogcm in the fifth assessment report of ipcc were applied ipcc 2014 mean daily precipitation maximum daily and minimum daily temperature changes were extracted from the canesm2 1 1 second generation canadian earth system model mpi esm lr 2 2 max planck institute earth system model low resolution and gfdl esm2g 3 3 geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory earth system model 2g models by new extreme scenarios of greenhouse gasses rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 in the current 1984 2013 and future 2020 2049 periods table 1 2 3 2 downscaling data produced by the aogcm models are not appropriate for direct use due to the low power of spatial resolution hence to alleviate the problem various downscaling techniques have been presented the downscaling models are divided into two categories based on their performances in the study 1 single site and 2 multisite the output of single site downscaling models is calculated for one site per se and the relations among multiple sites and the individual correlation of the variables are not considered thus the outputs of the adjacent sites do not possibly show high correlations consequently the issue affects the results of models and calculations depending on different climatic variables unlike in single site models in multisite methods downscaling is performed for several sites in an area or some variables concurrently thus three multisite downscaling methods including modexds 4 4 modular expanded downscaling bürger 1996 sknn 5 5 sequential k nearest neighbor imputation method kim et al 2004 kim and yi 2008 and msdsm 6 6 statistical downscaling model decision centric wilby et al 2002 wilby et al 2003 harpham and wilby 2005 wilby and dawson 2013 were applied in order to minimize the uncertainty in the output of multisite downscaling modexds method is created to downscale the daily climatic variables especially for those variables not following a normal distribution bürger 1996 exds is based on the premise that the local events are close to the normal atmospheric circulation on which the model can rely still it produces the real local variability in variables and sites concurrently the k nearest neighborhood approach k nn is a non parametric imputation method that can be used for regression altman 1992 it is a kind of instance based learning algorithm which identifies k number of its nearest neighbors of query data devak et al 2015 although the k nn method is described in detail in some research lall and sharma 1996 rajagopalan and lall 1999 buishand and brandsma 2001 yates et al 2003 kowarik and templ 2016 it is briefly explained here in order to apply k nn method for downscaling climatic data the input includes the k closest training set from historical daily weather data that are divided to predictors and predicted for training database devak et al 2015 at first step the composition of the feature vector includes means of precipitation and temperature of stations yates et al 2003 is defined for specific day t missing value rajagopalan and lall 1999 yates et al 2003 at second the nearest neighbors days within a temporal window to the current day yates et al 2003 king et al 2015 and their mean vectors are determined then the covariance matrix is computed for day t yates et al 2003 for the fourth step distances between the mean vectors of day t and nearest days are calculated also the distances are sorted and the first k nearest neighbors are retained therefore k is determined in the next step all of the k nearest neighbors are weighted based on their metric distances euclidean distance lall and sharma 1996 kim et al 2004 kim and yi 2008 thus each neighbor is weighted based on its importance kowarik and templ 2016 indeed the nearer neighbors have more contribution in the average than further neighbors finally the feature vector of day t weather variables is obtained by calculating a weighted average of amounts of k nearest neighbors these steps are repeated for as many days of required simulation rajagopalan and lall 1999 in the sknn method all of the steps are implemented as a k nn method except two steps with main points that lead to reducing execution time in sdsm method wilby et al 2002 wilby and dawson 2013 atmospheric circulation index and local meteorological variables will be used to estimate scheduling variables such as precipitation incident or the maximum temperature showing daily weather on site more information concerning the methods is accessible in bürger 1996 kim et al 2004 wilby et al 2002 and wilby and dawson 2013 2 3 3 simulation of temperature and precipitation in each sub basin in order to simulate precipitation and temperature the output of three models of aogcm and three methods of downscaling nine existing scenarios were built in an ensemble of each station and resulted in a time series finally for investigating the temperature and precipitation variations in the five sub basins the average regional values of these two variables were calculated over each sub basin by thiessen method 2 3 4 simulating the impacts of climate change and generating time series of economic efficiency in future periods in order to identify climate change impacts future precipitation and temperature variables were entered into the dynamic integrated water resources simulation model as exogenous variables for 2020 2049 as a 30 year time series the changes in the amount of precipitation led to changes in groundwater and surface water resources reservoirs as well as changes in the runoff and water infiltration in addition the increasing temperature caused the water requirement of the plants to increase consequently affected the total water demand regarding the interactions among different sectors the change of water would have some effects on other sub systems thus the time series of economic activities return in every part of the basin related to those resources in the future years will differ from that of the base period 2 4 water allocation optimization 2 4 1 development of three dimensional post modern portfolio theory the mpt model was initiated by harry markowitz in 1952 for determining investment strategies under uncertainty based on the mpt the utility of an investor is a function of the expected returns and risks because of maintaining an acceptable return investors prefer to invest in various activities rather than an individual activity in the other word the feature of the risk aversion of investors leads them to invest in different financial assets ekholm et al 2013 zhang 2016 which is called diversify in investing in case of returns of assets are not perfectly correlated diversification causes to a buffering effect that reduces the total risk however the risk of investing is reduced by diversifying investments combinations of financial assets that produce more return are not identified zhang 2016 the mpt resolves this problem and determines combinations portfolios of assets which maximize return for a preferred level of risk therefore it can be suitable for attracting investors mpt can be applied under the four following conditions which make diversification base useful elton et al 1995 fraser et al 2005 1 more than one possible investment option exists at any time 2 these investment options are exposed to risk 3 there is data for historical expected return of assets 4 all investments are not equally affected under the same conditions according to mpt the expected return of an individual asset is calculated based on actual returns of asset and the probability of their occurrence in different states eq 1a moreover individual asset risk is defined as deviations volatility of the expected return of investment and is calculated by the variance of expected return eq 3 portfolio return is a weighted average of the individual assets expected returns eq 2 it considers the assets expected returns and their shares in the portfolio the portfolio risk depends on of variance of assets and the covariance between them eqs 4 and 5 the covariance composed of correlations of each pair of assets and squares of their variances so that the positive correlations between two assets indicate that return of them changes in the same way above or below its expected return under the same condition therefore high correlations will increase the covariance as well as the portfolio risk as a result the asset correlations which lead to the portfolio risk would be less than each asset s risk every possible combination of assets can be shown as a point on the return risk graph some points are more efficient because they have the same expected return but a lower risk or the same risk but a higher expected return aerts et al 2015 all of these points called efficient portfolio will form the efficient frontier curve points lying on the frontier are called pareto points and are not strictly dominated by each other fig 8 even though the mpt is widely applied it is based on the assumptions that they have built limitations in using it 1 mpt assumes investors are generally rational and risk adverse while behavioral finance represents they are normal instead of rational curtis 2004 2 the investment of assets should be over the same time horizon while an asset may not be useful in the short time it will be useful in the long time 3 return assets are assumed to follow normal distribution within an asset class because of many financial assets returns do not follow a normal distribution using of mpt to different issues is limited 4 backward looking analysis based on historical results therefore a large number of historical data is needed and the validity of the results depends on the accuracy of them to adopt the mpt for water allocation the water will be dealt with as the capital then the returns and risks associated with the allocated water in different cases of water use activities will be dealt with as the return and risk components of the mpt since the excess share of water allocation does not have a risk attitude in this paper the modified version of the mpt known as post modern portfolio theory pmpt has been applied the latter model takes into account only the deficit water allocation as a risk regarding the necessity of considering social issues for water allocation planning the gini coefficient was considered as the third component to achieve a maximum economic return minimum economic risk and minimum gini coefficient simultaneously corresponding to the allocated water table 2 shows the corresponding components of the mpt with those applied in the case of water allocation the steps to implement the pmpt in the problem of water allocation in this paper are explained below step 1 totally e r i is an expected return that is obtained based on actual return value added water consumption and the probability of state k occurs ρ in water allocation the annual average value of water productivity as a surrogate of the expected economic return e r i is separately calculated for agricultural service and industrial activities by eq 1 1a e r i k 1 m ρ k r k 1b e r i k 1 m r k n k 1 m added value water consumption k n k 1 m in which i number of economic activities k number of years r individual return step 2 expected return portfolio function e r p is obtained corresponding to the total weight of the expected activities returns by eq 2 2 e r p i 1 n w i e r i w agr e r agr w ind e r ind w ser e r ser i 1 n w i 1 0 w i 1 i 1 n in which i number of economic activity w water allocation for every activity step 3 the expected return risk is calculated regarding the semi variance of economic return in different parts σ p by eq 3 the portfolio risk is then calculated as the variance of the return portfolio by eqs 4 and 5 3 risk σ k k 1 r i e r i m r k e r i 2

gini coefficient of the income distribution the efficient plane is produced by solving an optimization problem with a three objective function consisting of eqs 1 3 for this purpose the method of nsga ii non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii was applied all the points on this plane are pareto points and indicate the return risk and the gini coefficient while showing the amount of water allocations of x1 x2 x3 for different activities agriculture industry and services fig 8 illustrates schematically a comparison between the classic two dimensional mpt efficient frontier curve as indicated by markowitz 1952 and the three dimensional efficient frontier plane as adopted in this paper 2 5 making decisions to enhance the adaptive capacity an efficient frontier plane is generated in every sub basin according to climate change conditions those planes would be used to make decisions on water allocation in the sub basins as a way to achieve the maximum return and the minimum gini coefficient in accordance with the decision makers level of risk taking 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of the existing condition in the basin using the simulation model the outputs of the system dynamic model would be referred to as a baseline to investigate the consequences of economic activities on the hydrological economic social indicators the proportions of water withdrawal and return flow for different economic activities according to the simulated results for the period of 2001 2011 are depicted in fig 9 as can be seen most of the water is abstracted for the agricultural sector with the least portion of return flow due to high water consumption in the agricultural sector the discharge into the downstream lakes has decreased to a level far below that is required for maintaining the ecosystem services of the lakes sajedipour et al 2017 fig 10 that reveals the necessity of revision in the path of agricultural development in the area 3 2 simulation of temperature and precipitation in the future results of precipitation and temperature simulation of aogcm models show that the precipitation in all sub basins except the first one will decrease in each scenario in the future figs 11 and 12 overall the precipitation of the whole basin will decrease by about 10 1 according to the rcp2 6 and by 10 3 according to rcp8 5 in the future compared to those in the historical period 2001 2011 also as depicted in fig 12 the temperature would be increasing in all five sub basins leading to increasing the annual temperature of the whole basin to 2 37 c in rcp2 6 and 2 52 c in rcp8 5 3 3 surface water groundwater and ecosystem change simulation in the future in order to simulate the surface and groundwater conditions of the sub basins from 2020 to 2049 the ensemble time series data of temperature and precipitation variables were introduced to the system dynamic simulation model according to table 3 the basin runoff will decrease by 6 4 in rcp2 6 and 4 in rcp8 5 in the future period compared to those in the baseline condition the inflow into the lakes will be reduced compared to its historical records in the last ten years therefore the average number of flamingoes and produced fig in the two climate change scenarios as an indicator of ecosystem performance will decrease compared to the historical period missing these ecosystem services might be the effect on the benefit of agriculture and attracting ecotourism and consequently on the income of resilient in sub basin 5 moreover the average volume of the groundwater would decrease in 2020 2049 according to the results the study area will face lack of water and increased water demand due to high temperature fig 12 in the future which might result in a more severe economic loss due to high dependency of the local economy on agricultural activities 3 4 investigating the economic and social conditions in the future table 4 demonstrates the changes in economic and social indicators in each sub basin regarding value added and rate of employment respectively under different climate change scenarios compared with those associated with the historical period since the industrial and services sectors are not as sensitive as the agricultural sector to water changes their associated indicators in both scenarios remained the same as access to water resources get more restricted from upstream to downstream the economic and social indicators also get worse correspondingly it implies that adaptation policies need to be oriented toward decoupling the social economic welfare from the water it means a part of agricultural activities should be replaced by other economic activities to compensate for the economic and social losses due to lack of water in the climate change conditions 3 5 portfolio production tools of decision making the water allocation options will be revised in each sub basin as the adaptation policies for the conditions of climate change in the future based on the efficient frontier planes generated by running the three dimensional pmpt model each point on the plane is associated with a choice of water allocation with optimum values of economic return risk and gini coefficient for instance fig 13 illustrates the portfolio pareto points and a related efficient frontier plane associated with sub basin1 which has been produced under climate change conditions rcp 2 6 here comes an illustrative comparison between conditions of reallocating water by the portfolio model and water allocation according to the historical trend in the future period determination of baseline water allocation the amount of return risk and gini coefficient were calculated without optimizing in the next step the available water was reallocated to economic activities optimally by solving the portfolio in order to address more precisely the points are shown in two dimensional charts as shown in fig 14 a the portfolio pareto points have significantly more return than that of baseline with the same gini coefficient also more appropriate options are also produced with less gini coefficient and higher economic return by portfolio model fig 14b indicates that in the same risk portfolio points have less gini coefficient compared to the baseline fig 14c shows increasing return is associated with increasing the risk the process of choice will be finalized among the pareto points according to the level of risk accepted by the decision maker to illustrate the process the results associated with the two extreme conditions of the highest return and the lowest risk are depicted in table 5 fig 13 shows two extreme points on the efficient frontier plane which were chosen as examples with a risk aversion attitude compared to a risk taking one water allocation is higher to agriculture than to industries and services irrespective of risk taking attitude the water allocated to agriculture under the climate change scenario will be reduced and shifted to industries and services in comparison with the historical condition however in those sub basins with agricultural dependent industries the saved water from the reduced share of agricultural water is allocated to services within the risk taking attitude owing to the buffering characteristic of the portfolio which prevents reducing total return overall portfolio allocations in both attitudes to risk produced more proportions of return to risk and return to gini coefficient criteria in the basin compared to the baseline table 6 4 conclusions climate change negatively affects the amount of accessible water in arid regions leading to economic loss therefore increasing the system adaptive capacity to survive from the climate change impacts will play an important role in building sustainability in this paper the post modern portfolio theory pmpt was adapted to redesign the scheme of water allocation among three economic sectors of agriculture industries and services in tashk bakhtegan basin located in southern iran in addition to two criteria of economic return and risk which are initially embedded in the pmpt the third component of gini coefficient was added to the model to embrace the social dimension of equity as well a system dynamic model was applied to simulate the social ecological system of the basin under climate change scenarios changing of climate variables in the future was simulated using three aogcm models and downscaling methods according to the results the basin is expected to confront less precipitation due to climate change effects in the future which will result in an economic loss regarding reduction in agricultural productions and employment since the dominant economic activity in the basin is agriculture there is a big concern for climate change impacts therefore making economic activities more diverse regarding relying on resources would be the leading strategy of adaptation to climate change effects applying a three dimensional pmpt the paper generated the plane of efficiency which provides optimum points of water allocation with a different combination of economic return risk and gini coefficient the ratios of return to risk and return to gini coefficient on the efficiency plane are improved compared to the water allocation in the baseline conditions that it is supporting the increase of the system adaptive capacity instead of giving a single optimum solution the efficiency plane let the decision maker choose his her own choice from the points of the plane according to his her level of risk acceptance attitude that will provide policymakers with a practical tool for attracting the participation of stakeholders in the process of decision making respecting their attitudes of risk taking or risk aversion vis a vis economic return and social equity also the tashk bakhtegan lakes are of high environmental values due to their ecosystem services they serve to provide habitats for migrating birds such as flamingoes esthetic landscapes as well as serving to moderate the microclimate through a process of evaporation the evaporation process is also important from an economic point of view because it will supply the humidity for the rain fed orchards of figs and almonds in the local area therefore releasing water to the lake lead to revive valuable ecosystem services which effect on the socio economic system by enhancing the productivity of rain fed fig providing resident for birds improving ecotourism industry and conserving human health through avoiding salt distribution the items can be evaluated in the form of economic benefit currency and considered as one of the economic sectors in the portfolio equation to allocate water that will be suggested for future research conflict of interest none

1148,the attempts to restore lake wolsztyńskie by direct dosing to the water iron sulphate pix 113 and chloride polyaluminium pax 18 in 2005 2006 and then iron chloride to the lake s bottom sediments in 2012 2013 resulted in only short lasting improvement of water quality in 2016 the physicochemical and biological parameters have shown that the lake should be classified into eutrophic and even hypertrophic primarily because of the high concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyll a as well as low visibility although in theory the methods of restoration were selected correctly in practice the improvement of water quality in a flow through lake without eliminating the influx of water from allochthonous sources of pollution was impossible the total load of nutrients arriving in lake

fold higher than the one deemed as tolerable by the ecosystem about 86 of the phosphorus load is delivered from the main river dojca river thus elimination of this source of pollution is the necessary

progressive degradation of lakes and other water reservoirs caused by urbanization climate change and agricultural industry as a production of livestock poultry fish and crops requires an inter disciplinary approach to integrate different environmental social cultural and economic factors hamilton and dada 2016 one of the main threats to water quality seen today is the uncontrolled growth of phytoplankton particularly of the invasive and highly toxic cyanobacteria cayelan et al 2012 harke et al 2016 paerl et al 2016 as well as having direct economic consequences cyanobacterial blooms affect eco goods and services derived from lakes such as potable water supply fisheries or recreation aylward et al 2005 hamilton et al 2014 the implementation of the water framework directive 2000 60 ec and strong pressure to achieve at least good ecological status for all waters might lead to undertaking uncontrolled activities within water bodies any choice of technological solutions for implementation must be preceded by detailed analyses of the hydrological and morphometric properties of a given water body parameters of its catchment and the potential use of lake water in the context of economic calculations what appears to be particularly challenging is how to approach the problem of flow through lakes with large total catchment basins or badly degraded urban lakes which have been receiving sewage for so many years that their bottom sediments have become nearly inexhaustible pools of nutrients successful elimination of point sources of pollutants household greywater and sewage industrial wastewater rainwater carried to a lake or its tributaries through water collectors can be achieved with the latest wastewater treatment technology it is much harder to control non point pollution sources which include wastewater from villages lacking sewage systems that percolate through soil to lakes confined groundwaters field drainage ditches defective septic tanks and cesspools etc any effort to limit an import of contaminants from such sources requires paying special attention to single household greywater and sewage treatment systems and construction of local and collective water treatment plants wtps areal pollution is mainly caused by agricultural activity and therefore can be controlled through a variety of methods adjusted to particular catchments their physiographic and soil characteristics the current management of a given area and hydrographic conditions dunalska and wiśniewski 2016 ławniczak et al 2016 whereas most of the influx of pollutants from lake catchments has not been stopped yet many lake restoration methods are now being implemented across europe supported through local national and the european union funds unfortunately good tools are lacking to make reliable assessment of long term effects of the applied restoration methods therefore the main aim of the study was to analyze hydrochemical and biological parameters as well as to make an evaluation of the trophic condition of a lake which had already been subject to restoration twice in addition analyses were made to determine the hydrological as well as physicochemical parameters of waters in the tributaries to the lake and in its surface water outflow based on the data thus acquired loads of nutrients from external sources were determined and the phosphorus and nitrogen balances were calculated the analyzed lake is a flow through shallow water body which receives waters from a total catchment covering 197 km2 the lake lies in a town and serves as a

river s northern canal the obra river the warta and the odra rivers with respect to the water retention time according to the division proposed by pasławski 1975 lake wolsztyńskie belongs to lakes with the active water exchange status 5 i 10 where the water retention time is high depending on the sum of precipitation in a given year the complete replacement of the water contained in the lake occurs from 4 to 10 times a year the lake s main hydrological axis is the dojca river which flows into the lake at its northern end and carries waters to nearby lake berzyńskie moreover lake wolsztyńskie is supplied by water through five smaller watercourses three permanent and two periodical ones and there is one man made canal which carries away water from the lake morphometrically the

phosphorus inactivation method the applied coagulant consisted of an aqueous solution of iron sulphate pix 113 and chloride polyaluminium pax 18 the coagulants in doses of 50 tonnes of pix 113 and 50 tonnes of pax 18 in the spring 2005 as well as 100 t of pax 18 each in spring and autumn 2006 were delivered under the water surface to the depth of about 20 40 cm through a dosing system consisting of conveyor tubes and perforated pipes with an adjustable immersion depth system for the even distribution of the coagulant in the lake s bowl a gps appliance was used gawrońska et al 2006 the total cost of the reclamation treatment was 434 5 thousand pln data provided by the municipal and environmental protection department in wolsztyn the second lake restoration treatment was carried out in 2012 2013 and employed a method of direct dosing of iron chloride to the lake s bottom sediments to this aim a system called proteus was employed it consisted of two modules one positioned on the water surface responsible for the transport and distribution of chemical substances precise navigation and control of the underwater module and the underwater one responsible for induction of controlled resuspension of sediments aeration of sediments supply of selected chemical substances to the sediments coagulation and sedimentation of the bottom deposits by dosing iron chloride directly to sediments from the closed chamber of the dosing appliance it is possible to add coagulant in a precise and uniform manner without causing any harm to living organisms in 2014 iron chloride was additionally dosed directly to the dojca river to reduce the load of phosphorus imported to the lake through this main inflow wiśniewski and bryl 2014 the total cost of this reclamation effort was 610

considering the individual relationships between the tsi indicators dunalska 2011 it is plausible that the primary production is the main source of organic matter in the lake tsitp tsitoc tsichl tsisd the high trophic status of lake wolsztyńskie is confirmed by an assessment of the criteria included in the oecd international classification 1982 all the indicator values obtained clearly point to the hypertrophic condition of the lake table 2 phytoplankton abundance and biomass indicated also a more advanced stage of eutrophication of lake wolsztyńskie the total phytoplankton abundance ranged from 28 106 to 60 106 ind dm 3 of counted units i e single cells coenobia colonies filaments and trichomes fig 4 the total phytoplankton biomass fluctuated within an approximate range of 27 80 mg dm 3 fig 5 a seasonal phytoplankton growth was characterized by two maxima of abundance and biomass the first was observed in spring whereas the second in late summer the phytoplankton assemblages were formed by taxa belonging to eight phyla cyanobacteria bacillariophyta charophyta planktonic organisms primarily desmids and conjugating green algae chlorophyta cryptophyta euglenozoa miozoa previously dinophyta and ochrophyta in spring primarily diatoms dominated the phytoplankton forming approximately 60 of total abundance and total biomass the most abundant were asterionella formosa hass ulnaria acus kütz aboal and nannoplankton sized 2 20 μm species of the genus cyclotella table 3 the phytoplankton was then co dominated by cyanobacteria primarily aphanizomenon gracile lemm and limnothrix redekei goor meff forming relative biomass of 23 and 6 respectively at the beginning of summer diatoms cyanobacteria chlorophytes and cryptophytes co dominated the phytoplankton whereas in late summer and autumn the most abundant were cyanobacteria with 62 78 relative abundance and biomass fig 4 5 the cyanobacteria of the genera aphanizomenon and limnothrix and additionally planktothrix agardhii gom anagn et kom planktolyngbya limnetica lemm kom legn et cronb and microcystis wesenbergii kom kom ex kom were dominants which in turn are well known as toxic and or potentially toxic these all cyanobacteria represent functional groups s1 h1 and lm typical of nutrient rich water bodies in the same conditions of higher trophy level the representatives of functional groups c and d i e diatoms asterionella and ulnaria were the ones of the most abundant in spring phytoplankton of lake wolsztyńskie among other phytoplankton groups relative high shares had also chlorophytes cryptophytes and dinophytes in august whereas in october chlorophytes planktonic charophytes including desmids and diatoms euglenoids and ochrophytes were only sporadically noted in phytoplankton throughout the growth season regarding zooplankton 39 species were identified table 4 among three taxonomic groups analyzed rotifers had the highest species richness rotifera 22 species planktonic crustaceans crustacea were represented by 17 species including 11 cladocerans cladocera and 6 copepods copepoda and their juvenile stages nauplii zooplankton species composition was typical of central pelagic zone of the lake however species preferring environment of macrophytes e g lepadella ovalis müller 1786 peracantha truncata müller 1785 or podon sp were also noted the density of zooplankton was successively increasing from spring to summer with maximum in august 2668 in dm 3 fig 6 the only exception was april when cladocerans 56 1 dominated the zooplankton primarily bosmina coregoni coregoni baird 1857 and bosmina longispina leydig 1860 in the remaining months small sized rotifers prevailed in zooplankton community and their share in the total numbers reached up to 91 3 in august fig 6 there were common species characteristic of more eutrophic waters i e kellicotia longispina kellicott 1879 in june and keratella cochlearis f tecta gosse 1851 and trichocerca similis wierzejski 1893 in august and october the highest biomass of zooplankton was in june 2 77 mg dm 3 the values of zooplankton biomass gradually decreased in subsequent months fig 7 which was connected with quantitative domination of small sized forms in october zooplankton biomass was 30 fold lower compared with august concerning domination by weight copepoda dominated the zooplankton in spring with a share of 53 9 in april and 64 8 in june this resulted from a high share of macrocyclops albidus jurine 1820 approximately 40 of total biomass furthermore a high biomass in spring zooplankton formed also small sized cladocerans b c coregoni chydorus sphaericus müller 1785 and diaphanosoma brachyurum lipin 1848 flora of lake wolsztyńskie was represented by 34 macrophyte species forming 20 well developed communities which belong to 2 classes and 4 alliances all species were characteristic of eutrophic conditions table 5 the highest frequency was characterized by common reed phragmites australis eurasian watermilfoil myriophyllum spicatum and yellow water lily nuphar lutea the average number of species in the relevé was only 3 which indicates low biodiversity of the littoral such a low number of species is characteristic for community of high trophy similarly as the low value of the shannon wiener index hʹ 0 48 in 2016 about 20 of the whole lake area was occupied by macrophytes the largest area was covered by the communities of reed phragmitetum australis eurasian watermilfoil myriophylletum spicati as well as white and yellow water lilies nupharo nymphaeetum albae communities the plant cover ranged between 60 and 95 phragmites australis formed the first strip of littoral the closest from the shore except areas subjected to strong human pressure the biggest patches of submerged macrophytes were observed in the southern part of the lake which were created by eurasian watermilfoil myriophyllum spicatum in the form of randomly scattered clumps and at the inflow of dojca river in the inflow zone numerous patches of nympheid and elodeids occurred created by yellow and white water lilies and hornwort ceratophyllum demersum community which indicate the high water trophy supplying the basin 3 2 loads of nutrients the total load of nutrients arriving in lake wolsztyńskie from direct catchment point and atmospheric sources was 1 877 kg p and 17 137 kg n table 6 which can be converted to 1 5 g p m 2 y 1 and 13 8 g n m 2 y 1 at the moment the actual load of phosphorus in lake wolsztyńskie is about 12 fold higher than the ones deemed as tolerable by the ecosystem 157 4 kg y 1 fig 8 about 86 of the phosphorus load is brought in by the dojca river 1 614 kg hence any efforts to restore the quality of the lake water will be either futile or producing short lived effects unless this source of pollution is eliminated 4 discussion the efforts undertaken to reduce the productivity of waters in lake wolsztyńskie which consisted in dosing ferrous coagulant pix 113 and aluminium pax 18 one to water in 2005 2006 and then iron chloride directly to the bottom sediments in 2012 2013 did not bring about permanent improvement of the water quality a distinct decline in primary productivity was only noted during the application of coagulants after which the productivity in the lake waters rose again as evidenced by the high content of chlorophyll a fig 9 the total phosphorus content increased as well fig 10 a bad state of waters in lake wolsztyńskie was confirmed also by biological indicators high phytoplankton biomass throughout the growth season was characteristic of persistent blooms in nutrient rich waters as well as water bodies having poor ecological status napiórkowska krzebietke and dunalska 2015 seasonal growth pattern of phytoplankton with two peaks was similar to the original plankton ecology group peg model typical of eutrophic waters sommer et al 1986 spring phytoplankton assemblages were dominated by diatoms over 60 simultaneously with a high share of cyanobacteria over 30 summer and autumn intense blooms formed toxic or potentially toxic cyanobacteria which are typical of more nutrient rich polish lakes kobos et al 2013 dominant cyanobacteria represent functional groups s1 h1 and lm which according to reynolds et al 2002 and padisák et al 2009 are typical of turbid mixed environments with shade adaptation eutrophic stratified and shallow lakes with low nitrogen content or even eutrophic to hypertrophic small to medium sized lakes zooplankton indices of trophic state tsirot and tsicr based on two taxonomic groups rotifera and crustacea also confirmed the eutrophic character of waters in lake wolsztyńskie the rotifer trophic state index tsirot 60 84 indicated as highly eutrophic lake whereas crustacean trophic state index tsicr 51 69 indicated as highly meso eutrophic lake the increasing density of zooplankton from spring to summer maximum in august 2668 in dm 3 is also characteristic of eutrophic lakes according to the model elaborated by plankton ecology group i e model peg the low water quality in lake wolsztyńskie has also had a direct impact on the flora currently in the lake dominate rush species with a small proportion of submerged macrophytes including the absence of sensitive species particularly charophytes on the one hand high cover of hornwort at the inflow zone of dojca river to the lake can play as a filter for purifying pollutions supplying to the lake through temporary uptake by plants jeppesen et al 1997 blindow et al 2002 and indirectly by creating a niche for the development of zooplankton muylaert et al 2010 on the other hand high turnover rate of hornwort during vegetation season may result the secondary nutrient release to water and thus may intensify the eutrophication process currently despite the high level of commitment of local authorities to improve the water quality of lake wolsztyńskie and incurred large financial investment the lake does not meet the requirements of the water framework directive 2000 60 ec as to the good status of water body the high productivity in lake wolsztyńskie is maintained by the flux of nutrients mainly from the dojca river 86 of the phosphorus load elimination of this source of pollution is the necessary condition for attaining lasting improvement of the water quality in this lake unfortunately a large total catchment area of the dojca river 269 km2 a large number of diffuse sources of pollution including the fish farms and many administrative units managing this territory all this makes impossible to cut off effectively all sources of pollution directly in the catchment in this situation the protective activities should be done in the lake shore therefore analyzing the hydrological conditions landscape relief as well as economic and environmental conditions it seems that a possible solution lies in re directing the dojca river waters directly to the outflow from lake wolsztyńskie to this end the flow of water needs to be dammed at the mouth of the river with a watertight wall ca 250 m in length thus the river water would flow along the shoreline zone of the western part of the lake to its outflow in order to separate river from lake waters it would be recommended to mount watertight barriers in the inflow shoreline and outflow zones the water balance in lake wolsztyńskie is in the equilibrium state now in the hydrological year 2015 2016 the groundwater recharge volume was 85 230 m3 i e less than 1 on the income side of the balance wiśniewski 2016 if the whole water supply from the surface runoffs was cut off the water surface level in the lake would not be decreased owing to the groundwater supply in order to ensure the hydrological security of lake wolsztyńskie it is necessary to design a gate valve in the place of the current inflow and outflow of the dojca river which would allow the water level in the lake to be regulated during extreme events as an additional solution it can be the redirection of the pre treated water from the separated shoreline zone to the lake in its southern part instead of direct water flow to the outflow the best material for manufacturing the barrier profiles would be the modern system of pvc partitions dunalska et al 2015 dunalska and wiśniewski 2016 in lake wolsztyńskie the barrier profiles should be mounted from the water side so as not to damage the shore belt of reeds which could act as a biotic wastewater pre treatment facility a natural by pass ditch should help to cut off point sources of pollution i e the dojca river st 1 the inflows in the northern st 2 and south western parts of the lake st 8 area and non point sources of pollution in the whole northern southern and western parts of the lake and rainwater once the western shores of the lake are urbanized fig 11 such actions will allow us to eliminate as much as 92 of the phosphorus load and 84 of the nitrogen load originating from area sources in the western side of the lake and three surface inflows table 7 having cut off the dojca river the phosphorus load will decrease from 1877 kg to 156 kg and the share of the inflows in the supply of this element will represent just 27 and will be even lower than the contribution made by atmospheric pollution 35 when the sewerage system is made leak proof and pollutants from the inflow in the north western part of the lake are cut off st 5 the share of the point sources of pollution will be minimal such significant reduction in amounts of allochthonous pollutants creates an actual opportunity to conduct appropriate restoration treatments in the lake bowl and to maintain low productivity of waters in lake wolsztyńskie taking into account the lake morphometry and the physicochemical parameters of water the phosphorus inactivation and biomanipulation as a next step are recommended these actions would also allow us to reduce the internal load of nutrients from the bottom sediments what is necessary to achieve the long lasting positive effects 5 conclusions although in theory the methods of restoration were selected correctly for this type of a water body and implemented under the supervision of experienced scientific teams no lasting improvement of environmental conditions was achieved in practice the research results provide evidence that it is impossible to attain improved water quality in a flow through lake without eliminating the influx of water from allochthonous sources of pollution a question arises whether it is reasonable economically and socially to conduct lake restoration treatments limited exclusively to the lake bowl even though the local authorities and community put enormous pressure to do so as they are interested in creating an attractive site for tourism and recreation should not we rather educate them first about the causes and consequences of lake degradation it is fundamental to implement at the first step adequate protective measures in the lake s catchment and shoreline zone the restoration treatments in the lake itself should be the final step in this process currently the intensive growth of environmental engineering biotechnology and ecohydrology creates immense opportunities to improve the water quality whilst reducing the costs involved the integration of the above actions with the concept of ecosystem goods and services can be a very important tool for the management of water resources conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was

in 2012 2013 resulted in only short lasting improvement of water quality in 2016 the physicochemical and biological parameters have shown that the lake should be classified into eutrophic and even hypertrophic primarily because of the high concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyll a as well as low visibility although in theory the methods of restoration were selected correctly in practice the improvement of water quality in a flow through lake without eliminating the influx of water from allochthonous sources of pollution was impossible the total load of nutrients arriving in lake wolsztyńskie from the direct catchment that is point and atmospheric sources was 1877 kg p and 17 137 kg n respectively at the moment the actual load of phosphorus in lake wolsztyńskie is about 12

phosphorus inactivation method the applied coagulant consisted of an aqueous solution of iron sulphate pix 113 and chloride polyaluminium pax 18 the coagulants in doses of 50 tonnes of pix 113 and 50 tonnes of pax 18 in the spring 2005 as well as 100 t of pax 18 each in spring and autumn 2006 were delivered under the water surface to the depth of about 20 40 cm through a dosing system consisting of conveyor tubes and perforated pipes with an adjustable immersion depth system for the even distribution of the coagulant in the lake s bowl a gps appliance was used gawrońska et al 2006 the total cost of the reclamation treatment was 434 5 thousand pln data provided by the municipal and environmental protection department in wolsztyn the second lake restoration treatment was carried out in 2012 2013 and employed a method of direct dosing of iron chloride to the lake s bottom sediments to this aim a system called proteus was employed it consisted of two modules one positioned on the water surface responsible for the transport and distribution of chemical substances precise navigation and control of the underwater module and the underwater one responsible for induction of controlled resuspension of sediments aeration of sediments supply of selected chemical substances to the sediments coagulation and sedimentation of the bottom deposits by dosing iron chloride directly to sediments from the closed chamber of the dosing appliance it is possible to add coagulant in a precise and uniform manner without causing any harm to living organisms in 2014 iron chloride was additionally dosed directly to the dojca river to reduce the load of phosphorus imported to the lake through this main inflow wiśniewski and bryl 2014 the total cost of this reclamation effort was 610

the high trophic status of lake wolsztyńskie is confirmed by an assessment of the criteria included in the oecd international classification 1982 all the indicator values obtained clearly point to the hypertrophic condition of the lake table 2 phytoplankton abundance and biomass indicated also a more advanced stage of eutrophication of lake wolsztyńskie the total phytoplankton abundance ranged from

5 a seasonal phytoplankton growth was characterized by two maxima of abundance and biomass the first was observed in spring whereas the second in late summer the phytoplankton assemblages were formed by taxa belonging to eight phyla cyanobacteria bacillariophyta charophyta planktonic organisms primarily desmids and conjugating green algae chlorophyta cryptophyta euglenozoa miozoa previously dinophyta and ochrophyta in spring primarily diatoms dominated the phytoplankton forming approximately 60 of total abundance and total biomass the most abundant were asterionella formosa hass ulnaria acus kütz aboal and nannoplankton sized 2 20 μm species of the genus cyclotella table 3 the phytoplankton was then co dominated by cyanobacteria primarily aphanizomenon gracile lemm and limnothrix redekei goor meff forming relative biomass of 23 and 6 respectively at the beginning of summer diatoms cyanobacteria chlorophytes and cryptophytes co dominated the phytoplankton whereas in late summer and autumn the most abundant were cyanobacteria with 62 78 relative abundance and biomass fig 4 5 the cyanobacteria of the genera aphanizomenon and limnothrix and additionally planktothrix agardhii gom anagn et kom planktolyngbya limnetica lemm kom legn et cronb and microcystis wesenbergii kom kom ex kom were dominants which in turn are well known as toxic and or potentially toxic these all cyanobacteria represent functional groups s1 h1 and lm typical of nutrient rich water bodies in the same conditions of higher trophy level the representatives of functional groups c and d i e diatoms asterionella and ulnaria were the ones of the most abundant in spring phytoplankton of lake wolsztyńskie among other phytoplankton groups relative high shares had also chlorophytes cryptophytes and dinophytes in august whereas in october chlorophytes planktonic charophytes including desmids and diatoms euglenoids and ochrophytes were only sporadically noted in phytoplankton throughout the growth season regarding zooplankton 39 species were identified table 4 among three taxonomic groups analyzed rotifers had the highest species richness rotifera 22 species planktonic crustaceans crustacea were represented by 17 species including 11 cladocerans cladocera and 6 copepods copepoda and their juvenile stages nauplii zooplankton species composition was typical of central pelagic zone of the lake however species preferring environment of macrophytes e g lepadella ovalis müller 1786 peracantha truncata müller 1785 or podon sp were also noted the density of zooplankton was successively increasing from spring to summer with maximum in august 2668 in dm 3 fig 6 the only exception was april when cladocerans 56 1 dominated the zooplankton primarily bosmina coregoni coregoni baird 1857 and bosmina longispina leydig 1860 in the remaining months small sized rotifers prevailed in zooplankton community and their share in the total numbers reached up to 91 3 in august fig 6 there were common species characteristic of more eutrophic waters i e kellicotia longispina kellicott 1879 in june and keratella cochlearis f tecta gosse 1851 and trichocerca similis wierzejski 1893 in august and october the highest biomass of zooplankton was in june 2 77 mg dm 3 the values of zooplankton biomass gradually decreased in subsequent months fig 7 which was connected with quantitative domination of small sized forms in october zooplankton biomass was 30 fold lower compared with august concerning domination by weight copepoda dominated the zooplankton in spring with a share of 53 9 in april and 64 8 in june this resulted from a high share of macrocyclops albidus jurine 1820 approximately 40 of total biomass furthermore a high biomass in spring zooplankton formed also small sized cladocerans b c coregoni chydorus sphaericus müller 1785 and diaphanosoma brachyurum lipin 1848 flora of lake wolsztyńskie was represented by 34 macrophyte species forming 20 well developed communities which belong to 2 classes and 4 alliances all species were characteristic of eutrophic conditions table 5 the highest frequency was characterized by common reed phragmites australis eurasian watermilfoil myriophyllum spicatum and yellow water lily nuphar lutea the average number of species in the relevé was only 3 which indicates low biodiversity of the littoral such a low number of species is characteristic for community of high trophy similarly as the low value of the shannon wiener index hʹ 0 48 in 2016 about 20 of the whole lake area was occupied by macrophytes the largest area was covered by the communities of reed phragmitetum australis eurasian watermilfoil myriophylletum spicati as well as white and yellow water lilies nupharo nymphaeetum albae communities the plant cover ranged between 60 and 95 phragmites australis formed the first strip of littoral the closest from the shore except areas subjected to strong human pressure the biggest patches of submerged macrophytes were observed in the southern part of the lake which were created by eurasian watermilfoil myriophyllum spicatum in the form of randomly scattered clumps and at the inflow of dojca river in the inflow zone numerous patches of nympheid and elodeids occurred created by yellow and white water lilies and hornwort ceratophyllum demersum community which indicate the high water trophy supplying the basin 3 2 loads of nutrients the total load of nutrients arriving in lake wolsztyńskie from direct catchment point and atmospheric sources was 1 877 kg p and 17 137 kg n table 6 which can be converted to 1 5 g p m 2 y 1 and 13 8 g n m 2 y 1 at the moment the actual load of phosphorus in lake wolsztyńskie is about 12 fold higher than the ones deemed as tolerable by the ecosystem 157 4 kg y 1 fig 8 about 86 of the phosphorus load is brought in by the dojca river 1 614 kg hence any efforts to restore the quality of the lake water will be either futile or producing short lived effects unless this source of pollution is eliminated 4 discussion the efforts undertaken to reduce the productivity of waters in lake wolsztyńskie which consisted in dosing ferrous coagulant pix 113 and aluminium pax 18 one to water in 2005 2006 and then iron chloride directly to the bottom sediments in 2012 2013 did not bring about permanent improvement of the water quality a distinct decline in primary productivity was only noted during the application of coagulants after which the productivity in the lake waters rose again as evidenced by the high content of chlorophyll a fig 9 the total phosphorus content increased as well fig 10 a bad state of waters in lake wolsztyńskie was confirmed also by biological indicators high phytoplankton biomass throughout the growth season was characteristic of persistent blooms in nutrient rich waters as well as water bodies having poor ecological status napiórkowska krzebietke and dunalska 2015 seasonal growth pattern of phytoplankton with two peaks was similar to the original plankton ecology group peg model typical of eutrophic waters sommer et al 1986 spring phytoplankton assemblages were dominated by diatoms over 60 simultaneously with a high share of cyanobacteria over 30 summer and autumn intense blooms formed toxic or potentially toxic cyanobacteria which are typical of more nutrient rich polish lakes kobos et al 2013 dominant cyanobacteria represent functional groups s1 h1 and lm which according to reynolds et al 2002 and padisák et al 2009 are typical of turbid mixed environments with shade adaptation eutrophic stratified and shallow lakes with low nitrogen content or even eutrophic to hypertrophic small to medium sized lakes zooplankton indices of trophic state tsirot and tsicr based on two taxonomic groups rotifera and crustacea also confirmed the eutrophic character of waters in lake wolsztyńskie the rotifer trophic state index tsirot 60 84 indicated as highly eutrophic lake whereas crustacean trophic state index tsicr 51 69 indicated as highly meso eutrophic lake the increasing density of zooplankton from spring to summer maximum in august 2668 in dm 3 is also characteristic of eutrophic lakes according to the model elaborated by plankton ecology group i e model peg the low water quality in lake wolsztyńskie has also had a direct impact on the flora currently in the lake dominate rush species with a small proportion of submerged macrophytes including the absence of sensitive species particularly charophytes on the one hand high cover of hornwort at the inflow zone of dojca river to the lake can play as a filter for purifying pollutions supplying to the lake through temporary uptake by plants jeppesen et al 1997 blindow et al 2002 and indirectly by creating a niche for the development of zooplankton muylaert et al 2010 on the other hand high turnover rate of hornwort during vegetation season may result the secondary nutrient release to water and thus may intensify the eutrophication process currently despite the high level of commitment of local authorities to improve the water quality of lake wolsztyńskie and incurred large financial investment the lake does not meet the requirements of the water framework directive 2000 60 ec as to the good status of water body the high productivity in lake wolsztyńskie is maintained by the flux of nutrients mainly from the dojca river 86 of the phosphorus load elimination of this source of pollution is the necessary condition for attaining lasting improvement of the water quality in this lake unfortunately a large total catchment area of the dojca river 269 km2 a large number of diffuse sources of pollution including the fish farms and many administrative units managing this territory all this makes impossible to cut off effectively all sources of pollution directly in the catchment in this situation the protective activities should be done in the lake shore therefore analyzing the hydrological conditions landscape relief as well as economic and environmental conditions it seems that a possible solution lies in re directing the dojca river waters directly to the outflow from lake wolsztyńskie to this end the flow of water needs to be dammed at the mouth of the river with a watertight wall ca 250 m in length thus the river water would flow along the shoreline zone of the western part of the lake to its outflow in order to separate river from lake waters it would be recommended to mount watertight barriers in the inflow shoreline and outflow zones the water balance in lake wolsztyńskie is in the equilibrium state now in the hydrological year 2015 2016 the groundwater recharge volume was 85 230 m3 i e less than 1 on the income side of the balance wiśniewski 2016 if the whole water supply from the surface runoffs was cut off the water surface level in the lake would not be decreased owing to the groundwater supply in order to ensure the hydrological security of lake wolsztyńskie it is necessary to design a gate valve in the place of the current inflow and outflow of the dojca river which would allow the water level in the lake to be regulated during extreme events as an additional solution it can be the redirection of the pre treated water from the separated shoreline zone to the lake in its southern part instead of direct water flow to the outflow the best material for manufacturing the barrier profiles would be the modern system of pvc partitions dunalska et al 2015 dunalska and wiśniewski 2016 in lake wolsztyńskie the barrier profiles should be mounted from the water side so as not to damage the shore belt of reeds which could act as a biotic wastewater pre treatment facility a natural by pass ditch should help to cut off point sources of pollution i e the dojca river st 1 the inflows in the northern st 2 and south western parts of the lake st 8 area and non point sources of pollution in the whole northern southern and western parts of the lake and rainwater once the western shores of the lake are urbanized fig 11 such actions will allow us to eliminate as much as 92 of the phosphorus load and 84 of the nitrogen load originating from area sources in the western side of the lake and three surface inflows table 7 having cut off the dojca river the phosphorus load will decrease from 1877 kg to 156 kg and the share of the inflows in the supply of this element will represent just 27 and will be even lower than the contribution made by atmospheric pollution 35 when the sewerage system is made leak proof and pollutants from the inflow in the north western part of the lake are cut off st 5 the share of the point sources of pollution will be minimal such significant reduction in amounts of allochthonous pollutants creates an actual opportunity to conduct appropriate restoration treatments in the lake bowl and to maintain low productivity of waters in lake wolsztyńskie taking into account the lake morphometry and the physicochemical parameters of water the phosphorus inactivation and biomanipulation as a next step are recommended these actions would also allow us to reduce the internal load of nutrients from the bottom sediments what is necessary to achieve the long lasting positive effects 5 conclusions although in theory the methods of restoration were selected correctly for this type of a water body and implemented under the supervision of experienced scientific teams no lasting improvement of environmental conditions was achieved in practice the research results provide evidence that it is impossible to attain improved water quality in a flow through lake without eliminating the influx of water from allochthonous sources of pollution a question arises whether it is reasonable economically and socially to conduct lake restoration treatments limited exclusively to the lake bowl even though the local authorities and community put enormous pressure to do so as they are interested in creating an attractive site for tourism and recreation should not we rather educate them first about the causes and consequences of lake degradation it is fundamental to implement at the first step adequate protective measures in the lake s catchment and shoreline zone the restoration treatments in the lake itself should be the final step in this process currently the intensive growth of environmental engineering biotechnology and ecohydrology creates immense opportunities to improve the water quality whilst reducing the costs involved the integration of the above actions with the concept of ecosystem goods and services can be a very important tool for the management of water resources conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was

1149,the determination of a proper minimum environmental flow in a river basin is one of the most critical components of sustainable water resources management with hydraulic and habitat modelling being the most advance methods for that analysis the present study illustrates the ecohydraulic modelling of nestos river delta at the deltaic zone of a heavily modified watershed under various low flow scenarios using the river2d model river2d is a two dimensional depth averaged hydrodynamic and fish habitat model widely used in environmental flow assessment studies a detailed digital model of the river channel and its surrounding area was developed including all the morphological characteristics of the river channel as well as its various sandy islets field surveys in combination with digital elevation model data were used for the development of the digital terrain used as input to river2d model several different steady state hydraulic simulations were conducted under typical low flow conditions producing water depth and water velocity direction and magnitude maps for each discharge scenario while results were verified with the use of field measurements in the next step river2d was used for the fish habitat modelling of the study area with the application of fish preference curves developed specifically for the study area finally the fish habitat modelling was conducted for four different fish species divided into two age groups forced under the same five typical low flow conditions results reveal that the ecohydraulic modelling of river basins should be considered as an indispensable component in sustainable water resources management keywords ecohydraulic modelling river2d minimum environmental flow requirement fish habitats nestos river 1 introduction water is the main source of life for humans and the natural environment as it is the most important natural resource on earth gleick 1993 in recent decades climate change and human socio economic developments altered significantly the hydrologic cycle threatening the sufficient supply of good water quality the aquatic ecosystem health and the biodiversity of river systems vörösmarty et al 2010 jacobsen et al 2012 van vliet et al 2013 in river systems their health and viability depend on flow regime hydraulic flow rates and geometric characteristics of the main riverbed and riparian zone natural or artificial barriers along the river the appearance of natural or artificial flood events etc in view of the above increasing importance is given to the assessment of the minimum environmental flow requirement efr of the rivers and to its redefinition under conditions of climate change and water deficiency vörösmarty et al 2010 kirby et al 2014 the efr is defined as the minimum quantity time availability and quality of river runoff required to ensure the protection of internal and transitional ecosystems as well as the sustainable presence and development of humans whose activities depend on these ecosystems brisbane declaration 2007 corresponding conditions for minimal environmental excursion include ecologic flow ecologically acceptable flow regime and instream flow especially for heavily modified aquatic systems the required environmental flow is a key component of the environmental measures taken during the dam s operational phase in this case environmental discharge typically refers to the maintenance of a minimum flow downstream of dams fixed or seasonally changing with the aim of protecting downstream aquatic ecosystems however it is a fact that environmental discharge introduces restrictions on the operation of reservoirs as it reduces their yieldable capacity due to the restrain of part of the stored volume for environmental use but also because it imposes a different outflow schedule in relation to energy production planning thus the assessment of the minimum required environmental discharge involves two stages assessing the theoretical needs of ecosystems along the river and its estuaries in terms of quantity quality and time availability of the flow and adapting the operation of dams to meet these needs under existing technical and management constraints water uses aim of the present study is the implementation of a coupled hydraulic and habitat modeling of nestos river northern greece under various low flow conditions serving for the analysis and the ultimate determination of environmental flow at this sensitive river zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the nestos river is an important ecosystem for the wider region of both greece and the balkans in general the river basin has a significant geopolitical position with nestos being a transnational river with a watershed shared by greece and bulgaria the nestos river or mesta in bulgaria springs from rila mountains in bulgaria and flows into the thracian sea the total length of the river is 234 km of which 134 km and an area of 2429 km2 or approximately 40 of the total 6130 km2 of river s basin are in greek territory fig 1 the national importance of nestos river is great as its waters cover the irrigation water requirements for a large part of northern greece and after the construction of the hydroelectric dams in its catchment area the river is also of particular importance in the country s energy balance in addition the ecological importance of the area is also great as the river basin is an important habitat for many flora and fauna species the ecological significance of nestos basin is also evidenced by the inclusion of two areas nestos gorges area and the nestos deltaic zone in the natura 2000 network boskidis et al 2011 during the early 1990s thissavros and platanovrisi dams 170 m and 95 m in height respectively were constructed in nestos river course by the greek public power corporation s a at a distance of 30 and 45 km from the greek bulgarian borders for energy production and water supply for irrigation needs in the area the system of these two dams regulates the flow of the river throughout the year moreover an irrigation dam was constructed since 1950s near toxotes village distributing parts of river water to the irrigation networks of west and east nestos delta plain the present study focuses on the section of the river flowing downstream of the toxotes dam up to the river mouth this section runs through the nestos delta area and supports the riparian forest of kotza orman but also many fish species entering the river from the sea and then entrapped due to the presence of toxotes dam 2 2 model description for the mathematical simulation of habitats in the study area the river2d model was used it is a two dimensional model for the hydrodynamic and habitat simulation developed specifically for use in natural streams and rivers it is a finite element model based on the petrov galerkin method of mass and energy conservation and it is capable to resolve subcritical supercritical and wet dry areas the model has been developed by the university of alberta usa and has been used in various studies and works worldwide ghanem et al 1996 waddle et al 1996 the hydrodynamic simulation module is based on the two dimensional st venant equations and the volume continuity equation these three equations produce the spatio temporal variability of water stage and the two components of the momentum vector steffler blackburn 2002 for the fish habitat modeling the river2d model uses the weighted usable area wua methodology bovee 1982 wua was calculated as the sum of the composite suitability index csi with a range of 0 0 1 0 estimated at each point of the computational grid and the tributary region associated with each point in the river2d model these points are the computational nodes of the finite element mesh and the tributary regions are the thiessen polygons that surround the area near the node steffler blackburn 2002 the csi index for each node was estimated as a combination of separate depth and speed ratios the suitability index for each parameter was evaluated by the linear interpolation from an approximate fitness curve for each item water velocities and depths at each point were provided by the hydrodynamic simulation of the model 2 3 model parameterization the river2d model requires as input data a detailed topographic model of the study area in the form of xyz points where x and y denote the geographic coordinates and z the altitude of the point above mean sea level according to the above requirements and for the purposes of the present study a detailed digital elevation model was created for the nestos river section downstream of the toxotes dam and up to the river mouth using data from field surveys and an existing low resolution digital elevation model specifically all river features such as banks islets simulation boundaries were mapped fig 2 presents a distinctive picture of the mapping process of the river features red with the river banks with blue islets and with gray simulation boundaries with the use of field survey data the google earth program and the tcx converter tool a very large number of xyz points 7000 points were produced representing river s topography and its features these points were introduced into the river2d model through the river2d bed routine for the creation of the digital terrain of the river and the appropriate input background for the continuation of the simulation process then the digital elevation model produced by the above process was consequently inserted into the river2d mesh routine to proceed with the finite element calculation and produce the study area mesh fig 3 shows the final computational grid created for the entire study area while fig 3b illustrates a detailed example of the creation of a computational grid for a deltaic zone of the nestos river an index of the quality of the generated mesh is the mesh quality index qi index of the r2d mesh routine this index is calculated as the ratio of the area of a triangle of the grid to the circumference of the circumscribed circle of the particular triangle the minimum value of this ratio from all the triangles of the mesh characterizes the quality of the overall mesh an ideal mesh would have a qi index equal to the unit however under realistic conditions the acceptable values of qi index for simulation needs range from 0 15 to 0 5 waddle steffler 2002 in the case of nestos river the qi index was 0 16 while the mesh consisted of 86 272 nodes in total regarding the computational boundaries of the model the embarkments at the sides of the river were mapped and used as the no flow boundaries the simulated discharge with values of 3 m3 s 5 m3 s 7 m3 s 10 m3 s and 15 m3 s was used as the initial inflow boundary condition while the outflow condition was given as the corresponding water surface elevation of each discharge as measured during field surveys a unified bed roughness height ks value of 0 1 indicative of the hydraulic characteristics of the sandy river bed was applied to the study area in situ measurements of discharge water depth and water velocity in three locations alongside the river fig 4 were used for the calibration of the model in a range of discharges from 3 m3 s to 23 m3 s fig 5 displays the correlation between the observed and the simulated values of water depth fig 5a and water velocity fig 5b indicating that the model can simulate the hydraulic characteristics of the study area the same conclusion can be drawn from table 1 with the statistics of the correlation data in particular the coefficient of determination of the water depth and the water velocity was 0 976 and 0 947 respectively mean absolute error mae for the same parameters was 0 017 and 0 050 while root mean square error rmse values was 0 019 and 0 072 3 results 3 1 hydraulic modelling results for the needs of the hydraulic simulation of the study area different scenarios were created to examine the hydraulic behavior of the river especially in low flow conditions for this purpose hydraulic simulations were made for discharges of 3 m3 s 5 m3 s 7 m3 s 10 m3 s and 15 m3 s this range of discharge values were monitored during field surveys in nestos river delta and are indicative for simulations under river low flow conditions boskidis et al 2011 kamidis et al 2011 fig 6 shows indicative results from the hydraulic simulation forced with the above discharge values the figure focuses in an area of the river so that the differences of each scenario are distinct the color scale shows the depth of water in m while the arrow vectors show the direction and magnitude of water velocity in m s the red lines show the computational boundaries of

various flow scenarios while fig 9 shows the alteration of wua with the discharge for every fish species and age group as table 2 and fig 9 reveal all the fish species present an increase of their wua as the discharge increases with only the exception of a strymonicus adult population whose wua decreases under higher flows more specifically considering the river flow of 7 m3 s as the baseline flow median value of a historic discharge series the wua of a strymonicus adult decreases by 11 4 and 11 as discharge increases to 10 and 15 m3 s respectively the population of juveniles looses 1 2 and 18 8 of its wua as river flow decreases by 28 5 and 57 1 respectively an increase of base flow to 10 m3 s allows a minimal increase in the wua of a strymonicus juveniles for b strumicae adults the reduction of river flow to 5 and 3 m3 s reduces the habitat area by 2 and 25 8 respectively juveniles are more sensitive to low flow conditions thus their habitat appears decreased by 12 6 and 41 8 respectively the increase of baseflow to 10 and 15 m3 s will produce a higher wua by 1 6 and 4 5 for adult population and by 8 8 and 15 3 for the juveniles respectively similar low flow conditions of 5 and 3 m3 s reduce significantly the habitat area of r amarus adults by 5 and 26 1 respectively producing a marginal increase in habitat area as base flow changes to 10 and 15 m3 s respectively finally the wua of s orpheus exhibits significant reduction under low flow conditions 3 and 5 m3 s for both age groups adults and juveniles similarly the increase of base flow to 10 m3 s and 15 m3 s doubles the wua of both age groups overall river2d results illustrate that higher river flows improve the quality and quantity of fish habitat in the river while lower flows may stress it thus the determination of an appropriate minimum environmental flow is critical for the sustainable ecological management of the river 5 conclusion this study presented the ecohydraulic modelling of nestos river delta area under low flow regimes a detailed digital model of the study area was produced with the use of field survey data and digital elevation data river2d hydrodynamic and fish habitat model was then used for the simulation of the delta area in total five low flow conditions were simulated during the hydraulic modelling while during the fish habitat modelling suitability indices were produced for four fish species in two age groups under various river discharges the adults of a strymonicus showed an opposite behavior to river flow increasing their habitat area under low flows all other species and age groups exhibited similar behavior as river flow reduces s orpheus is the most sensitive species among adult age groups in terms of habitat area response to low river flow

1149,the determination of a proper minimum environmental flow in a river basin is one of the most critical components of sustainable water resources management with hydraulic and habitat modelling being the most advance methods for that analysis the present study illustrates the ecohydraulic modelling of nestos river delta at the deltaic zone of a heavily modified watershed under various low flow scenarios using the river2d model river2d is a two dimensional depth averaged hydrodynamic and fish habitat model widely used in environmental flow assessment studies a detailed digital model of the river channel and its surrounding area was developed including all the morphological characteristics of the river channel as well as its various sandy islets field surveys in combination with digital elevation model data were used for the development of the digital terrain used as input to river2d model several different steady state hydraulic simulations were conducted under typical low flow conditions producing water depth and water velocity direction and magnitude maps for each discharge scenario while results were verified with the use of field measurements in the next step river2d was used for the fish habitat modelling of the study area with the application of fish preference curves developed specifically for the study area finally the fish habitat modelling was conducted for four different fish species divided into two age groups forced under the same five typical low flow conditions results reveal that the ecohydraulic modelling of river basins should be considered as an indispensable component in sustainable water resources management keywords ecohydraulic modelling river2d minimum environmental flow requirement fish habitats nestos river 1 introduction water is the main source of life for humans and the natural environment as it is the most important natural resource on earth gleick 1993 in recent decades climate change and human socio economic developments altered significantly the hydrologic cycle threatening the sufficient supply of good water quality the aquatic ecosystem health and the biodiversity of river systems vörösmarty et al 2010 jacobsen et al 2012 van vliet et al 2013 in river systems their health and viability depend on flow regime hydraulic flow rates and geometric characteristics of the main riverbed and riparian zone natural or artificial barriers along the river the appearance of natural or artificial flood events etc in view of the above increasing importance is given to the assessment of the minimum environmental flow requirement efr of the rivers and to its redefinition under conditions of climate change and water deficiency vörösmarty et al 2010 kirby et al 2014 the efr is defined as the minimum quantity time availability and quality of river runoff required to ensure the protection of internal and transitional ecosystems as well as the sustainable presence and development of humans whose activities depend on these ecosystems brisbane declaration 2007 corresponding conditions for minimal environmental excursion include ecologic flow ecologically acceptable flow regime and instream flow especially for heavily modified aquatic systems the required environmental flow is a key component of the environmental measures taken during the dam s operational phase in this case environmental discharge typically refers to the maintenance of a minimum flow downstream of dams fixed or seasonally changing with the aim of protecting downstream aquatic ecosystems however it is a fact that environmental discharge introduces restrictions on the operation of reservoirs as it reduces their yieldable capacity due to the restrain of part of the stored volume for environmental use but also because it imposes a different outflow schedule in relation to energy production planning thus the assessment of the minimum required environmental discharge involves two stages assessing the theoretical needs of ecosystems along the river and its estuaries in terms of quantity quality and time availability of the flow and adapting the operation of dams to meet these needs under existing technical and management constraints water uses aim of the present study is the implementation of a coupled hydraulic and habitat modeling of nestos river northern greece under various low flow conditions serving for the analysis and the ultimate determination of environmental flow at this sensitive river zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the nestos river is an important ecosystem for the wider region of both greece and the balkans in general the river basin has a significant geopolitical position with nestos being a transnational river with a watershed shared by greece and bulgaria the nestos river or mesta in bulgaria springs from rila mountains in bulgaria and flows into the thracian sea the total length of the river is 234 km of which 134 km and an area of 2429 km2 or approximately 40 of the total 6130 km2 of river s basin are in greek territory fig 1 the national importance of nestos river is great as its waters cover the irrigation water requirements for a large part of northern greece and after the construction of the hydroelectric dams in its catchment area the river is also of particular importance in the country s energy balance in addition the ecological importance of the area is also great as the river basin is an important habitat for many flora and fauna species the ecological significance of nestos basin is also evidenced by the inclusion of two areas nestos gorges area and the nestos deltaic zone in the natura 2000 network boskidis et al 2011 during the early 1990s thissavros and platanovrisi dams 170 m and 95 m in height respectively were constructed in nestos river course by the greek public power corporation s a at a distance of 30 and 45 km from the greek bulgarian borders for energy production and water supply for irrigation needs in the area the system of these two dams regulates the flow of the river throughout the year moreover an irrigation dam was constructed since 1950s near toxotes village distributing parts of river water to the irrigation networks of west and east nestos delta plain the present study focuses on the section of the river flowing downstream of the toxotes dam up to the river mouth this section runs through the nestos delta area and supports the riparian forest of kotza orman but also many fish species entering the river from the sea and then entrapped due to the presence of toxotes dam 2 2 model description for the mathematical simulation of habitats in the study area the river2d model was used it is a two dimensional model for the hydrodynamic and habitat simulation developed specifically for use in natural streams and rivers it is a finite element model based on the petrov galerkin method of mass and energy conservation and it is capable to resolve subcritical supercritical and wet dry areas the model has been developed by the university of alberta usa and has been used in various studies and works worldwide ghanem et al 1996 waddle et al 1996 the hydrodynamic simulation module is based on the two dimensional st venant equations and the volume continuity equation these three equations produce the spatio temporal variability of water stage and the two components of the momentum vector steffler blackburn 2002 for the fish habitat modeling the river2d model uses the weighted usable area wua methodology bovee 1982 wua was calculated as the sum of the composite suitability index csi with a range of 0 0 1 0 estimated at each point of the computational grid and the tributary region associated with each point in the river2d model these points are the computational nodes of the finite element mesh and the tributary regions are the thiessen polygons that surround the area near the node steffler blackburn 2002 the csi index for each node was estimated as a combination of separate depth and speed ratios the suitability index for each parameter was evaluated by the linear interpolation from an approximate fitness curve for each item water velocities and depths at each point were provided by the hydrodynamic simulation of the model 2 3 model parameterization the river2d model requires as input data a detailed topographic model of the study area in the form of xyz points where x and y denote the geographic coordinates and z the altitude of the point above mean sea level according to the above requirements and for the purposes of the present study a detailed digital elevation model was created for the nestos river section downstream of the toxotes dam and up to the river mouth using data from field surveys and an existing low resolution digital elevation model specifically all river features such as banks islets simulation boundaries were mapped fig 2 presents a distinctive picture of the mapping process of the river features red with the river banks with blue islets and with gray simulation boundaries with the use of field survey data the google earth program and the tcx converter tool a very large number of xyz points 7000 points were produced representing river s topography and its features these points were introduced into the river2d model through the river2d bed routine for the creation of the digital terrain of the river and the appropriate input background for the continuation of the simulation process then the digital elevation model produced by the above process was consequently inserted into the river2d mesh routine to proceed with the finite element calculation and produce the study area mesh fig 3 shows the final computational grid created for the entire study area while fig 3b illustrates a detailed example of the creation of a computational grid for a deltaic zone of the nestos river an index of the quality of the generated mesh is the mesh quality index qi index of the r2d mesh routine this index is calculated as the ratio of the area of a triangle of the grid to the circumference of the circumscribed circle of the particular triangle the minimum value of this ratio from all the triangles of the mesh characterizes the quality of the overall mesh an ideal mesh would have a qi index equal to the unit however under realistic conditions the acceptable values of qi index for simulation needs range from 0 15 to 0 5 waddle steffler 2002 in the case of nestos river the qi index was 0 16 while the mesh consisted of 86 272 nodes in total regarding the computational boundaries of the model the embarkments at the sides of the river were mapped and used as the no flow boundaries the simulated discharge with values of 3 m3 s 5 m3 s 7 m3 s 10 m3 s and 15 m3 s was used as the initial inflow boundary condition while the outflow condition was given as the corresponding water surface elevation of each discharge as measured during field surveys a unified bed roughness height ks value of 0 1 indicative of the hydraulic characteristics of the sandy river bed was applied to the study area in situ measurements of discharge water depth and water velocity in three locations alongside the river fig 4 were used for the calibration of the model in a range of discharges from 3 m3 s to 23 m3 s fig 5 displays the correlation between the observed and the simulated values of water depth fig 5a and water velocity fig 5b indicating that the model can simulate the hydraulic characteristics of the study area the same conclusion can be drawn from table 1 with the statistics of the correlation data in particular the coefficient of determination of the water depth and the water velocity was 0 976 and 0 947 respectively mean absolute error mae for the same parameters was 0 017 and 0 050 while root mean square error rmse values was 0 019 and 0 072 3 results 3 1 hydraulic modelling results for the needs of the hydraulic simulation of the study area different scenarios were created to examine the hydraulic behavior of the river especially in low flow conditions for this purpose hydraulic simulations were made for discharges of 3 m3 s 5 m3 s 7 m3 s 10 m3 s and 15 m3 s this range of discharge values were monitored during field surveys in nestos river delta and are indicative for simulations under river low flow conditions boskidis et al 2011 kamidis et al 2011 fig 6 shows indicative results from the hydraulic simulation forced with the above discharge values the figure focuses in an area of the river so that the differences of each scenario are distinct the color scale shows the depth of water in m while the arrow vectors show the direction and magnitude of water velocity in m s the red lines show the computational boundaries of the simulation while the white areas are the areas not covered by water during each scenario in the nestos river deltaic zone at the vicinity of river mouth water depth curves were created for the different flow scenarios fig 7 a b these curves show the change in depth of the river and consequently in the cross sectional area in relation to the change in its flow 3 2 fish habitat modeling
