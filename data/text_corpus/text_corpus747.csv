3735,understanding the controlling factors for variations of precipitation isotopes is essential for accurate interpretation of isotope based paleoclimate proxy data as well as better apprehension of the hydrological cycle these are particularly important for ethiopia an arid region and important location for studying human evolution past studies have established the importance of moisture source on isotopic variation in precipitation but few studies have identified exact moisture sources and quantified their contributions in this study we use a lagrangian moisture diagnostic technique and daily precipitation isotope data collected at debre markos on the northwest ethiopian highland to quantify the contributions of different moisture sources to precipitation we also quantitatively establish the relative importance of local climate conditions climate conditions of moisture uptake locations and different moisture sources on the isotopic variation in precipitation at the study site our results show that recycled continental moisture from adjacent areas is the most dominant moisture source throughout the year 67 and its contribution is higher in the wet season 79 than in the dry season 56 secondary moisture sources include the southern indian ocean 16 for the wet season and the northern indian ocean 14 for the dry season based on correlation analyses we find that the most important control over the precipitation isotopic variation is the convective intensity at both the study site and the moisture uptake locations strong connective activities are linked to low isotopic values and the seasonal movement of the deep convection region could explain the seasonal precipitation δ18o patterns with low values in the wet season and high values in the dry season other climate factors that affect the isotopic composition of precipitation include local temperature relative humidity rainfall amount as well as total rainout along the trajectories and relative humidity at moisture uptake locations our study could provide new perspectives for interpreting δ18o based paleoclimate proxies in this region as well as crucial information for understanding hydrocliamte processes in a region where sustainable water resources are of particular importance for socioeconomic development keywords precipitation isotope moisture source ethiopia hysplit 1 introduction paleoclimate studies from geologic archives give us perspectives for future climate change to reconstruct paleoclimate using isotope proxy records it is vital to understand the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation isotopes and the relative importance of competing controlling factors in the modern climate system this understanding is essential for interpreting terrestrial oxygen isotope proxy data obtained from a variety of sources such as lake sediments e g marshall et al 2009 speleothems e g asrat et al 2007 soil carbonates e g aronson et al 2008 and fossil tooth enamel e g bedaso et al 2013 previous studies have established several climate and environmental factors that control precipitation isotopic variations including temperature dansgaard 1964 elevation gonfiantini et al 2001 seasonality dansgaard 1964 bedaso and wu 2020 source of moisture putman et al 2017 balagizi et al 2018 and air mass transport history soderberg et al 2013 in the tropics previous studies have commonly considered the amount effect a negative correlation between precipitation isotopes and rainfall amount dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 as the dominant controlling factor however many studies have recently challenged the association of high rainfall amount and lower precipitation isotope values and further cautioned the interpretation of paleoclimate data based solely on this relationship lemma et al 2020 bedaso et al 2020 therefore exploring other competing factors and quantifying their effect on precipitation isotope could improve the interpretation of continental paleoclimate isotope proxy derived from rainfall hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o isotopes are valuable tracers to examine atmospheric and hydrological processes that control precipitation isotopes from source to sink gat 1996 they have been used in previous studies to investigate the impact of such processes as moisture source location and conditions at source region moisture transport trajectories and climate conditions along the trajectories weather systems that generate precipitation sub cloud evaporation and local weather conditions burnett et al 2004 uemura et al 2008 vachon et al 2010 krklec and domínguez villar 2014 heydarizad et al 2019 salamalikis et al 2016 bedaso et al 2020 such studies have been facilitated with the development of hysplit back trajectory analysis draxler 2011 and moisture source diagnostic techniques sodemann et al 2008 as well as the increasing availability of spatial and temporal precipitation isotopes data besides δ2h and δ18o d excess a derived isotopic variable defined as d excess δ2h 818o dansgaard 1964 has been successfully used to infer moisture source conditions and atmospheric processes in different geographic locations e g the arctic kurita 2011 southern australia guan et al 2013 eastern africa levin et al 2009 otte et al 2017 and quantifying recycled moisture in china kong et al 2013 the global average precipitation d excess 10 craig 1961 is attributed to direct moisture from the ocean when evaporated at 81 relative humidity and 25 c merlivat and jouzel 1979 continental evaporated water sources are characterized by relatively higher d excess 10 and d excess is inversely related to relative humidity dansgaard 1964 in addition to paleoclimate implications understanding seasonal moisture source variability and quantitative estimates of relative contribution to precipitation sources are also vital to evaluate effects of climate change on precipitation trenberth 2011 determine water availability and predict agriculture productivity rosell and holmer 2007 this is particularly important for the east african region where rainfall patterns are highly complex and variable nicholson 2017 and the local economy is based on rainfed subsistence farming in particular ethiopia highlands are the source of the blue nile and considered as the water tower of east africa unep 2010 understanding the links among moisture source precipitation and water resources bedaso and wu 2021 for this area has great implications for the sustainability of water resources of the east african region as a whole previous studies suggested that the ethiopian highlands obtain moisture from multiple sources including the atlantic and indian oceans the mediterranean the red sea and central africa williams et al 2012 viste and sorteberg 2013 these sources may have potential effects on the isotopic composition of precipitation in ethiopia and the rest of east africa e g levin et al 2009 soderberg et al 2013 balagizi et al 2018 levin et al 2009 highlighted the importance of transpired moisture from the sudd and congo basins as a likely moisture source that results in 18o enriched rainfall in ethiopian highlands whereas joseph et al 1992 attributed this 18o enrichment to the first condensation of water from either the red sea or the equatorial indian ocean more recently bedaso et al 2020 alluded to the importance of change of moisture source and trajectory as an important control over seasonal isotopic variations the authors suggested that moisture derived from the south corresponded to depleted isotopic composition in the wet season and moisture from north and east led to enriched composition during the rest of the year although these studies have provided an overall picture they are largely qualitative and mostly based only on the analysis of wind direction and air mass trajectories without consideration of actual moisture flux therefore in this study we attempt to quantify contributions from different moisture sources by adopting a lagrangian moisture diagnostic technique using the daily precipitation isotope data collected at debre markos located in the northwest highland of ethiopia this paper aims to achieve two major objectives 1 identify actual moisture uptake locations quantify their contributions to precipitation at the site and examine seasonal variations of moisture sources 2 quantify the relative importance of local climate conditions climate conditions of moisture uptake locations and different moisture sources on the isotopic variation in precipitation at the study site 2 data and methods 2 1 study area this study is conducted in ethiopia located in eastern africa within 3 15 n latitude 33 48 e longitude fig 1 a it focuses on the northwestern ethiopian highland where the precipitation samples were collected at debre markos 10 3 n 37 7 e alt 2446 m fig 1b a station located in the central part of the nw highland rainfall in ethiopia shows complex patterns with large seasonal to decadal variability in different regions of the country seleshi and zanke 2004 this spatial and temporal rainfall distribution is largely controlled by the north south movement of the tropical rain belt associated with the intertropical convergent zone itcz nicholson 2018 over ethiopia s varying topography fig 1a and 1b the itcz movement gives rise to a bimodal rainfall pattern in the south and a unimodal pattern in the northern part of the country debre markos experiences subtropical highland climate cwb based on the climate data for debre markos from 1960 to 2015 the average annual temperature is 15 c with small seasonal variations the warmest month typically occurs in april with an average temperature of 18 1 c the coolest month is usually august with an average temperature of 14 2 c the average amount of annual precipitation is 1340 mm with 158 rainy days per year it is characterized by a unimodal rainfall pattern centered in july and august the june to september rainy season traditionally known as kiremt accounts for two thirds of the annual precipitation and rainy days the rest of the year is considered as dry season degefu 1987 fig 1c throughout the year the northwestern highlands of ethiopia are under the influence of different wind patterns which potentially bring moisture to the country from regions including the indian ocean the mediterranean and red seas central africa and the gulf of guinea viste and sorteberg 2013 2 2 precipitation isotope data a total of 197 daily precipitation samples were collected between august 2012 and september 2013 at debre markos meteorological station in the northwest highlands of ethiopia fig 1 with a custom made collection device composed of a funnel affixed to a plastic jug precipitation samples were collected every day before noon in days with a measurable rainfall amount of 0 2 mm enough for duplicate isotope measurement the volumetric amount of precipitation was documented with each sample collection the water samples were transferred to and stored in glass vials with polycone seal caps wrapped with parafilm to prevent evaporation samples were analyzed for isotope ratios δ2h and δ18o with a picarro l2130 i liquid water isotope analyzer via cavity ring down spectroscopy all isotopic analyses results were reported as the δ notation relative to the international standard of vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow in per mil with analytical precision of 0 1 for δ18o 0 4 for δ2h the external precision of d excess is calculated as 0 49 fröhlich et al 2001 detailed sample site selection criteria site description sample collection procedure isotope analysis and the isotope data are initially reported in bedaso et al 2020 as δ18o and δ2h show similar characteristics we only use δ18o values for our analyses d excess is used to track any deviation between δ18o and δ2h our previous study bedaso et al 2020 shows that precipitation isotopic composition at debre markos displays a distinct seasonal pattern with higher values enriched during the dry season and lower values depleted during the wet season fig 2 the wet season δ18o ranges from 10 9 to 4 4 with an amount weighted mean of 2 7 and standard deviation of 2 9 the dry season δ18o ranges from 5 3 to 10 3 with an amount weighted mean of 0 9 and standard deviation of 3 4 more details can be found in bedaso et al 2020 2 3 backward trajectories and climate data to investigate sources of moisture we used the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model draxler 2011 developed by the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to generate backward trajectories of air parcel based on the global data assimilation system gdas 0 5 degree climate data 10 day backward trajectories were calculated every six hours for all days between august 2012 and september 2013 from which trajectories ending with precipitation were selected for analysis the starting height of 1000 m above ground level agl was chosen to target the moisture rich air parcels wallace and hobbs 2006 in order to examine the impact of trajectory starting height on moisture source we ran the hysplit model at multiple heights and calculated the relative moisture contribution from different locations supplementary material s1 the results show that different starting heights yielded similar spatial distribution of moisture sources along each trajectory we extracted hourly location information of the air parcel latitude longitude and height together with its climate conditions including air temperature precipitation relative humidity specific humidity and pressure for local surface climate conditions we used ncep ncar reanalysis data downloaded from https psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep reanalysis html the reason we chose to use the ncep ncar reanalysis data for local climate conditions is because it also provides the climate data for gdas used by the hysplit model in this way when we compared the contributions from local and trajectory climate conditions we had higher confidence that the difference is not due to different datasets in addition we downloaded the daily outgoing longwave radiation olr data as a proxy for convective intensity from noaa https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data interp olr html olr data were also extracted for each of the hourly locations along all trajectories these climate data were used to identify the location and amount of moisture uptake and rainout along the trajectories and used to examine the correlation between isotopic composition and the climate conditions along the trajectories the hysplt software also contains a cluster analysis function that could combine trajectories into clusters based on their proximity and calculate the cluster mean trajectories this function was used to derive major clusters for the wet and dry seasons for comparison several other temperature datasets were used including the debre markos meteorological station temperature data obtained from the national meteorology agency of ethiopia and the era interim reanalysis surface temperature data from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf downloaded from https apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full daily levtype sfc 2 4 identification of moisture uptake and rainout as a single air parcel travels along a trajectory it can gain moisture from surface evaporation uptake or lose moisture through precipitation rainout these are reflected in the change of specific humidity of the air parcel which can be used to identify and quantify moisture sources sodemann et al 2008 in this study we first calculate the change in specific humidity δ q at the interval of every six hours for all trajectories based on the following δ q q t q t 6 h where q refers to the specific humidity at certain time t since we are only interested in trajectories that end with precipitation in the target location we identify all precipitating air parcels when δ q t 0 0 and the relative humidity is greater than 80 r h t 0 80 for each of the precipitating parcels we then trace it backward to identify all locations of moisture uptake δ q 0 and rainout δ q 0 a n d r h 80 along trajectories for each of these locations we record δ q and other climate parameters for future analysis a single backward trajectory can have multiple moisture uptake and rainout locations 2 5 quantification of moisture source contributions the calculation of moisture source contribution is based on a method used in sodemann et al 2008 it follows several steps 1 we first sort all uptake and rainout locations along a trajectory based on time from the earliest end to the latest start point of the backward trajectory 2 at an uptake location n we calculate the initial uptake contribution fn as the fraction of the uptake amount δ q n to the moisture in the air parcel qn f n δ q n q n 3 as we move along the trajectory a new uptake reduces the importance of previous uptakes δ q m m n the contribution of all previous uptakes fm is then calculated as the ratio of previous uptake amount δ q m to the new moisture content qn of the air parcel f m δ q m q n m n 4 at a rainout location all previous moisture uptakes δ q m are discounted in proportion to the rainout amount δ q n as follows δ q m δ q m δ q n f m m n the discounted moisture uptake δ q m amount will be used in subsequent calculations in moisture contribution fm as we completed the entire trajectory each moisture uptake location would get a fraction contribution to the total precipitation at the target site properly discounted for subsequent moisture uptake and rainout we multiplied the fractions fm by the precipitation amount at the end of the trajectory to derive the amount of moisture contribution at each uptake location we then aggregated moisture contributions of all rain producing trajectories within a season by 1ox1o grid so that we could map out the spatial distribution of seasonal moisture sources to precipitation at the target locations 2 6 demarcation of moisture source regions based on the spatial distribution of moisture uptake locations we divide moisture sources into five major regions and summarize their individual moisture contributions to total precipitation in order to further quantify the moisture contribution from different source regions these regions are delineated as follows proximal continental pc ethiopia and surrounding countries of eritrea somalia kenya uganda south sudan and sudan south of 18on including the sudd north africa na regions north of pc and west of 43oe including the red sea and the mediterranean central africa ca regions west of pc and south of na including the congo basin north indian ocean nio regions east of pc and na and north of the equator south indian ocean sio regions east and of pc and ca and south of the equator 2 7 statistical methods we used correlation analysis to examine how the isotopic composition of precipitation was related to both the local climate conditions and the climate conditions of the moisture sources along the trajectories for each rainy day with isotope data we extracted temperature precipitation relative humidity and olr for the target location we also calculated the mean air temperature relative humidity and olr of all moisture uptake locations weighted by their moisture contributions as well as the total rainout amount for each trajectory we then performed the correlation analysis between the δ18o values and these local and trajectory climate variables to examine their impact correlation analysis is also used to examine the impact of different moisture sources for each rainy day with isotope values we calculated the percentage of moisture from different source regions and performed the correlation analysis between δ18o values and the percentage values from different sources in addition we used the multiple linear regression mlr to examine how much of the variance in δ18o values can be explained by local climate conditions trajectory climate conditions and moisture source the multiple regression model is set up as follows y a b i x i e where y is dependent variable δ18o values xi are explanatory variables a is the intercept bi are regression coefficients and e is the random error the mlr model is set up in five ways i using only moisture source variables i e percentage of moisture from pc na ca nio and sio ii using only local climate variables including local olr temperature relative humidity and precipitation amount iii using only trajectory climate variables including averaged trajectory olr temperature relatively humidity and total rainout iv using both local and trajectory climate variables and v using all variables the parameters were estimated with maximum likelihood method the statistical significance of the model is tested by the f test and the p values indicate the probabilities that null hypothesis is true i e there is no relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables r2 is calculated to assess the total model performance and compare the explanatory power of each group of variables we also established the relative importance of each explanatory variable by their independent contribution to the total r2 based on a statistical method proposed by genizi 1993 3 results 3 1 identification of major moisture source regions based on the methodology described in 2 4 and 2 5 we identified the location and amount of moisture uptake along the transport trajectories for all precipitation events at debra markos during the wet and dry seasons of the study period fig 3 fig 3 also displays rainy day trajectories in the wet and dry season their major clusters and the percentage of trajectories represented by each cluster during the wet season june september most of the air mass trajectories comes from the south and west moisture uptake occurs mostly from the indian ocean south the congo basin west as well as continental areas of central africa during the dry season air masses come from the north and northeast especially from november to march the transitional months of october april and may often contain trajectories from both north northwest and south southeast moisture uptake occurs largely at the red sea north the arabian sea northeast and the nearby continental region the moisture source contribution from these regions are summarized in table 1 on the annual basis the majority of the moisture 67 arriving at debre markos comes from proximal continental region the second most important moisture source region is the south indian ocean contributing about 16 of the annual moisture mostly during the wet season the third moisture source region is the north indian ocean the arabian sea contributing 14 of the moisture mostly during the dry season minor moisture source regions are central africa including the congo basin contributing about 2 of the total annual moisture mostly in the wet season and north africa including the red sea and the mediterranean contributing another 2 of total moisture mostly during the dry season in fig 3 it can be seen that moisture uptake does not occur evenly along the trajectories and trajectory frequencies don t necessarily indicate higher moisture contribution for example during the wet season although 57 of the trajectories originate in the sio this region only contributes about 18 of the total moisture in precipitation at debre markos during the dry season about 39 of the trajectories originate in the sio mostly during the transitional months but it contributes less only 14 of total moisture 3 2 impact of moisture source on isotopic composition of precipitation in order to quantitatively investigate how moisture source affect precipitation isotopic composition we performed a correlation analysis between precipitation δ18o at debre markos and the percentage of moisture for each of the source regions the results table 2 show that δ18o at debre markos is significantly correlated with percentage of moisture from ca pc sio and nio very few trajectories transport moisture from na and as a result their moisture contribution only shows a weak correlation with precipitation δ18o values a multiple regression model shows that contributions from different moisture sources could explain 22 of the variations in δ18o at debre markos p 0 01 3 3 impact of climate conditions on precipitation isotopes the correlation between the precipitation δ18o and a set of variables that describe both the local climate conditions at debra markos and the average climate conditions of the locations along the trajectory where moisture uptake occurs are shown in table 3 scatterplots between δ18o and these variables are provided in supplementary materials s2 the results show significant correlations between δ18o and olr surface temperature relative humidity and precipitation amount rainout locally δ18o is most significantly correlated with olr suggesting a strong control of local convection on the precipitation isotopic composition δ18o is also positively correlated with surface temperature the temperature effect and negatively correlated with local precipitation the amount effect and relative humidity with the exception of temperature the relationship between δ18o and those climate variables are similar along the trajectories but with even stronger correlations precipitation δ18o at debre markos is strongly influenced by the convective activities olr of all moisture uptake locations along the trajectories it is also negatively correlated with the mean relative humidity and total rainout along the trajectories trajectory temperature does not show any significant correlation with δ18o 3 4 relative importance of climate variables and moisture source using the multiple linear regression models we found that local climate conditions by themselves can explain 52 of the variability in δ18o climate conditions of moisture uptake locations along the trajectories can explain 40 of the δ18o variability moisture source can explain about 22 of δ18o variability since the climate variables are not completely independent of each other a combination of both local and trajectory climate variables explains 62 of the variability in δ18o once the local and trajectory climate conditions are accounted for moisture source variables only increase the model total r2 by 1 i e they added little explanatory power to the model more details of these regression models can be found in supplementary materials s3 the relative importance of the climate variables can be established by partitioning the total model r2 based on the independent contributions of each individual variables the results are shown in table 4 based on their partial r2 the most important controlling factor is local and trajectory olr accounting for 37 of the total variability in the precipitation isotopic composition local temperature is the second important factor that accounts for 17 of the isotope variability local and trajectory relative humidity can explain 5 of the isotope variability trajectory rainout accounts for 3 and amount effect only explains 1 of the total variability 4 discussion 4 1 climate controls over precipitation isotopes δ18o at debre markos displays a distinct seasonal pattern with depleted isotopic composition in the wet season and enriched in the dry season previously this pattern was commonly explained either by amount effect in the tropics dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 or the remoteness of moisture source and subsequent rainout effect e g tang et al 2015 however we found that amount effect has a relatively weak impact at debre markos accounting for only 1 of total variability of δ18o instead the predominant local influence is convective intensity as indicated by olr olr is measured as the top of the cloud temperature and serve as a proxy for convective intensity during the wet season day time land surface heating increases ground temperature and causes deep and strong convections that generate higher clouds the consequent lower temperature at which precipitation forms leads to depleted δ18o composition in addition precipitation isotope composition is also affected by temperature and relative humidity during the wet season temperature is lower because of evaporative cooling and the relative humidity is higher both factors could reduce the amount of sub cloud evaporation leading to lower δ18o values while d excess remains unaffected guan et al 2013 past studies suggest that the seasonal difference in isotopic values could also be caused by the difference in moisture source e g levin et al 2009 kebede and travi 2012 lemma et al 2020 they suggest that the depleted δ18o composition in the wet season is caused by the remoteness of moisture source from the south indian ocean and subsequent rainout effect and seasonal changes in moisture sources whereas bedaso et al 2020 suggested the importance of detailed analysis of both moisture source and processes along moisture transport path here in this study we show that climate conditions at moisture uptake locations along the trajectories rather than the remoteness of the source could have a significant impact on the precipitation isotopic composition at debre markos our results show that although many 57 backward trajectories for the wet season precipitation events extend to the indian ocean the majority 79 of moisture uptake occurs in the proximal continental pc region and only 18 of the moisture comes from the southern indian ocean sio the most significant climate factor controlling the δ18o values at debre markos is the convective intensity at those moisture uptake regions the depleted isotopic composition in the wet season are largely caused by regional convective activities fig 4 shows the regional olr for the wet season 4a and dry season 4b it can be seen that during the wet season debre markos is right in a zone of low olr indicating high convective intensity this zone also includes much of the pc and central africa ca which account for 75 of total moisture to dm precipitation in the wet season as a result δ18o is much lower in this season and it is also negatively correlated with the amount of moisture coming from pc r 0 33 p 0 01 and ca r 0 25 p 0 01 regions on the contrary sio has much higher olr with weaker convective activities moisture from sio has more enriched δ18o leading to a positive correlation r 0 21 p 0 01 between δ18o and the amount of moisture coming from sio during the dry season as the convective zone moves southward the overall olr in both the pc and nio regions which contribute about half of the seasonal moisture increases leading to enriched δ18o composition in addition to moisture source olr relative humidity of moisture uptake locations and the total rainout along the trajectories also influence the isotopic values at debre markos our analysis suggests that once the trajectory climate conditions are accounted for the actual moisture region per se does not provide additional explanatory power to δ18o variability in addition to δ18o precipitation d excess has been widely used as a tracer for moisture sources dansgaard 1964 clark and fritz 1997 d excess provides the degree of kinetic fractionation during evaporation in the source region as a function of relative humidity and other boundary layer conditions clark and fritz 1997 d excess can be further altered during moisture transport by the mixing of continental recycled water vapor derived from various sources through evaporation gat et al 1994 and by sub cloud evaporation i e reevaporation of raindrops during precipitation event in a relatively dry atmosphere gat 1996 and secondary evaporation after rainfall precipitation derived directly from ocean moisture sources that evaporated under humid conditions has a relatively low d excess close to the global average value of 10 craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 distillation of air parcels during moisture transport lower the δ18o values but d excess remains unaffected however vapor derived from recycled moisture evaporated under low humidity conditions would have a relatively high d excess craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 the relative high d excess values of debre markos precipitation also confirm the importance of recycled moisture as source of precipitation fig 2 table 2 it also shows a significant positive correlation with the percent of moisture from pc region r 0 33 p 0 01 therefore the higher d excess values in the wet season is likely linked to the higher percentage of moisture from pc region that accounts 79 of moisture during this season in addition d excess and δ18o could be further affected by local conditions after condensation such as sub cloud evaporation fig 5 displays the relationship between δ18o and d excess during the wet and dry seasons the data show a highly significant negative correlation r2 0 54 p 0 01 between δ18o and d excess during the dry season whereas the correlation is much weaker r2 0 10 p 0 01 although statistically significant during the wet season the dry season is usually associated with relatively low precipitation amount low humidity and higher temperature fig 2 these conditions could facilitate sub cloud evaporation leading to higher δ18o and lower d excess values during the dry season our result also shows a strong temperature effect on the δ18o variation at debre markos which is not commonly observed in previous studies in tropical regions in general temperature effect is not significant at low latitudes because of higher temperature hence weaker isotopic fractionation and lack of seasonality the lack of correlation between isotopic composition and mean annual temperature at low latitudes was reported by dansgaard 1964 but the correlation increases when daily data is used noone and simmonds 2002 although it was not consistently observed across different sites bedaso et al 2020 showed a significant positive correlation between daily δ18o and temperature at debre markos but no significant correlation when weekly and monthly data are used in order to evaluate the data uncertainties we compared several temperature datasets to confirm this effect including the ncep reanalysis surface used in this study the gdas climate data used for hysplit modeling temperature at 1000 m the debre markos meteorological station temperature data obtained from the national meteorology agency of ethiopia and the era interim reanalysis surface temperature data from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf although some difference exists in the strength of correlation all datasets show a statistically significant positive correlation between surface temperature and δ18o the correlation is very strong for both the station r 0 71 p 0 01 and ncep surface temperature data r 0 62 p 0 01 the correlation is weaker but still statistically significant for gdas 1000 m temperature r 0 36 p 0 01 and era interim surface temperature data r 0 35 p 0 01 therefore we believe the temperature effect on the precipitation isotopes is significant at debre markos and it is not a result of data uncertainties the observed temperature effect could likely be caused by three reasons first the use of daily isotopic data is likely to reveal this relationship that are otherwise not observed in monthly or annual datasets second based on our analysis fig 5 secondary evaporation is significant particularly in the dry season higher temperature increases secondary evaporation enriching the heavy isotopes in the remaining precipitation third due to its high elevation 2500 m debre markos has a highland subtropical climate with cooler temperatures than other tropical regions at similar latitudes as isotopic fractionation is more prominent at lower temperature this could enhance the temperature effect 4 2 moisture source and transport the precipitable vapor in debre markos is a mixture of adverted moisture from the ocean and regional recycled moisture the relative contribution of these moisture sources changes with the season leading to distinct seasonal patterns of precipitation isotopes fig 3c and 3d previous studies suggest that moisture for ethiopia mainly comes from the indian ocean to the east the arabian sea to the northeast the mediterranean and the red sea to the north the congo basin or even as far as the atlantic ocean to the west viste and sorteberg 2013 costa et al 2014 lemma et al 2021 however previous research has two major limitations first they used air mass trajectories as a proxy for locations of moisture source it is evident that not all trajectories produce precipitation and even with those with precipitation moisture uptake is not evenly distributed along the moisture trajectories second these studies only qualitatively identify possible moisture source without a quantitative assessment of how much actual moisture in fact comes from each source here we established a quantitative assessment of where moisture comes from our results show that most moisture for debre markos precipitation is recycled moisture from nearby continental regions pc accounting for 66 of the total annual moisture this percentage is higher in the wet season 79 and lower in the dry season 56 secondary moisture sources include the south indian ocean 16 mostly for the wet season and the arabian sea 14 mostly for the dry season a small amount of moisture comes from the red sea 2 during the dry season and from central africa including the congo basin 2 during the wet season almost no moisture comes from the atlantic ocean based on these results we developed a conceptual model along the moisture transport pathway showing important processes that potentially control seasonal precipitation δ18o and d excess values in deber markos fig 6 the ultimate sources of moisture for east african come the sio in the wet season and nio in the dry season however vapor advected from the ocean partially rains out along the moisture transport path and contributes water to continental recycled moisture the advected vapor also mix with recycled moisture along the transport pathway en route to the ethiopian highland progressive rainout and mixing of vapor would alter the δ18o and d excess values of precipitation along the moisture trajectory and eventually at debre markos for example during the wet season about 79 of the moisture is recycled moisture derived from the pc region in the pc region most of the moisture is picked up locally close to debre markos and along the ethio sudan border extending both to western ethiopia and the eastern half of south sudan in south sudan evapotranspiration from the sudd one of the largest wetlands in africa and seasonal swamps associated with overflooding of the white nile might have contributed vapor to the atmosphere mohamed et al 2006 evapotranspiration from such a large area of wetlands could impact microclimate mohamed et al 2006 and further increase rainfall downwind savenije 1995 at debre markos during the wet season southerly and westerly winds are dominant and carry moisture from the indian ocean and recycled moisture from the sudd and eastern part of south sudan fig 4a in addition moisture recycling can be enhanced by topography which blocks moisture from entering further inland van der ent et al 2010 and the ethiopian highlands could play a significant role to enhance moisture recycling in western ethiopia fig 6 the seasonal variation of δ18o and d excess values are also attributed to differences in atmospheric processes and climatic conditions along the moisture trajectory and locally in debre markos during the wet season high humidity and strong convective processes in the western half of the pc region including debre markos could be responsible for low δ18o and high d excess values in contrast in the dry season d excess values in debre markos are lower than the wet season the low d excess values in the dry season could be due to low humidity at debre markos which results in sub cloud evaporation during precipitation or direct moisture contribution from the nio fig 6 thus the isotopic composition of precipitation in debre markos is mainly controlled by local conditions moisture contribution from multiple sources and moisture transport processes along moisture trajectories overall our result agrees with previous studies e g cole et al 1999 vullie et al 2003 in suggesting the primary importance of atmospheric circulation pattern moisture source and climate conditions on the isotopic composition of precipitation but our study went further by presenting a quantitative investigation of the impact of these processes on precipitation isotopes in ethiopia including the impact of moisture sources seasonal moisture contributions local and trajectory climate conditions this helps to improve the interpretation of hydrogen and oxygen isotope based paleo proxy records e g ice core speleothems soil carbonates and contributes to our understanding of long term climate variability it also facilitates the use of isotopes in surface water and groundwater hydrological modelling studies especially in ungagged watersheds with limited to no long term monitoring data our study is limited by the short temporal coverage of our data to further understand interannual to decadal moisture variability and moisture dynamics in ethiopia it is imperative to establish multiple long term daily to weekly based precipitation isotope monitoring stations in different parts of the country 5 conclusion this study has two major objectives 1 identify moisture uptake locations quantify their contributions to precipitation and examine their seasonal variations for debre markos in the northwest ethiopian highlands 2 quantify the relative importance of local climate conditions climate conditions of moisture uptake locations and different moisture sources on the isotopic variation in precipitation at the study site we found that moisture trajectories change from dominantly south and southwest in the wet season to northeast in the dry season recycled continental moisture from the pc region is the most dominant moisture source throughout the year 67 and the percentage is higher in the wet season 79 than the dry season 56 secondary moisture sources include the sio for the wet season and the nio for the dry season our results show that the most important control over the precipitation isotopic variation is the convective intensity indicated by olr at both the study site and the moisture uptake locations strong connective activities are linked to low isotopic values and the seasonal movement of the deep convection region could explain the seasonal precipitation δ18o patterns with low values in the wet season and high values in the dry season other climate factors that affect the isotopic composition of precipitation include local temperature relative humidity rainfall amount as well as total rainout along the trajectories and relative humidity at moisture uptake locations our study could provide new perspectives for interpreting δ18o based paleoclimate proxies in this region as well as crucial information

3735,understanding the controlling factors for variations of precipitation isotopes is essential for accurate interpretation of isotope based paleoclimate proxy data as well as better apprehension of the hydrological cycle these are particularly important for ethiopia an arid region and important location for studying human evolution past studies have established the importance of moisture source on isotopic variation in precipitation but few studies have identified exact moisture sources and quantified their contributions in this study we use a lagrangian moisture diagnostic technique and daily precipitation isotope data collected at debre markos on the northwest ethiopian highland to quantify the contributions of different moisture sources to precipitation we also quantitatively establish the relative importance of local climate conditions climate conditions of moisture uptake locations and different moisture sources on the isotopic variation in precipitation at the study site our results show that recycled continental moisture from adjacent areas is the most dominant moisture source throughout the year 67 and its contribution is higher in the wet season 79 than in the dry season 56 secondary moisture sources include the southern indian ocean 16 for the wet season and the northern indian ocean 14 for the dry season based on correlation analyses we find that the most important control over the precipitation isotopic variation is the convective intensity at both the study site and the moisture uptake locations strong connective activities are linked to low isotopic values and the seasonal movement of the deep convection region could explain the seasonal precipitation δ18o patterns with low values in the wet season and high values in the dry season other climate factors that affect the isotopic composition of precipitation include local temperature relative humidity rainfall amount as well as total rainout along the trajectories and relative humidity at moisture uptake locations our study could provide new perspectives for interpreting δ18o based paleoclimate proxies in this region as well as crucial information for understanding hydrocliamte processes in a region where sustainable water resources are of particular importance for socioeconomic development keywords precipitation isotope moisture source ethiopia hysplit 1 introduction paleoclimate studies from geologic archives give us perspectives for future climate change to reconstruct paleoclimate using isotope proxy records it is vital to understand the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation isotopes and the relative importance of competing controlling factors in the modern climate system this understanding is essential for interpreting terrestrial oxygen isotope proxy data obtained from a variety of sources such as lake sediments e g marshall et al 2009 speleothems e g asrat et al 2007 soil carbonates e g aronson et al 2008 and fossil tooth enamel e g bedaso et al 2013 previous studies have established several climate and environmental factors that control precipitation isotopic variations including temperature dansgaard 1964 elevation gonfiantini et al 2001 seasonality dansgaard 1964 bedaso and wu 2020 source of moisture putman et al 2017 balagizi et al 2018 and air mass transport history soderberg et al 2013 in the tropics previous studies have commonly considered the amount effect a negative correlation between precipitation isotopes and rainfall amount dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 as the dominant controlling factor however many studies have recently challenged the association of high rainfall amount and lower precipitation isotope values and further cautioned the interpretation of paleoclimate data based solely on this relationship lemma et al 2020 bedaso et al 2020 therefore exploring other competing factors and quantifying their effect on precipitation isotope could improve the interpretation of continental paleoclimate isotope proxy derived from rainfall hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o isotopes are valuable tracers to examine atmospheric and hydrological processes that control precipitation isotopes from source to sink gat 1996 they have been used in previous studies to investigate the impact of such processes as moisture source location and conditions at source region moisture transport trajectories and climate conditions along the trajectories weather systems that generate precipitation sub cloud evaporation and local weather conditions burnett et al 2004 uemura et al 2008 vachon et al 2010 krklec and domínguez villar 2014 heydarizad et al 2019 salamalikis et al 2016 bedaso et al 2020 such studies have been facilitated with the development of hysplit back trajectory analysis draxler 2011 and moisture source diagnostic techniques sodemann et al 2008 as well as the increasing availability of spatial and temporal precipitation isotopes data besides δ2h and δ18o d excess a derived isotopic variable defined as d excess δ2h 818o dansgaard 1964 has been successfully used to infer moisture source conditions and atmospheric processes in different geographic locations e g the arctic kurita 2011 southern australia guan et al 2013 eastern africa levin et al 2009 otte et al 2017 and quantifying recycled moisture in china kong et al 2013 the global average precipitation d excess 10 craig 1961 is attributed to direct moisture from the ocean when evaporated at 81 relative humidity and 25 c merlivat and jouzel 1979 continental evaporated water sources are characterized by relatively higher d excess 10 and d excess is inversely related to relative humidity dansgaard 1964 in addition to paleoclimate implications understanding seasonal moisture source variability and quantitative estimates of relative contribution to precipitation sources are also vital to evaluate effects of climate change on precipitation trenberth 2011 determine water availability and predict agriculture productivity rosell and holmer 2007 this is particularly important for the east african region where rainfall patterns are highly complex and variable nicholson 2017 and the local economy is based on rainfed subsistence farming in particular ethiopia highlands are the source of the blue nile and considered as the water tower of east africa unep 2010 understanding the links among moisture source precipitation and water resources bedaso and wu 2021 for this area has great implications for the sustainability of water resources of the east african region as a whole previous studies suggested that the ethiopian highlands obtain moisture from multiple sources including the atlantic and indian oceans the mediterranean the red sea and central africa williams et al 2012 viste and sorteberg 2013 these sources may have potential effects on the isotopic composition of precipitation in ethiopia and the rest of east africa e g levin et al 2009 soderberg et al 2013 balagizi et al 2018 levin et al 2009 highlighted the importance of transpired moisture from the sudd and congo basins as a likely moisture source that results in 18o enriched rainfall in ethiopian highlands whereas joseph et al 1992 attributed this 18o enrichment to the first condensation of water from either the red sea or the equatorial indian ocean more recently bedaso et al 2020 alluded to the importance of change of moisture source and trajectory as an important control over seasonal isotopic variations the authors suggested that moisture derived from the south corresponded to depleted isotopic composition in the wet season and moisture from north and east led to enriched composition during the rest of the year although these studies have provided an overall picture they are largely qualitative and mostly based only on the analysis of wind direction and air mass trajectories without consideration of actual moisture flux therefore in this study we attempt to quantify contributions from different moisture sources by adopting a lagrangian moisture diagnostic technique using the daily precipitation isotope data collected at debre markos located in the northwest highland of ethiopia this paper aims to achieve two major objectives 1 identify actual moisture uptake locations quantify their contributions to precipitation at the site and examine seasonal variations of moisture sources 2 quantify the relative importance of local climate conditions climate conditions of moisture uptake locations and different moisture sources on the isotopic variation in precipitation at the study site 2 data and methods 2 1 study area this study is conducted in ethiopia located in eastern africa within 3 15 n latitude 33 48 e longitude fig 1 a it focuses on the northwestern ethiopian highland where the precipitation samples were collected at debre markos 10 3 n 37 7 e alt 2446 m fig 1b a station located in the central part of the nw highland rainfall in ethiopia shows complex patterns with large seasonal to decadal variability in different regions of the country seleshi and zanke 2004 this spatial and temporal rainfall distribution is largely controlled by the north south movement of the tropical rain belt associated with the intertropical convergent zone itcz nicholson 2018 over ethiopia s varying topography fig 1a and 1b the itcz movement gives rise to a bimodal rainfall pattern in the south and a unimodal pattern in the northern part of the country debre markos experiences subtropical highland climate cwb based on the climate data for debre markos from 1960 to 2015 the average annual temperature is 15 c with small seasonal variations the warmest month typically occurs in april with an average temperature of 18 1 c the coolest month is usually august with an average temperature of 14 2 c the average amount of annual precipitation is 1340 mm with 158 rainy days per year it is characterized by a unimodal rainfall pattern centered in july and august the june to september rainy season traditionally known as kiremt accounts for two thirds of the annual precipitation and rainy days the rest of the year is considered as dry season degefu 1987 fig 1c throughout the year the northwestern highlands of ethiopia are under the influence of different wind patterns which potentially bring moisture to the country from regions including the indian ocean the mediterranean and red seas central africa and the gulf of guinea viste and sorteberg 2013 2 2 precipitation isotope data a total of 197 daily precipitation samples were collected between august 2012 and september 2013 at debre markos meteorological station in the northwest highlands of ethiopia fig 1 with a custom made collection device composed of a funnel affixed to a plastic jug precipitation samples were collected every day before noon in days with a measurable rainfall amount of 0 2 mm enough for duplicate isotope measurement the volumetric amount of precipitation was documented with each sample collection the water samples were transferred to and stored in glass vials with polycone seal caps wrapped with parafilm to prevent evaporation samples were analyzed for isotope ratios δ2h and δ18o with a picarro l2130 i liquid water isotope analyzer via cavity ring down spectroscopy all isotopic analyses results were reported as the δ notation relative to the international standard of vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow in per mil with analytical precision of 0 1 for δ18o 0 4 for δ2h the external precision of d excess is calculated as 0 49 fröhlich et al 2001 detailed sample site selection criteria site description sample collection procedure isotope analysis and the isotope data are initially reported in bedaso et al 2020 as δ18o and δ2h show similar characteristics we only use δ18o values for our analyses d excess is used to track any deviation between δ18o and δ2h our previous study bedaso et al 2020 shows that precipitation isotopic composition at debre markos displays a distinct seasonal pattern with higher values enriched during the dry season and lower values depleted during the wet season fig 2 the wet season δ18o ranges from 10 9 to 4 4 with an amount weighted mean of 2 7 and standard deviation of 2 9 the dry season δ18o ranges from 5 3 to 10 3 with an amount weighted mean of 0 9 and standard deviation of 3 4 more details can be found in bedaso et al 2020 2 3 backward trajectories and climate data to investigate sources of moisture we used the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model draxler 2011 developed by the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to generate backward trajectories of air parcel based on the global data assimilation system gdas 0 5 degree climate data 10 day backward trajectories were calculated every six hours for all days between august 2012 and september 2013 from which trajectories ending with precipitation were selected for analysis the starting height of 1000 m above ground level agl was chosen to target the moisture rich air parcels wallace and hobbs 2006 in order to examine the impact of trajectory starting height on moisture source we ran the hysplit model at multiple heights and calculated the relative moisture contribution from different locations supplementary material s1 the results show that different starting heights yielded similar spatial distribution of moisture sources along each trajectory we extracted hourly location information of the air parcel latitude longitude and height together with its climate conditions including air temperature precipitation relative humidity specific humidity and pressure for local surface climate conditions we used ncep ncar reanalysis data downloaded from https psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep reanalysis html the reason we chose to use the ncep ncar reanalysis data for local climate conditions is because it also provides the climate data for gdas used by the hysplit model in this way when we compared the contributions from local and trajectory climate conditions we had higher confidence that the difference is not due to different datasets in addition we downloaded the daily outgoing longwave radiation olr data as a proxy for convective intensity from noaa https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data interp olr html olr data were also extracted for each of the hourly locations along all trajectories these climate data were used to identify the location and amount of moisture uptake and rainout along the trajectories and used to examine the correlation between isotopic composition and the climate conditions along the trajectories the hysplt software also contains a cluster analysis function that could combine trajectories into clusters based on their proximity and calculate the cluster mean trajectories this function was used to derive major clusters for the wet and dry seasons for comparison several other temperature datasets were used including the debre markos meteorological station temperature data obtained from the national meteorology agency of ethiopia and the era interim reanalysis surface temperature data from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf downloaded from https apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full daily levtype sfc 2 4 identification of moisture uptake and rainout as a single air parcel travels along a trajectory it can gain moisture from surface evaporation uptake or lose moisture through precipitation rainout these are reflected in the change of specific humidity of the air parcel which can be used to identify and quantify moisture sources sodemann et al 2008 in this study we first calculate the change in specific humidity δ q at the interval of every six hours for all trajectories based on the following δ q q t q t 6 h where q refers to the specific humidity at certain time t since we are only interested in trajectories that end with precipitation in the target location we identify all precipitating air parcels when δ q t 0 0 and the relative humidity is greater than 80 r h t 0 80 for each of the precipitating parcels we then trace it backward to identify all locations of moisture uptake δ q 0 and rainout δ q 0 a n d r h 80 along trajectories for each of these locations we record δ q and other climate parameters for future analysis a single backward trajectory can have multiple moisture uptake and rainout locations 2 5 quantification of moisture source contributions the calculation of moisture source contribution is based on a method used in sodemann et al 2008 it follows several steps 1 we first sort all uptake and rainout locations along a trajectory based on time from the earliest end to the latest start point of the backward trajectory 2 at an uptake location n we calculate the initial uptake contribution fn as the fraction of the uptake amount δ q n to the moisture in the air parcel qn f n δ q n q n 3 as we move along the trajectory a new uptake reduces the importance of previous uptakes δ q m m n the contribution of all previous uptakes fm is then calculated as the ratio of previous uptake amount δ q m to the new moisture content qn of the air parcel f m δ q m q n m n 4 at a rainout location all previous moisture uptakes δ q m are discounted in proportion to the rainout amount δ q n as follows δ q m δ q m δ q n f m m n the discounted moisture uptake δ q m amount will be used in subsequent calculations in moisture contribution fm as we completed the entire trajectory each moisture uptake location would get a fraction contribution to the total precipitation at the target site properly discounted for subsequent moisture uptake and rainout we multiplied the fractions fm by the precipitation amount at the end of the trajectory to derive the amount of moisture contribution at each uptake location we then aggregated moisture contributions of all rain producing trajectories within a season by 1ox1o grid so that we could map out the spatial distribution of seasonal moisture sources to precipitation at the target locations 2 6 demarcation of moisture source regions based on the spatial distribution of moisture uptake locations we divide moisture sources into five major regions and summarize their individual moisture contributions to total precipitation in order to further quantify the moisture contribution from different source regions these regions are delineated as follows proximal continental pc ethiopia and surrounding countries of eritrea somalia kenya uganda south sudan and sudan south of 18on including the sudd north africa na regions north of pc and west of 43oe including the red sea and the mediterranean central africa ca regions west of pc and south of na including the congo basin north indian ocean nio regions east of pc and na and north of the equator south indian ocean sio regions east and of pc and ca and south of the equator 2 7 statistical methods we used correlation analysis to examine how the isotopic composition of precipitation was related to both the local climate conditions and the climate conditions of the moisture sources along the trajectories for each rainy day with isotope data we extracted temperature precipitation relative humidity and olr for the target location we also calculated the mean air temperature relative humidity and olr of all moisture uptake locations weighted by their moisture contributions as well as the total rainout amount for each trajectory we then performed the correlation analysis between the δ18o values and these local and trajectory climate variables to examine their impact correlation analysis is also used to examine the impact of different moisture sources for each rainy day with isotope values we calculated the percentage of moisture from different source regions and performed the correlation analysis between δ18o values and the percentage values from different sources in addition we used the multiple linear regression mlr to examine how much of the variance in δ18o values can be explained by local climate conditions trajectory climate conditions and moisture source the multiple regression model is set up as follows y a b i x i e where y is dependent variable δ18o values xi are explanatory variables a is the intercept bi are regression coefficients and e is the random error the mlr model is set up in five ways i using only moisture source variables i e percentage of moisture from pc na ca nio and sio ii using only local climate variables including local olr temperature relative humidity and precipitation amount iii using only trajectory climate variables including averaged trajectory olr temperature relatively humidity and total rainout iv using both local and trajectory climate variables and v using all variables the parameters were estimated with maximum likelihood method the statistical significance of the model is tested by the f test and the p values indicate the probabilities that null hypothesis is true i e there is no relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables r2 is calculated to assess the total model performance and compare the explanatory power of each group of variables we also established the relative importance of each explanatory variable by their independent contribution to the total r2 based on a statistical method proposed by genizi 1993 3 results 3 1 identification of major moisture source regions based on the methodology described in 2 4 and 2 5 we identified the location and amount of moisture uptake along the transport trajectories for all precipitation events at debra markos during the wet and dry seasons of the study period fig 3 fig 3 also displays rainy day trajectories in the wet and dry season their major clusters and the percentage of trajectories represented by each cluster during the wet season june september most of the air mass trajectories comes from the south and west moisture uptake occurs mostly from the indian ocean south the congo basin west as well as continental areas of central africa during the dry season air masses come from the north and northeast especially from november to march the transitional months of october april and may often contain trajectories from both north northwest and south southeast moisture uptake occurs largely at the red sea north the arabian sea northeast and the nearby continental region the moisture source contribution from these regions are summarized in table 1 on the annual basis the majority of the moisture 67 arriving at debre markos comes from proximal continental region the second most important moisture source region is the south indian ocean contributing about 16 of the annual moisture mostly during the wet season the third moisture source region is the north indian ocean the arabian sea contributing 14 of the moisture mostly during the dry season minor moisture source regions are central africa including the congo basin contributing about 2 of the total annual moisture mostly in the wet season and north africa including the red sea and the mediterranean contributing another 2 of total moisture mostly during the dry season in fig 3 it can be seen that moisture uptake does not occur evenly along the trajectories and trajectory frequencies don t necessarily indicate higher moisture contribution for example during the wet season although 57 of the trajectories originate in the sio this region only contributes about 18 of the total moisture in precipitation at debre markos during the dry season about 39 of the trajectories originate in the sio mostly during the transitional months but it contributes less only 14 of total moisture 3 2 impact of moisture source on isotopic composition of precipitation in order to quantitatively investigate how moisture source affect precipitation isotopic composition we performed a correlation analysis between precipitation δ18o at debre markos and the percentage of moisture for each of the source regions the results table 2 show that δ18o at debre markos is significantly correlated with percentage of moisture from ca pc sio and nio very few trajectories transport moisture from na and as a result their moisture contribution only shows a weak correlation with precipitation δ18o values a multiple regression model shows that contributions from different moisture sources could explain 22 of the variations in δ18o at debre markos p 0 01 3 3 impact of climate conditions on precipitation isotopes the correlation between the precipitation δ18o and a set of variables that describe both the local climate conditions at debra markos and the average climate conditions of the locations along the trajectory where moisture uptake occurs are shown in table 3 scatterplots between δ18o and these variables are provided in supplementary materials s2 the results show significant correlations between δ18o and olr surface temperature relative humidity and precipitation amount rainout locally δ18o is most significantly correlated with olr suggesting a strong control of local convection on the precipitation isotopic composition δ18o is also positively correlated with surface temperature the temperature effect and negatively correlated with local precipitation the amount effect and relative humidity with the exception of temperature the relationship between δ18o and those climate variables are similar along the trajectories but with even stronger correlations precipitation δ18o at debre markos is strongly influenced by the convective activities olr of all moisture uptake locations along the trajectories it is also negatively correlated with the mean relative humidity and total rainout along the trajectories trajectory temperature does not show any significant correlation with δ18o 3 4 relative importance of climate variables and moisture source using the multiple linear regression models we found that local climate conditions by themselves can explain 52 of the variability in δ18o climate conditions of moisture uptake locations along the trajectories can explain 40 of the δ18o variability moisture source can explain about 22 of δ18o variability since the climate variables are not completely independent of each other a combination of both local and trajectory climate variables explains 62 of the variability in δ18o once the local and trajectory climate conditions are accounted for moisture source variables only increase the model total r2 by 1 i e they added little explanatory power to the model more details of these regression models can be found in supplementary materials s3 the relative importance of the climate variables can be established by partitioning the total model r2 based on the independent contributions of each individual variables the results are shown in table 4 based on their partial r2 the most important controlling factor is local and trajectory olr accounting for 37 of the total variability in the precipitation isotopic composition local temperature is the second important factor that accounts for 17 of the isotope variability local and trajectory relative humidity can explain 5 of the isotope variability trajectory rainout accounts for 3 and amount effect only explains 1 of the total variability 4 discussion 4 1 climate controls over precipitation isotopes δ18o at debre markos displays a distinct seasonal pattern with depleted isotopic composition in the wet season and enriched in the dry season previously this pattern was commonly explained either by amount effect in the tropics dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 or the remoteness of moisture source and subsequent rainout effect e g tang et al 2015 however we found that amount effect has a relatively weak impact at debre markos accounting for only 1 of total variability of δ18o instead the predominant local influence is convective intensity as indicated by olr olr is measured as the top of the cloud temperature and serve as a proxy for convective intensity during the wet season day time land surface heating increases ground temperature and causes deep and strong convections that generate higher clouds the consequent lower temperature at which precipitation forms leads to depleted δ18o composition in addition precipitation isotope composition is also affected by temperature and relative humidity during the wet season temperature is lower because of evaporative cooling and the relative humidity is higher both factors could reduce the amount of sub cloud evaporation leading to lower δ18o values while d excess remains unaffected guan et al 2013 past studies suggest that the seasonal difference in isotopic values could also be caused by the difference in moisture source e g levin et al 2009 kebede and travi 2012 lemma et al 2020 they suggest that the depleted δ18o composition in the wet season is caused by the remoteness of moisture source from the south indian ocean and subsequent rainout effect and seasonal changes in moisture sources whereas bedaso et al 2020 suggested the importance of detailed analysis of both moisture source and processes along moisture transport path here in this study we show that climate conditions at moisture uptake locations along the trajectories rather than the remoteness of the source could have a significant impact on the precipitation isotopic composition at debre markos our results show that although many 57 backward trajectories for the wet season precipitation events extend to the indian ocean the majority 79 of moisture uptake occurs in the proximal continental pc region and only 18 of the moisture comes from the southern indian ocean sio the most significant climate factor controlling the δ18o values at debre markos is the convective intensity at those moisture uptake regions the depleted isotopic composition in the wet season are largely caused by regional convective activities fig 4 shows the regional olr for the wet season 4a and dry season 4b it can be seen that during the wet season debre markos is right in a zone of low olr indicating high convective intensity this zone also includes much of the pc and central africa ca which account for 75 of total moisture to dm precipitation in the wet season as a result δ18o is much lower in this season and it is also negatively correlated with the amount of moisture coming from pc r 0 33 p 0 01 and ca r 0 25 p 0 01 regions on the contrary sio has much higher olr with weaker convective activities moisture from sio has more enriched δ18o leading to a positive correlation r 0 21 p 0 01 between δ18o and the amount of moisture coming from sio during the dry season as the convective zone moves southward the overall olr in both the pc and nio regions which contribute about half of the seasonal moisture increases leading to enriched δ18o composition in addition to moisture source olr relative humidity of moisture uptake locations and the total rainout along the trajectories also influence the isotopic values at debre markos our analysis suggests that once the trajectory climate conditions are accounted for the actual moisture region per se does not provide additional explanatory power to δ18o variability in addition to δ18o precipitation d excess has been widely used as a tracer for moisture sources dansgaard 1964 clark and fritz 1997 d excess provides the degree of kinetic fractionation during evaporation in the source region as a function of relative humidity and other boundary layer conditions clark and fritz 1997 d excess can be further altered during moisture transport by the mixing of continental recycled water vapor derived from various sources through evaporation gat et al 1994 and by sub cloud evaporation i e reevaporation of raindrops during precipitation event in a relatively dry atmosphere gat 1996 and secondary evaporation after rainfall precipitation derived directly from ocean moisture sources that evaporated under humid conditions has a relatively low d excess close to the global average value of 10 craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 distillation of air parcels during moisture transport lower the δ18o values but d excess remains unaffected however vapor derived from recycled moisture evaporated under low humidity conditions would have a relatively high d excess craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 the relative high d excess values of debre markos precipitation also confirm the importance of recycled moisture as source of precipitation fig 2 table 2 it also shows a significant positive correlation with the percent of moisture from pc region r 0 33 p 0 01 therefore the higher d excess values in the wet season is likely linked to the higher percentage of moisture from pc region that accounts 79 of moisture during this season in addition d excess and δ18o could be further affected by local conditions after condensation such as sub cloud evaporation fig 5 displays the relationship between δ18o and d excess during the wet and dry seasons the data show a highly significant negative correlation r2 0 54 p 0 01 between δ18o and d excess during the dry season whereas the correlation is much weaker r2 0 10 p 0 01 although statistically significant during the wet season the dry season is usually associated with relatively low precipitation amount low humidity and higher temperature fig 2 these conditions could facilitate sub cloud evaporation leading to higher δ18o and lower d excess values during the dry season our result also shows a strong temperature effect on the δ18o variation at debre markos which is not commonly observed in previous studies in tropical regions in general temperature effect is not significant at low latitudes because of higher temperature hence weaker isotopic fractionation and lack of seasonality the lack of correlation between isotopic composition and mean annual temperature at low latitudes was reported by dansgaard 1964 but the correlation increases when daily data is used noone and simmonds 2002 although it was not consistently observed across different sites bedaso et al 2020 showed a significant positive correlation between daily δ18o and temperature at debre markos but no significant correlation when weekly and monthly data are used in order to evaluate the data uncertainties we compared several temperature datasets to confirm this effect including the ncep reanalysis surface used in this study the gdas climate data used for hysplit modeling temperature at 1000 m the debre markos meteorological station temperature data obtained from the national meteorology agency of ethiopia and the era interim reanalysis surface temperature data from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf although some difference exists in the strength of correlation all datasets show a statistically significant positive correlation between surface temperature and δ18o the correlation is very strong for both the station r 0 71 p 0 01 and ncep surface temperature data r 0 62 p 0 01 the correlation is weaker but still statistically significant for gdas 1000 m temperature r 0 36 p 0 01 and era interim surface temperature data r 0 35 p 0 01 therefore we believe the temperature effect on the precipitation isotopes is significant at debre markos and it is not a result of data uncertainties the observed temperature effect could likely be caused by three reasons first the use of daily isotopic data is likely to reveal this relationship that are otherwise not observed in monthly or annual datasets second based on our analysis fig 5 secondary evaporation is significant particularly in the dry season higher temperature increases secondary evaporation enriching the heavy isotopes in the remaining precipitation third due to its high elevation 2500 m debre markos has a highland subtropical climate with cooler temperatures than other tropical regions at similar latitudes as isotopic fractionation is more prominent at lower temperature this could enhance the temperature effect 4 2 moisture source and transport the precipitable vapor in debre markos is a mixture of adverted moisture from the ocean and regional recycled moisture the relative contribution of these moisture sources changes with the season leading to distinct seasonal patterns of precipitation isotopes fig 3c and 3d previous studies suggest that moisture for ethiopia mainly comes from the indian ocean to the east the arabian sea to the northeast the mediterranean and the red sea to the north the congo basin or even as far as the atlantic ocean to the west viste and sorteberg 2013 costa et al 2014 lemma et al 2021 however previous research has two major limitations first they used air mass trajectories as a proxy for locations of moisture source it is evident that not all trajectories produce precipitation and even with those with precipitation moisture uptake is not evenly distributed along the moisture trajectories second these studies only qualitatively identify possible moisture source without a quantitative assessment of how much actual moisture in fact comes from each source here we established a quantitative assessment of where moisture comes from our results show that most moisture for debre markos precipitation is recycled moisture from nearby continental regions pc accounting for 66 of the total annual moisture this percentage is higher in the wet season 79 and lower in the dry season 56 secondary moisture sources include the south indian ocean 16 mostly for the wet season and the arabian sea 14 mostly for the dry season a small amount of moisture comes from the red sea 2 during the dry season and from central africa including the congo basin 2 during the wet season almost no moisture comes from the atlantic ocean based on these results we developed a conceptual model along the moisture transport pathway showing important processes that potentially control seasonal precipitation δ18o and d excess values in deber markos fig 6 the ultimate sources of moisture for east african come the sio in the wet season and nio in the dry season however vapor advected from the ocean partially rains out along the moisture transport path and contributes water to continental recycled moisture the advected vapor also mix with recycled moisture along the transport pathway en route to the ethiopian highland progressive rainout and mixing of vapor would alter the δ18o and d excess values of precipitation along the moisture trajectory and eventually at debre markos for example during the wet season about 79 of the moisture is recycled moisture derived from the pc region in the pc region most of the moisture is picked up locally close to debre markos and along the ethio sudan border extending both to western ethiopia and the eastern half of south sudan in south sudan evapotranspiration from the sudd one of the largest wetlands in africa and seasonal swamps associated with overflooding of the white nile might have contributed vapor to the atmosphere mohamed et al 2006 evapotranspiration from such a large area of wetlands could impact microclimate mohamed et al 2006 and further increase rainfall downwind savenije 1995 at debre markos during the wet season southerly and westerly winds are dominant and carry moisture from the indian ocean and recycled moisture from the sudd and eastern part of south sudan fig 4a in addition moisture recycling can be enhanced by topography which blocks moisture from entering further inland van der ent et al 2010 and the ethiopian highlands could play a significant role to enhance moisture recycling in western ethiopia fig 6 the seasonal variation of δ18o and d excess values are also attributed to differences in atmospheric processes and climatic conditions along the moisture trajectory and locally in debre markos during the wet season high humidity and strong convective processes in the western half of the pc region including debre markos could be responsible for low δ18o and high d excess values in contrast in the dry season d excess values in debre markos are lower than the wet season the low d excess values in the dry season could be due to low humidity at debre markos which results in sub cloud evaporation during precipitation or direct moisture contribution from the nio fig 6 thus the isotopic composition of precipitation in debre markos is mainly controlled by local conditions moisture contribution from multiple sources and moisture transport processes along moisture trajectories overall our result agrees with previous studies e g cole et al 1999 vullie et al 2003 in suggesting the primary importance of atmospheric circulation pattern moisture source and climate conditions on the isotopic composition of precipitation but our study went further by presenting a quantitative investigation of the impact of these processes on precipitation isotopes in ethiopia including the impact of moisture sources seasonal moisture contributions local and trajectory climate conditions this helps to improve the interpretation of hydrogen and oxygen isotope based paleo proxy records e g ice core speleothems soil carbonates and contributes to our understanding of long term climate variability it also facilitates the use of isotopes in surface water and groundwater hydrological modelling studies especially in ungagged watersheds with limited to no long term monitoring data our study is limited by the short temporal coverage of our data to further understand interannual to decadal moisture variability and moisture dynamics in ethiopia it is imperative to establish multiple long term daily to weekly based precipitation isotope monitoring stations in different parts of the country 5 conclusion this study has two major objectives 1 identify moisture uptake locations quantify their contributions to precipitation and examine their seasonal variations for debre markos in the northwest ethiopian highlands 2 quantify the relative importance of local climate conditions climate conditions of moisture uptake locations and different moisture sources on the isotopic variation in precipitation at the study site we found that moisture trajectories change from dominantly south and southwest in the wet season to northeast in the dry season recycled continental moisture from the pc region is the most dominant moisture source throughout the year 67 and the percentage is higher in the wet season 79 than the dry season 56 secondary moisture sources include the sio for the wet season and the nio for the dry season our results show that the most important control over the precipitation isotopic variation is the convective intensity indicated by olr at both the study site and the moisture uptake locations strong connective activities are linked to low isotopic values and the seasonal movement of the deep convection region could explain the seasonal precipitation δ18o patterns with low values in the wet season and high values in the dry season other climate factors that affect the isotopic composition of precipitation include local temperature relative humidity rainfall amount as well as total rainout along the trajectories and relative humidity at moisture uptake locations our study could provide new perspectives for interpreting δ18o based paleoclimate proxies in this region as well as crucial information for understanding hydrocliamte processes in a region where sustainable water resources are of particular importance for socioeconomic development credit authorship contribution statement shuang ye wu

3736,the implicit stochastic optimization iso model is a methodology that has been extensively employed in the mid long term optimal operation of a reservoir system the generation of runoff series is the key technology to make up for the poor representativeness and reliability of historical runoff samples and is the premise to guarantee the accuracy of the iso model however the traditional methods are not suitable for the stochastic generation of runoff series among reservoirs with spatial temporal correlation in this work the generative adversarial network called dc wgan is developed as a runoff generation model dc wgan is based on a data driven model and can capture the correlation of runoff series in time and space dimensions simultaneously the proposed method is applied to the downstream jinsha river cascade and three gorges cascade reservoirs in china to generate ten day runoff series and is compared with the stochastic generation method based on copula function the focus of this paper is the model s performance in replicating the spatial temporal correlation of ten day runoff series results are as follows 1 dc wgan has strong learning and generalization ability which can learn the correct distribution of original runoff samples and generate runoff series similar to that from the validation set 2 the runoff series among reservoirs with spatial temporal correlation can be generated through dc wgan without assuming the probability distribution of samples in advance 3 dc wgan is better than copula function in capturing the spatial temporal correlation especially the moderate and weak correlation the proposed methodology has a high practical value and application prospect for the stochastic generation of runoff series with spatial temporal correlation keywords reservoir system runoff series stochastic generation generative adversarial networks copula 1 introduction the joint optimal operation of a reservoir system can maximize the usage efficiency of water resources by making full use of hydrology storage capacity and electric power compensation among reservoirs yeh 1985 guo et al 2011 labadie 2004 ma et al 2020 the mid long term runoff forecast is the basis of optimal operation of reservoirs at that time horizon nevertheless the current mid long term forecast accuracy still has difficulty conforming to the requirements of mid long term operation which limits the application of joint optimal operation technology karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 xu et al 2019 kim and palmer 1997 one of the effective methods to avoid the low accuracy of mid long term forecast is to use the implicit stochastic optimization iso method to extract the operation rules of a reservoir system according to the historical runoff series ma et al 2013 yang et al 2017 chang et al 2018 however in practical projects the length of historical series is only several decades and this makes it difficult to reflect the randomness of future runoff changes for a single reservoir the duration of the existing runoff series is sufficient but for the runoff series with spatial temporal correlation the current samples are not representative and reliable enough to meet the requirements of the iso based operation the generation of runoff series with spatial temporal correlation brings a great challenge to the refined management and decision making for the joint optimal operation of a reservoir system the runoff process not only delivers a specific periodic change but shows random characteristics affected by climate and human activities which frequently hinders the explicit equation to describe the runoff series wang et al 2017 therefore stochastic generation of runoff series has been widely practiced in this field gao et al 2018 wagena et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the traditional hydrological stochastic generation methods can be classified into autoregression models disaggregation models and stochastic mode based on physical mechanism can et al 2012 al zakar et al 2017 miao and ding 1998 the autoregression model is favored in the field of hydrological series generation because of its advantages of simple structure and easy operation the first order autoregressive ar 1 model is one of the most widely used model to describe the stochastic process of runoff wang et al 1995 used the ar 1 model with normal distribution and p iii distribution to simulate the monthly runoff series of reservoirs and achieved a good application effect ding et al 1993 discussed the variation characteristics of monthly runoff of the four major rivers i e yangtze river yellow river songhua river and xijiang river in china and the results showed that the seasonal first order autoregressive sar 1 model combined with skew transformation can be used to characterize the temporal variation of monthly runoff there are also some improved autoregressive models including the autoregressive moving average arma model autoregressive integrated moving average arima model and autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average arfima model can et al 2012 ab razak et al 2018 yaya and fashae 2015 the basic idea of the disaggregation model is to decompose large scale hydrological series into higher resolution hydrological series both in time and space for example annual runoff is decomposed into monthly runoff and the runoff of a downstream location is decomposed into the runoff of multiple upstream locations santos and salas 1992 constructed a stepwise disaggregation model to decompose annual runoff into monthly runoff prairie et al 2007 proposed a k nearest neighbor approach to resample monthly flows conditioned on an annual value in a temporal disaggregation or multiple upstream locations conditioned on a downstream location for a spatial disaggregation the results show that this method is parsimonious and effective and can capture the distributional and spatial dependency properties at all the locations the mode based on a physical mechanism is effective in areas with little or no hydrological data however due to the influence of climate topography human activities and other factors on the hydrological system modeling considering hydrological law is a relatively difficult work thus the research on stochastic generation based on physical mechanism has not produced much progress miao and ding 1998 in addition the methods above are difficult to extend to high dimensions which is not suitable for the runoff stochastic generation of the multi reservoir system at short time scales in recent years to make the stochastic generation model better reflect the statistical characteristics and correlation of hydrological series copula function has been introduced into stochastic hydrological models to further improve the accuracy of hydrological stochastic generation sraj et al 2015 chen et al 2019 copula function is principally applied to identify the correlation between different variables it can be independent of the marginal distribution of variables and connect different marginal distributions which is flexible and simple chowdhary et al 2011 used the copula function to analyze two dimensional flood frequency and consider that clayton copula is the most reliable method to simulate the joint distribution of flood peak and flood volume lee and salas 2011 used a variety of copula functions to establish the internal correlation of hydrological series and utilize them to the annual runoff simulation of the nile river traditionally the current stochastic generation methods are based on statistical assumptions which are generated by monte carlo and latin hypercube sampling methods the problem with these methods is that the probability distribution of runoff series should be assumed in advance and it may not be applicable in practice in addition it is difficult for traditional stochastic generation methods to capture the nonlinear characteristics of high dimensional data which fails to meet the requirements of runoff generation for a reservoir system the copula function combined with the joint random sampling method is employed to make the joint distribution and randomly get a large sample of the runoff series this method overcomes the shortcoming of the traditional stochastic simulation method to analyze the correlation structure of time series however most of the current research on the stochastic generation with the copula function focuses on the two dimension copula function i e considering the correlation between the two variables at the time with the increase of the variables it would be much more difficult to model and estimate the variables of the copula function which is not suited for the runoff series with multiple periods correlation in time and multiple sites correlation in space simultaneously therefore with the rapid development of joint operation for a reservoir system the stochastic generation method of runoff series should not only consider the temporal correlation but also the spatial correlation between different reservoirs in the watershed it is urgent to develop a method that requires no assumption of the specific probability distribution and considers the spatial temporal correlation of runoff series the generative adversarial network gan a generative model has attracted extensive attention since it came out and has been applied in many fields zhang et al 2020 chen et al 2018 tang et al 2018 li et al 2017 the gan has evolved into nearly 500 improved versions since it was proposed the representative and widely used ones are deep convolutional generative adversarial network dcgan radford et al 2015 wasserstein generative adversarial network wgan arjovsky et al 2017 and sequence generative adversarial network seqgan yu et al 2017 the main characteristics of gan are as follows 1 the distribution of historical data can be directly learned and new samples can be generated without any premise of data distribution in advance 2 unsupervised learning is applied to avoid tedious manual annotation which is suitable for learning and generating large scale data sets to the best of our knowledge little work has been done in the field of runoff stochastic generation with the correlation of multiple periods in time and multiple sites in space simultaneously and without the assumptions of probability distributions regarding the existing problems of traditional hydrological stochastic generation technology and the advantages of gan in data generation this paper combines dcgan with wgan to form dc wgan which is applied to generate runoff series for a reservoir system the major contribution of this study is twofold 1 exploring the applicability of dc wgan in the field of runoff stochastic generation for a reservoir system from two aspects of samples statistical similarity and generalization performance 2 analyzing the spatial temporal correlation of runoff samples of dc wgan compared with the copula function the proposed framework is applied to the downstream jinsha river cascade and three gorges cascade reservoirs in china considering that the runoff stochastic generated in this paper is used for mid long term optimal operation of the reservoir system and the time scale of mid long term optimal operation is generally month or ten days the ten day scale is adopted for stochastic generation and analysis the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the proposed methodology this section has two subsections namely runoff stochastic generation model based on generative adversarial network and runoff stochastic generation model based on copula function section 3 describes a case study for a four reservoir system and the data set of model training the results and discussion of the case study are given in section 4 finally conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 runoff stochastic generation model based on generative adversarial network 2 1 1 generative adversarial network gan was proposed by ian goodfellow et al 2014 in 2014 it has been widely used in computer vision natural language processing and other fields inspired by the zero sum game in game theory gan achieves the best generation effect through the opposition between two networks i e generator network and discriminator network the structure of gan is shown in fig 1 the model is mainly composed of a generator network and a discriminator network the essence of these two networks is to express complex nonlinear relations and complex classify signals using deep neural networks dnns the difference is that the input of the generator network is a set of random noise and the generated samples are obtained by mapping the generator while the input of the discriminator is both the historical and the generated samples and the output is a probability value that represents the confidence of guessing whether the input is the original samples or the generated samples assuming that there are m reservoirs with n year historical runoff data and each year is divided into t periods the historical runoff data can be expressed as x i j t i 1 2 m j 1 2 n y e a r t 1 2 t the original distribution of historical data is represented by p data x given a set of random noise zp z z with known distribution e g gaussian distribution the two dnns in the training process are generator g z θ g and discriminator d x θ d respectively where θ g and θ d are the weight parameters of the two networks the goal of the generator is to make the generated samples as close to the distribution of the original samples as possible in order to cheat the discriminator while the goal of the discriminator is to distinguish the difference between the generated samples and the original samples as much as possible a dynamic game process is constituted by the generator and the discriminator the two networks compete with each other to improve their performance in the iterative process finally the samples consistent with the original samples are generated after setting the object of network training the loss functions of generator and discriminator are constructed respectively to train the network due to the larger output of the discriminator means the more realistic samples the generator is optimized to minimize the expectation of d g for a given discriminator on the other hand the discriminator is optimized to minimize the expectation of d g and maximize the expectation of original data d x for a given generator after taking logarithms the specific expression of loss function l g and l d is as follows 1 l g e zp z z log 1 d g z 2 l d e xp data x log d x e zp z z log 1 d g z combined with formula 1 and formula 2 the value function is established to form a minimax game model and its objective function is as follows 3 min θ g max θ d v g d e xp data x log d x e zp z z log 1 d g z in the early stage of network training the samples generated by the generator are very dissimilar from the original samples thus the discriminator can reject these samples with high confidence at this time l d is small l g and v g d is very large 2 1 2 improved generative adversarial network 2 1 2 1 problems of original generative adversarial network gan can produce better samples compared with other generation models however the original gan also has some problems such as unstable training and gradient disappearance the generator and discriminator of gan reach equilibrium in the process of gambling but it is difficult to make both networks converge to the optimal at the same time which leads to the instability of model training on the other hand the loss of the discriminator converges to 0 quickly when the discriminator is accurate so it fails to provide reliable information to update the gradient of the generator resulting in the disappearance of the generator gradient for the original gan the optimal discriminator with a fixed generator is as follows 4 d g x p data x p data x p g x where p data x is the distribution of original samples and p g x is the distribution of samples generated by the generator with the optimal discriminator the optimization objective of the generator is shown below 5 min θ g v g d e xp data x log d g x e zp z z log 1 d g g z e xp data x log d g x e xp g x log 1 d g x e xp data x log p data x p data x p g x e xp g x log p g x p data x p g x the above formula is transformed in the form of jensen shannon js divergence 6 min θ g v g d 2 log 2 2 j s p data p g where 7 js p 1 p 2 1 2 k l p 1 p 1 p 2 2 1 2 k l p 2 p 1 p 2 2 8 kl p 1 p 2 e xp 1 log p 1 p 2 it can be assured that if the discriminator is trained to the uttermost the training goal of the gan is to minimize the js divergence between the distribution of original samples p data and generated samples p g since it is almost impossible for p data and p g to overlap the js divergence of p data and p g is constant log 2 regardless of their distance which eventually leads to the gradient disappearance of the generator a number of improved gan are devoted to resolving the above problems among which dcgan and wgan are the most effective and widely used dcgan proposes a network architecture of generator and discriminator in the feature extraction layer of the two networks the convolutional neural network cnn is applied to replace the multilayer perceptron mlp in the original gan to improve its stability wgan improves the loss function of generator and discriminator and wasserstein distance is used to replace the js divergence in the original gan to reflect the distance between the original samples and generated samples 2 1 2 2 deep convolutional generative adversarial network the deep convolutional generative adversarial network dcgan is proposed to solve the problem that the original gan is unstable in the training process radford et al 2015 dcgan introduces cnns into the generator and discriminator of gan as shown in fig 2 as can be seen from fig 2 the generator projects a 100 dimensional noise vector into many feature maps in a small convolution representation space the random noise is reshaped into a 4 4 1024 matrix through a full connection layer and then expanded to a 64 64 3 matrix i e generated samples after four deconvolution layers with a 2 step length the discriminator converts the 64 64 3 matrix i e generated samples and original samples into a 4 4 1024 matrix through four convolution layers and then outputs a probability value from 0 to 1 through a full connection layer the advantage of dcgan lies in the fact that it uses some empirical network structure to make the confrontational training more stable its main improvements are as follows 1 the network can learn a more suitable spatial down sampling method through a stridden convolution layer instead of a pooling layer in addition convolution is used in the discriminator and deconvolution is used in the generator 2 batch normalization is applied to accelerate the learning and convergence of the model and reduce the dependence of network parameters on initialization 3 the hyperbolic tangent tanh activation function is used in the output layer of the generator while the rectified linear unit relu function is used in other layers and leakyrelu function is used in all layers of discriminator to avoid gradient sparsity the definitions of relu and leakyrelu functions are shown in equation 9 and equation 10 4 the output of the last convolution layer in the discriminator is sent to a sigmoid classifier 9 relu x max x 0 x x 0 0 x 0 0 10 leakyrelu x max x 0 x x 0 ax x 0 r where a 0 1 is a constant relu sets all negative values to zero whereas leakyrelu gives all negative values a non zero slope leakyrelu function is a variant of relu function 2 1 2 3 wasserstein generative adversarial network to avoid the gradient disappearance of the generator in the original gan arjovsky et al 2017 proposed wasserstein generative adversarial network wgan in 2017 wgan is a kind of generative adversarial network that optimizes training using wasserstein distance instead of js divergence compared with js divergence wasserstein distance can still reflect the distance of generated and original samples even if there is no overlap between them the form of wasserstein distance is as follows 11 w p data p g 1 k sup f l k e xp data x f x e xp g x f x where k is the lipschitz constant of the continuous function f and sup is the supremum thus the loss function of discriminator in wgan is as follows 12 l max ω w e xp data x f ω x e zp z z f ω g θ z let d f ω g g θ and change the upper formula into the lower one 13 l max d e xp data x d x e zp z z d g z the advantages of wgan are as follows 1 the better the discriminator is trained the better the generator is which greatly improved the stability of the original gan 2 mode collapse is avoided with positive effects on model robustness 2 1 3 model architecture and details of training considering the advantages of dcgan and wgan this paper combines dcgan with wgan abbreviated as dc wgan for short to generate stochastic runoff series of a reservoir system table 1 shows the model architecture of dc wgan in table 1 mlp denotes the multilayer perceptron while conv and conv transpose mean convolution layer and deconvolution layer respectively it can be seen that the generator and the discriminator feature an opposite network structure the generator includes two deconvolution layers for up sampling random noise z to generate runoff series while the discriminator includes two convolution layers for down sampling data from generated samples and original samples the hidden layer of generator and discriminator adopts relu and leakyrelu activation function respectively batch normalization is adopted to improve the robustness of the model to different hyperparameters table 2 presents the details of training the algorithm in table 2 is used to train dc wgan to generate the runoff series by means of batches a root mean square prop rmsprop algorithm is used to update the parameters of the generator and discriminator network ω is the weight of discriminator parameters clipping is used to truncate the absolute value of discriminator parameters to no more than a fixed constant c which can prevent the gradient explosion of the discriminator the dc wgan developed in this paper is written using tensorflow library of python 3 6 2 2 runoff stochastic generation model based on copula function 2 2 1 copula function copula was proposed and proved by sklar in 1959 sklar 1959 copula is a kind of function that combines the multiple variables from 0 to1 into a joint distribution which can effectively combine any marginal distribution for a continuous variable x d the marginal distribution function is f d x d the joint distribution function is h x 1 x 2 x d and the corresponding copula function is c 14 h x 1 x 2 x d c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f d x d c u 1 u 2 u d where u d f d x d and d 1 2 n the copula function with two variables is as follows 15 h x y c f x x f y y c x y where f x x and f y y are the marginal distribution functions of variables x and y respectively traditionally copula functions can be divided into elliptic copula quadratic copula and archimedean copula moreover archimedean copula can be further classified in symmetric and asymmetric type according to its structure the asymmetric archimedean copula function is simple in structure and contains only one parameter which is widely used in the field of hydrology there are three types of asymmetric archimedean copulas including gumbel copula clayton copula and frank copula which can be expressed as follows gumbel copula 16 c x y exp ln x θ ln y θ 1 θ θ 1 clayton copula 17 c x y x θ y θ 1 1 θ θ 0 frank copula 18 c x y 1 θ ln 1 e θ x 1 e θ y 1 e θ 1 θ r where θ is the parameter of the copula function 2 2 2 stochastic generation of copula function copula function is used to generate samples based on the inverse function of conditional probability by solving the conditional distribution between two variables at the adjacent periods the runoff series is randomly simulated combined with the monte carlo gibbs sampling method the process is shown in fig 3 step 1 optimization of marginal distribution functions selecting five kinds of marginal distribution functions commonly used in hydrological research to fit the runoff of each period i e gamma distribution pearson type iii distribution exponential distribution weibull distribution and lognormal distribution estimating parameters of each distribution function using the maximum likelihood method choosing the optimal distribution function of each period with the akaike information criterion aic step 2 optimization of copula functions selecting gumbel copula clayton copula and frank copula to construct the joint distribution of runoff in adjacent periods estimating parameters of each copula function using the maximum likelihood method choosing the optimal copula function of each adjacent period with the akaike information criterion aic step 3 stochastic generation of runoff series calculating the conditional probability of each adjacent period according to the optimal copula function of runoff between adjacent periods generating the frequency of runoff in each period using the gibbs sampling method transforming the frequency into the value of runoff by the optimal distribution function of runoff in each period in step 1 repeating step 3 until gibbs sampling is completed the generation of runoff series based on the copula function in this paper is performed by the r language 3 case study in this study the downstream jinsha river cascade and three gorges cascade reservoirs of china are selected as a case study including xiluodu xiangjiaba three gorges and gezhouba reservoirs xiluodu and xiangjiaba power stations are the first hydropower projects ever planned and developed in the mainstream of jinsha river and are also an important project for the development of western china the two hydropower stations form a cascade system with the three gorges and gezhouba hydropower stations on the mainstream of the yangtze river the cascade four reservoir system plays an extremely important role for the optimal allocation of water resources for the transmission of power from the west to the east in china the location and topologic structure of the four reservoir system is shown in fig 4 xiluodu and three gorges reservoirs have seasonal regulation capacity while xiangjiaba and gezhouba reservoirs have daily regulation capacity the stochastic generation of runoff series for the reservoir system can provide a large number of diverse runoff samples which is useful for more reasonably extracting the regulation rules from the reservoir system and guiding the optimal operation of cascade reservoirs scientifically taking the above mentioned reservoir system as an example the stochastic generation of runoff based on dc wgan is established and the spatial temporal correlation of the generated samples is verified by comparing with the copula method the runoff series of the reservoir system i e inflow to reservoir from 1940 to 2010 are used as data set for training and verification of dc wgan 90 i e series for 64 years historical runoff series were used as a training set and 10 i e series for 7 years as a validation set dc wgan is used to learn the historical ten day runoff samples and stochastically generate 3 000 ten day runoff samples after training the model the learning and generalization ability of dc wgan is analyzed from the statistical similarity and diversity of generated runoff samples similarly the above historical runoff data are used to generate runoff series based on copula function five distribution functions i e gamma distribution pearson type iii distribution exponential distribution weibull distribution and lognormal distribution commonly used in hydrology and three symmetric archimedean copula functions i e gumbel copula clayton copula and frank copula are selected and optimized the runoff series of adjacent periods of ten day is simulated by the gibbs sampling method 4 results and discussion 4 1 runoff series generation solution based on dc wgan the model architecture and algorithm of dc wgan in tables 1 and 2 are used to stochastically generate the runoff series of the reservoir system and the number of iterations is set to be 40 000 fig 5 illustrates the training evolution process of dc wgan it can be seen that the output of the discriminator for the original and generated samples is quite different see fig 5 a in the initial 10 000 iterations which shows that the discriminator can easily distinguish the source of the sample data in the later iterations the wasserstein distance between the distribution of the original and generated samples gradually converges to zero see fig 5 b the model is iterated to 40 000 times to illustrate that the whole training process is stable and the distribution of the final runoff samples will be very close to the original runoff samples a box scatter plot is shown in fig 6 to visually compare the annual runoff of original series and that of generated series from dc wgan it can be seen that the original and generated annual series are similar the 25 75 range and median line of the two series are essentially the same indicating that the dc wgan model can learn the basic characteristics of the original runoff series considering that the distance from xiluodu to xiangjiaba reservoirs and from three gorges to gezhouba reservoirs is relatively short see fig 4 runoff into the two reservoirs upstream is similar and so is runoff into the two reservoirs downstream see fig 6 therefore a single comparison between an upstream i e xiluodu reservoir and a downstream i e three gorges reservoirs runoff will be shown to verify the learning ability of dc wgan the frequency curves on original runoff series and generated runoff series of dc wgan are shown in fig 7 for comparison 64 samples are randomly selected from 3 000 generated runoff samples of dc wgan the number of which is the same as the original samples in fig 7 the blue dots and lines represent samples and frequency curves of the original runoff series while the yellow dots and lines are the generated runoff series the frequency curves are fitted by lognormal distribution function the frequency curves of the original and generated samples overlap almost completely indicating that dc wgan can generate runoff series with correct distribution to further verify the generalization capacity of dc wgan the runoff series from generated runoff samples which is most similar to the seven runoff series not involved in model training i e validation set are found using the euclidean distance among them three runoff series are shown in fig 8 these three runoff series are selected according to the amount of local inflow in the basin i e wet inflow year medium inflow year and dry inflow year dc wgan can still generate samples with a similar morphology to the verification set without using these samples to train the model indicating that dc wgan has a strong generalization ability the autocorrelation coefficient in fig 8 also verifies that dc wgan can capture the temporal correlation of the runoff series the calculation formula for the autocorrelation coefficient r τ concerning time lag τ is as follows 19 r τ i 1 n τ x i μ x i τ μ i 1 n x i μ 2 where x is the time series of the original or generated samples μ is the mean value of the time series and n is the total number of periods of the time series 4 2 temporal correlation to verify the temporal correlation of runoff series the pearson correlation coefficients ρ x y of original samples generated samples from dc wgan and copula are calculated the pearson correlation coefficient is a statistic that reflects the correlation degree between two variables and its calculation formula is as follows 20 ρ x y i 1 m x i x y i y i 1 m x i x 2 i 1 m y i y 2 where x and y are the mean value of variables x and y and m is the total number of samples fig 9 illustrates the heat map for the temporal correlation of original samples generated samples from dc wgan and copula respectively the results from fig 9 verify the following points 1 among the original runoff samples there is a strong correlation from 1 to 10 periods and from 30 to 36 periods in xiluodu reservoir while the runoff series from 11 to 29 periods only has a strong correlation with its adjacent periods and a moderate or weak correlation with other periods accordingly each period of runoff in the three gorges reservoir and its two or three adjacent periods are highly correlated with the remaining periods having a moderate or weak correlation 2 the runoff series generated by dc wgan can not only learn the strong correlation of the original runoff series but also capture the moderate or weak correlation between periods especially for the runoff over 10 intervals dc wgan can learn its correct correlation 3 although the runoff series generated by copula can only consider the temporal correlation between two adjacent periods at a time it can also capture the strong correlation of cross period because of its conditional probability passing forward in time series however the correlation of its generated series is weaker than the original series and generated series from dc wgan due to the correlation is passed forward rather than directly learnt moreover the generation method based on copula cannot capture the moderate or weak correlation between periods so it shows no correlation 4 3 spatial correlation to verify the spatial correlation of runoff series the spatial correlation coefficients of ten day runoff for xiluodu and three gorges reservoirs are calculated based on the original samples generated samples from dc wgan and copula as shown in fig 10 the spatial correlation coefficients of annual runoff series based on these three kinds of samples are 0 67 0 65 and 0 01 respectively fig 10 shows that for the original samples the spatial correlation coefficients of ten day runoff and annual runoff are 0 23 0 80 respectively accordingly for the generated samples from dc wgan the spatial correlation coefficients of ten day runoff and annual runoff are 0 07 0 71 respectively and for the generated samples from copula the spatial correlation coefficients of ten day runoff and annual runoff are 0 03 0 03 respectively it is obvious that the runoff series of xiluodu and the three gorges reservoirs show a strong spatial correlation dc wgan can learn the spatial correlation of the runoff series between reservoirs but the generation method based on copula cannot capture the spatial correlation of the runoff series between different reservoirs 5 conclusions stochastic generation of runoff series can provide a large number of diverse runoff samples for the implicit stochastic optimization which is the premise for scientifically guiding the joint optimal operation of a reservoir system the traditional stochastic generation method of runoff series is difficult to capture the nonlinear features of high dimensional data and cannot consider the temporal and spatial correlation of runoff at the same time therefore this paper proposes the generative adversarial network called dc wgan to generate the runoff series of a reservoir system considering the advantages of the generative adversarial network in data generation taking the downstream jinsha river cascade and three gorges cascade reservoirs in china as an example the stochastic generation of ten day runoff for the reservoir system is carried out and compared with the generation method based on copula function the following conclusions are drawn 1 dc wgan can generate runoff series with a correct distribution which not only meets the statistical similarity of the original samples but also generates runoff processes with a full diversity of behaviors 2 dc wgan has a strong generalization ability which can generate runoff series with similar morphology in the validation set and capture the temporal correlation of runoff series 3 compared with the generation method of the copula function dc wgan does not need to assume the probability distribution of samples in advance besides dc wgan can simultaneously consider the correlation of multiple periods in time and multiple sites in space for the runoff series of the reservoir system a large number of runoff samples with spatial temporal correlation of the reservoir system can be generated at one time using a generative adversarial network instead of iterating many times in the form of a markov chain this method has strong operability and is easy to expand increasing the dimension of the original runoff series hardly increases the calculation workload of the model moreover dc wgan can train any kind of generated network without assuming the form of probability distribution instead it can generate samples by continuously approaching the real data distribution through adversarial learning it provides a cost effective solution for the stochastic generation of runoff series with spatial temporal correlation however this paper only compares the performance of dc wgan model with copula method at ten day time scale future research can be devoted to the deep analysis of dc wgan model compared with other more classical and efficient methods e g hidden markov processes and autoregressive model for the runoff stochastic generation at different time scales e g decadal annual and daily time scales 6 data

3736,the implicit stochastic optimization iso model is a methodology that has been extensively employed in the mid long term optimal operation of a reservoir system the generation of runoff series is the key technology to make up for the poor representativeness and reliability of historical runoff samples and is the premise to guarantee the accuracy of the iso model however the traditional methods are not suitable for the stochastic generation of runoff series among reservoirs with spatial temporal correlation in this work the generative adversarial network called dc wgan is developed as a runoff generation model dc wgan is based on a data driven model and can capture the correlation of runoff series in time and space dimensions simultaneously the proposed method is applied to the downstream jinsha river cascade and three gorges cascade reservoirs in china to generate ten day runoff series and is compared with the stochastic generation method based on copula function the focus of this paper is the model s performance in replicating the spatial temporal correlation of ten day runoff series results are as follows 1 dc wgan has strong learning and generalization ability which can learn the correct distribution of original runoff samples and generate runoff series similar to that from the validation set 2 the runoff series among reservoirs with spatial temporal correlation can be generated through dc wgan without assuming the probability distribution of samples in advance 3 dc wgan is better than copula function in capturing the spatial temporal correlation especially the moderate and weak correlation the proposed methodology has a high practical value and application prospect for the stochastic generation of runoff series with spatial temporal correlation keywords reservoir system runoff series stochastic generation generative adversarial networks copula 1 introduction the joint optimal operation of a reservoir system can maximize the usage efficiency of water resources by making full use of hydrology storage capacity and electric power compensation among reservoirs yeh 1985 guo et al 2011 labadie 2004 ma et al 2020 the mid long term runoff forecast is the basis of optimal operation of reservoirs at that time horizon nevertheless the current mid long term forecast accuracy still has difficulty conforming to the requirements of mid long term operation which limits the application of joint optimal operation technology karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 xu et al 2019 kim and palmer 1997 one of the effective methods to avoid the low accuracy of mid long term forecast is to use the implicit stochastic optimization iso method to extract the operation rules of a reservoir system according to the historical runoff series ma et al 2013 yang et al 2017 chang et al 2018 however in practical projects the length of historical series is only several decades and this makes it difficult to reflect the randomness of future runoff changes for a single reservoir the duration of the existing runoff series is sufficient but for the runoff series with spatial temporal correlation the current samples are not representative and reliable enough to meet the requirements of the iso based operation the generation of runoff series with spatial temporal correlation brings a great challenge to the refined management and decision making for the joint optimal operation of a reservoir system the runoff process not only delivers a specific periodic change but shows random characteristics affected by climate and human activities which frequently hinders the explicit equation to describe the runoff series wang et al 2017 therefore stochastic generation of runoff series has been widely practiced in this field gao et al 2018 wagena et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the traditional hydrological stochastic generation methods can be classified into autoregression models disaggregation models and stochastic mode based on physical mechanism can et al 2012 al zakar et al 2017 miao and ding 1998 the autoregression model is favored in the field of hydrological series generation because of its advantages of simple structure and easy operation the first order autoregressive ar 1 model is one of the most widely used model to describe the stochastic process of runoff wang et al 1995 used the ar 1 model with normal distribution and p iii distribution to simulate the monthly runoff series of reservoirs and achieved a good application effect ding et al 1993 discussed the variation characteristics of monthly runoff of the four major rivers i e yangtze river yellow river songhua river and xijiang river in china and the results showed that the seasonal first order autoregressive sar 1 model combined with skew transformation can be used to characterize the temporal variation of monthly runoff there are also some improved autoregressive models including the autoregressive moving average arma model autoregressive integrated moving average arima model and autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average arfima model can et al 2012 ab razak et al 2018 yaya and fashae 2015 the basic idea of the disaggregation model is to decompose large scale hydrological series into higher resolution hydrological series both in time and space for example annual runoff is decomposed into monthly runoff and the runoff of a downstream location is decomposed into the runoff of multiple upstream locations santos and salas 1992 constructed a stepwise disaggregation model to decompose annual runoff into monthly runoff prairie et al 2007 proposed a k nearest neighbor approach to resample monthly flows conditioned on an annual value in a temporal disaggregation or multiple upstream locations conditioned on a downstream location for a spatial disaggregation the results show that this method is parsimonious and effective and can capture the distributional and spatial dependency properties at all the locations the mode based on a physical mechanism is effective in areas with little or no hydrological data however due to the influence of climate topography human activities and other factors on the hydrological system modeling considering hydrological law is a relatively difficult work thus the research on stochastic generation based on physical mechanism has not produced much progress miao and ding 1998 in addition the methods above are difficult to extend to high dimensions which is not suitable for the runoff stochastic generation of the multi reservoir system at short time scales in recent years to make the stochastic generation model better reflect the statistical characteristics and correlation of hydrological series copula function has been introduced into stochastic hydrological models to further improve the accuracy of hydrological stochastic generation sraj et al 2015 chen et al 2019 copula function is principally applied to identify the correlation between different variables it can be independent of the marginal distribution of variables and connect different marginal distributions which is flexible and simple chowdhary et al 2011 used the copula function to analyze two dimensional flood frequency and consider that clayton copula is the most reliable method to simulate the joint distribution of flood peak and flood volume lee and salas 2011 used a variety of copula functions to establish the internal correlation of hydrological series and utilize them to the annual runoff simulation of the nile river traditionally the current stochastic generation methods are based on statistical assumptions which are generated by monte carlo and latin hypercube sampling methods the problem with these methods is that the probability distribution of runoff series should be assumed in advance and it may not be applicable in practice in addition it is difficult for traditional stochastic generation methods to capture the nonlinear characteristics of high dimensional data which fails to meet the requirements of runoff generation for a reservoir system the copula function combined with the joint random sampling method is employed to make the joint distribution and randomly get a large sample of the runoff series this method overcomes the shortcoming of the traditional stochastic simulation method to analyze the correlation structure of time series however most of the current research on the stochastic generation with the copula function focuses on the two dimension copula function i e considering the correlation between the two variables at the time with the increase of the variables it would be much more difficult to model and estimate the variables of the copula function which is not suited for the runoff series with multiple periods correlation in time and multiple sites correlation in space simultaneously therefore with the rapid development of joint operation for a reservoir system the stochastic generation method of runoff series should not only consider the temporal correlation but also the spatial correlation between different reservoirs in the watershed it is urgent to develop a method that requires no assumption of the specific probability distribution and considers the spatial temporal correlation of runoff series the generative adversarial network gan a generative model has attracted extensive attention since it came out and has been applied in many fields zhang et al 2020 chen et al 2018 tang et al 2018 li et al 2017 the gan has evolved into nearly 500 improved versions since it was proposed the representative and widely used ones are deep convolutional generative adversarial network dcgan radford et al 2015 wasserstein generative adversarial network wgan arjovsky et al 2017 and sequence generative adversarial network seqgan yu et al 2017 the main characteristics of gan are as follows 1 the distribution of historical data can be directly learned and new samples can be generated without any premise of data distribution in advance 2 unsupervised learning is applied to avoid tedious manual annotation which is suitable for learning and generating large scale data sets to the best of our knowledge little work has been done in the field of runoff stochastic generation with the correlation of multiple periods in time and multiple sites in space simultaneously and without the assumptions of probability distributions regarding the existing problems of traditional hydrological stochastic generation technology and the advantages of gan in data generation this paper combines dcgan with wgan to form dc wgan which is applied to generate runoff series for a reservoir system the major contribution of this study is twofold 1 exploring the applicability of dc wgan in the field of runoff stochastic generation for a reservoir system from two aspects of samples statistical similarity and generalization performance 2 analyzing the spatial temporal correlation of runoff samples of dc wgan compared with the copula function the proposed framework is applied to the downstream jinsha river cascade and three gorges cascade reservoirs in china considering that the runoff stochastic generated in this paper is used for mid long term optimal operation of the reservoir system and the time scale of mid long term optimal operation is generally month or ten days the ten day scale is adopted for stochastic generation and analysis the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the proposed methodology this section has two subsections namely runoff stochastic generation model based on generative adversarial network and runoff stochastic generation model based on copula function section 3 describes a case study for a four reservoir system and the data set of model training the results and discussion of the case study are given in section 4 finally conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 runoff stochastic generation model based on generative adversarial network 2 1 1 generative adversarial network gan was proposed by ian goodfellow et al 2014 in 2014 it has been widely used in computer vision natural language processing and other fields inspired by the zero sum game in game theory gan achieves the best generation effect through the opposition between two networks i e generator network and discriminator network the structure of gan is shown in fig 1 the model is mainly composed of a generator network and a discriminator network the essence of these two networks is to express complex nonlinear relations and complex classify signals using deep neural networks dnns the difference is that the input of the generator network is a set of random noise and the generated samples are obtained by mapping the generator while the input of the discriminator is both the historical and the generated samples and the output is a probability value that represents the confidence of guessing whether the input is the original samples or the generated samples assuming that there are m reservoirs with n year historical runoff data and each year is divided into t periods the historical runoff data can be expressed as x i j t i 1 2 m j 1 2 n y e a r t 1 2 t the original distribution of historical data is represented by p data x given a set of random noise zp z z with known distribution e g gaussian distribution the two dnns in the training process are generator g z θ g and discriminator d x θ d respectively where θ g and θ d are the weight parameters of the two networks the goal of the generator is to make the generated samples as close to the distribution of the original samples as possible in order to cheat the discriminator while the goal of the discriminator is to distinguish the difference between the generated samples and the original samples as much as possible a dynamic game process is constituted by the generator and the discriminator the two networks compete with each other to improve their performance in the iterative process finally the samples consistent with the original samples are generated after setting the object of network training the loss functions of generator and discriminator are constructed respectively to train the network due to the larger output of the discriminator means the more realistic samples the generator is optimized to minimize the expectation of d g for a given discriminator on the other hand the discriminator is optimized to minimize the expectation of d g and maximize the expectation of original data d x for a given generator after taking logarithms the specific expression of loss function l g and l d is as follows 1 l g e zp z z log 1 d g z 2 l d e xp data x log d x e zp z z log 1 d g z combined with formula 1 and formula 2 the value function is established to form a minimax game model and its objective function is as follows 3 min θ g max θ d v g d e xp data x log d x e zp z z log 1 d g z in the early stage of network training the samples generated by the generator are very dissimilar from the original samples thus the discriminator can reject these samples with high confidence at this time l d is small l g and v g d is very large 2 1 2 improved generative adversarial network 2 1 2 1 problems of original generative adversarial network gan can produce better samples compared with other generation models however the original gan also has some problems such as unstable training and gradient disappearance the generator and discriminator of gan reach equilibrium in the process of gambling but it is difficult to make both networks converge to the optimal at the same time which leads to the instability of model training on the other hand the loss of the discriminator converges to 0 quickly when the discriminator is accurate so it fails to provide reliable information to update the gradient of the generator resulting in the disappearance of the generator gradient for the original gan the optimal discriminator with a fixed generator is as follows 4 d g x p data x p data x p g x where p data x is the distribution of original samples and p g x is the distribution of samples generated by the generator with the optimal discriminator the optimization objective of the generator is shown below 5 min θ g v g d e xp data x log d g x e zp z z log 1 d g g z e xp data x log d g x e xp g x log 1 d g x e xp data x log p data x p data x p g x e xp g x log p g x p data x p g x the above formula is transformed in the form of jensen shannon js divergence 6 min θ g v g d 2 log 2 2 j s p data p g where 7 js p 1 p 2 1 2 k l p 1 p 1 p 2 2 1 2 k l p 2 p 1 p 2 2 8 kl p 1 p 2 e xp 1 log p 1 p 2 it can be assured that if the discriminator is trained to the uttermost the training goal of the gan is to minimize the js divergence between the distribution of original samples p data and generated samples p g since it is almost impossible for p data and p g to overlap the js divergence of p data and p g is constant log 2 regardless of their distance which eventually leads to the gradient disappearance of the generator a number of improved gan are devoted to resolving the above problems among which dcgan and wgan are the most effective and widely used dcgan proposes a network architecture of generator and discriminator in the feature extraction layer of the two networks the convolutional neural network cnn is applied to replace the multilayer perceptron mlp in the original gan to improve its stability wgan improves the loss function of generator and discriminator and wasserstein distance is used to replace the js divergence in the original gan to reflect the distance between the original samples and generated samples 2 1 2 2 deep convolutional generative adversarial network the deep convolutional generative adversarial network dcgan is proposed to solve the problem that the original gan is unstable in the training process radford et al 2015 dcgan introduces cnns into the generator and discriminator of gan as shown in fig 2 as can be seen from fig 2 the generator projects a 100 dimensional noise vector into many feature maps in a small convolution representation space the random noise is reshaped into a 4 4 1024 matrix through a full connection layer and then expanded to a 64 64 3 matrix i e generated samples after four deconvolution layers with a 2 step length the discriminator converts the 64 64 3 matrix i e generated samples and original samples into a 4 4 1024 matrix through four convolution layers and then outputs a probability value from 0 to 1 through a full connection layer the advantage of dcgan lies in the fact that it uses some empirical network structure to make the confrontational training more stable its main improvements are as follows 1 the network can learn a more suitable spatial down sampling method through a stridden convolution layer instead of a pooling layer in addition convolution is used in the discriminator and deconvolution is used in the generator 2 batch normalization is applied to accelerate the learning and convergence of the model and reduce the dependence of network parameters on initialization 3 the hyperbolic tangent tanh activation function is used in the output layer of the generator while the rectified linear unit relu function is used in other layers and leakyrelu function is used in all layers of discriminator to avoid gradient sparsity the definitions of relu and leakyrelu functions are shown in equation 9 and equation 10 4 the output of the last convolution layer in the discriminator is sent to a sigmoid classifier 9 relu x max x 0 x x 0 0 x 0 0 10 leakyrelu x max x 0 x x 0 ax x 0 r where a 0 1 is a constant relu sets all negative values to zero whereas leakyrelu gives all negative values a non zero slope leakyrelu function is a variant of relu function 2 1 2 3 wasserstein generative adversarial network to avoid the gradient disappearance of the generator in the original gan arjovsky et al 2017 proposed wasserstein generative adversarial network wgan in 2017 wgan is a kind of generative adversarial network that optimizes training using wasserstein distance instead of js divergence compared with js divergence wasserstein distance can still reflect the distance of generated and original samples even if there is no overlap between them the form of wasserstein distance is as follows 11 w p data p g 1 k sup f l k e xp data x f x e xp g x f x where k is the lipschitz constant of the continuous function f and sup is the supremum thus the loss function of discriminator in wgan is as follows 12 l max ω w e xp data x f ω x e zp z z f ω g θ z let d f ω g g θ and change the upper formula into the lower one 13 l max d e xp data x d x e zp z z d g z the advantages of wgan are as follows 1 the better the discriminator is trained the better the generator is which greatly improved the stability of the original gan 2 mode collapse is avoided with positive effects on model robustness 2 1 3 model architecture and details of training considering the advantages of dcgan and wgan this paper combines dcgan with wgan abbreviated as dc wgan for short to generate stochastic runoff series of a reservoir system table 1 shows the model architecture of dc wgan in table 1 mlp denotes the multilayer perceptron while conv and conv transpose mean convolution layer and deconvolution layer respectively it can be seen that the generator and the discriminator feature an opposite network structure the generator includes two deconvolution layers for up sampling random noise z to generate runoff series while the discriminator includes two convolution layers for down sampling data from generated samples and original samples the hidden layer of generator and discriminator adopts relu and leakyrelu activation function respectively batch normalization is adopted to improve the robustness of the model to different hyperparameters table 2 presents the details of training the algorithm in table 2 is used to train dc wgan to generate the runoff series by means of batches a root mean square prop rmsprop algorithm is used to update the parameters of the generator and discriminator network ω is the weight of discriminator parameters clipping is used to truncate the absolute value of discriminator parameters to no more than a fixed constant c which can prevent the gradient explosion of the discriminator the dc wgan developed in this paper is written using tensorflow library of python 3 6 2 2 runoff stochastic generation model based on copula function 2 2 1 copula function copula was proposed and proved by sklar in 1959 sklar 1959 copula is a kind of function that combines the multiple variables from 0 to1 into a joint distribution which can effectively combine any marginal distribution for a continuous variable x d the marginal distribution function is f d x d the joint distribution function is h x 1 x 2 x d and the corresponding copula function is c 14 h x 1 x 2 x d c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f d x d c u 1 u 2 u d where u d f d x d and d 1 2 n the copula function with two variables is as follows 15 h x y c f x x f y y c x y where f x x and f y y are the marginal distribution functions of variables x and y respectively traditionally copula functions can be divided into elliptic copula quadratic copula and archimedean copula moreover archimedean copula can be further classified in symmetric and asymmetric type according to its structure the asymmetric archimedean copula function is simple in structure and contains only one parameter which is widely used in the field of hydrology there are three types of asymmetric archimedean copulas including gumbel copula clayton copula and frank copula which can be expressed as follows gumbel copula 16 c x y exp ln x θ ln y θ 1 θ θ 1 clayton copula 17 c x y x θ y θ 1 1 θ θ 0 frank copula 18 c x y 1 θ ln 1 e θ x 1 e θ y 1 e θ 1 θ r where θ is the parameter of the copula function 2 2 2 stochastic generation of copula function copula function is used to generate samples based on the inverse function of conditional probability by solving the conditional distribution between two variables at the adjacent periods the runoff series is randomly simulated combined with the monte carlo gibbs sampling method the process is shown in fig 3 step 1 optimization of marginal distribution functions selecting five kinds of marginal distribution functions commonly used in hydrological research to fit the runoff of each period i e gamma distribution pearson type iii distribution exponential distribution weibull distribution and lognormal distribution estimating parameters of each distribution function using the maximum likelihood method choosing the optimal distribution function of each period with the akaike information criterion aic step 2 optimization of copula functions selecting gumbel copula clayton copula and frank copula to construct the joint distribution of runoff in adjacent periods estimating parameters of each copula function using the maximum likelihood method choosing the optimal copula function of each adjacent period with the akaike information criterion aic step 3 stochastic generation of runoff series calculating the conditional probability of each adjacent period according to the optimal copula function of runoff between adjacent periods generating the frequency of runoff in each period using the gibbs sampling method transforming the frequency into the value of runoff by the optimal distribution function of runoff in each period in step 1 repeating step 3 until gibbs sampling is completed the generation of runoff series based on the copula function in this paper is performed by the r language 3 case study in this study the downstream jinsha river cascade and three gorges cascade reservoirs of china are selected as a case study including xiluodu xiangjiaba three gorges and gezhouba reservoirs xiluodu and xiangjiaba power stations are the first hydropower projects ever planned and developed in the mainstream of jinsha river and are also an important project for the development of western china the two hydropower stations form a cascade system with the three gorges and gezhouba hydropower stations on the mainstream of the yangtze river the cascade four reservoir system plays an extremely important role for the optimal allocation of water resources for the transmission of power from the west to the east in china the location and topologic structure of the four reservoir system is shown in fig 4 xiluodu and three gorges reservoirs have seasonal regulation capacity while xiangjiaba and gezhouba reservoirs have daily regulation capacity the stochastic generation of runoff series for the reservoir system can provide a large number of diverse runoff samples which is useful for more reasonably extracting the regulation rules from the reservoir system and guiding the optimal operation of cascade reservoirs scientifically taking the above mentioned reservoir system as an example the stochastic generation of runoff based on dc wgan is established and the spatial temporal correlation of the generated samples is verified by comparing with the copula method the runoff series of the reservoir system i e inflow to reservoir from 1940 to 2010 are used as data set for training and verification of dc wgan 90 i e series for 64 years historical runoff series were used as a training set and 10 i e series for 7 years as a validation set dc wgan is used to learn the historical ten day runoff samples and stochastically generate 3 000 ten day runoff samples after training the model the learning and generalization ability of dc wgan is analyzed from the statistical similarity and diversity of generated runoff samples similarly the above historical runoff data are used to generate runoff series based on copula function five distribution functions i e gamma distribution pearson type iii distribution exponential distribution weibull distribution and lognormal distribution commonly used in hydrology and three symmetric archimedean copula functions i e gumbel copula clayton copula and frank copula are selected and optimized the runoff series of adjacent periods of ten day is simulated by the gibbs sampling method 4 results and discussion 4 1 runoff series generation solution based on dc wgan the model architecture and algorithm of dc wgan in tables 1 and 2 are used to stochastically generate the runoff series of the reservoir system and the number of iterations is set to be 40 000 fig 5 illustrates the training evolution process of dc wgan it can be seen that the output of the discriminator for the original and generated samples is quite different see fig 5 a in the initial 10 000 iterations which shows that the discriminator can easily distinguish the source of the sample data in the later iterations the wasserstein distance between the distribution of the original and generated samples gradually converges to zero see fig 5 b the model is iterated to 40 000 times to illustrate that the whole training process is stable and the distribution of the final runoff samples will be very close to the original runoff samples a box scatter plot is shown in fig 6 to visually compare the annual runoff of original series and that of generated series from dc wgan it can be seen that the original and generated annual series are similar the 25 75 range and median line of the two series are essentially the same indicating that the dc wgan model can learn the basic characteristics of the original runoff series considering that the distance from xiluodu to xiangjiaba reservoirs and from three gorges to gezhouba reservoirs is relatively short see fig 4 runoff into the two reservoirs upstream is similar and so is runoff into the two reservoirs downstream see fig 6 therefore a single comparison between an upstream i e xiluodu reservoir and a downstream i e three gorges reservoirs runoff will be shown to verify the learning ability of dc wgan the frequency curves on original runoff series and generated runoff series of dc wgan are shown in fig 7 for comparison 64 samples are randomly selected from 3 000 generated runoff samples of dc wgan the number of which is the same as the original samples in fig 7 the blue dots and lines represent samples and frequency curves of the original runoff series while the yellow dots and lines are the generated runoff series the frequency curves are fitted by lognormal distribution function the frequency curves of the original and generated samples overlap almost completely indicating that dc wgan can generate runoff series with correct distribution to further verify the generalization capacity of dc wgan the runoff series from generated runoff samples which is most similar to the seven runoff series not involved in model training i e validation set are found using the euclidean distance among them three runoff series are shown in fig 8 these three runoff series are selected according to the amount of local inflow in the basin i e wet inflow year medium inflow year and dry inflow year dc wgan can still generate samples with a similar morphology to the verification set without using these samples to train the model indicating that dc wgan has a strong generalization ability the autocorrelation coefficient in fig 8 also verifies that dc wgan can capture the temporal correlation of the runoff series the calculation formula for the autocorrelation coefficient r τ concerning time lag τ is as follows 19 r τ i 1 n τ x i μ x i τ μ i 1 n x i μ 2 where x is the time series of the original or generated samples μ is the mean value of the time series and n is the total number of periods of the time series 4 2 temporal correlation to verify the temporal correlation of runoff series the pearson correlation coefficients ρ x y of original samples generated samples from dc wgan and copula are calculated the pearson correlation coefficient is a statistic that reflects the correlation degree between two variables and its calculation formula is as follows 20 ρ x y i 1 m x i x y i y i 1 m x i x 2 i 1 m y i y 2 where x and y are the mean value of variables x and y and m is the total number of samples fig 9 illustrates the heat map for the temporal correlation of original samples generated samples from dc wgan and copula respectively the results from fig 9 verify the following points 1 among the original runoff samples there is a strong correlation from 1 to 10 periods and from 30 to 36 periods in xiluodu reservoir while the runoff series from 11 to 29 periods only has a strong correlation with its adjacent periods and a moderate or weak correlation with other periods accordingly each period of runoff in the three gorges reservoir and its two or three adjacent periods are highly correlated with the remaining periods having a moderate or weak correlation 2 the runoff series generated by dc wgan can not only learn the strong correlation of the original runoff series but also capture the moderate or weak correlation between periods especially for the runoff over 10 intervals dc wgan can learn its correct correlation 3 although the runoff series generated by copula can only consider the temporal correlation between two adjacent periods at a time it can also capture the strong correlation of cross period because of its conditional probability passing forward in time series however the correlation of its generated series is weaker than the original series and generated series from dc wgan due to the correlation is passed forward rather than directly learnt moreover the generation method based on copula cannot capture the moderate or weak correlation between periods so it shows no correlation 4 3 spatial correlation to verify the spatial correlation of runoff series the spatial correlation coefficients of ten day runoff for xiluodu and three gorges reservoirs are calculated based on the original samples generated samples from dc wgan and copula as shown in fig 10 the spatial correlation coefficients of annual runoff series based on these three kinds of samples are 0 67 0 65 and 0 01 respectively fig 10 shows that for the original samples the spatial correlation coefficients of ten day runoff and annual runoff are 0 23 0 80 respectively accordingly for the generated samples from dc wgan the spatial correlation coefficients of ten day runoff and annual runoff are 0 07 0 71 respectively and for the generated samples from copula the spatial correlation coefficients of ten day runoff and annual runoff are 0 03 0 03 respectively it is obvious that the runoff series of xiluodu and the three gorges reservoirs show a strong spatial correlation dc wgan can learn the spatial correlation of the runoff series between reservoirs but the generation method based on copula cannot capture the spatial correlation of the runoff series between different reservoirs 5 conclusions stochastic generation of runoff series can provide a large number of diverse runoff samples for the implicit stochastic optimization which is the premise for scientifically guiding the joint optimal operation of a reservoir system the traditional stochastic generation method of runoff series is difficult to capture the nonlinear features of high dimensional data and cannot consider the temporal and spatial correlation of runoff at the same time therefore this paper proposes the generative adversarial network called dc wgan to generate the runoff series of a reservoir system considering the advantages of the generative adversarial network in data generation taking the downstream jinsha river cascade and three gorges cascade reservoirs in china as an example the stochastic generation of ten day runoff for the reservoir system is carried out and compared with the generation method based on copula function the following conclusions are drawn 1 dc wgan can generate runoff series with a correct distribution which not only meets the statistical similarity of the original samples but also generates runoff processes with a full diversity of behaviors 2 dc wgan has a strong generalization ability which can generate runoff series with similar morphology in the validation set and capture the temporal correlation of runoff series 3 compared with the generation method of the copula function dc wgan does not need to assume the probability distribution of samples in advance besides dc wgan can simultaneously consider the correlation of multiple periods in time and multiple sites in space for the runoff series of the reservoir system a large number of runoff samples with spatial temporal correlation of the reservoir system can be generated at one time using a generative adversarial network instead of iterating many times in the form of a markov chain this method has strong operability and is easy to expand increasing the dimension of the original runoff series hardly increases the calculation workload of the model moreover dc wgan can train any kind of generated network without assuming the form of probability distribution instead it can generate samples by continuously approaching the real data distribution through adversarial learning it provides a cost effective solution for the stochastic generation of runoff series with spatial temporal correlation however this paper only compares the performance of dc wgan model with copula method at ten day time scale future research can be devoted to the deep analysis of dc wgan model compared with other more classical and efficient methods e g hidden markov processes and autoregressive model for the runoff stochastic generation at different time scales e g decadal annual and daily time scales 6 data

3737,located within the transition zone between the monsoon and westerlies circulation system the northeastern tibetan plateau netp is a critical region for understanding the alternative roles of various atmospheric moisture sources in local precipitation and the resultant hydrological divergences yet determination of contributions of the recycled moisture and the summer monsoonal flows to the local precipitation remain ambiguous in this study daily time series precipitation isotope data for three consecutive years 2016 2018 at two representative sites huangyuan hy and gangcha gc on the netp were analyzed the results reveal remarkable seasonal variations in the precipitation isotopes δ2h and δ18o on the netp which were alternatively influenced by local climate conditions and the transitions of moisture sources much lower slopes 8 and intercepts 10 of the daily based local meteoric water lines lmwls at both sites suggested that sub cloud evaporation of raindrops and monsoonal activities exerted significant influences in local precipitation local climatic conditions partially modulated the isotopes of precipitation and during entire study period at hy however they exhibited weak impacts on the isotopes of precipitation at gc indicating different controlling factors and diverse moisture sources between the two sites combined the isotopic data and the hysplit model results we found that the westerly the recycled moisture and the summer monsoon circulation alternatively influenced the isotopic composition of precipitation between june and august the recycled fractions accounted for 0 11 6 monthly mean 5 1 7 0 and 0 20 2 monthly mean 3 1 7 3 of the monthly precipitation at hy and gc respectively notably we demonstrated that both the east asian summer monsoon easm and the indian summer monsoon ism reached the netp and contributed considerable moistures to the local precipitation as many as 87 0 mm and 62 2 mm of precipitation were generated from monsoonal water vapor in 2016 which accounted for 14 96 and 9 93 of the annual total amounts at hy and gc these findings provide a better understanding of the interactions between atmospheric water vapor and precipitation and the roles of monsoonal activities in local climates both of which are beneficial for interpreting paleo climate reconstruction on the tp keywords precipitation isotopes recycled

watershed hydrology and regional water resource management for agriculture drought relief flood control and forecasting huffman and klepp 2011 li et al 2018 under the changing climate the atmospheric circulation regimes and moisture recycling processes have been particularly altered which has considerably changed the transportation and trajectories of the water vapor osipova and osipov 2016 kostrova et al 2020 gimeno et al 2020 and has ultimately caused spatial temporal variations in the precipitation maussion et al 2014 these variations have driven the local changes in the hydrological cycle dagan et al 2019 and have exert marked influences on the ecosystem stability especially in semi arid and arid regions du et al 2019 accordingly understanding the atmospheric water cycle and the sources of the precipitation water in semi arid zones where water resources drive the distribution and activities of human populations is particularly crucial and can help forecast the extreme hydroclimatic events caused by sudden regional changes in the precipitation ansari et al 2020 gimeno et al 2020 the tibetan plateau tp is referred to as the asian water tower due to its plentiful precipitation and extensive cryosphere yao et al 2012 yao et al 2013 immerzeel et al 2010 in terms of its higher elevations and extensively variable topography the tp is a key region that imposes profound impacts on the atmospheric water cycle and energy budget of asia yao et al 2013 the precipitation over the tp is mutually influenced by large scale atmospheric circulations and associated local moisture recycling ma et al 2018a in recent decades the tp has become wetter and warmer overall kuang and jiao 2016 causing spatial temporal variability of the moisture sources and resultant changes in the regional formation and spatial distribution of the precipitation wang et al 2008 which directly regulate the streamflow and runoff of the major asian rivers zhang et al 2013 the northeastern tibetan plateau netp is located in the monsoonal margin region and its climate has experienced more extensive warmer and wetter shifts than the other regions of the tp during the past three decades kuang and jiao 2016 tang et al 2020 the substantial changes in the local precipitation are responsible for the dramatic variations in the lake levels and runoff chen et al 2015 fan et al 2021 as a boundary of the summer monsoons on the tp the precipitation in this region is controlled by the east asian summer monsoon easm the indian summer monsoon ism and the westerlies circulation yang et al 2014 thus this area is very sensitive to changes in the summer monsoon intensity and is an ideal location for climate change studies wu et al 2020a previous studies have connected the past climate evolution hydrological processes and biological cycles with monsoonal activities ji et al 2005 chen et al 2016 yang et al 2014 cui and li 2015 however most of these studies did not distinguish between the easm and ism well and only broadly referred to them as summer monsoons ma et al 2020 this is because the monsoonal incursion is hard to capture and is more difficult to partition using large scale regional climate models due to the weak and variable signals and sparse observations in this monsoonal margin region immerzeel et al 2010 guo et al 2015a however to date few studies have focused on quantitatively determining the respective influence of easm and ism to local precipitation ma et al 2020 additionally recycled moisture is a key part of the atmospheric water vapor balance on the tp cui and li 2015 and it can provide more precipitable water vapor to local regions ma et al 2018b the netp located in the transition zone between the hinterland of the tp and the arid region of northwestern china guo et al 2015a is the important headwater region of many inland rivers and supplies over 80 of surface water resources to the oases in the hexi corridor yao et al 2017 under the climate warming and wetting conditions on the netp the contributions of recycled moisture to the local precipitation are becoming more and more important tang et al 2020 therefore understanding the roles of the easm ism and recycled moisture in local precipitation is of great significance for forecasting precipitation dynamics water resource management chen et al 2020 and facilitating paleo climate reconstruction on the tp wu et al 2020a despite these advances in our understanding of the precipitation dynamics on the netp the majority of previous studies focused on either specific months or annual scales over the netp zhao and zhou 2021 and investigations on seasonal and inter annual variations in the contributions of recycled to local precipitation have not been conducted due to a lack of continuous hydrometeorological parameter data tian et al 2020 the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes and d excess d excess δ2h 8δ18o of precipitation have been broadly used in hydrological and climatological studies dansgaard 1964 araguás araguás et al 1998 they are generally considered to be valuable tools for understanding atmospheric circulation cycle araguás araguás et al 1998 guo et al 2019 determining the moisture sources of local precipitation guo et al 2015b yang et al 2017 and quantifying the contributions of regional and local sources to precipitation gat 1996 kong et al 2013 generally spatial temporal variations in the stable isotope compositions of precipitation are tightly correlated with the local air temperature relative humidity precipitation amount dansgaard 1964 cui and li 2015 tian et al 2020 and circulation patterns guo et al 2017 knowledge of these climatic parameters controlling the isotopic composition of precipitation is also indispensable for paleo climate studies for example ice cores lake sediments tree rings and soil carbonates chen et al 2016 remarkably stable isotope ratios and their relationships not only have the potential to show ongoing changes in the hydrological cycle but they are very important to understanding the present and past climate systems in recent decades the back trajectory models and the stable isotope compositions of precipitation have provided valuable information about the moisture sources and atmospheric circulation patterns that give rise to rainfall and have been demonstrated to be an effective means of investigating complex hydrological processes ansari et al 2020 bedaso et al 2020 high frequency daily precipitation isotope sampling provides the opportunity to investigate the climate isotope relationship seasonality and influences of the moisture sources and trajectories on the δ18o δ2h and d excess values of precipitation which is highly important for understanding the dynamic processes of individual precipitation events and the for linking the isotopic signal to synoptic weather conditions according to previous studies of precipitation isotopes on the tp and in other regions the monthly average isotopic values of precipitation are much smaller than the daily level yao et al 2013 tian et al 2020 bailey et al 2019 which smooth over much of the important information about the controls of synoptic climatic conditions on precipitation isotopes e g the incursion of monsoonal vapor the leaching effect and sometimes extreme precipitation due to local climate changes accordingly three consecutive years 2016 2018 of daily precipitation sampling was conducted at two different locations on the netp for stable isotopic analysis δ18o δ2h the goals of this study were to capture the isotopic variability of the precipitation and its controlling factors 2 to reveal the different moisture sources of the precipitation 3 to identify the contributions of the easm ism and recycled moisture to the precipitation in different months during the warm seasons monthly average ta 0 the results of this comprehensive investigation provide a better understanding of the moisture sources of the precipitation and will improve interpretations of paleo climate records in the region in addition these results have major implications for the regional water vapor budget and hydrological processes on the netp 2 study area the netp is located in the monsoonal margin region which is the intersection zone of the eastern asian monsoon region the northwestern arid region and the alpine tp chen et al 2016 it has pronounced continental climate characteristic including broad variations in air temperature ta and precipitation cui and li 2015 here we selected two sites with different climate conditions and geographic locations fig 1 in which the precipitation is derived from different water vapor transportation systems the gangcha area gc 37 33 n 100 13 e 3302 m is located on the north bank of qinghai lake basin fig 1 is the important water conservation area in the qilian mountains as well as the ecological function area of the qinghai lake basin the climate in the gc is typically classified as plateau continental climate the huangyuan area hy 36 68 n 101 23 e 2635 m is located at the eastern foot of riyue mountain fig 1 it is the source area of the huangshui river and supplies the majority of the agriculture and domestic water for most of the cities on the netp it is the transition area between continental monsoon and non monsoon regions and is also the region of joint inland and plateau climates in comparison the precipitation in the gc is easily influenced by the evaporated moisture from qinghai lake and the indian summer monsoon ism however hy is blocked by riyue mountain fig 1 which weakens the transport of the ism according to the meteorological records for 1960 2012 the average annual air temperatures are 0 22 c and 3 3 c for gc and hy respectively hu et al 2021 80 of the precipitation occurs between may and october in the gc and hy cui and li 2015 and the average annual precipitation amounts are 382 mm and 409 mm in gc and hy respectively hu et al 2021 the temporal spatial differences in the precipitation at both sites are remarkable due to their complex moisture sources the influence of qinghai lake the blocking effect of the high alpine mountains and the elevation differences wu et al 2020b in addition the local recycled moisture makes an important contribution to the precipitation ma et al 2018b in this study in order to explore the contributions of the summer monsoon and recycled moisture we divided the hydrological year into the warm season and the cold season the warm season was defined as the months with positive monthly average air temperatures ta 0 c while the months with negative ta were defined as the cold season 3 data and methods 3 1 daily precipitation sampling and local meteorological data determination daily precipitation samples were collected from november 2015 to december 2018 in the hy and gc the precipitation collectors were manually constructed according to international atomic energy agency global network of isotopes in precipitation iaea gnip precipitation sampling guide http www naweb iaea org napc ih documents other gnip manual v2 02 en hq pdf the collector was installed on the roof 8 m above the ground to avoid the contamination of soil and windblown snow from previous events all of the precipitation from 20 00 on one day to 20 00 on the next day was defined as a precipitation event and a sample was collected liquid samples rainfall were immediately collected to minimize the effects of evaporation winter snow samples were collected in pre cleaned plastic bags and were melted at room temperature 25 c before being transferred to hdpe bottles some light rain and short time rain snow events were collected using a wide mouth stainless steel plate in order to collect as much sample as possible for analysis before the sampling the bottles were washed three times with rain water and then rapidly filled if multiple precipitation events occurred in one day the samples during each event were collected separately and then mixed to represent the average level for that day all of the bottles were filled up without bubbles and sealed with a layer of paraffin each bottle was labeled with the location information collection time and date all of the samples were stored at 4 c and shipped to the laboratory of isotope hydrology at the key laboratory of ecohydrology of inland river basin chinese academy of sciences cas each sample was pretreated to remove the impurities by using disposable filters and 2 ml analytical vial was completely filling for the isotopic analysis within 6 months a total of 99 97 and 111 samples were collected in 2016 2017 and 2018 in the hy respectively a total of 105 51 and 77 samples were obtained in 2016 2017 and 2018 in the gc respectively all of the samples were preserved in hdpe bottles and stored in a fridge at 4 c until the isotopic analysis the local climate parameters were observed hourly at the hy and gc national meteorological sites the daily air temperature precipitation and relative humidity corresponding to each precipitation event were used in this study in addition the vapor pressure deficit vpd for each precipitation sample was calculated saturation vapor pressure minus actual vapor pressure where the saturation vapor pressure actual vapor pressure relative humidity 100 wu et al 2015 3 2 stable isotope analysis the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope values of the water samples were determined using the gv isoprime continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer cf irms at the key laboratory of ecohydrology of inland river basin chinese academy of sciences irms is the benchmark technique for stable isotope analysis of plants and soil water a syringe sge syringe 1 μl fitted to the liquid auto sampler pulls up 0 4 μl of water from a septum sealed sample vial 2 ml positioned in an auto sampler containing 110 spots when analyzing the stable isotope composition of water 0 3 μl of water was injected into a heated septum housing 140 c using the automated microliter syringe the resulting water vapor was flushed by a constant flow of ultra high purity helium 130 ml min via a stainless steel probe extending 15 cm into a quartz reactor tube maintained at 1050 c the stable oxygen isotope ratios of the samples were measured using the co2 h2o equilibration method in which about a millimole amount of co2 10 to 20 ml is brought into isotopic equilibrium with a few microliters of sample water similarly the 2h 1h ratio of a water sample can be converted to h2 via isotopic exchange using platinum wire as the catalyst five laboratory reference standards with distinct isotopic compositions were developed by nanjing university for calibration with δ18o values of 19 49 13 39 7 94 2 69 and 9 89 and δ2h values of 154 0 97 3 51 6 9 2 100 6 which are referenced to the international vienna standard mean ocean water standard light antarctic precipitation vsmow slap scale craig 1961 to achieve both a good repeatability and a good reproducibility we conducted a stability test on the analyzer before the sample analysis we prepared 14 distilled or tap water samples for stable isotope analysis the precisions of the δ18o and δ2h values were calculated by calculating the 1 sigma standard deviation of groups of 12 injections and then calculating the average of these standard deviations the drift of the analyzer was determined by taking the mean of these same 12 groups of measurements and calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum means all of these measured precision and drift values were less than those of the guaranteed values indicating that the analyzer exhibited a high stability before the analyzing the weighted average values δwa were calculated for the monthly and annual average δ18o and δ2h values at both sites as follows eq 1 1 δ wa i 1 n p i δ i i 1 n p i where pi is the daily precipitation amount which is the daily average data collected at the meteorological station and δi is the stable isotope δ18o and δ2h of the daily precipitation sample the deuterium excess d excess was used to indicate the deviation from the global meteoric water line gmwl which was calculated as follows eq 2 2 d excess δ2h 8 δ18o 3 3 hysplit model calculation the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model http ready arl noaa gov hysplit php noaa 2018 with the main input parameters of air temperature wind speed pressure and solar radiation stein et al 2015 was used to identify the transportation trajectory of the water vapor and the origin of the air masses transporting to the study area this model clarifies the direction of the wind moisture source sodemann et al 2008 the meteorological data from global data assimilation system 1 gdas 1 were used to identify the probable moisture provenance in addition 10 day 240 h air parcel backward trajectories were calculated for the monthly precipitation events recorded in the study areas hy and gc using the hysplit model the daily back trajectories of the air masses were calculated and cluster analysis was conducted to group these back trajectories according to their directions speeds the separation of the same air masses was conducted based on their centroid lengths cluster mean trajectories to identify the dominant sources of moisture entering the region stein et al 2015 4 results 4 1 temporal variations in the stable isotope composition of the precipitation on the netp stable isotopes δ18o δ2h and d excess of the daily precipitation fluctuated substantially in the hy and the gc during the study period fig 2 in the hy the daily δ18o values ranged from 23 08 to 12 23 and the δ2h varied from 171 3 to 74 4 with amount weighted values of 8 63 and 57 3 for δ18o and δ2h respectively table 1 the d excess values in the hy ranged from 30 7 to 33 2 with an average of 11 7 in the gc the δ18o values varied from 30 42 to 6 71 the δ2h values ranged from 227 9 to 59 1 and the d excess varied from 29 1 to 33 0 with amount weighted average values of 7 95 53 2 and 10 4 respectively table 1 remarkably seasonal trends were observed at both sites fig 2 higher δ18o and δ2h values occurred from january to the end of may accompanied by lower d excess values fig 2 which was related to sub cloud evaporation guan et al 2013 in contrast the precipitation exhibited substantially negative δ18o and δ2h trends between june and august during the three observation years fig 2 the d excess fluctuated around the global average line of 10 fig 2 suggesting the combined effects of monsoonal incursion with lower d excess and recycled moisture leading to increased d excess fröhlich et al 2002 bershaw et al 2012 after september the δ18o and δ2h values tended to be positive and the d excess exhibited much higher values fig 2 this is attributed to be the prevailing westerlies tian et al 2005 guan et al 2013 and recycled moisture bershaw et al 2012 however this conclusion cannot be confirmed using only stable isotopes and more evidences are presented in the following discussion in addition the inter annual variability in the stable isotope composition of the precipitation was significant at both sites during the three years fig 2 table 1 the highest δ18o and δ2h values lower d excess occurred in 2017 and the most negative mean values occurred in 2018 table 1 this was due to the inter variability of the local climate conditions i e air temperature precipitation amounts and relative humidity fig 2 and the resultant changes in the transpiration and recycled moisture during three years much less precipitation was observed in 2017 at both sites table 1 fig 2 which made sub cloud evaporation much easier thereby resulting in the enrichment of heavier isotopes 18o 2h in the precipitation froehlich et al 2008 4 2 characteristics of local meteoric water lines lmwls on the netp the relationship between δ18o and δ2h defined as the local meteoric water line lmwl provides a useful tool for comparing seasonal and spatial isotopic variations among different regions bedaso et al 2020 here we have calculated lmwls during the whole observation period for the two sites fig 3 as well as for the individual year table 1 using the daily isotopic data during three years 2016 2018 the ordinary least square regression olsr method has been used the lmwl at hy and gc is determined to be δ2h 7 50 0 1 δ18o 7 16 0 90 r2 0 95 and δ2h 7 50 0 11 δ18o 7 16 1 03 r2 0 95 they exhibited lower slopes which are indistinguishable from the gmwl fig 3 generally local transpiration of soil plant and surface water and the sub cloud evaporation both play remarkable roles in decreasing the slopes of lmwls putman et al 2019 in specific the lmwls of the precipitation in each year varied table 1 which suggests yearly differences in the local evaporation of raindrops and alternations of the moisture sources although the lmwls have similar slopes their intercepts varied during three years at both sites table 1 reflecting the changing d excess controlled by the moisture sources and the re evaporation of raindrops dansgaard 1964 the highest intercepts exhibited in 2016 at both sites which were consistent with the highest d excess in 2016 table 1 the lower intercept and the corresponding lower d excess may be the result of upwind processes including mixing and rayleigh distillation mechanisms putman et al 2019 in addition although both sites are located on the netp the slopes and intercepts of the lmwls are different from those δ2h 7 86 δ18o 15 01 reported in large scale areas in the qinghai lake region on the netp this is because most of the sampling sites recorded by cui and li 2015 are distributed to the northwest of qinghai lake and thus the westerlies circulations and recycled moisture from this large lake easily reach these sites which resulted in higher d excess gat et al 1994 cui and li 2015 yang et al 2016 4 3 contribution of monthly recycled moisture to local precipitation on netp we quantitatively estimated the monthly fractions of the recycled moisture on the netp using the two end member mixing model suggested by froehlich et al 2008 section 1 1 in supplementary material generally in the hy the recycled fraction constituted 0 0 to 11 6 of the total precipitation with an average value of 6 1 during study period in the gc the recycled fractions contributed 0 0 to 20 2 among three years with an average value of 5 7 evidently higher recycled fractions were showing in september and october at both sites table 2 in addition the monthly mean values of stable isotopes δ18o δ2h and d excess are presented in table 2 for comparison overall the more positive δ18o and δ2h and higher d excess values corresponded to larger recycled fractions at the two sites table 2 suggesting higher relative humidity and weak re evaporation of raindrops under clouds other studies have also reported distinct high d excess values for precipitation events affected by large lakes supporting the substantial influence of recycled moisture on local precipitation gat et al 1994 cui and li 2015 corcoran et al 2019 4 4 remarkable monsoon signals recorded by the water vapor trajectories in order to trace the monsoon activities involving into the local precipitation the monthly trajectories model was conducted as is shown the ism and the easm distinctly intruded into the netp during the warm seasons and transported considerable water vapor to both sites figs s1 s2 generally these monsoonal activities mainly occurred in august 2016 accounting for 20 of the total back trajectories and in june 11 july 4 and august 2017 13 at hy fig s1 for comparison they arrived more frequently at gc they accounted for 13 and 12 of the total back trajectories in july and august 2016 the ratios are 10 and 9 in june and july 2017 and the contributing ratios are 14 in august 2018 fig s2 however due to the long distance and blocking of high mountains on the tp some of the monsoonal signals arriving at the netp could be weaken and even be smoothed on monthly scale accordingly the route of the monsoonal derived water vapors in typical single precipitation events was depicted to precisely detect the monsoonal signals a total of 9 precipitation events were identified which were completely influenced by the monsoonal intrusion fig 4 for comparison the gc was more affected by the monsoonal transportation i e ism and easm this was because the gc is located father west than the hy fig 1 and there is no mountain blocking effect on the gc fig 1 which could prevent the transportation of the monsoonal air masses and the resultant rainfall in contrast the hy is located to the east of riyue mountain fig 1 which to some degree attenuates the incursion of the ism however strong ism activities were still observed in the hy after preferentially visiting the gc i e in june 2017 fig s1 in contrast the easm can arrive at both sites figs s1 s2 this air mass was directly transported from the china sea to the hy over a short distance 5 discussion 5 1 factors controlling the isotopic composition of the precipitation 5 1 1 combined effect of local climate conditions on precipitation δ18o as shown in fig 2 the seasonal trends were remarkable this is speculated to be related to the transitions in the moisture sources the influences of the local climatic conditions yao et al 2013 cui and li 2015 yang et al 2017 and the local recycled moisture zhu et al 2020 in order to clarify the combined effect of all of the climate factors on the isotopic composition of the precipitation the multiple linear regression analysis was conducted for the hy and gc the correlation is significant at hy δ18o 0 336 ta 0 124 p 0 083 rh 3 719 n 307 r2 0 2 p 0 05 however there is nearly no relations p 0 05 between precipitation δ18o and local meteorological factors evidently the combined impacts of ta p and rh can explain 20 of the variations in the precipitation δ18o in the hy however the variations in the precipitation δ18o in the gc exhibit extremely weak correlations with ta p and rh accordingly we suggest that the variations and fluctuations in the isotopic composition in the precipitation in the gc were probably controlled by the moisture sources unlike the hy the gc is located adjacent to qinghai lake 14 km apart and the evaporative moisture from this large lake exerts substantial influence on the distribution and source of the precipitation previous studies have also demonstrated the considerable influence of large lakes on the precipitation xu et al 2011 cui and li 2015 and have shown that the local recycled moisture makes an important contribution to the precipitation tian et al 2001b 5 1 2 influence of convective processes on precipitation isotopes in order to determine the influence of the convective processes on the local precipitation outgoing longwave radiation olr data obtained by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa satellites were used to examine the large scale convection activity over the region fig 5 a previous study suggested that large scale convection activities corresponded to lower olr values usually 240 w m 2 gadgil 2003 and lower stable isotope values tang et al 2015 guo et al 2017 ahmed et al 2020 in our study the temporal variations in the precipitation δ18o in the hy and the gc exhibit several negative peaks which correspond to the larger precipitation amounts fig 2 during the warm seasons in the three years according to the olr diagrams the intra seasonal variations in the precipitation δ18o occurred during or after the passage of convective clouds fig 5 in contrast the high precipitation δ18o values mainly correspond to higher olr values fig 5 suggesting an inactive phase in the convection activity at both sites thus we conclude that the temporal variations in the precipitation δ18o at both sites may be influenced by the occurrence of large scale convection activity 5 2 moisture sources of the precipitation on the netp generally the divergences in the slopes and intercepts of the lmwls can be used to distinguish the moisture sources putman et al 2019 in order to trace the moisture sources of the precipitation on the netp the lmwls of the different sites on the tp were summarized for comparison as suggested the slopes increased gradually from the northern slope of the himalaya dingri monsoonal zone to the inner tp delingha westerly zone reflecting the transition in the moisture sources between the monsoons india monsoon and east asia monsoon the westerlies and local recycled moisture tian et al 2001a according to yao et al 2009 the netp is located in the marginal zone between the westerlies and monsoons north of 35 n where a higher slope 8 would be expected however this regular pattern was broken table 3 because the slopes of the lmwls on the netp are lower 8 than those of delingha and the kunlun mountain pass in the westerlies zone and beiluhe and tuotuohe in the transition zone table 3 it suggests the prevalence of non equilibrium fractionation processes evaporation during transportation of the moisture and the falling of raindrops dansgaard 1964 araguás araguás et al 1998 and the effect of great lakes gat et al 1994 cui and li 2015 in addition the slopes on the netp are identical to those of lhasa and dingri implying the input of oceanic water vapor tian et al 2001b the probable influence of monsoons tian et al 2020 and significant sub cloud evaporation of raindrops araguás araguás et al 1998 zhao et al 2011 putman et al 2019 accordingly the hysplit model was used to determine the pathway and origin of air masses to the study area during the warm seasons from may to october among three consecutive years considering the prevalence of the westerlies in the cold seasons on the netp cui and li 2015 wu et al 2020b the model results indicated three possible vapor sources fig s1 s2 the predominant source was westerly circulation wc which was prevalent during the whole period from may to october the cold and dry air moved out of the tp to the north east and south araguás araguás et al 1998 which resulted in a much lower humidity fig 2 and less precipitable water cui and li 2015 in addition the local recycled moistures from the inland areas contributed considerable moistures to local precipitation fig s1 s2 generally the precipitation generated by recycled moistures always resulted in more positive δ18o and higher d excess table 2 this has also been reported in previous studies on the tp cui and li 2015 this kind of circulation pattern is mainly linked with the transportation of the westerlies polar air masses and the formation of snow jouzel et al 1982 interestingly the incursion of monsoon was captured by the hysplit model which including ism from the bay of bengal and the easm from china sea fig s1 s2 most of the monsoonal activities were concentrated in july and august at both sites fig s1 s2 which are consistent with the prevalence time of monsoon on the tp yao et al 2009 2013 especially the model results captured 11 and 10 of the total back trajectories originating from the ism in june 2017 in the hy and the gc respectively figs s1 s2 we propose that the ism reached the netp in june 2017 was very strong 5 2 1 seasonal differences in the import of recycled moisture to the netp based on the calculated results table 2 the monthly variations in the recycled fractions were comprehensively compared with the local climatic conditions during the warm season fig 6 the recycled fractions were much larger in september and october during the three years which corresponded lower evaporation rates of raindrop lower air temperatures blue bars in fig 6 and a higher relative humidity table 2 this indicates that the sub cloud evaporation was weak due to the lower air temperatures during september and october and the abundant recycled moisture originating from the upwind regions and qinghai lake cui and li 2015 contained higher rh which increased the d excess values of the precipitation froehlich et al 2008 xu et al 2011 bowen et al 2012 in contrast the recycled fractions were smaller in may june july and august which is consistent with the higher raindrop evaporation rates higher air temperatures green bars in fig 6 and a lower relative humidity table 2 the lower recycled fractions in may and june are attributed to the lower air temperatures which greatly reduced the local lake evaporation as well as caused by the westerlies transportation with lower relative humidity in july and august although the air temperature gradually increased the recycled fractions were lower fig 6 table 2 this may be related to the intrusion of the easm cui and li 2015 which brought considerable water vapor with negative isotope values δ18o δ2h to the netp and offset the local evaporation more specifically the recycled fraction in the gc exhibited a stable trend during the different months compared to those in the hy fig 6 this suggests incursion of monsoonal moisture and the significant influence of the large lake the gc near the qinghai lake 14 km was more susceptible to this large lake and could easily receive the water vapor from the ism however the hy was blocked by riyue mountain fig 1 which prevented a portion of the water vapor from the evaporation of qinghai lake and the monsoonal moisture from reaching this area thus the precipitation in the hy was somewhat controlled by the long distance westerlies and local recycled moisture the fluctuations in the recycled fractions in the hy may be the result of transitions in the local climatic conditions and the mixing of moisture from upwind regions with inland water moisture 5 2 2 influences of remarkable monsoonal incursion on the local precipitation as is shown by the monthly trajectories model fig s1 s2 the intrusions of the ism and the easm were observed on the netp during the warm seasons we compared the d excess values of the monthly precipitation in westerlies dominated zones delingha and hetian tian et al 2005 transition zones beiluhe yang et al 2017 and monsoon dominated zones nagqu and lhasa tian et al 2001c tian et al 2020 on the tp fig 7 remarkably between june and august the lower d excess values at our sites were comparable to these in nagqu and lhasa pink bars in fig 7 indicating the distinct impact of the monsoonal incursion on the local precipitation the onset of the monsoon in the earlier summer months transported water vapor with a higher humidity leading to lower d excess values tian et al 2001c liu et al 2008 in order to further analyze the influence of monsoon on netp the stable isotope signals of monsoonal derived precipitation events selected according to the trajectories model fig 3 as well as the corresponding climatic parameters were compared table 4 it is clear that most of these monsoonal derived precipitation events exhibit more negative isotopic values and higher relative humidity table 4 generally the water vapor from the indian ocean moved northeastward uplifting on to the himalayas and continued to the gc and hy the heavier isotopes in the moisture were gradually depleted due to rainout during the moisture transport resulting in the negative δ18o values of the subsequent precipitation araguás araguás et al 1998 tian et al 2005 tian et al 2020 the easm belongs to the pacific monsoon domain and is triggered by land sea temperature differences which are caused by differential solar heating and the thermal inertia of the land and ocean under these conditions a low level flow of moisture is transported from the pacific ocean to eastern china and then to the netp araguás araguás et al 1998 remarkably although only 9 precipitation events were observed which were directly originated from monsoonal activities not including the mixing sources from three sources as many as 104 6 mm at hy and 71 9 mm at gc of precipitation were generated during one precipitation event table 4 emphasized the considerable contributions of monsoonal incursion to local precipitation notably we observed important vapor trajectories of the easm 20 in the hy in august 2016 fig s1 which generated an abundant precipitation event pp 64 6 mm on august 18 2016 fig 3 similarly the easm reached gc in both 2016 and 2018 and 33 6 mm of precipitation were occurred table 4 in addition the gc was more affected by the monsoonal activities especially the ism this was because the gc is located father west than the hy fig 1 and there is no mountain blocking effect in the gc fig 1 which could prevent the transportation of the monsoonal air masses and the resultant rainfall in contrast the hy is located to the east of riyue mountain fig 1 which to some degree attenuates the incursion of the ism however strong ism activities were still observed in the hy after preferentially visiting the gc table 4 during the eastward transportation of the ism the original isotopically negative air masses experienced evaporation and mixing with evaporated vapor in the local area during its long distance transportation and subsequent uplift over riyue mountain finally it gradually became enriched in 18o and 2h after long distance transportation to the hy table 4 in contrast the easm arrived almost simultaneously at both sites table 4 this air mass was directly transported from the china sea to the hy over a short distance fig s1 without leaching and moisture loss and thus the precipitation had higher δ18o and δ2h signals table 4 however during the long conveyance from the hy to the gc the initially isotopically positive air masses became progressively depleted in 18o and 2h due to the leaching effect and mixing with isotopically negative evaporated water vapor above large lake which resulted in the gradual depletion of 18o table 4 6 research limitations we studied the evolution of the isotopic composition of the precipitation on the netp on the daily scale which is useful for interpreting the regional hydrological transitions and for evaluating the roles of the large lake qinghai lake in the local water resources limited daily resolution data as well as large scale reanalysis data is available for the netp which are useful for studying the synoptic scale systems and for exploring a variety of precipitation processes however some issues and limitations regarding this study deserve further consideration 1 we are aware that further work is necessary to conduct long time series water vapor monitoring on the netp which has the potential to interpret evolution of precipitation isotopes and to precisely estimate the recycled moisture wu et al 2020b tian et al 2020 2 as was suggested the monsoonal water vapor reaches the central asia especially the northern tp chen et al 2020 and substantially contributes to the summer precipitation here we also captured the incursion of the monsoons however accurately estimating the transportation of the monsoonal moisture to the tp during long periods remains a challenge and future studies should be conducted 7 conclusions in this study daily stable isotope data for the precipitation at two representative sites on the netp during three years were analyzed remarkable temporal variations in the isotopic composition of the precipitation were observed which were caused by changes in the atmospheric circulations and the influence of evaporation on the isotopic compositions during different months the lower slopes and intercepts of the lmwls during different years emphasize the significant effect of evaporation and the impact of the monsoon incursion significant correlations p 0 05 were found between the δ18o of precipitation and climatic parameters temperature precipitation amounts and relative humidity during entire study period in the hy however the same correlations were not commonly observed in the gc indicating different controlling factors and diverse moisture sources between the two sites based on the isotopic signals and the hysplit model we determined that the predominant moisture source was the westerlies before may while during june and august the recycled vapor and some monsoon moisture substantially contributed to the precipitation and the westerlies controlled the formation and isotopic composition of the precipitation after september additionally the recycled moisture accounted for 5 7 6 1 of the total monthly precipitation notably remarkable monsoonal signals including the easm and ism were observed during the warm season which contributed 3 42 11 11 and 0 1 4 57 of total annual precipitation the

3737,located within the transition zone between the monsoon and westerlies circulation system the northeastern tibetan plateau netp is a critical region for understanding the alternative roles of various atmospheric moisture sources in local precipitation and the resultant hydrological divergences yet determination of contributions of the recycled moisture and the summer monsoonal flows to the local precipitation remain ambiguous in this study daily time series precipitation isotope data for three consecutive years 2016 2018 at two representative sites huangyuan hy and gangcha gc on the netp were analyzed the results reveal remarkable seasonal variations in the precipitation isotopes δ2h and δ18o on the netp which were alternatively influenced by local climate conditions and the transitions of moisture sources much lower slopes 8 and intercepts 10 of the daily based local meteoric water lines lmwls at both sites suggested that sub cloud evaporation of raindrops and monsoonal activities exerted significant influences in local precipitation local climatic conditions partially modulated the isotopes of precipitation and during entire study period at hy however they exhibited weak impacts on the isotopes of precipitation at gc indicating different controlling factors and diverse moisture sources between the two sites combined the isotopic data and the hysplit model results we found that the westerly the recycled moisture and the summer monsoon circulation alternatively influenced the isotopic composition of precipitation between june and august the recycled fractions accounted for 0 11 6 monthly mean 5 1 7 0 and 0 20 2 monthly mean 3 1 7 3 of the monthly precipitation at hy and gc respectively notably we demonstrated that both the east asian summer monsoon easm and the indian summer monsoon ism reached the netp and contributed considerable moistures to the local precipitation as many as 87 0 mm and 62 2 mm of precipitation were generated from monsoonal water vapor in 2016 which accounted for 14 96 and 9 93 of the annual total amounts at hy and gc these findings provide a better understanding of the interactions between atmospheric water vapor and precipitation and the roles of monsoonal activities in local climates both of which are beneficial for interpreting paleo climate reconstruction on the tp keywords precipitation isotopes recycled

watershed hydrology and regional water resource management for agriculture drought relief flood control and forecasting huffman and klepp 2011 li et al 2018 under the changing climate the atmospheric circulation regimes and moisture recycling processes have been particularly altered which has considerably changed the transportation and trajectories of the water vapor osipova and osipov 2016 kostrova et al 2020 gimeno et al 2020 and has ultimately caused spatial temporal variations in the precipitation maussion et al 2014 these variations have driven the local changes in the hydrological cycle dagan et al 2019 and have exert marked influences on the ecosystem stability especially in semi arid and arid regions du et al 2019 accordingly understanding the atmospheric water cycle and the sources of the precipitation water in semi arid zones where water resources drive the distribution and activities of human populations is particularly crucial and can help forecast the extreme hydroclimatic events caused by sudden regional changes in the precipitation ansari et al 2020 gimeno et al 2020 the tibetan plateau tp is referred to as the asian water tower due to its plentiful precipitation and extensive cryosphere yao et al 2012 yao et al 2013 immerzeel et al 2010 in terms of its higher elevations and extensively variable topography the tp is a key region that imposes profound impacts on the atmospheric water cycle and energy budget of asia yao et al 2013 the precipitation over the tp is mutually influenced by large scale atmospheric circulations and associated local moisture recycling ma et al 2018a in recent decades the tp has become wetter and warmer overall kuang and jiao 2016 causing spatial temporal variability of the moisture sources and resultant changes in the regional formation and spatial distribution of the precipitation wang et al 2008 which directly regulate the streamflow and runoff of the major asian rivers zhang et al 2013 the northeastern tibetan plateau netp is located in the monsoonal margin region and its climate has experienced more extensive warmer and wetter shifts than the other regions of the tp during the past three decades kuang and jiao 2016 tang et al 2020 the substantial changes in the local precipitation are responsible for the dramatic variations in the lake levels and runoff chen et al 2015 fan et al 2021 as a boundary of the summer monsoons on the tp the precipitation in this region is controlled by the east asian summer monsoon easm the indian summer monsoon ism and the westerlies circulation yang et al 2014 thus this area is very sensitive to changes in the summer monsoon intensity and is an ideal location for climate change studies wu et al 2020a previous studies have connected the past climate evolution hydrological processes and biological cycles with monsoonal activities ji et al 2005 chen et al 2016 yang et al 2014 cui and li 2015 however most of these studies did not distinguish between the easm and ism well and only broadly referred to them as summer monsoons ma et al 2020 this is because the monsoonal incursion is hard to capture and is more difficult to partition using large scale regional climate models due to the weak and variable signals and sparse observations in this monsoonal margin region immerzeel et al 2010 guo et al 2015a however to date few studies have focused on quantitatively determining the respective influence of easm and ism to local precipitation ma et al 2020 additionally recycled moisture is a key part of the atmospheric water vapor balance on the tp cui and li 2015 and it can provide more precipitable water vapor to local regions ma et al 2018b the netp located in the transition zone between the hinterland of the tp and the arid region of northwestern china guo et al 2015a is the important headwater region of many inland rivers and supplies over 80 of surface water resources to the oases in the hexi corridor yao et al 2017 under the climate warming and wetting conditions on the netp the contributions of recycled moisture to the local precipitation are becoming more and more important tang et al 2020 therefore understanding the roles of the easm ism and recycled moisture in local precipitation is of great significance for forecasting precipitation dynamics water resource management chen et al 2020 and facilitating paleo climate reconstruction on the tp wu et al 2020a despite these advances in our understanding of the precipitation dynamics on the netp the majority of previous studies focused on either specific months or annual scales over the netp zhao and zhou 2021 and investigations on seasonal and inter annual variations in the contributions of recycled to local precipitation have not been conducted due to a lack of continuous hydrometeorological parameter data tian et al 2020 the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes and d excess d excess δ2h 8δ18o of precipitation have been broadly used in hydrological and climatological studies dansgaard 1964 araguás araguás et al 1998 they are generally considered to be valuable tools for understanding atmospheric circulation cycle araguás araguás et al 1998 guo et al 2019 determining the moisture sources of local precipitation guo et al 2015b yang et al 2017 and quantifying the contributions of regional and local sources to precipitation gat 1996 kong et al

1964 cui and li 2015 tian et al 2020 and circulation patterns guo et al 2017 knowledge of these climatic parameters controlling the isotopic composition of precipitation is also indispensable for paleo climate studies for example ice cores lake sediments tree rings and soil carbonates chen et al 2016 remarkably stable isotope ratios and their relationships not only have the potential to show ongoing changes in the hydrological cycle but they are very important to understanding the present and past climate systems in recent decades the back trajectory models and the stable isotope compositions of precipitation have provided valuable information about the moisture sources and atmospheric circulation patterns that give rise to rainfall and have been demonstrated to be an effective means of investigating complex hydrological processes ansari et al 2020 bedaso et al 2020 high frequency daily precipitation isotope sampling provides the opportunity to investigate the climate isotope relationship seasonality and influences of the moisture sources and trajectories on the δ18o δ2h and d excess values of precipitation which is highly important for understanding the dynamic processes of individual precipitation events and the for linking the isotopic signal to synoptic weather conditions according to previous studies of precipitation isotopes on the tp and in other regions the monthly average isotopic values of precipitation are much smaller than the daily level yao et al 2013 tian et al 2020 bailey et al 2019 which smooth over much of the important information about the controls of synoptic climatic conditions on precipitation isotopes e g the incursion of monsoonal vapor the leaching effect and sometimes extreme precipitation due to local climate changes accordingly three consecutive years 2016 2018 of daily precipitation sampling was conducted at two different locations on the netp for stable isotopic analysis δ18o δ2h the goals of this study were to capture the isotopic variability of the precipitation and its controlling factors 2 to reveal the different moisture sources of the precipitation 3 to identify the contributions of the easm ism and recycled moisture to the precipitation in different months during the warm seasons monthly average ta 0 the results of this comprehensive investigation provide a better understanding of the moisture sources of the precipitation and will improve interpretations of paleo climate records in the region in addition these results have major implications for the regional water vapor budget and hydrological processes on the netp 2 study area the netp is located in the monsoonal margin region which is the intersection zone of the eastern asian monsoon region the northwestern arid region and the alpine tp chen et al 2016 it has pronounced continental climate characteristic including broad variations in air temperature ta and precipitation cui and li 2015 here we selected two sites with different climate conditions and geographic locations fig 1 in which the precipitation is derived from different water vapor transportation systems the gangcha area gc 37 33 n 100 13 e 3302 m is located on the north bank of qinghai lake basin fig 1 is the important water conservation area in the qilian mountains as well as the ecological function area of the qinghai lake basin the climate in the gc is typically classified as plateau continental climate the huangyuan area hy 36 68 n 101 23 e 2635 m is located at the eastern foot of riyue mountain fig 1 it is the source area of the huangshui river and supplies the majority of the agriculture and domestic water for most of the cities on the netp it is the transition area between continental monsoon and non monsoon regions and is also the region of joint inland and plateau climates in comparison the precipitation in the gc is easily influenced by the evaporated moisture from qinghai lake and the indian summer monsoon ism however hy is blocked by riyue mountain fig 1 which weakens the transport of the ism according to the meteorological records for 1960 2012 the average annual air temperatures are 0 22 c and 3 3 c for gc and hy respectively hu et al 2021 80 of the precipitation occurs between may and october in the gc and hy cui and li 2015 and the average annual precipitation amounts are 382 mm and 409 mm in gc and hy respectively hu et al 2021 the temporal spatial differences in the precipitation at both sites are remarkable due to their complex moisture sources the influence of qinghai lake the blocking effect of the high alpine mountains and the elevation differences wu et al 2020b in addition the local recycled moisture makes an important contribution to the precipitation ma et al 2018b in this study in order to explore the contributions of the summer monsoon and recycled moisture we divided the hydrological year into the warm season and the cold season the warm season was defined as the months with positive monthly average air temperatures ta 0 c while the months with negative ta were defined as the cold season 3 data and methods 3 1 daily precipitation sampling and local meteorological data determination daily precipitation samples were collected from november 2015 to december 2018 in the hy and gc the precipitation collectors were manually constructed according to international atomic energy agency global network of isotopes in precipitation iaea gnip precipitation sampling guide http www naweb iaea org napc ih documents other gnip manual v2 02 en hq pdf the collector was installed on the roof 8 m above the ground to avoid the contamination of soil and windblown snow from previous events all of the precipitation from 20 00 on one day to 20 00 on the next day was defined as a precipitation event and a sample was collected liquid samples rainfall were immediately collected to minimize the effects of evaporation winter snow samples were collected in pre cleaned plastic bags and were melted at room temperature 25 c before being transferred to hdpe bottles some light rain and short time rain snow events were collected using a wide mouth stainless steel plate in order to collect as much sample as possible for analysis before the sampling the bottles were washed three times with rain water and then rapidly filled if multiple precipitation events occurred in one day the samples during each event were collected separately and then mixed to represent the average level for that day all of the bottles were filled up without bubbles and sealed with a layer of paraffin each bottle was labeled with the location information collection time and date all of the samples were stored at 4 c and shipped to the laboratory of isotope hydrology at the key laboratory of ecohydrology of inland river basin chinese academy of sciences cas each sample was pretreated to remove the impurities by using disposable filters and 2 ml analytical vial was completely filling for the isotopic analysis within 6 months a total of 99 97 and 111 samples were collected in 2016 2017 and 2018 in the hy respectively a total of 105 51 and 77 samples were obtained in 2016 2017 and 2018 in the gc respectively all of the samples were preserved in hdpe bottles and stored in a fridge at 4 c until the isotopic analysis the local climate parameters were observed hourly at the hy and gc national meteorological sites the daily air temperature precipitation and relative humidity corresponding to each precipitation event were used in this study in addition the vapor pressure deficit vpd for each precipitation sample was calculated saturation vapor pressure minus actual vapor pressure where the saturation vapor pressure actual vapor pressure relative humidity 100 wu et al 2015 3 2 stable isotope analysis the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope values of the water samples were determined using the gv isoprime continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer cf irms at the key laboratory of ecohydrology of inland river basin chinese academy of sciences irms is the benchmark technique for stable isotope analysis of plants and soil water a syringe sge syringe 1 μl fitted to the liquid auto sampler pulls up 0 4 μl of water from a septum sealed sample vial 2 ml positioned in an auto sampler containing 110 spots when analyzing the stable isotope composition of water 0 3 μl of water was injected into a heated septum housing 140 c using the automated microliter syringe the resulting water vapor was flushed by a constant flow of ultra high purity helium 130 ml min via a stainless steel probe extending 15 cm into a quartz reactor tube maintained at 1050 c the stable oxygen isotope ratios of the samples were measured using the co2 h2o equilibration method in which about a millimole amount of co2 10 to 20 ml is brought into isotopic equilibrium with a few microliters of sample water similarly the 2h 1h ratio of a water sample can be converted to h2 via isotopic exchange using platinum wire as the catalyst five laboratory reference standards with distinct isotopic compositions were developed by nanjing university for calibration with δ18o values of 19 49 13 39 7 94 2 69 and 9 89 and δ2h values of 154 0 97 3 51 6 9 2 100 6 which are referenced to the international vienna standard mean ocean water standard light antarctic precipitation vsmow slap scale craig 1961 to achieve both a good repeatability and a good reproducibility we conducted a stability test on the analyzer before the sample analysis we prepared 14 distilled or tap water samples for stable isotope analysis the precisions of the δ18o and δ2h values were calculated by calculating the 1 sigma standard deviation of groups of 12 injections and then calculating the average of these standard deviations the drift of the analyzer was determined by taking the mean of these same 12 groups of measurements and calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum means all of these measured precision and drift values were less than those of the guaranteed values indicating that the analyzer exhibited a high stability before the analyzing the weighted average values δwa were calculated for the monthly and annual average δ18o and δ2h values at both sites as follows eq 1 1 δ wa i 1 n p i δ i i 1 n p i where pi is the daily precipitation amount which is the daily average data collected at the meteorological station and δi is the stable isotope δ18o and δ2h of the daily precipitation sample the deuterium excess d excess was used to indicate the deviation from the global meteoric water line gmwl which was calculated as follows eq 2 2 d excess δ2h 8 δ18o 3 3 hysplit model calculation the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model http ready arl noaa gov hysplit php noaa 2018 with the main input parameters of air temperature wind speed pressure and solar radiation stein et al 2015 was used to identify the transportation trajectory of the water vapor and the origin of the air masses transporting to the study area this model clarifies the direction of the wind moisture source sodemann et al 2008 the meteorological data from global data assimilation system 1 gdas 1 were used to identify the probable moisture provenance in addition 10 day 240 h air parcel backward trajectories were calculated for the monthly precipitation events recorded in the study areas hy and gc using the hysplit model the daily back trajectories of the air masses were calculated and cluster analysis was conducted to group these back trajectories according to their directions speeds the separation of the same air masses was conducted based on their centroid lengths cluster mean trajectories to identify the dominant sources of moisture entering the region stein et al 2015 4 results 4 1 temporal variations in the stable isotope composition of the precipitation on the netp stable isotopes δ18o δ2h and d excess of the daily precipitation fluctuated substantially in the hy and the gc during the study period fig 2 in the hy the daily δ18o values ranged from 23 08 to 12 23 and the δ2h varied from 171 3 to 74 4 with amount weighted values of 8 63 and 57 3 for δ18o and δ2h respectively table 1 the d excess values in the hy ranged from 30 7 to 33 2 with an average of 11 7 in the gc the δ18o values varied from 30 42 to 6 71 the δ2h values ranged from 227 9 to 59 1 and the d excess varied from 29 1 to 33 0 with amount weighted average values of 7 95 53 2 and 10 4 respectively table 1 remarkably seasonal trends were observed at both sites fig 2 higher δ18o and δ2h values occurred from january to the end of may accompanied by lower d excess values fig 2 which was related to sub cloud evaporation guan et al 2013 in contrast the precipitation exhibited substantially negative δ18o and δ2h trends between june and august during the three observation years fig 2 the d excess fluctuated around the global average line of 10 fig 2 suggesting the combined effects of monsoonal incursion with lower d excess and recycled moisture leading to increased d excess fröhlich et al 2002 bershaw et al 2012 after september the δ18o and δ2h values tended to be positive and the d excess exhibited much higher values fig 2 this is attributed to be the prevailing westerlies tian et al 2005 guan et al 2013 and recycled moisture bershaw et al 2012 however this conclusion cannot be confirmed using only stable isotopes and more evidences are presented in the following discussion in addition the inter annual variability in the stable isotope composition of the precipitation was significant at both sites during the three years fig 2 table 1 the highest δ18o and δ2h values lower d excess occurred in 2017 and the most negative mean values occurred in 2018 table 1 this was due to the inter variability of the local climate conditions i e air temperature precipitation amounts and relative humidity fig 2 and the resultant changes in the transpiration and recycled moisture during three years much less precipitation was observed in 2017 at both sites table 1 fig 2 which made sub cloud evaporation much easier thereby resulting in the enrichment of heavier isotopes 18o 2h in the precipitation froehlich et al 2008 4 2 characteristics of local meteoric water lines lmwls on the netp the relationship between δ18o and δ2h defined as the local meteoric water line lmwl provides a useful tool for comparing seasonal and spatial isotopic variations among different regions bedaso et al 2020 here we have calculated lmwls during the whole observation period for the two sites fig 3 as well as for the individual year table 1 using the daily isotopic data during three years 2016 2018 the ordinary least square regression olsr method has been used the lmwl at hy and gc is determined to be δ2h 7 50 0 1 δ18o 7 16 0 90 r2 0 95 and δ2h 7 50 0 11 δ18o 7 16 1 03 r2 0 95 they exhibited lower slopes which are indistinguishable from the gmwl fig 3 generally local transpiration of soil plant and surface water and the sub cloud evaporation both play remarkable roles in decreasing the slopes of lmwls putman et al 2019 in specific the lmwls of the precipitation in each year varied table 1 which suggests yearly differences in the local evaporation of raindrops and alternations of the moisture sources although the lmwls have similar slopes their intercepts varied during three years at both sites table 1 reflecting the changing d excess controlled by the moisture sources and the re evaporation of raindrops dansgaard 1964 the highest intercepts exhibited in 2016 at both sites which were consistent with the highest d excess in 2016 table 1 the lower intercept and the corresponding lower d excess may be the result of upwind processes including mixing and rayleigh distillation mechanisms putman et al 2019 in addition although both sites are located on the netp the slopes and intercepts of the lmwls are different from those δ2h 7 86 δ18o 15 01 reported in large scale areas in the qinghai lake region on the netp this is because most of the sampling sites recorded by cui and li 2015 are distributed to the northwest of qinghai lake and thus the westerlies circulations and recycled moisture from this large lake easily reach these sites which resulted in higher d excess gat et al 1994 cui and li 2015 yang et al 2016 4 3 contribution of monthly recycled moisture to local precipitation on netp we quantitatively estimated the monthly fractions of the recycled moisture on the netp using the two end member mixing model suggested by froehlich et al 2008 section 1 1 in supplementary material generally in the hy the recycled fraction constituted 0 0 to 11 6 of the total precipitation with an average value of 6 1 during study period in the gc the recycled fractions contributed 0 0 to 20 2 among three years with an average value of 5 7 evidently higher recycled fractions were showing in september and october at both sites table 2 in addition the monthly mean values of stable isotopes δ18o δ2h and d excess are presented in table 2 for comparison overall the more positive δ18o and δ2h and higher d excess values corresponded to larger recycled fractions at the two sites table 2 suggesting higher relative humidity and weak re evaporation of raindrops under clouds other studies have also reported distinct high d excess values for precipitation events affected by large lakes supporting the substantial influence of recycled moisture on local precipitation gat et al 1994 cui and li 2015 corcoran et al 2019 4 4 remarkable monsoon signals recorded by the water vapor trajectories in order to trace the monsoon activities involving into the local precipitation the monthly trajectories model was conducted as is shown the ism and the easm distinctly intruded into the netp during the warm seasons and transported considerable water vapor to both sites figs s1 s2 generally these monsoonal activities mainly occurred in august 2016 accounting for 20 of the total back trajectories and in june 11 july 4 and august 2017 13 at hy fig s1 for comparison they arrived more frequently at gc they accounted for 13 and 12 of the total back trajectories in july and august 2016 the ratios are 10 and 9 in june and july 2017 and the contributing ratios are 14 in august 2018 fig s2 however due to the long distance and blocking of high mountains on the tp some of the monsoonal signals arriving at the netp could be weaken and even be smoothed on monthly scale accordingly the route of the monsoonal derived water vapors in typical single precipitation events was depicted to precisely detect the monsoonal signals a total of 9 precipitation events were identified which were completely influenced by the monsoonal intrusion fig 4 for comparison the gc was more affected by the monsoonal transportation i e ism and easm this was because the gc is located father west than the hy fig 1 and there is no mountain blocking effect on the gc fig 1 which could prevent the transportation of the monsoonal air masses and the resultant rainfall in contrast the hy is located to the east of riyue mountain fig 1 which to some degree attenuates the incursion of the ism however strong ism activities were still observed in the hy after preferentially visiting the gc i e in june 2017 fig s1 in contrast the easm can arrive at both sites figs s1 s2 this air mass was directly transported from the china sea to the hy over a short distance 5 discussion 5 1 factors controlling the isotopic composition of the precipitation 5 1 1 combined effect of local climate conditions on precipitation δ18o as shown in fig 2 the seasonal trends were remarkable this is speculated to be related to the transitions in the moisture sources the influences of the local climatic conditions yao et al 2013 cui and li 2015 yang et al 2017 and the local recycled moisture zhu et al 2020 in order to clarify the combined effect of all of the climate factors on the isotopic composition of the precipitation the multiple linear regression analysis was conducted for the hy and gc the correlation is significant at hy δ18o 0 336 ta 0 124 p 0 083 rh 3 719 n 307 r2 0 2 p 0 05 however there is nearly no relations p 0 05 between precipitation δ18o and local meteorological factors evidently the combined impacts of ta p and rh can explain 20 of the variations in the precipitation δ18o in the hy however the variations in the precipitation δ18o in the gc exhibit extremely weak correlations with ta p and rh accordingly we suggest that the variations and fluctuations in the isotopic composition in the precipitation in the gc were probably controlled by the moisture sources unlike the hy the gc is located adjacent to qinghai lake 14 km apart and the evaporative moisture from this large lake exerts substantial influence on the distribution and source of the precipitation previous studies have also demonstrated the considerable influence of large lakes on the precipitation xu et al 2011 cui and li 2015 and have shown that the local recycled moisture makes an important contribution to the precipitation tian et al 2001b 5 1 2 influence of convective processes on precipitation isotopes in order to determine the influence of the convective processes on the local precipitation outgoing longwave radiation olr data obtained by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa satellites were used to examine the large scale convection activity over the region fig 5 a previous study suggested that large scale convection activities corresponded to lower olr values usually 240 w m 2 gadgil 2003 and lower stable isotope values tang et al 2015 guo et al 2017 ahmed et al 2020 in our study the temporal variations in the precipitation δ18o in the hy and the gc exhibit several negative peaks which correspond to the larger precipitation amounts fig 2 during the warm seasons in the three years according to the olr diagrams the intra seasonal variations in the precipitation δ18o occurred during or after the passage of convective clouds fig 5 in contrast the high precipitation δ18o values mainly correspond to higher olr values fig 5 suggesting an inactive phase in the convection activity at both sites thus we conclude that the temporal variations in the precipitation δ18o at both sites may be influenced by the occurrence of large scale convection activity 5 2 moisture sources of the precipitation on the netp generally the divergences in the slopes and intercepts of the lmwls can be used to distinguish the moisture sources putman et al 2019 in order to trace the moisture sources of the precipitation on the netp the lmwls of the different sites on the tp were summarized for comparison as suggested the slopes increased gradually from the northern slope of the himalaya dingri monsoonal zone to the inner tp delingha westerly zone reflecting the transition in the moisture sources between the monsoons india monsoon and east asia monsoon the westerlies and local recycled moisture tian et al 2001a according to yao et al 2009 the netp is located in the marginal zone between the westerlies and monsoons north of 35 n where a higher slope 8 would be expected however this regular pattern was broken table 3 because the slopes of the lmwls on the netp are lower 8 than those of delingha and the kunlun mountain pass in the westerlies zone and beiluhe and tuotuohe in the transition zone table 3 it suggests the prevalence of non equilibrium fractionation processes evaporation during transportation of the moisture and the falling of raindrops dansgaard 1964 araguás araguás et al 1998 and the effect of great lakes gat et al 1994 cui and li 2015 in addition the slopes on the netp are identical to those of lhasa and dingri implying the input of oceanic water vapor tian et al 2001b the probable influence of monsoons tian et al 2020 and significant sub cloud evaporation of raindrops araguás araguás et al 1998 zhao et al 2011 putman et al 2019 accordingly the hysplit model was used to determine the pathway and origin of air masses to the study area during the warm seasons from may to october among three consecutive years considering the prevalence of the westerlies in the cold seasons on the netp cui and li 2015 wu et al 2020b the model results indicated three possible vapor sources fig s1 s2 the predominant source was westerly circulation wc which was prevalent during the whole period from may to october the cold and dry air moved out of the tp to the north east and south araguás araguás et al 1998 which resulted in a much lower humidity fig 2 and less precipitable water cui and li 2015 in addition the local recycled moistures from the inland areas contributed considerable moistures to local precipitation fig s1 s2 generally the precipitation generated by recycled moistures always resulted in more positive δ18o and higher d excess table 2 this has also been reported in previous studies on the tp cui and li 2015 this kind of circulation pattern is mainly linked with the transportation of the westerlies polar air masses and the formation of snow jouzel et al 1982 interestingly the incursion of monsoon was captured by the hysplit model which including ism from the bay of bengal and the easm from china sea fig s1 s2 most of the monsoonal activities were concentrated in july and august at both sites fig s1 s2 which are consistent with the prevalence time of monsoon on the tp yao et al 2009 2013 especially the model results captured 11 and 10 of the total back trajectories originating from the ism in june 2017 in the hy and the gc respectively figs s1 s2 we propose that the ism reached the netp in june 2017 was very strong 5 2 1 seasonal differences in the import of recycled moisture to the netp based on the calculated results table 2 the monthly variations in the recycled fractions were comprehensively compared with the local climatic conditions during the warm season fig 6 the recycled fractions were much larger in september and october during the three years which corresponded lower evaporation rates of raindrop lower air temperatures blue bars in fig 6 and a higher relative humidity table 2 this indicates that the sub cloud evaporation was weak due to the lower air temperatures during september and october and the abundant recycled moisture originating from the upwind regions and qinghai lake cui and li 2015 contained higher rh which increased the d excess values of the precipitation froehlich et al 2008 xu et al 2011 bowen et al 2012 in contrast the recycled fractions were smaller in may june july and august which is consistent with the higher raindrop evaporation rates higher air temperatures green bars in fig 6 and a lower relative humidity table 2 the lower recycled fractions in may and june are attributed to the lower air temperatures which greatly reduced the local lake evaporation as well as caused by the westerlies transportation with lower relative humidity in july and august although the air temperature gradually increased the recycled fractions were lower fig 6 table 2 this may be related to the intrusion of the easm cui and li 2015 which brought considerable water vapor with negative isotope values δ18o δ2h to the netp and offset the local evaporation more specifically the recycled fraction in the gc exhibited a stable trend during the different months compared to those in the hy fig 6 this suggests incursion of monsoonal moisture and the significant influence of the large lake the gc near the qinghai lake 14 km was more susceptible to this large lake and could easily receive the water vapor from the ism however the hy was blocked by riyue mountain fig 1 which prevented a portion of the water vapor from the evaporation of qinghai lake and the monsoonal moisture from reaching this area thus the precipitation in the hy was somewhat controlled by the long distance westerlies and local recycled moisture the fluctuations in the recycled fractions in the hy may be the result of transitions in the local climatic conditions and the mixing of moisture from upwind regions with inland water moisture 5 2 2 influences of remarkable monsoonal incursion on the local precipitation as is shown by the monthly trajectories model fig s1 s2 the intrusions of the ism and the easm were observed on the netp during the warm seasons we compared the d excess values of the monthly precipitation in westerlies dominated zones delingha and hetian tian et al 2005 transition zones beiluhe yang et al 2017 and monsoon dominated zones nagqu and lhasa tian et al 2001c tian et al 2020 on the tp fig 7 remarkably between june and august the lower d excess values at our sites were comparable to these in nagqu and lhasa pink bars in fig 7 indicating the distinct impact of the monsoonal incursion on the local precipitation the onset of the monsoon in the earlier summer months transported water vapor with a higher humidity leading to lower d excess values tian et al 2001c liu et al 2008 in order to further analyze the influence of monsoon on netp the stable isotope signals of monsoonal derived precipitation events selected according to the trajectories model fig 3 as well as the corresponding climatic parameters were compared table 4 it is clear that most of these monsoonal derived precipitation events exhibit more negative isotopic values and higher relative humidity table 4 generally the water vapor from the indian ocean moved northeastward uplifting on to the himalayas and continued to the gc and hy the heavier isotopes in the moisture were gradually depleted due to rainout during the moisture transport resulting in the negative δ18o values of the subsequent precipitation araguás araguás et al 1998 tian et al 2005 tian et al 2020 the easm belongs to the pacific monsoon domain and is triggered by land sea temperature differences which are caused by differential solar heating and the thermal inertia of the land and ocean under these conditions a low level flow of moisture is transported from the pacific ocean to eastern china and then to the netp araguás araguás et al 1998 remarkably although only 9 precipitation events were observed which were directly originated from monsoonal activities not including the mixing sources from three sources as many as 104 6 mm at hy and 71 9 mm at gc of precipitation were generated during one precipitation event table 4 emphasized the considerable contributions of monsoonal incursion to local precipitation notably we observed important vapor trajectories of the easm 20 in the hy in august 2016 fig s1 which generated an abundant precipitation event pp 64 6 mm on august 18 2016 fig 3 similarly the easm reached gc in both 2016 and 2018 and 33 6 mm of precipitation were occurred table 4 in addition the gc was more affected by the monsoonal activities especially the ism this was because the gc is located father west than the hy fig 1 and there is no mountain blocking effect in the gc fig 1 which could prevent the transportation of the monsoonal air masses and the resultant rainfall in contrast the hy is located to the east of riyue mountain fig 1 which to some degree attenuates the incursion of the ism however strong ism activities were still observed in the hy after preferentially visiting the gc table 4 during the eastward transportation of the ism the original isotopically negative air masses experienced evaporation and mixing with evaporated vapor in the local area during its long distance transportation and subsequent uplift over riyue mountain finally it gradually became enriched in 18o and 2h after long distance transportation to the hy table 4 in contrast the easm arrived almost simultaneously at both sites table 4 this air mass was directly transported from the china sea to the hy over a short distance fig s1 without leaching and moisture loss and thus the precipitation had higher δ18o and δ2h signals table 4 however during the long conveyance from the hy to the gc the initially isotopically positive air masses became progressively depleted in 18o and 2h due to the leaching effect and mixing with isotopically negative evaporated water vapor above large lake which resulted in the gradual depletion of 18o table 4 6 research limitations we studied the evolution of the isotopic composition of the precipitation on the netp on the daily scale which is useful for interpreting the regional hydrological transitions and for evaluating the roles of the large lake qinghai lake in the local water resources limited daily resolution data as well as large scale reanalysis data is available for the netp which are useful for studying the synoptic scale systems and for exploring a variety of precipitation processes however some issues and limitations regarding this study deserve further consideration 1 we are aware that further work is necessary to conduct long time series water vapor monitoring on the netp which has the potential to interpret evolution of precipitation isotopes and to precisely estimate the recycled moisture wu et al 2020b tian et al 2020 2 as was suggested the monsoonal water vapor reaches the central asia especially the northern tp chen et al 2020 and substantially contributes to the summer precipitation here we also captured the incursion of the monsoons however accurately estimating the transportation of the monsoonal moisture to the tp during long periods remains a challenge and future studies should be conducted 7 conclusions in this study daily stable isotope data for the precipitation at two representative sites on the netp during three years were analyzed remarkable temporal variations in the isotopic composition of the precipitation were observed which were caused by changes in the atmospheric circulations and the influence of evaporation on the isotopic compositions during different months the lower slopes and intercepts of the lmwls during different years emphasize the significant effect of evaporation and the impact of the monsoon incursion significant correlations p 0 05 were found between the δ18o of precipitation and climatic parameters temperature precipitation amounts and relative humidity during entire study period in the hy however the same correlations were not commonly observed in the gc indicating different controlling factors and diverse moisture sources between the two sites based on the isotopic signals and the hysplit model we determined that the predominant moisture source was the westerlies before may while during june and august the recycled vapor and some monsoon moisture substantially contributed to the precipitation and the westerlies controlled the formation and isotopic composition of the precipitation after september additionally the recycled moisture accounted for 5 7 6 1 of the total monthly precipitation notably remarkable monsoonal signals including the easm and ism were observed during the warm season which contributed 3 42 11 11 and 0 1 4 57 of total annual precipitation the

3738,in the lower transboundary indus basin ltib excessive groundwater is being consumed in combination with surface water to meet the increasing demand for irrigation and resulting in groundwater depletion this study employed the generalized three cornered hat method gtch to assess uncertainty of different gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa measurements using grace twsa data and the variance variability in space and time of grace derived groundwater storage anomalies gwsa using empirical orthogonal function eof analysis respectively furthermore monthly grace derived gwsa were estimated using global land data assimilation system gldas model data and gwsa time series trend and depletion of groundwater storage were evaluated using the mannkendal mk trend test and sen s slope estimator in the ltib the twsa and precipitation data depict seasonal characteristics with peaks in the summer and dips in the winter which reflect variation in gwsa respectively additionally it is observed that the variations in gwsa exhibit a downward trend from 2003 to 2016 the results revealed that more than 80 of total variance variability was explained by the first 2 eof modes the results showed that grace derived gwsa is being depleted at a rate of 4 16 0 26 mm per year 2 97 0 19 km3 per year long term monthly mean of

resources has increased with the frequent occurrence of abnormal weather conditions due to climate change and water shortages resulting from regional imbalances in water supply gleeson et al 2013 unsustainable abstraction of groundwater for irrigation and food production continues to be a global water resource challenge facing many alluvial aquifer systems foster and chilton 2003 the amount of groundwater in the world is about 615 000 km3 which is three thousand times more than water contained in ponds and rivers and thirty times more than water present in lakes nazir 1995 groundwater serves about 1 5 to 2 8 billion people around the world for drinking purposes out of which 98 of the population belongs to rural areas morris et al 2003 globally groundwater has been used for irrigation at an alarming rate and accounts for 40 of the irrigation water siebert and doll 2010 along with the rapid population increase and social economic development the groundwater resource is affected by human activities liu et al 2015 about one third of the largest groundwater basins globally are rapidly depleting because of anthropogenic activities without knowing the accurate storage of water among those basins globally the transboundary indus basin aquifer shared between india and pakistan is the second most overstressed aquifer nasa 2015 information on variations in groundwater storage is necessary to assess the water resources lin et al 2020 the monitoring of groundwater storage variations can be beneficial for groundwater management in the indus river basin which is already under stress because of climate change and increased consumption of groundwater across different sectors including agriculture industries and households there are several groundwater management problems due to the over abstraction of groundwater in pakistan the declining of the water table groundwater withdrawal deterioration of groundwater quality and increased salinity are some of the challenges for the groundwater managers chandio and larock 1984 sufi et al 1998 saeed and ashraf 2005 khan et al 2008 qureshi et al 2010 regular groundwater resources management is an important aspect of efficient groundwater management estimation of groundwater exploitation and fluctuations in replenishment are significant parameters of sustainable groundwater management cheema et al 2014 groundwater resource management has become more critical in the absence of any groundwater regulation policy in punjab province pakistan because of over abstraction pakistan is included in the top four countries in the world where the abstraction rate of groundwater has reached 80 km3 year from 1961 to 2010 wada et al 2014 it was observed that groundwater abstraction was caused by increasing population urban expansion and development in irrigation rapidly qureshi 2011 such negative implications can be observed in terms of groundwater loss by 13 5 mm per year from 2003 to 2010 in the punjab province of pakistan iqbal et al 2016 the increase of the pumping wells in punjab province pakistan for example the number increased to 0 94 million from 2000 to 2010 confirmed the water consumption increased in the area punjab 2012 the groundwater is the main source of continuous supply which is being consumed by the farmers to grow wheat rice sugarcane potatoes other cash and fodder crops punjab 2012 how to quantify the effects on groundwater resource because of climate change interference are of particular significance to the sustainable development of the indus river basin therefore unsustainable groundwater use in the indus river basin is a threat to agricultural production and agricultural water management and may cause a serious water crisis in the already water scarce region the use of groundwater is increasing for irrigation poses legitimate questions about the future sustainability of abstraction from the basin and water security of this region remains a major social political concern shah 2009 groundwater monitoring with a network of monitoring wells from regional to basin scale is tiresome time consuming and cost effective the collection of data has irregularity at the temporal scale and the uneven distribution of monitoring wells complex subsurface physical properties and groundwater recharge process make assessment more difficult such a network is unevenly distributed and hampers the heterogeneity of groundwater at a spatial scale although the situations demand regular monitoring and management of groundwater at a large scale therefore information on groundwater variability at a large scale is limited due to the sparse density of groundwater observation data to this end the national aeronautics and space administration nasa launched the grace mission to provide an opportunity to estimate continuous groundwater storage using precise observation of earth s gravity field changes directly from space over time chen et al 2016 tapley et al 2004 grace is a dedicated twin satellite mission that provides imagery of the earth s gravity field monthly tapley et al 2004 grace satellite data have also been used in many studies to investigate groundwater storage change muskett and romanovsky 2009 strassberg et al 2009 sun 2013 previous studies mostly focused on global scale basins for the depletion of groundwater wada et al 2010 doll et al 2014a dalin et al 2017 and terrestrial water storage scanlon et al 2016 scanlon et al 2018 rodell et al 2018 felfelani et al 2017 most hotspots of groundwater depletion were observed in three states of india harayana punjab and rajasthan approximately 54 9 km3 year losses in groundwater were estimated from april 2002 to june 2008 tiwari et al 2009 rodell et al 2009 assessed a groundwater loss of 109 km3 from august 2002 to october 2008 with an average depletion rate of 4 1 cm year equivalent height of water of 17 7 km3 4 5 km3 per year in the three indian states of haryana punjab and rajasthan cheema et al 2014 observed 68 km3 262 mm of groundwater abstracted and 31 km 3 121 mm depleted in irrigated indus basin during the year 2007 long et al 2016 evaluated groundwater depletion rate over the northwest indian aquifer using a newly developed constrained forward modeling method resulting in a groundwater depletion rate of 14 0 4 km3 year from january 2005 to december 2010 these studies have proved worthy of using grace satellite data for estimating groundwater changes recent studies macdonald et al 2016 asoka et al 2017 bhanja and mukherjee 2019 disagree on the triggers for groundwater storage changes and recharge patterns across south asia while some studies asoka et al 2017 have argued that the precipitation patterns are the primary influencing factor for groundwater level changes across the indian subcontinent other studies on this topic macdonald et al 2016 bhanja et al 2017a bhanja et al 2017b bhanja and mukherjee 2019 suggest that even in areas demonstrating increased precipitation and primary secondary recharge enhanced depletion of groundwater storage are observed which is potentially caused by intensive groundwater abstraction rodell et al 2009 wada et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 doll et al 2014a bhanja et al 2019 bhanja and mukherjee 2019 global hydrological models ghms which model the global and regional water fluxes and storage usually include global land surface models lsms and global hydrological and water resource models ghwrms both of which could provide insight into the global terrestrial water storage scanlon et al 2018 large uncertainties exist in their outputs however mostly because of the limited in situ observations for model inputs and the model structural errors in addition ghm based terrestrial water storage changes may be subject to more delayed release than grace monitoring due to the large efforts required in data collection and preparation the latency in information on ghm terrestrial water storage estimates may not meet the need for water resource management compared to ghms grace satellites provide more direct estimates of changes in terrestrial water storage that are derived from the time variable gravity field in terms of the global water storage famiglietti et al 2015 furthermore grace satellite datasets have been used in many studies to validate ghm outputs doll et al 2014b few studies attempted to characterize groundwater storage in the indus river basin and its adjacent area using grace data and obtain significant findings for instance iqbal et al 2016 estimated groundwater storage variations over upper indus plain and found a great loss of groundwater storage from 2003 to 2014 tang et al 2017 reconstructed annually groundwater storage from 1980 to 2015 and observed a loss of groundwater storage of 13 6 9 7 cm in the punjab province pakistan in addition only a few researchers are developing this understanding of groundwater storage in the indus river basin however no relevant studies have been reported on groundwater storage depletion and its spatio temporal characteristics in the lower transboundary indus basin ltib of the indus river basin since the ltib is a vital area for agricultural production there is a dire need to understand the dynamics of groundwater storage which is necessary for agricultural water management although a previous study by iqbal et al 2016 employed a single product of grace data csr rl05 to estimate groundwater storage in combination with hydrological variables in adjacent regions of indus river basin here we extend this work the main contribution and novelty of this study are 1 we used average data of different products of grace satellite data to reduce the uncertainty among them and to assess the spatiotemporal variations in twsa and gwsa for a longer duration from january 2003 to december 2016 within the ltib 2 gtch method was applied to estimate the uncertainty among different grace derived twsa datasets 3 utilized empirical orthogonal function eof analysis on grace derived gwsa data to compute variability in the long term and inter annual trend at spatio temporal scale and 4 gwsa temporal trend and depletion was evaluated using the mann kendall mk trend test and sen s slope estimator the spatial and temporal changes in gwsa over 14 years provide information on hydrological footprints regional agricultural water resources management sustainable water use water resource variations and water managers to identify the potential areas of excessive groundwater abstraction and how they are occurring during various years this study assesses the potential and effectiveness of grace satellite data for studying groundwater storage variations the objectives of this work were 1 application of gtch method to estimate uncertainties associated with different grace derived twsa datasets 2 temporal trend analysis of grace derived twsa and gwsa using mk trend test and sen s slope estimator 3 validation of grace derived gwsa with the wghm pcr globwb and in situ gwsa temporally 4 perform eof analysis on grace derived gwsa to evaluate spatio temporal trends 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the transboundary indus basin covers an area of 1 16 million km2 geographically on the earth s crust because of the large region it has variations in altitude from sea level to 8011 m fig 1 the indus river is the main river of the transboundary indus basin it flows 3 180 km to the indian ocean through the hilly terrain of the karakoram himalayan and the hindu kush junction the indus river has about 1 million km2 of drainage area with an average annual discharge of 7900 m3 s which is one of the major transboundary rivers in the world the transboundary indus basin has 61 of its area in pakistan and presents an important source for hydropower irrigation and water supply shamsudduha and panda 2019 29 in india and 8 in afghanistan and china the major portion of the transboundary indus basin aquifer is shared between pakistan and india the indus river serves more than three hundred million people including 61 living in pakistan 35 in india and 4 on the chinese and afghan sides of the basin riparian countries of the transboundary indus basin depend on as the source of water thus water security challenges are vital to the sustainable development of this region the hydrologic processes of the indus river are associated with glaciated mountain valleys in the upper transboundary indus basin with monsoon plains in the ltib and a deltaic coastline each of which has characteristic and extensive water management regimes khan and adams 2019 the transboundary indus basin exhibits variability in precipitation land use water use and topography due to the complex hydrological processes cheema et al 2014 the climate in the indus river basin is unique and reflects the interaction between different circulation systems the two important circulations indian summer monsoons and westerly disturbances contribute to 46 3 199 35 mm and 47 2 203 51 mm of annual precipitation for the entire indus basin respectively ul hasson and bohner 2019 hence because of its unique geographical location and critical role in crop supply to feed people a case study of long term groundwater storage changes was carried out over the ltib in this study we selected only the ltib for further investigation of groundwater storage depletion as it is the main region for irrigation through groundwater abstraction and large fluctuations in groundwater storage compared to the rest

grace anomaly long term average 2004 2009 the sms qs cws anomaly at time t was estimated by equation 2 δ g t a g t g 2004 2009 a v g where g represents sms qs cws and g 2004 2009 avg represents the average g from 2004 to 2009 isolating the other gldas derived variables yields gwsa rahaman et al 2019 it was assumed that the biosphere and snow influence is very negligible and gwsa can be estimated by isolating the anomaly of soil moisture storage canopy water storage and surface runoff from twsa zhang et al 2014 swenson and wahr 2003 rodell et al 2009 so groundwater storage anomalies gwsa were estimated using equation 3 3 δ g w s a δ t w s a δ s m s a δ q s a δ c w s a the groundwater storage data obtained from wghm and pcr globwb models were also processed using similar equations used for gldas data to generate gwsa these gwsa were used to validate and compare with grace derived gwsa 2 2 3 trmm data tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm is a joint jaxa and nasa mission to monitor

terrestrial water storage with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 globally wada et al 2010 van beek et al 2011 and was upscaled to 1 degree by pixel averaging using the bilinear interpolation method the simulations of the pcr globwb model integrate terrestrial water storage groundwater soil moisture snow and surface water reservoirs rivers lakes and inundated water it also stimulates the

calculated based on a two layer soil water balance model driven from different parameters like precipitation surface runoff moisture demand evapotranspiration and moisture supply palmer 1965 wet and dry conditions can be evaluated by positive and negative values of pdsi due to the climate dependent variable input in the index the impact of climate change can be evaluated on drought and climate variations it provides a significant comparison in space and time alley 1984 heim 2002 sheffield et al 2012 van der schrier et al 2013 the monthly gws derived from pcr globwb model data was used from 2003 to 2015 3 2 methods 3 2 1 generalized three cornered hat method gtch in this study we determined the quality of the twsa series by making a comparison of different grace products csr gfz jpl csr m jpl m using the generalized three cornered hat gtch method the gtch method is an efficient way to assess the relative uncertainties in the data set without relying on a comparison with true variables when at least three different sets of the same process are available however it should be noted that this method does not allow an estimation of the absolute uncertainty of one series particularly the results only make sense when all series are considered together and they have no physical meaning by themselves koot et al 2006 the relative uncertainties among the grace derived twsa using different products of grace was computed ferreira et al 2016 awange et al 2016 torcaso et al 1998 galindo and palacio 1999 by first considering the available time series of the twsa products and supposing each time series can be written by equation 6 x i s єi i 1 n 6 where xi 1 2 n in which i relates to each twsa product s is the original signal and єi represents the measurement error chin et al 2005 because the true estimation of s is not available n 1 twsa products and one considered as the reference series chosen arbitrarily could be estimated by equation 7 koot et al 2006 yin xi xn єi єn i 1 2 n 7 where xn reference time series the results are independent of the special choice of a twsa product awange et al 2016 torcaso et al 1998 galindo and palacio 1999 chin et al 2005 koot et al 2006 then the difference of the covariance matrix s of the series was estimated the unknown n n covariance matrix was introduced of individual noises r r r t r nn which correspond to s as described by galindo and palacio in equation 8 galindo and palacio 2003 s 8 where i n 1 n 1 identity matrix r n 1 vector r1 n r2 n r n 1 n t u is n 1 vector 11 0 1 t and r can be estimated using equation 9 s rnn uut urt rut 9 equation 8 is undetermined to estimate n free parameters an appropriate objective function should be defined the objective function is proposed by galindo and palacio and given in equation 10 galindo and palacio 1999 f r r nn 10 with a constraint function shown in equation 11 g r r n n r nn r r nn u t â s 1 â r r nn u k 0 where k denotes k d e t s n 1 the initial conditions are selected to assure that the initial values fulfilled the constraints and shown in equation 12 torcaso et al 1998 0 i n and 2 ut s 1 u 1 12 after determining the free parameters r 1 n r 2 n r nn by reducing equation 10 the rest of the unknown elements can be computed using equation 9 and the square root of the diagonal elements of r and r nn show the uncertainties between different datasets 3 2 2 empirical orthogonal function analysis eof with empirical orthogonal function eof analyses the dominant spatial gwsa patterns and generate the gwsa time series can be identified hu et al 2014 which explains the magnitude of the variation of each eof mode of the monthly gwsa the spatial temporal structures of the long term variations of the monthly gwsa are examined by the empirical orthogonal function eof analyses lorenz 1956 empirical orthogonal function analysis eof also known as principal component analysis pca is a structural feature in the analysis of matrix data that serves to separate prominent spatiotemporal patterns existing in a geophysical field lorenz 1956 it has been used to compute spatio temporal patterns of sea surface temperature sst rainfall humidity pressure fields etc hannachi et al 2007 though pca has some limitations one of the majors is the mixing problem because researchers proposed modified eof analyses such as rotated eofs reofs richman 1986 complex eofs simplified eofs etc hannachi et al 2007 this study used reofs to compute independent temporal and corresponding spatial patterns statistically more detail about eof analysis process and formulization can be found in supplementary material 3 2 3 trend analysis the grace derived gwsa trend was analyzed using the mk trend test at a 95 statistical significance level the trend magnitude was estimated by using the theil sen approach rahaman et al 2019 the correlation was used to understand the strength of agreement among grace derived gwsa and wghm pcr globwb model and in situ data gwsa a regression fitting analysis was also applied to understand the relationship and the variability between the time series of grace derived gwsa and wghm and pcr globwb model derived gwsa 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatio temporal terrestrial water storage variations when grace derived twsa is compared with each other using basin averaged values of three gridded and two mascon products it exhibited a high consistency with a mean correlation of determination from 0 70 to 0 89 in the ltib the relative uncertainty associated with the different products of grace derived twsa using the gtch method is shown in fig 3 results indicated that the csr m and jpl m solutions presented the highest uncertainties estimated to be 18 62 mm and 18 20 mm as compared with others uncertainties followed by the csr sh 10 95 mm jpl sh 13 56 mm and the gfz sh 9 72 respectively further investigation on the individual time signals of twsa time series suggested that the differences between the three spherical harmonic gridded based and the latter two mascon solutions were mainly due to their larger monthly amplitudes which can be observed from fig 2 with under and over estimation of the long term trends using stl seasonal trend decomposition using loess huang et al 2019 fig 4 respectively carefully selecting the twsa time series and improving its precision therefore are very essential for a better understanding of hydrological processes and disaggregation of tws changes to individual components of a specific basin hence the average value of five products of grace derived twsa from 2003 to 2016 was adopted to generate combined twsa series fig 2 to guarantee the best estimation of the grace derived gwsa for the ltib the monthly regional mean of twsa was computed from different grace derived products as shown in fig 2 for the last 14 years 2003 2016 the linear trend of combined twsa over the ltib showed a decline of 3 61 mm yr an equivalent of water height which is about 2 55 km3 yr fig 5 exhibits the monthly time series based on temporal changes in precipitation anomaly and sc pdsi overall the variations in precipitation anomaly were consistent with sc pdsi fig 5 and gwsa on a monthly scale as shown in fig 7 particularly the sc pdsi time series data were constantly negative from january 2008 to july 2010 indicating a drought condition within this duration gwsa was also found to be declining fig 7 during 2010 which agrees with this finding iqbal et al 2016 pakistan faced massive and small floods as well as flash foods in consecutive years of 2010 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 rehman et al 2015 which continued into 2015 heavy rainfall of monsoon hit pakistan at the end of july 2010 the rising trend in gwsa fig 7 after august 2010 played a major role in groundwater recharge 38 46 mm due to the massive flooding the precipitation was observed 155 01 mm in july 2010 and 116 39 mm in august 2010 respectively gwsa also exhibited a sharp increase during these months moreover the flood in 2015 was the second massive flood event that also affected groundwater recharge the estimated precipitation was 151 38 mm in july 2015 and 84 09 mm in august 2015 fig 7 moreover during other flooding years gwsa also had a recharge impact on the other side there are regions close to a network of canals with evidence of recharge from the leakage of the canal network kumar et al 2011 given the widespread canal coverage in this area the spatial variation in groundwater recharge might be affected by natural drainage and canal losses from himalayan meltwater and runoff sources for sustaining groundwater resources in the ltib furthermore the groundwater regime may also be influenced by the seepage from natural surface water bodies mukherjee et al 2018 canals macdonald et al 2016 irrigation return flows bhanja and mukherjee 2019 and groundwater policy interventions bhanja et al 2017a leakages from the distributor canals are significant for the indus 59 000 km of canal network macdonald et al 2015 constituting a major portion of recharge in some regions macdonald et al 2016 although the local scale groundwater withdrawals for public and private water supplies in the urban areas are minor compared to the irrigational abstractions macdonald et al 2015 it can be the potential driver for rapid groundwater depletion macdonald et al 2016 4 2 deriving groundwater storage from grace and hydrological modeled data since the variations in gwsa were not the same in the entire study period 2003 2016 the whole period was divided into three sub periods 2003 2009 2010 2011 2012 2016 for the ltib to explore variations of the gwsa in more detail the sub periods are shown by blue lines in fig 6 from january 2003 to december 2009 gwsa exhibited a decreasing trend with a loss of 2 70 mm yr 1 93 km3 yr on the other hand during 2010 2011 the gwsa showed an increase of 2 75 mm month 3 92 km3 month mann kendall does not consider two values for the trend analysis so we used the monthly data however after the year 2012 a decrease of 0 24 mm yr 0 17 km3 yr was observed in the study area precipitation is the main source of groundwater recharge as well as tws directly or indirectly joshi et al 2020 it is the most important factor that can affect the gwsa variations in the gwsa were consistent with variations in the precipitation anomaly it can be inferred easily that the negative period e g started from 2009 to august 2010 of the gwsa was a result of the hydrological drought the gwsa fig 6 showed a dramatically declining trend suggesting a considerable loss of groundwater due to continuous over pumping was not replenished by runoff from precipitation the abnormal performance of gwsa during monsoon time in 2010 may be strongly relevant to droughts the gwsa decreased continuously during 2010 on the other hand during 2010 2015 several continuous positive precipitation anomalies were explored because of the flood years which increased gwsa however a rapid decrease in gwsa was observed after 2013 due to several continuous negative precipitation anomalies in the summer season to irrigate rice crops huge pumping is required for traditional flood irrigation the groundwater seems to be recharged naturally through frequent flooding events in the ltib fig 6 table 2 presents the results of the groundwater storage trend and depletion rate however growing water demand associated with rapid population growth and the expansion of irrigated agriculture has put more pressure on the sustainability of groundwater storage considering the demographic changes in the indus river basin and its adjacent areas the population density is inevitably increasing freshwater consumption when the local surface water no longer meets growing demand more overexploitation of groundwater is likely to occur the protection of groundwater in this area is bound to be affected by the increased water demand overall as an important producing and living area of the indus the ltib faces great challenges in the management of water reserves especially groundwater reserves 4 3 comparison of groundwater storage anomalies analysis the gwsa played an important role in the hydrological cycle on a monthly and seasonal basis four seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february were used during the seasonal analysis gwsa compared with wghm and pcr globwb gwsa on a monthly and seasonal basis in fig 8 a b grace based and both wghm and pcr globwb gwsa showed significant depletion in ltib the r2 between grace and both wghm and pcr globwb derived gwsa reached 0 81 and 0 75 the root mean square error rmse was 21 53 mm and 82 33 mm fig 9 a b besides gwsa from grace and both wghm and pcr globwb was also estimated on a seasonal basis separately fig 9 c d the correlation found between grace and wghm gwsa on a seasonal basis is spring 0 88 summer 0 73 autumn 0 89 winter 0 98 and between gwsa from grace and pcr globwb is spring 0 83 summer 0 64 autumn 0 85 and winter 0 96 a comparative analysis between grace and ghms derived water storage trends show that the ghms underestimate the water storage trends in comparison to grace reflecting the effects of water withdrawals for climate variations and irrigation scanlon et al 2018 consequently it becomes difficult to separate the effect of human induced components in the human natural complex system due to the large grid size of grace and global hydrological models scanlon et al 2018 overall grace derived and both wghm and pcr globwb gwsa on seasonal and monthly bases compared favorably this verifies that it is reasonable to study variations in groundwater utilizing grace satellite data in the ltib however there are still differences between grace derived and both wghm and pcr globwb gwsa for example grace derived gwsa represented a lower gwsa from 2004 to 2005 while wghm and pcr globwb gwsa is higher in terms of amplitude furthermore grace derived gwsa was much higher than that from wghm and pcr globwb from 2011 to 2012 and 2014 to 2016 fig 8b the grace derived gwsa was validated with the selected 398 observational wells gwla temporally in the validation analysis only those pixels selected were overlaid on the observational wells fig 2 fig 10 shows a comparison of observational wells gwsa against grace derived gwsa on a seasonal and annual scale in the selected region of the ltib the observational wells and grace derived gwsa show a decreasing trend temporally the observational wells and grace derived gwsa showed correlation is 0 69 and 0 82 on a seasonal and annual scale respectively 4 4 spatial distribution of terrestrial water storage and groundwater storage fig 12 exhibits the annual spatial distribution of grace derived gwsa from 2003 to 2016 in the ltib the annual spatial gwsa experienced a noticeable declining trend during the study period however the variations were quite unstable in some regions which indicates this region suffered serious groundwater loss however gwsa showed variations in terms of a rising and declining trend gwsa increased greatly during 2010 2011 and 2015 flooding years this can be seen in the amplitude of three small peaks for the same period in fig 7 it is interesting to observe that the corresponding spatial variation in twsa fig 11 and gwsa is reasonably consistent a decrease in gwsa may be because of increasing water use in the agricultural area and restricted availability of surface water which causes more withdrawal and less recharge to the aquifer depletion is likely to be retained until effective processes are taken to suppress groundwater demand or until the supply or quality of the resources is reduced to the point at which farmers and residents of the regions are forced to react severe shortages of potable water reduced agricultural productivity conflicts and sufferings surely would accompany the supply limited solution 4 5 eof analysis of groundwater storage anomalies gwsa the monthly gwsa time series was decomposed using eof analysis the spatial patterns of the first two eof modes and related temporal principal components are shown in fig 13 the variations in long term inter annual and seasonal trends were detected by the first 2 modes of the eof which represent 73 19 and 12 11 of the total variance respectively table 3 summarizes the eof analysis results the first two eof modes explain more than 80 of the variability present in the gwsa the long term and inter annual variability were captured by pc1 pc1 also showed a climatological shift occurring between 2008 and 2010 the spatial pattern of eof mode 1 illustrates the increasing deviations of gwsa in the eastern part of the ltib but decreasing deviations in most parts of the southwest combined with the amplitude time series pc1 the results indicate that the variations in gwsa decreased during 2003 2016 but increased after august 2010 and august 2015 because of massive flooding in these years in pakistan which are also shown in fig 7 pc2 is related to dominant seasonal variations the amplitude of pc2 approximates a sine wave with crests in april july and troughs in september november combined with the spatial pattern of eof mode 2 an increasing trend can be seen between april and july and a decreasing trend can be seen between september and november 5 conclusion in this study the grace derived gwsa characteristics using gldas simulation were analyzed on a spatial and temporal basis in the ltib during the study period 2003 2016 the results of gwsa showed a net loss of 41 51 km3 over the study period however there were few peaks of increment in the gwsa during the flooding events 2010 2016 temporally spatially almost all areas of the ltib especially in the southeastern parts showed decreasing trends in the gwsa in a year the basin averaged gwsa reached its maximum capacity in july august and minimum capacity in november december with a 1 2 months lag to precipitation the variations in gwsa were analyzed comprehensively in the ltib consisting of spatio temporal patterns and seasonal fluctuations during the study period of 2003 2016 the rate of depletion of gwsa varied spatially in the ltib which was mainly reflected in decreasing trends observed significantly in the ltib the long term trends of gwsa were consistent with the precipitation anomaly on a temporal basis anthropogenic factors could be significant drivers of the gws decreasing trend in the ltib similarly the temporal variability in long term time series of sc pdsi and precipitation anomalies was negative from 2008 to before july 2010 this leads to a drought situation consistent with the long term gwsa trend derived from grace in the same period in fig 7 the uneven precipitation and extensive groundwater abstraction through irrigation caused groundwater storage depletion in the ltib the grace derived gwsa showed good correlations in comparison to the hydrological model estimates the wghm and pcr globwb models and in situ data showed remarkable correlations of 0 81 0 75 and 0 69 respectively estimates from wghm pcr globwb and in situ gwsa showed similar trends as the grace derived gwsa thus estimating the variations in gwsa using grace data in the ltib is feasible the information derived from grace gwsa could be helpful to groundwater policymakers to understand the complete picture of hydrology for groundwater regulation at the basin scale and provide policy recommendations at the national level this study mainly focuses on the estimation of groundwater storage trend and depletion of groundwater using the average of different products of grace in the ltib and some limitations are present including low resolution of the grace data the anthropogenic activities in the variations of groundwater storages and the lack of observational wells data in validation section in the ibis which will be further investigated and fully evaluated in the near future in subsequent research the researchers can choose different grace data such as using new grace advanced mass concentration mascon data

3738,in the lower transboundary indus basin ltib excessive groundwater is being consumed in combination with surface water to meet the increasing demand for irrigation and resulting in groundwater depletion this study employed the generalized three cornered hat method gtch to assess uncertainty of different gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa measurements using grace twsa data and the variance variability in space and time of grace derived groundwater storage anomalies gwsa using empirical orthogonal function eof analysis respectively furthermore monthly grace derived gwsa were estimated using global land data assimilation system gldas model data and gwsa time series trend and depletion of groundwater storage were evaluated using the mannkendal mk trend test and sen s slope estimator in the ltib the twsa and precipitation data depict seasonal characteristics with peaks in the summer and dips in the winter which reflect variation in gwsa respectively additionally it is observed that the variations in gwsa exhibit a downward trend from 2003 to 2016 the results revealed that more than 80 of total variance variability was explained by the first 2 eof modes the results showed that grace derived gwsa is being depleted at a rate of 4 16 0 26 mm per year 2 97 0 19 km3 per year long term monthly mean of grace derived gwsa showed remarkable agreements of correlation of determination r2 with pcraster global balance pcr globwb model 75 and wghm watergap global hydrological model 81 the grace derived gwsa also showed a good correlation of 0 69 and 0 82 with in situ data on seasonal and annual scales respectively this study would be insightful to calculate the agro economic impact of excessive groundwater withdrawal keywords ltib grace groundwater storage change three cornered hat method eof 1 introduction the importance of the stable supply of water and systematic management of water resources has increased with the frequent occurrence of abnormal weather conditions due to climate change and water shortages resulting from regional imbalances in water supply gleeson et al 2013 unsustainable abstraction of groundwater for irrigation and food production continues to be a global water resource challenge facing many alluvial aquifer systems foster and chilton 2003 the amount of groundwater in the world is about 615 000 km3 which is three thousand times more than water contained in ponds and rivers and thirty times more than water present in lakes nazir 1995 groundwater serves about 1 5 to 2 8 billion people around the world for drinking purposes out of which 98 of the population belongs to rural areas morris et al 2003 globally groundwater has been used for irrigation at an alarming rate and accounts for 40 of the irrigation water siebert and doll 2010 along with the rapid population increase and social economic development the groundwater resource is affected by human activities liu et al 2015 about one third of the largest groundwater basins globally are rapidly depleting because of anthropogenic activities without knowing the accurate storage of water among those basins globally the transboundary indus basin aquifer shared between india and pakistan is the second most overstressed aquifer nasa 2015 information on variations in groundwater storage is necessary to assess the water resources lin et al 2020 the monitoring of groundwater storage variations can be beneficial for groundwater management in the indus river basin which is already under stress because of climate change and increased consumption of groundwater across different sectors including agriculture industries and households there are several groundwater management problems due to the over abstraction of groundwater in pakistan the declining of the water table groundwater withdrawal deterioration of groundwater quality and increased salinity are some of the challenges for the groundwater managers chandio and larock 1984 sufi et al 1998 saeed and ashraf 2005 khan et al 2008 qureshi et al 2010 regular groundwater resources management is an important aspect of efficient groundwater management estimation of groundwater exploitation and fluctuations in replenishment are significant parameters of sustainable groundwater management cheema et al 2014 groundwater resource management has become more critical in the absence of any groundwater regulation policy in punjab province pakistan because of over abstraction pakistan is included in the top four countries in the world where the abstraction rate of groundwater has reached 80 km3 year from 1961 to 2010 wada et al 2014 it was observed that groundwater abstraction was caused by increasing population urban expansion and development in irrigation rapidly qureshi 2011 such negative implications can be observed in terms of groundwater loss by 13 5 mm per year from 2003 to 2010 in the punjab province of pakistan iqbal et al 2016 the increase of the pumping wells in punjab province pakistan for example the number increased to 0 94 million from 2000 to 2010 confirmed the water consumption increased in the area punjab 2012 the groundwater is the main source of continuous supply which is being consumed by the farmers to grow wheat rice sugarcane potatoes other cash and fodder crops punjab 2012 how to quantify the effects on groundwater resource because of climate change interference are of particular significance to the sustainable development of the indus river basin therefore unsustainable groundwater use in the indus river basin is a threat to agricultural production and agricultural water management and may cause a serious water crisis in the already water scarce region the use of groundwater is increasing for irrigation poses legitimate questions about the future sustainability of abstraction from the basin and water security of this region remains a major social political concern shah 2009 groundwater monitoring with a network of monitoring wells from regional to basin scale is tiresome time consuming and cost effective the collection of data has irregularity at the temporal scale and the uneven distribution of monitoring wells complex subsurface physical properties and groundwater recharge process make assessment more difficult such a network is unevenly distributed and hampers the heterogeneity of groundwater at a spatial scale although the situations demand regular monitoring and management of groundwater at a large scale therefore information on groundwater variability at a large scale is limited due to the sparse density of groundwater observation data to this end the national aeronautics and space administration nasa launched the grace mission to provide an opportunity to estimate continuous groundwater storage using precise observation of earth s gravity field changes directly from space over time chen et al 2016 tapley et al 2004 grace is a dedicated twin satellite mission that provides imagery of the earth s gravity field monthly tapley et al 2004 grace satellite data have also been used in many studies to

depletion rate over the northwest indian aquifer using a newly developed constrained forward modeling method resulting in a groundwater depletion rate of 14 0 4 km3 year from january 2005 to december

triggers for groundwater storage changes and recharge patterns across south asia while some studies asoka et al 2017 have argued that the precipitation patterns are the primary influencing factor for groundwater level changes across the indian subcontinent other studies on this topic macdonald et al 2016 bhanja et al 2017a bhanja et al 2017b bhanja and mukherjee 2019 suggest that even in areas demonstrating increased precipitation and primary secondary recharge enhanced depletion of groundwater storage are observed which is potentially caused by intensive groundwater abstraction rodell et al 2009 wada et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 doll et al 2014a bhanja et al 2019 bhanja and mukherjee 2019 global hydrological models ghms which model the global and regional water fluxes and storage usually include global land surface models lsms and global hydrological and water resource models ghwrms both of which could provide insight into the global terrestrial water storage scanlon et al 2018 large uncertainties exist in their outputs however mostly because of the limited in situ observations for model inputs and the model structural errors in addition ghm based terrestrial water storage changes may be subject to more delayed release than grace monitoring due to the large efforts required in data collection and preparation the latency in information on ghm terrestrial water storage estimates may not meet the need for water resource management compared to ghms grace satellites provide more direct estimates of changes in terrestrial water storage that are derived from the time variable gravity field in terms of the global water storage famiglietti et al 2015 furthermore grace satellite datasets have been used in many studies to validate ghm outputs doll et al 2014b few studies attempted to characterize groundwater storage in the indus river basin and its adjacent area using grace data and obtain significant findings for instance iqbal et al 2016 estimated groundwater storage variations over upper indus plain and found a great loss of groundwater storage from 2003 to 2014 tang et al 2017 reconstructed annually groundwater storage from 1980 to 2015 and observed a loss of groundwater storage of 13 6 9 7 cm in the punjab province pakistan in addition only a few researchers are developing this understanding of groundwater storage in the indus river basin however no relevant studies have been reported on groundwater storage depletion and its spatio temporal characteristics in the lower transboundary indus basin ltib of the indus river basin since the ltib is a vital area for agricultural production there is a dire need to understand the dynamics of groundwater storage which is necessary for agricultural water management although a previous study by iqbal et al 2016 employed a single product of grace data csr rl05 to estimate groundwater storage in combination with hydrological variables in adjacent regions of indus river basin here we extend this work the main contribution and novelty of this study are 1 we used average data of different products of grace satellite data to reduce the uncertainty among them and to assess the spatiotemporal variations in twsa and gwsa for a longer duration from january 2003 to december 2016 within the ltib 2 gtch method was applied to estimate the uncertainty among different grace derived twsa datasets 3 utilized empirical orthogonal function eof analysis on grace derived gwsa data to compute variability in the long term and inter annual trend at spatio temporal scale and 4 gwsa temporal trend and depletion was evaluated using the mann kendall mk trend test and sen s slope estimator the spatial and temporal changes in gwsa over 14 years provide information on hydrological footprints regional agricultural water resources management sustainable water use water resource variations and water managers to identify the potential areas of excessive groundwater abstraction and how they are occurring during various years this study assesses the potential and effectiveness of grace satellite data for studying groundwater storage variations the objectives of this work were 1 application of gtch method to estimate uncertainties associated with different grace derived twsa datasets 2 temporal trend analysis of grace derived twsa and gwsa using mk trend test and sen s slope estimator 3 validation of grace derived gwsa with the wghm pcr globwb and in situ gwsa temporally 4 perform eof analysis on grace derived gwsa to evaluate spatio temporal trends 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the transboundary indus basin covers an area of 1 16 million km2 geographically on the earth s crust because of the large region it has variations in altitude from sea level to 8011 m fig 1 the indus river is the main river of the transboundary indus basin it flows 3 180 km to the indian ocean through the hilly terrain of the karakoram himalayan and the hindu kush junction the indus river has about 1 million km2 of drainage area with an average annual discharge of 7900 m3 s which is one of the major transboundary rivers in the world the transboundary indus basin has 61 of its area in pakistan and presents an important source for hydropower irrigation and water supply shamsudduha and panda 2019 29 in india and 8 in afghanistan and china the major portion of the transboundary indus basin aquifer is shared between pakistan and india the indus river serves more than three hundred million people including 61 living in pakistan 35 in india and 4 on the chinese and afghan sides of the basin riparian countries of the transboundary indus basin depend on as the source of water thus water security challenges are vital to the sustainable development of this region the hydrologic processes of the indus river are associated with glaciated mountain valleys in the upper transboundary indus basin with monsoon plains in the ltib and a deltaic coastline each of which has characteristic and extensive water management regimes khan and adams 2019 the transboundary indus basin exhibits variability in precipitation land use water use and topography due to the complex hydrological processes cheema et al 2014 the climate in the indus river basin is unique and reflects the interaction between different circulation systems the two important circulations indian summer monsoons and westerly disturbances contribute to 46 3 199 35 mm and 47 2 203 51 mm of annual precipitation for the entire indus basin respectively ul hasson and bohner 2019 hence because of its unique geographical location and critical role in crop supply to feed people a case study of long term groundwater storage changes was carried out over the ltib in this study we selected only the ltib for further investigation of groundwater storage depletion as it is the main region for irrigation through groundwater abstraction and large fluctuations in groundwater storage compared to the rest part of the indus river basin 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 grace data five gridded grace twsa products including two mascon based products having a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 from the jet propulsion

mass grids landn the grace mascon products were upscaled to 1 to match the resolution of sh based gridded grace products using pixel averaging based on bilinear interpolation the difference between the mascon and sh based gridded products is ocean and land zones are defined explicitly during the mascon processing consequently reducing leakage errors generally higher land signals leak into the lower ocean signals relative to the sh based gridded products scanlon et al 2016 the average of these grace datasets was used in this study the accuracy can be improved using averaged data of these datasets landerer and swenson 2012 seyoum and milewski 2017 linear interpolation was utilized to fill all the missing month data using the mean values before and after the missing month long et al 2015 to restore the original signal that was lost during the pre processing a multiplicative scaling factor was applied to the monthly mass grid data provided by the grace satellite seyoum et al 2019 the tws contains groundwater storage gws surface water sw soil moisture storage sms snow water equivalent swe runoff qs and canopy water storage cws rodell et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 rahaman et al

rodell et al 2004 it provides 3 hour to monthly datasets with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and 1 1 using data assimilation methodology this study used a 1 degree spatial resolution of gldas land surface models lsms http disc sci gsfc nasa gov services grads gds gldas to obtain the soil moisture sms canopy water storage cws and surface runoff qs the average value of the four land surface models noah mosaic clm vic was utilized to estimate the anomaly of sms qs and cws to minimize any error or biases katpatal et al 2018 the gldas data sms qs and cws were also processed similarly to the grace anomaly long term average 2004 2009 the sms qs cws anomaly at time t was estimated by equation 2 δ g t a g t g 2004 2009 a v g where g represents sms qs cws and g 2004 2009 avg represents the average g from 2004 to 2009 isolating the other gldas derived variables yields gwsa rahaman et al 2019 it was assumed that the biosphere and snow influence is very negligible and gwsa can be estimated by isolating the anomaly of soil moisture storage canopy water storage and surface runoff from twsa zhang et al 2014 swenson and wahr 2003 rodell et al 2009 so groundwater storage anomalies gwsa were estimated using equation 3 3 δ g w s a δ t w s a δ s m s a δ q s a δ c w s a the groundwater storage data obtained from wghm and pcr globwb models were also processed using similar equations used for gldas data to generate gwsa these gwsa were used to validate and compare with grace derived gwsa 2 2 3 trmm data tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm is a joint jaxa and nasa mission to monitor

2012 yatagai et al 2013 the trmm product provides rainfall data at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 the spatial resolution was aggregated to 1 degree to match with grace resolution of 1 degree data using the bilinear interpolation method the monthly trmm 3b43 version 7 http disc sci gsfc nasa gov precipitation precipitation data was used from 2003 to 2016in this study 3 observational wells groundwater storage in pakistan the groundwater level data is measured twice by punjab irrigation and drainage authority pida on seasonal bases i e pre monsoon june and post monsoon october https irrigation punjab gov pk to eliminate outliers gaps in the data and irregular jumps the groundwater level data was pre processed the 398 groundwater monitoring stations were chosen without missing data to correspond with grace data from 2003 to 2014 temporal consistency in data was tested while choosing the study period and stations at first long term 2003 2014 seasonal average groundwater level was subtracted from individual seasonal groundwater level data to estimate the groundwater level anomaly gwla as shown in equation 4 4 gwla g w l gwl ltm here gwl represents the groundwater level and gwl ltm is the long term mean for the groundwater level of the same station next the gwla was multiplied by a specific yield s y to obtain the gwsa strassberg et al 2007 as shown in equation 5 the specific yield of the ltib was obtained from tang et al 2017 5 gwsa g w l a s y in this equation gwsa represents the groundwater storage anomalies mm and s y is the average specific yield 3 1 pcr globwb the pcraster global water balance pcr globwb model developed by natthachet et al 2018 is a spatial based hydrology and water resources model for global to regional studies it provides terrestrial water storage with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 globally wada et al 2010 van beek et al 2011 and was upscaled to 1 degree by pixel averaging using the bilinear interpolation method the simulations of the pcr globwb model integrate terrestrial water storage groundwater soil moisture snow and surface water reservoirs rivers lakes and inundated water it also stimulates the anthropogenic activities of human water use this model derived data was used from january 2003 to november 2015 more detail about the pcr globwb model can be found in supplementary material 3 1 1 wghm

doll et al 2003 schmied et al 2014 derives the water balance storage components and their related fluxes it provides data at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 doll et al 2003 and was upscaled to 1

calculated based on a two layer soil water balance model driven from different parameters like precipitation surface runoff moisture demand evapotranspiration and moisture supply palmer 1965 wet and dry conditions can be evaluated by positive and negative values of pdsi due to the climate dependent variable input in the index the impact of climate change can be evaluated on drought and climate variations it provides a significant comparison in space and time alley 1984 heim 2002 sheffield et al 2012 van der schrier et al 2013 the monthly gws derived from pcr globwb model data was used from 2003 to 2015 3 2 methods 3 2 1 generalized three cornered hat method gtch in this study we determined the quality of the twsa series by making a comparison of different grace products csr gfz jpl csr m jpl m using the generalized three cornered hat gtch method the gtch method is an efficient way to assess the relative uncertainties in the data set without relying on a comparison with true variables when at least three different sets of the same process are available however it should be noted that this method does not allow an estimation of the absolute uncertainty of one series particularly the results only make sense when all series are considered together and they have no physical meaning by themselves koot et al 2006 the relative uncertainties among the grace derived twsa using different products of grace was computed ferreira et al 2016 awange et al 2016 torcaso et al 1998 galindo and palacio 1999 by first considering the available time series of the twsa products and supposing each time series can be written by equation 6 x i s єi i 1 n 6 where xi 1 2 n in which i relates to each twsa product s is the original signal and єi represents the measurement error chin et al 2005 because the true estimation of s is not available n 1 twsa products and one considered as the reference series chosen arbitrarily could be estimated by equation 7 koot et al 2006 yin xi xn єi єn i 1 2 n 7 where xn reference time series the results are independent of the special choice of a twsa product awange et al 2016 torcaso et al 1998 galindo and palacio 1999 chin et al 2005 koot et al 2006 then the difference of the covariance matrix s of the series was estimated the unknown n n covariance matrix was introduced of individual noises r r r t r nn which correspond to s as described by galindo and palacio in equation 8 galindo and palacio 2003 s 8 where i n 1 n 1 identity matrix r n 1 vector r1 n r2 n r n 1 n t u is n 1 vector 11 0 1 t and r can be estimated using equation 9 s rnn uut urt rut 9 equation 8 is undetermined to estimate n free parameters an appropriate objective function should be defined the objective function is proposed by galindo and palacio and given in equation 10 galindo and palacio 1999 f r r nn 10 with a constraint function shown in equation 11 g r r n n r nn r r nn u t â s 1 â r r nn u k 0 where k denotes k d e t s n 1 the initial conditions are selected to assure that the initial values fulfilled the constraints and shown in equation 12 torcaso et al 1998 0 i n and 2 ut s 1 u 1 12 after determining the free parameters r 1 n r 2 n r nn by reducing equation 10 the rest of the unknown elements can be computed using equation 9 and the square root of the diagonal elements of r and r nn show the uncertainties between different datasets 3 2 2 empirical orthogonal function analysis eof with empirical orthogonal function eof analyses the dominant spatial gwsa patterns and generate the gwsa time series can be identified hu et al 2014 which explains the magnitude of the variation of each eof mode of the monthly gwsa the spatial temporal structures of the long term variations of the monthly gwsa are examined by the empirical orthogonal function eof analyses lorenz 1956 empirical orthogonal function analysis eof also known as principal component analysis pca is a structural feature in the analysis of matrix data that serves to separate prominent spatiotemporal patterns existing in a geophysical field lorenz 1956 it has been used to compute spatio temporal patterns of sea surface temperature sst rainfall humidity pressure fields etc hannachi et al 2007 though pca has some limitations one of the majors is the mixing problem because researchers proposed modified eof analyses such as rotated eofs reofs richman 1986 complex eofs simplified eofs etc hannachi et al 2007 this study used reofs to compute independent temporal and corresponding spatial patterns statistically more detail about eof analysis process and formulization can be found in supplementary material 3 2 3 trend analysis the grace derived gwsa trend was analyzed using the mk trend test at a 95 statistical significance level the trend magnitude was estimated by using the theil sen approach rahaman et al 2019 the correlation was used to understand the strength of agreement among grace derived gwsa and wghm pcr globwb model and in situ data gwsa a regression fitting analysis was also applied to understand the relationship and the variability between the time series of grace derived gwsa and wghm and pcr globwb model derived gwsa 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatio temporal terrestrial water storage variations when grace derived twsa is compared with each other using basin averaged values of three gridded and two mascon products it exhibited a high consistency with a mean correlation of determination from 0 70 to 0 89 in the ltib the relative uncertainty associated with the different products of grace derived twsa using the gtch method is shown in fig 3 results indicated that the csr m and jpl m solutions presented the highest uncertainties estimated to be 18 62 mm and 18 20 mm as compared with others uncertainties followed by the csr sh 10 95 mm jpl sh 13 56 mm and the gfz sh 9 72 respectively further investigation on the individual time signals of twsa time series suggested that the differences between the three spherical harmonic gridded based and the latter two mascon solutions were mainly due to their larger monthly amplitudes which can be observed from fig 2 with under and over estimation of the long term trends using stl seasonal trend decomposition using loess huang et al 2019 fig 4 respectively carefully selecting the twsa time series and improving its precision therefore are very essential for a better understanding of hydrological processes and disaggregation of tws changes to individual components of a specific basin hence the average value of five products of grace derived twsa from 2003 to 2016 was adopted to generate combined twsa series fig 2 to guarantee the best estimation of the grace derived gwsa for the ltib the monthly regional mean of twsa was computed from different grace derived products as shown in fig 2 for the last 14 years 2003 2016 the linear trend of combined twsa over the ltib showed a decline of 3 61 mm yr an equivalent of water height which is about 2 55 km3 yr fig 5 exhibits the monthly time series based on temporal changes in precipitation anomaly and sc pdsi overall the variations in precipitation anomaly were consistent with sc pdsi fig 5 and gwsa on a monthly scale as shown in fig 7 particularly the sc pdsi time series data were constantly negative from january 2008 to july 2010 indicating a drought condition within this duration gwsa was also found to be declining fig 7 during 2010 which agrees with this finding iqbal et al 2016 pakistan faced massive and small floods as well as flash foods in consecutive years of 2010 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 rehman et al 2015 which continued into 2015 heavy rainfall of monsoon hit pakistan at the end of july 2010 the rising trend in gwsa fig 7 after august 2010 played a major role in groundwater recharge 38 46 mm due to the massive flooding the precipitation was observed 155 01 mm in july 2010 and 116 39 mm in august 2010 respectively gwsa also exhibited a sharp increase during these months moreover the flood in 2015 was the second massive flood event that also affected groundwater recharge the estimated precipitation was 151 38 mm in july 2015 and 84 09 mm in august 2015 fig 7 moreover during other flooding years gwsa also had a recharge impact on the other side there are regions close to a network of canals with evidence of recharge from the leakage of the canal network kumar et al 2011 given the widespread canal coverage in this area the spatial variation in groundwater recharge might be affected by natural drainage and canal losses from himalayan meltwater and runoff sources for sustaining groundwater resources in the ltib furthermore the groundwater regime may also be influenced by the seepage from natural surface water bodies mukherjee et al 2018 canals macdonald et al 2016 irrigation return flows bhanja and mukherjee 2019 and groundwater policy interventions bhanja et al 2017a leakages from the distributor canals are significant for the indus 59 000 km of canal network macdonald et al 2015 constituting a major portion of recharge in some regions macdonald et al 2016 although the local scale groundwater withdrawals for public and private water supplies in the urban areas are minor compared to the irrigational abstractions macdonald et al 2015 it can be the potential driver for rapid groundwater depletion macdonald et al 2016 4 2 deriving groundwater storage from grace and hydrological modeled data since the variations in gwsa were not the same in the entire study period 2003 2016 the whole period was divided into three sub periods 2003 2009 2010 2011 2012 2016 for the ltib to explore variations of the gwsa in more detail the sub periods are shown by blue lines in fig 6 from january 2003 to december 2009 gwsa exhibited a decreasing trend with a loss of 2 70 mm yr 1 93 km3 yr on the other hand during 2010 2011 the gwsa showed an increase of 2 75 mm month 3 92 km3 month mann kendall does not consider two values for the trend analysis so we used the monthly data however after the year 2012 a decrease of 0 24 mm yr 0 17 km3 yr was observed in the study area precipitation is the main source of groundwater recharge as well as tws directly or indirectly joshi et al 2020 it is the most important factor that can affect the gwsa variations in the gwsa were consistent with variations in the precipitation anomaly it can be inferred easily that the negative period e g started from 2009 to august 2010 of the gwsa was a result of the hydrological drought the gwsa fig 6 showed a dramatically declining trend suggesting a considerable loss of groundwater due to continuous over pumping was not replenished by runoff from precipitation the abnormal performance of gwsa during monsoon time in 2010 may be strongly relevant to droughts the gwsa decreased continuously during 2010 on the other hand during 2010 2015 several continuous positive precipitation anomalies were explored because of the flood years which increased gwsa however a rapid decrease in gwsa was observed after 2013 due to several continuous negative precipitation anomalies in the summer season to irrigate rice crops huge pumping is required for traditional flood irrigation the groundwater seems to be recharged naturally through frequent flooding events in the ltib fig 6 table 2 presents the results of the groundwater storage trend and depletion rate however growing water demand associated with rapid population growth and the expansion of irrigated agriculture has put more pressure on the sustainability of groundwater storage considering the demographic changes in the indus river basin and its adjacent areas the population density is inevitably increasing freshwater consumption when the local surface water no longer meets growing demand more overexploitation of groundwater is likely to occur the protection of groundwater in this area is bound to be affected by the increased water demand overall as an important producing and living area of the indus the ltib faces great challenges in the management of water reserves especially groundwater reserves 4 3 comparison of groundwater storage anomalies analysis the gwsa played an important role in the hydrological cycle on a monthly and seasonal basis four seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february were used during the seasonal analysis gwsa compared with wghm and pcr globwb gwsa on a monthly and seasonal basis in fig 8 a b grace based and both wghm and pcr globwb gwsa showed significant depletion in ltib the r2 between grace and both wghm and pcr globwb derived gwsa reached 0 81 and 0 75 the root mean square error rmse was 21 53 mm and 82 33 mm fig 9 a b besides gwsa from grace and both wghm and pcr globwb was also estimated on a seasonal basis separately fig 9 c d the correlation found between grace and wghm gwsa on a seasonal basis is spring 0 88 summer 0 73 autumn 0 89 winter 0 98 and between gwsa from grace and pcr globwb is spring 0 83 summer 0 64 autumn 0 85 and winter 0 96 a comparative analysis between grace and ghms derived water storage trends show that the ghms underestimate the water storage trends in comparison to grace reflecting the effects of water withdrawals for climate variations and irrigation scanlon et al 2018 consequently it becomes difficult to separate the effect of human induced components in the human natural complex system due to the large grid size of grace and global hydrological models scanlon et al 2018 overall grace derived and both wghm and pcr globwb gwsa on seasonal and monthly bases compared favorably this verifies that it is reasonable to study variations in groundwater utilizing grace satellite data in the ltib however there are still differences between grace derived and both wghm and pcr globwb gwsa for example grace derived gwsa represented a lower gwsa from 2004 to 2005 while wghm and pcr globwb gwsa is higher in terms of amplitude furthermore grace derived gwsa was much higher than that from wghm and pcr globwb from 2011 to 2012 and 2014 to 2016 fig 8b the grace derived gwsa was validated with the selected 398 observational wells gwla temporally in the validation analysis only those pixels selected were overlaid on the observational wells fig 2 fig 10 shows a comparison of observational wells gwsa against grace derived gwsa on a seasonal and annual scale in the selected region of the ltib the observational wells and grace derived gwsa show a decreasing trend temporally the observational wells and grace derived gwsa showed correlation is 0 69 and 0 82 on a seasonal and annual scale respectively 4 4 spatial distribution of terrestrial water storage and groundwater storage fig 12 exhibits the annual spatial distribution of grace derived gwsa from 2003 to 2016 in the ltib the annual spatial gwsa experienced a noticeable declining trend during the study period however the variations were quite unstable in some regions which indicates this region suffered serious groundwater loss however gwsa showed variations in terms of a rising and declining trend gwsa increased greatly during 2010 2011 and 2015 flooding years this can be seen in the amplitude of three small peaks for the same period in fig 7 it is interesting to observe that the corresponding spatial variation in twsa fig 11 and gwsa is reasonably consistent a decrease in gwsa may be because of increasing water use in the agricultural area and restricted availability of surface water which causes more withdrawal and less recharge to the aquifer depletion is likely to be retained until effective processes are taken to suppress groundwater demand or until the supply or quality of the resources is reduced to the point at which farmers and residents of the regions are forced to react severe shortages of potable water reduced agricultural productivity conflicts and sufferings surely would accompany the supply limited solution 4 5 eof analysis of groundwater storage anomalies gwsa the monthly gwsa time series was decomposed using eof analysis the spatial patterns of the first two eof modes and related temporal principal components are shown in fig 13 the variations in long term inter annual and seasonal trends were detected by the first 2 modes of the eof which represent 73 19 and 12 11 of the total variance respectively table 3 summarizes the eof analysis results the first two eof modes explain more than 80 of the variability present in the gwsa the long term and inter annual variability were captured by pc1 pc1 also showed a climatological shift occurring between 2008 and 2010 the spatial pattern of eof mode 1 illustrates the increasing deviations of gwsa in the eastern part of the ltib but decreasing deviations in most parts of the southwest combined with the amplitude time series pc1 the results indicate that the variations in gwsa decreased during 2003 2016 but increased after august 2010 and august 2015 because of massive flooding in these years in pakistan which are also shown in fig 7 pc2 is related to dominant seasonal variations the amplitude of pc2 approximates a sine wave with crests in april july and troughs in september november combined with the spatial pattern of eof mode 2 an increasing trend can be seen between april and july and a decreasing trend can be seen between september and november 5 conclusion in this study the grace derived gwsa characteristics using gldas simulation were analyzed on a spatial and temporal basis in the ltib during the study period 2003 2016 the results of gwsa showed a net loss of 41 51 km3 over the study period however there were few peaks of increment in the gwsa during the flooding events 2010 2016 temporally spatially almost all areas of the ltib especially in the southeastern parts showed decreasing trends in the gwsa in a year the basin averaged gwsa reached its maximum capacity in july august and minimum capacity in november december with a 1 2 months lag to precipitation the variations in gwsa were analyzed comprehensively in the ltib consisting of spatio temporal patterns and seasonal fluctuations during the study period of 2003 2016 the rate of depletion of gwsa varied spatially in the ltib which was mainly reflected in decreasing trends observed significantly in the ltib the long term trends of gwsa were consistent with the precipitation anomaly on a temporal basis anthropogenic factors could be significant drivers of the gws decreasing trend in the ltib similarly the temporal variability in long term time series of sc pdsi and precipitation anomalies was negative from 2008 to before july 2010 this leads to a drought situation consistent with the long term gwsa trend derived from grace in the same period in fig 7 the uneven precipitation and extensive groundwater abstraction through irrigation caused groundwater storage depletion in the ltib the grace derived gwsa showed good correlations in comparison to the hydrological model estimates the wghm and pcr globwb models and in situ data showed remarkable correlations of 0 81 0 75 and 0 69 respectively estimates from wghm pcr globwb and in situ gwsa showed similar trends as the grace derived gwsa thus estimating the variations in gwsa using grace data in the ltib is feasible the information derived from grace gwsa could be helpful to groundwater policymakers to understand the complete picture of hydrology for groundwater regulation at the basin scale and provide policy recommendations at the national level this study mainly focuses on the estimation of groundwater storage trend and depletion of groundwater using the average of different products of grace in the ltib and some limitations are present including low resolution of the grace data the anthropogenic activities in the variations of groundwater storages and the lack of observational wells data in validation section in the ibis which will be further investigated and fully evaluated in the near future in subsequent research the researchers can choose different grace data such as using new grace advanced mass concentration mascon data

3739,the ease of access to media resources and computational power has recently generated interest in using vision based approaches for hydraulic monitoring a key challenge for non intrusive image based hydrology measurement methods is incorporating different hydraulic variables as prior knowledge with image information we propose a photogrammetry based method called l 1 diffusion derived from the convection diffusion equation commonly used in hydrodynamics with an additional regularization term to estimate the fluid motion field in the image plane from which the free surface velocity can be further obtained using the photogrammetric projection relationship between the image plane and world coordinates the inverse problem is used to discuss the relationship between the widely used space time image velocimetry stiv and the proposed l 1 diffusion to validate the proposed method unmanned aerial vehicle uav images as well as in situ acoustic doppler current profiler adcp experiments were carried out based on comparison results with the adcp measurement and vision based flow field estimation the newly proposed l 1 diffusion algorithm can accurately and efficiently estimate the free surface velocity of a river from the image sequences in a variety of scenarios keywords optical flow variational method stiv free surface velocity 1 introduction extreme weather events and climate change have led to an increased likelihood of severe flooding around the world monitoring critical hydrological elements like flow velocity water level and flow charge is critical for risk management and water supplementation because of the complex hydraulic characteristics of rivers and the harsh wilderness a timely and accurate velocity measurement has always been a difficult proposition to serve as the basis of future flood prediction at present most conventional flow velocity measurements are performed in an intrusive time consuming and labor intensive manner a classic example of gauging free surface velocity is by measuring the time and distance for a manually released float between consecutive river sections however the collapse of dykes and banks caused by excessive flooding could endanger the operator during flood measurement based on the doppler principle the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp can more accurately measure the velocity distribution of the cross section which is the benchmark for the accurate comparison of various current measurement algorithms however it cannot be used in real time during flooding or when there is severe sediment disturbance problems with these intrusion based methods have compelled people to look for alternative methods for conducting velocity monitoring which are automatic secure reliable and non intrusive the radar equipment for example is one solution for this problem alimenti alimenti et al 2020 used the doppler radar sensor to river surface velocity and discharge estimation however with the development of computer vision and the available computational resources image based approaches for measuring free surface velocity have been the subject of extensive research concerning river velocity monitoring and may be another promising solutions for those challenging problems adrian 1991 firstly proposed the piv method which aya et al 1995 analyzed flood surface velocity by capturing features such as floating particles or free surface deformation caused by waves or ripples hauet et al 2008 and tracked them in consecutive frames by using correlation based techniques which named large scale particle image lspiv particle tracking velocimetry ptv patalano et al 2017 is another example of a correlation based algorithm that does not divide the region of interest into multiple subdomains but compares them to subsequence frames ptv is conducted by directly tracking the individual features between consecutive frames however it is less applicable when the density of the tracer is low and inhomogeneous and the majority of the fluid has no defined surface features to improve the accuracy a manually released tracer is required for correlation based methods which is trouble to in situ measurements for addressing the issue of lack of defined surface features fujita et al 2007 proposed the space time image velocimetry stiv method by stacking image pixels at a preset search line to infer the streamwise convection velocity stiv can estimate surface velocity without using additional tracers however it is ill posed in terms of the inverse problem in other words depending on the distribution of the line pattern in the space time image there may be many velocities to be chosen and only a one dimensional velocity can be obtained to address this issue the variational method as a classical method for solving inverse problem was used to infer the motion field from an image sequence in comparison to correlation based methods like ptv or lspiv the variational method can incorporate different assumptions based on prior knowledge of fluid dynamics and obtain a global solution without post processing on the other hand for the ill posed problem in stiv the variational methods convert the ill posed problem into a deterministic optimization problem based on regularization theory tikhonov 1963 recently khalid et al 2019 used the huber function and improved the brightness consistency assumption in field experiments and the results of the estimation were further compared with those of lspiv wildes et al 2000 wildes et al 1997 estimated fluid velocity from image sequences by solving the euler lagrange equation and compare their results with measurement data although the variational method has been successful in modeling problems of complex fluid motion estimation cassisa et al 2011 ruhnau et al 2007 zuo and qi 2017 relatively little research has been done on in situ free surface measurement the velocity obtained under different hydraulic and photography conditions on the contrary is extremely important for hydrological science and risk management decision making the goal of this research is to find an accurate and non intrusive photogrammetry based algorithm for estimating river surface velocity in the field to accomplish this the general energy functional form for a photogrammetry based fluid motion field estimation is developed given the illumination change that occurs during the field monitoring task the l 1 norm is chosen as the basis for the proposed energy function and a comparison between the stiv method and the variational method is performed finally three in situ experiments are carried out to validate the new algorithm 2 methodology 2 1 definition of problem the task of monitoring river velocimetry using a photogrammetry based method relies on a reasonable estimation of the image velocity over a given time period once the velocity vector in the image plane has been accurately estimated the velocity vector in the world coordinates can be calculated using the projection matrix to formulate a mathematical model used for depicting the fluid motion i x y t is denoted as the pixel intensity of an image sequence depicting the fluid motion where x y is the spatial coordinates of the image domain and t the time index the assumption of brightness constancy in the computer vision community states that the pixel intensity is a constant within a small range of time period δ t and spatial displacement δ x δ y 1 i x y t i x δ x y δ y t δ t using taylor expansion the assumption of brightness consistency can be written in a more compact form as eq 2 2 i t i t ω 0 eq 2 is valid for every point in the image domain with a pixel velocity field ω u v t d x d t d y d t t fig 1 shows the consecutive image records in a natural channel the motion of a fluid is much more complex than that of a rigid body as wave breaking or diffusion effects may result in a changeable pixel field in the fluid instead there is an alternative way of considering the assumption of brightness consistency by using the convection diffusion equation as in eq 3 which describes the transferred physical phenomena of scalar quantities due to the effects of diffusion and convection 3 c t d c ω c r where c d and ω represent the concentration diffusion coefficient and velocity field respectively the external source term is defined as r the laplacian operator and divergence operator are denoted by δ 2 x 2 2 y 2 and x y respectively in the case of an incompressible fluid the continuity equation can be expressed as eq 4 4 ω 0 the scalar transportation equation eq 5 for an incompressible fluid can be derived from the combination of eq 3 and eq 4 5 c t c t ω d δ c r previous studies cassisa et al 2011 corpetti et al 2006 zhou et al 2000 have demonstrated that it is reasonable to assume that c i where i denotes the pixel intensity the transportation equation of the incompressible fluid eq 5 can be transformed into a pixel based convection diffusion equation as shown in eq 6 when there is no external light source which means r 0 in eq 5 6 i t i t ω d δ i 0 a comparison between eq 2 and eq 6 indicates that the assumption of brightness consistency is the result of the pixel based transportation equation without considering the diffusion effects based on the regularization theory the problem of velocity estimation can be formulated as the minimization of the energy functional eq 7 in a deterministic way by utilizing the variational method the energy functional eq 7 is an integration over the image domain and consists of a data term and a regularization term the data term describes the pixel convection diffusion phenomenon with a scoring function φ with the prior assumption about the smoothness of flow field the regularization term is used to penalize the gradient of interesting velocity field from high variation by the regularization function ϕ so the problem of estimating pixel velocity field can be transformed to find the minimization function in eq 7 7 min ω e ω x φ i t i t ω d δ i 2 data term ϕ ω 2 regularization term d x 2 2 l 1 diffusion for surface velocity estimation the pixel intensity effected by external light source is the only information to estimate the pixel velocity field however as most hydrological monitoring tasks are conducted in natural conditions conditions of a stationary light source and local fluctuations are often worse than those in laboratory conditions which causes unavoidable illumination errors and low accurate velocity measurement to develop a robust nonintrusive photogrammetry method for surface velocity measurement the l 1 norm i e φ s 2 ϕ s 2 s 2 is selected as the basis for construction of energy functional in eq 7 because it is more robust with illumination errors and outliers as described in rez et al 2013 and zach et al 2007 the energy functional eq 7 to be minimized in this study has the form of eq 8 with λ being the parameter for adjusting the smoothness of final velocity field the λ is selected by empirical setting with smaller λ suggests smoother velocity field 8 e ω x λ i t i t ω d δ i ω d x the energy functional in eq 8 is still convex but not continuously differentiable owing to the l 1 operator one way for minimizing the functional energy shown in eq 8 is to use the modified differentiable l 1 norm as φ s 2 ϕ s 2 s 2 2 where the is a small positive constant based on the differentiable substitution the corresponding euler lagrange equations which are two coupled non linear partial differential equations could be derived and solved using the fix point iteration brox et al 2004 after experiments in different solving algorithms the approach proposed by zach et al 2007 is used for it s potential advantage in real time computation considering a small displacement case zach et al 2007 thought that the problem could be formulated as minimizing the convex approximation shown in eq 9 so the auxiliary variable v is introduced for approximation of ω the homogeneous diffusion effect is considered here by making i t i t d δ i to be in the standard local linearized form zach et al 2007 wedel et al 2009 rez et al 2013 and the current residual is denoted as ρ v i t i t v thus the process of estimating the fluid velocity field in the image plane is transformed to slove the optimization problem of eq 9 which generates two sub optimization problems based on the classical prime dual principle 9 e ω 1 2 θ ω v 2 λ ρ v d x where θ is a small constant for guarantee v is a valid approximation for ω herein the optimization procedures for eq 9 are briefly introduced zach et al 2007 1 with v fixed the equation eq 10 is firstly solved 10 min ω ω 1 2 θ ω v 2 d x the first problem has the form of a total variation denoising model of rudin osher fatemi rudin et al 1992 zach et al 2007 which can be solved efficiently and uniquely using a duality based algorithm chambolle 2004 11 ω v θ p to solve eq 11 the auxiliary variable p should fulfilled the equation eq 12 12 θ p v θ p v p eq 12 can be solved by a fixed point scheme iteration as described in eq 13 where τ stands for the time step in the iteration and should be satisfied the condition of τ 1 8 13 p k 1 p k τ div p k v θ 1 τ div p k v θ 2 then with ω fixed the equation eq 14 is to be solved 14 min v ω 1 2 θ ω v 2 λ ρ v d x the solution of eq 14 can be reached through the thresholding theorem in eq 15 15 v ω λ θ i if ρ ω λ θ i 2 λ θ i if ρ ω λ θ i 2 ρ ω i i t i if ρ ω λ θ i 2 it should be noted that these derivations are only valid for small displacements while for other cases they do not behave well due to the previous taylor expansion assumption the problem of large displacement estimation can be tackled by using the multiresolution coarse to fine image pyramid together with the warping strategy heitz et al 2008 brox et al 2004 meinhardt llopis and s a nchez 2012 fig 2 shows the producers of image pyramid by using multi resolution strategy images of interest are down sampled at each pyramid to find larger flow vectors the flow field from the coarser pyramid level is propagated to the finer pyramid level as a good initialization approximation for a finer solution this recursive procedure of propagation is finished until finest level of pyramid reached and warping is helpful for not restricted to a local minima and can produce a better estimation for true displacement vectors at each level as a demonstration fig 3 shows the dense pixel flow field derived from consecutive images based on the the proposed algorithm which reveals the direction and magnitude of flow velocity in the image plane at each pixel position and provides a direct idea of the kinetic characteristics of the channel however due to the perspective effect the flow field in the image is not equal to the flow field in the real world e g m s based on the photogrammetry principle how the flow field in the real physical world could be derived from the pixel flow field will be introduced in detail in section 3 1 the implementation of proposed algorithm were based on the open source library scikit image van der walt et al 2014 and opencv bradski 2000 2 3 proposed l 1 diffusion algorithm relation with stiv method briefly the stiv proposed by fujita et al 2007 is a novel algorithm applied in hydrology for free surface monitoring which is widely used in japan compared to the correlation based lspiv method stiv has the advantage of not requiring a manually released tracer the basic idea of stiv is to observe the angle in the so named spatial temporal image which represents the convection velocity along the direction of the search line fig 4 shows the basic procedure for the spatial temporal image generation based on the assumption that the pixel moves at a constant speed v the orientation angle θ of the spatial temporal image is related to the convection velocity along the streamwise direction by stacking the pixel of the interested search line along the time t the velocity can be calculated using eq 16 where α is the velocity coefficient transferring the pixel velocity to world velocity corresponding to external factors such as spatial resolution and frame rate 16 v α tan θ the key to stiv is to determine an accurate angle θ which has recently been improved for resulting in more accurate and efficient measurements under deteriorated scenarios by using frequency analysis fujita et al 2018 and auto correlation fujita et al 2019 inferring the motion field from observations i e image sequences is a standard inverse problem the inverse problem can be used to interpret the relationship between stiv and the variational method considering the convection equation in the one dimensional case in eq 17 17 c t u c x 0 using the same assumption that c i as in the variational method eq 17 can be formulated as eq 18 18 i t u i x 0 it is clear that the solution to the characteristic line in eq 18 has the form x u t c which implies an unchanged pixel status along the characteristic direction as shown in fig 5 which is the basic assumption of stiv based on the above discussion it can be found that on the assumption of c i both stiv and the variational method can infer the velocity by observing the change in pixel intensity between consecutive frames which is the output of the pixel transportation equation from the perspective of the inverse problem the angle in the spatial temporal image which is the output of the stiv method may exist many different values when it is interpreted as the characteristic line of the corresponding pixel transportation equation this is due to the fact that if the pixel moved exactly as described by the transportation equation there would be a unique characteristic line to the corresponding characteristic line however many solutions of the pixel convection diffusion equation may be generated when observing the line pattern in the spatial temporal image which is also known as an ill posed problem in contrast to the stiv method the variational method convert this ill posed problem into a deterministic optimization problem by including a regularization term in the energy functional resulting in an optimal and unique solution under the assumption of flow continuity and smoothness 3 results and discussion 3 1 data acquisition and geometry correction the proposed l 1 diffusion algorithm which contains the procedure of estimation of pixel velocity field and camera calibration is used in this section to estimate the free surface velocity field of various scenarios from the recorded image sequences two image acquisition approaches from a terrestrial camera and uav unmanned aerial vehicle were considered for the analysis the image acquired from a terrestrial camera is much more challenging to analyze than an uav image sequence because the perspective effect leads to an uneven spatial resolution at different locations for recovering motion in the image plane to world coordinates the relationship between the image plane and world coordinates must be established such a relationship can be described using a projection model of intrinsic extrinsic and scale factors in photogrammetry as shown in eq 19 where u v is the image coordinate in the image plane x y z represents the world coordinate and s represents the scale factor the intrinsic parameters denote the parameters related only to the camera itself which can be described using optical lenses sensors etc the extrinsic parameters relative to the reference frame are determined by the rotation matrix r i j and translator vector t 19 s u v 1 1 d x 0 c x 0 1 d y c y 0 0 1 f 0 1 0 f 1 0 0 1 intrinsic parameters r 11 r 12 r 13 t 1 r 21 r 22 r 23 t 2 r 31 r 32 r 33 t 3 extrinsic parameters x y z 1 in practice the projection model shown in eq 19 is usually rewritten as the direct linear transform equations for clarity as shown in eq 20 to determine the coefficients of l i at least six ground control points gcps are required for 11 unknown variables with each gcp contributing two equations to the linear system 20 u l 1 x l 2 y l 3 z l 4 l 9 x l 10 y l 11 z 1 v l 5 x l 6 y l 7 z l 8 l 9 x l 10 y l 11 z 1 in the following experiments concerning terrestrial cameras the coefficients of l i are obtained through a least squares approach by solving the linear equations composed of pixel coordinates and world coordinates of gcps as shown in eq 21 fig 6 b shows the in situ layout of the gcps deployed to make eq 21 be an over determined system which can increase the stability and robustness of the solution and prevent outliers from affecting the overall accuracy of the solution 21 x 1 y 1

total station while the corresponding image coordinates can be obtained through a manual observation of the image the linear system composed of gcps is further solved to obtain the coefficients of l i finally with the calculated l i and current water levels the world coordinates of each gcp can be recalculated and compared with the world coordinates registered using the total station the results of the comparison are regarded the re projection error as a metric for the calibration accuracy 3 2 results of uav image sequence the use of uavs to estimate free surface velocity is a convenient and effective measurement method particularly when geological disasters caused by flash floods result in conventional measurement equipment disable such as adcp to illustrate the procedure for estimating the two dimensional free surface velocity a video depicting the upstream of the zinal gauging station from a height of 30 m was used from rousseau 2019 the frame rate time step of the video is 25 hz 1 25 s with resolution 1920 1080 fig 8 a shows the region of interest and its water surface appears opaque because of the sediments carried by the flow which provides a good foundation for photogrammetry based computation by enhancing the contrast of the image fig 8 b shows the results of the instant velocity field estimated from two consecutive images based on the l 1 diffusion method the kinetic characteristics of floods in mountain streams are clearly depicted through the flow field especially for regions where the vortex was affected by topographical reasons this trend of the flow field is similar to the result presented by rousseau 2019 fig 9 a shows the computation results of the time averaged spatial distribution of the magnitude of the surface velocity calculated using total 88 consecutive frames and setting frame gap with 2 the velocity reaches a maximum near the center of the stream and decreases from the center to both sides which is in agreement with the principle of river velocity distribution fig 9 a shows the field of magnitude of velocity calculated using the l 1 diffusion method which is compared with the results from rousseau 2019 both methods yield close results concerning velocity magnitude and spatial distribution which verifies that the l 1 diffusion method has the ability to extracting velocity from uav images without post processing procedure 3 3 results of man made channel image sequence the surface velocity is easier to evaluate in an ortho view image sequence because the motion in the world can be recovered from the image plane by a scale factor however when it comes to monitoring tasks related to routine hydrology the limitations of the field conditions make it more difficult to directly capture images from an angle that is perpendicular to the water surface in addition the motion of the fluid in the perspective view is very different from that in the ortho view because the pixel in the region far away from camera represents larger length in the world to study the applicability of the photogrammetry based algorithm under different viewpoints and hydraulic conditions an experiment was conducted in a man made trapezoidal channel with a width of 60 m in henan china the image sequence was obtained using a digital camera with resolution 3840 2140 and frame rate of 25 hz 1 25 s the camera was installed on the right bank of the channel with a tilting angle of 10 towards the water surface the ship mounted adcp guided by a cable system that connects the left bank and right bank of the channel was used for velocity measurement across the section as shown in fig 6 a the results of the surface velocity estimated from different algorithms are compared with the corresponding adcp measurements theoretically the performance of the proposed l 1 diffusion algorithm should be compared with the free surface velocity however the velocity measured by the adcp has a nearest distance of 33 cm to the free surface with maximum channel depth of 7 96 m fig 10 a plots the streamwise velocity distribution measured by the adcp the blank space between the measured data and the trapezoidal boundary is the blind region where no data were available the results of calculation and experiment measurement are shown in fig 10 however the velocity magnitude computed from the l 1 diffusion algorithm is around 0 1 m s smaller than that from the adcp measurement this is probably due to the dip phenomenon where the location of the maximum velocity is below a certain distance from the free surface such dip phenomenon was observed in the previous research on secondary currents due to the anisotropic reynolds stress in the open rectangular channel obtained from numerical simulation shi et al 1999 sofialidis and prinos 1999 and experimental results nezu 1985 nezu and nakagawa 1984 tominaga et al 1989 for comparison the time averaged velocities calculated by the l 1 diffusion and stiv methods are examined with the free surface velocity recovered from the adcp measurement as a reference for removing the dip phenomenon the velocity profile was fitted with a parabolic distribution to recover the surface velocity as shown in fig 10 b g a comparison between the magnitude of streamwise velocity of the adcp and different algorithms along the streamwise direction is shown in fig 11 these photogrammetry based methods yield similar trends in the observation area the stiv method estimates a similar trend of velocity with the time averaged l 1 diffusion method using 98 consecutive frames with frame gap 2 except that it generally produces a larger streamwise velocity magnitude than that of the l 1 diffusion method at approximately 0 2 m s however both the methods reveal the principle that the surface velocity decreases from the midstream of the channel to both sides with respect to the surface velocity field the velocity computed in the perspective image can be recovered through the so called ortho rectification procedure the time averaged magnitude of the velocity field shown in fig 12 a has a blank region near the left bank this is because the motion far away from the terrestrial camera is represented by compressed pixels in the captured image fig 12 b shows the spatial velocity distribution of the man made channel calculated using the l 1 diffusion method the two dimensional velocity fields reveal that the diffusion effect is more evident in the near bank region compared to that in the middle of the channel 3 4 results of nature river sequence in this section the proposed l 1 diffusion method is further compared with earlier experimental data to examine its applicability and robustness under perspective conditions the experiment also studied by yagi et al 2020 in a natural river under different hydraulic conditions by jsce and icharm at the shinano river niigata prefecture japan is used as a comparison study for relatively higher velocity i e 3 4 m s the experiment data as well as the stiv computation results are acquired from hydro technology institute co ltd table 1 illustrates the necessary information of these experimental sites fig 13 shows the result of the instant velocity field obtained by the l 1 diffusion method clearly revealing the kinetic characteristics of the region of interest fig 13 a shows the pixel motion field estimated from two consecutive images with frame gap 2 where each location has a two dimensional motion vector estimated by minimizing the l 1 diffusion energy most areas in the image show the characteristics of convection but present a relatively complex flow pattern near the bank owing to the perspective effect the motion in the image plane is not proportional to the real metric in the world at each pixel position the procedure for recovering motion from the image plane to the world is described in the previous section fig 13 b shows the result of recovered streamwise velocity in world metric i e m s which transferred from pixel flow field in the image plane the velocity reaches its maximum at the center of the river bank and gradually decays to zero from the center to both banks fig 14 shows the velocity measured by the adcp which shows a different hydraulic characteristic of the velocity distribution in natural river with the man made the location of the maximum velocity is less affected by the secondary current in natural river than that in the man made channel situation most likely due to higher velocity and section geometry properties that result in small variations in the velocity near the surface the validation and comparison of stiv and the proposed l 1 diffusion method are shown in fig 15 where the two stiv computation results of hydro stiv watanabe et al 2021 and ku stiv fujita et al 2007 are provided by hydro technology institute co ltd in terms of magnitude the velocity estimated by the l 1 diffusion method is closer to the adcp measurement than that by the stiv method from the velocity spatial distribution the difference in the velocity estimated by different algorithms in the near bank region is smaller than the difference in the center region and a similar phenomenon of oscillation velocity estimated by stiv is observed in the computation result as in the previous channel experiment both methods yielded close results in the region near the center of the river the uncertainty of the l 1 diffusion method is increasing with the distance from the starting point in left bank to the right bank this is reasonable for the compressed pixels that are far away from the camera owing to the perspective effect nevertheless both methods can reveal general kinetic characteristics in a non intrusive way 3 5 discussions 1 velocity estimation in different scenarios generally the process of estimating the surface velocity of a river flow from an image can be divided into two steps image acquisition and motion estimation the first step is to capture the image sequence of the flow in the target area at a stable angle the second step is to calculate the motion vector in the corresponding image plane according to the captured image sequences the displacement in the real world can be obtained by projecting the motion vector in the image plane to the world coordinate system then the velocity can be calculated given the displacement and the time interval both uav and terrestrial cameras can be used for acquiring image sequences for acquiring images from uav the flow pattern is perpendicular to the camera which is the ideal case for calculating surface velocity the motion of the fluid is directly revealed by the change in the pixel intensity during the observation period interestingly image sequences under perspective view will compress the pixels in the far away region from the camera which increases the difficulty in estimating motion once the motion field in the image plane is estimated the velocity in the world can be directly obtained through a scale factor uavs generally shoot in a perpendicular direction on the water surface so uavs are the preferred option for emergencies where other measuring equipment are not available for routine monitoring a terrestrial camera can better fit the field conditions from the viewpoint of different algorithms to estimate the free surface the stiv and the variational method have their advantages and applicable scenarios for flow rate estimation time averaged streamwise velocity is preferred in practice because the flow rate can be efficiently computed by multiplying the time averaged streamwise velocity with the surface velocity coefficient and area of interest in this case the stiv method is preferred over the variational method on the other hand for instant velocity field estimation the optical flow method is a better option which can accurately and efficiently compute two dimensional velocity fields directly without post processing such as interpolation between pixels 2 spatial velocity distribution estimated from different algorithms from the results of the experiments conducted in man made channels and natural rivers it can be found that outliers and oscillation of velocity are much easier to observe in the stiv method compared to the velocity estimated from the l 1 diffusion method the possible reason is that the stiv method evaluates the velocity independently at each search line however the fluids governed by continuity and momentum equations have intrinsic spatial connections as a comparison with the stiv method the construction of the l 1 diffusion method is based on the scalar transportation equation and velocity gradient regularization the velocity field is computed on the basis of the minimization of functional energy which considers the physical properties of the fluid as well as the prior of velocity smoothness as observed through the results in both the man made channel and natural river the streamwise velocity estimated by the l 1 diffusion has a better spatial smoothness accuracy and less possibility of outliers than that by the stiv method considering the magnitude of velocity in the man made channel and nature river both conducted using a terrestrial camera the stiv method exhibits a higher velocity than that in the variational method one possible explanation for this phenomenon is the larger velocity coefficient that transferring the tangent value of texture angle in the spatial temporal image to world velocity i e m s more specifically the length of the search line was set to 15 m in the man made channel and nature river to form a spatial temporal image however a longer search line may lead to a larger velocity coefficient owing to uneven distortion as for the velocity estimated from the uav image sequence the l 1 diffusion method which is based on photogrammetry and the variational principle can efficiently and accurately recover the two dimensional flow fields from the image sequence and scale factor in this case the stiv method is no longer available because the construction of the spatial temporal image relies on the convection motion from a one dimensional search line 4 conclusion and perspective a method named l 1 diffusion method is proposed for estimating the surface flow field of a natural river from an image sequence in different scenarios in this paper the general variational formulation is derived based on the modified scalar transportation and continuity equations as the physical foundation for depicting the surface velocity field from the collected image sequences the l 1 norm is employed as the basis of the energy function in field monitoring for illumination error robustness the three in situ experiments conducted under different hydraulic conditions and shooting angles show that the proposed l 1 diffusion method accurately estimates the surface velocity in different scenarios furthermore a comparison between stiv and the proposed method is also discussed from the perspective of the inverse problem from a practical point of view the proposed method is preferable when an instant surface velocity field is required and the results from terrestrial and uav experiments show that preliminary studies on inferring the free surface velocity of rivers are helpful for future river management and flood prevention however more research on the selection of data term and regularization terms is required to improve accuracy and efficiency credit authorship contribution statement kailin huang methodology writing original draft software

3739,the ease of access to media resources and computational power has recently generated interest in using vision based approaches for hydraulic monitoring a key challenge for non intrusive image based hydrology measurement methods is incorporating different hydraulic variables as prior knowledge with image information we propose a photogrammetry based method called l 1 diffusion derived from the convection diffusion equation commonly used in hydrodynamics with an additional regularization term to estimate the fluid motion field in the image plane from which the free surface velocity can be further obtained using the photogrammetric projection relationship between the image plane and world coordinates the inverse problem is used to discuss the relationship between the widely used space time image velocimetry stiv and the proposed l 1 diffusion to validate the proposed method unmanned aerial vehicle uav images as well as in situ acoustic doppler current profiler adcp experiments were carried out based on comparison results with the adcp measurement and vision based flow field estimation the newly proposed l 1 diffusion algorithm can accurately and efficiently estimate the free surface velocity of a river from the image sequences in a variety of scenarios keywords optical flow variational method stiv free surface velocity 1 introduction extreme weather events and climate change have led to an increased likelihood of severe flooding around the world monitoring critical hydrological elements like flow velocity water level and flow charge is critical for risk management and water supplementation because of the complex hydraulic characteristics of rivers and the harsh wilderness a timely and accurate velocity measurement has always been a difficult proposition to serve as the basis of future flood prediction at present most conventional flow velocity measurements are performed in an intrusive time consuming and labor intensive manner a classic example of gauging free surface velocity is by measuring the time and distance for a manually released float between consecutive river sections however the collapse of dykes and banks caused by excessive flooding could endanger the operator during flood measurement based on the doppler principle the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp can more accurately measure the velocity distribution of the cross section which is the benchmark for the accurate comparison of various current measurement algorithms however it cannot be used in real time during flooding or when there is severe sediment disturbance problems with these intrusion based methods have compelled people to look for alternative methods for conducting velocity monitoring which are automatic secure reliable and non intrusive the radar equipment for example is one solution for this problem alimenti alimenti et al 2020 used the doppler radar sensor to river surface velocity and discharge estimation however with the development of computer vision and the available computational resources image based approaches for measuring free surface velocity have been the subject of extensive research concerning river velocity monitoring and may be another promising solutions for those challenging problems adrian 1991 firstly proposed the piv method which aya et al 1995 analyzed flood surface velocity by capturing features such as floating particles or free surface deformation caused by waves or ripples hauet et al 2008 and tracked them in consecutive frames by using correlation based techniques which named large scale particle image lspiv particle tracking velocimetry ptv patalano et al 2017 is another example of a correlation based algorithm that does not divide the region of interest into multiple subdomains but compares them to subsequence frames ptv is conducted by directly tracking the individual features between consecutive frames however it is less applicable when the density of the tracer is low and inhomogeneous and the majority of the fluid has no defined surface features to improve the accuracy a manually released tracer is required for correlation based methods which is trouble to in situ measurements for addressing the issue of lack of defined surface features fujita et al 2007 proposed the space time image velocimetry stiv method by stacking image pixels at a preset search line to infer the streamwise convection velocity stiv can estimate surface velocity without using additional tracers however it is ill posed in terms of the inverse problem in other words depending on the distribution of the line pattern in the space time image there may be many velocities to be chosen and only a one dimensional velocity can be obtained to address this issue the variational method as a classical method for solving inverse problem was used to infer the motion field from an image sequence in comparison to correlation based methods like ptv or lspiv the variational method can incorporate different assumptions based on prior knowledge of fluid dynamics and obtain a global solution without post processing on the other hand for the ill posed problem in stiv the variational methods convert the ill posed problem into a deterministic optimization problem based on regularization theory tikhonov 1963 recently khalid et al 2019 used the huber function and improved the brightness consistency assumption in field experiments and the results of the estimation were further compared with those of lspiv wildes et al 2000 wildes et al 1997 estimated fluid velocity from image sequences by solving the euler lagrange equation and compare their results with measurement data although the variational method has been successful in modeling problems of complex fluid motion estimation cassisa et al 2011 ruhnau et al 2007 zuo and qi 2017 relatively little research has been done on in situ free surface measurement the velocity obtained under different hydraulic and photography conditions on the contrary is extremely important for hydrological science and risk management decision making the goal of this research is to find an accurate and non intrusive photogrammetry based algorithm for estimating river surface velocity in the field to accomplish this the general energy functional form for a photogrammetry based fluid motion field estimation is developed given the illumination change that occurs during the field monitoring task the l 1 norm is chosen as the basis for the proposed energy function and a comparison between the stiv method and the variational method is performed finally three in situ experiments are carried out to validate the new algorithm 2 methodology 2 1 definition of problem the task of monitoring river velocimetry using a photogrammetry based method relies on a reasonable estimation of the image velocity over a given time period once the velocity vector in the image plane has been accurately estimated the velocity vector in the world coordinates can be calculated using the projection matrix to formulate a mathematical model used for depicting the fluid motion i x y t is denoted as the pixel intensity of an image sequence depicting the fluid motion where x y is the spatial coordinates of the image domain and t the time index the assumption of brightness constancy in the computer vision community states that the pixel intensity is a constant within a small range of time period δ t and spatial displacement δ x δ y 1 i x y t i x δ x y δ y t δ t using taylor expansion the assumption of brightness consistency can be written in a more compact form as eq 2 2 i t i t ω 0 eq 2 is valid for every point in the image domain with a pixel velocity field ω u v t d x d t d y d t t fig 1 shows the consecutive image records in a natural channel the motion of a fluid is much more complex than that of a rigid body as wave breaking or diffusion effects may result in a changeable pixel field in the fluid instead there is an alternative way of considering the assumption of brightness consistency by using the convection diffusion equation as in eq 3 which describes the transferred physical phenomena of scalar quantities due to the effects of diffusion and convection 3 c t d c ω c r where c d and ω represent the concentration diffusion coefficient and velocity field respectively the external source term is defined as r the laplacian operator and divergence operator are denoted by δ 2 x 2 2 y 2 and x y respectively in the case of an incompressible fluid the continuity equation can be expressed as eq 4 4 ω 0 the scalar transportation equation eq 5 for an incompressible fluid can be derived from the combination of eq 3 and eq 4 5 c t c t ω d δ c r previous studies cassisa et al 2011 corpetti et al 2006 zhou et al 2000 have demonstrated that it is reasonable to assume that c i where i denotes the pixel intensity the transportation equation of the incompressible fluid eq 5 can be transformed into a pixel based convection diffusion equation as shown in eq 6 when there is no external light source which means r 0 in eq 5 6 i t i t ω d δ i 0 a comparison between eq 2 and eq 6 indicates that the assumption of brightness consistency is the result of the pixel based transportation equation without considering the diffusion effects based on the regularization theory the problem of velocity estimation can be formulated as the minimization of the energy functional eq 7 in a deterministic way by utilizing the variational method the energy functional eq 7 is an integration over the image domain and consists of a data term and a regularization term the data term describes the pixel convection diffusion phenomenon with a scoring function φ with the prior assumption about the smoothness of flow field the regularization term is used to penalize the gradient of interesting velocity field from high variation by the regularization function ϕ so the problem of estimating pixel velocity field can be transformed to find the minimization function in eq 7 7 min ω e ω x φ i t i t ω d δ i 2 data term ϕ ω 2 regularization term d x 2 2 l 1 diffusion for surface velocity estimation the pixel intensity effected by external light source is the only information to estimate the pixel velocity field however as most hydrological monitoring tasks are conducted in natural conditions conditions of a stationary light source and local fluctuations are often worse than those in laboratory conditions which causes unavoidable illumination errors and low accurate velocity measurement to develop a robust nonintrusive photogrammetry method for surface velocity measurement the l 1 norm i e φ s 2 ϕ s 2 s 2 is selected as the basis for construction of energy functional in eq 7 because it is more robust with illumination errors and outliers as described in rez et al 2013 and zach et al 2007 the energy functional eq 7 to be minimized in this study has the form of eq 8 with λ being the parameter for adjusting the smoothness of final velocity field the λ is selected by empirical setting with smaller λ suggests smoother velocity field 8 e ω x λ i t i t ω d δ i ω d x the energy functional in eq 8 is still convex but not continuously differentiable owing to the l 1 operator one way for minimizing the functional energy shown in eq 8 is to use the modified differentiable l 1 norm as φ s 2 ϕ s 2 s 2 2 where the is a small positive constant based on the differentiable substitution the corresponding euler lagrange equations which are two coupled non linear partial differential equations could be derived and solved using the fix point iteration brox et al 2004 after experiments in different solving algorithms the approach proposed by zach et al 2007 is used for it s potential advantage in real time computation considering a small displacement case zach et al 2007 thought that the problem could be formulated as minimizing the convex approximation shown in eq 9 so the auxiliary variable v is introduced for approximation of ω the homogeneous diffusion effect is considered here by making i t i t d δ i to be in the standard local linearized form zach et al 2007 wedel et al 2009 rez et al 2013 and the current residual is denoted as ρ v i t i t v thus the process of estimating the fluid velocity field in the image plane is transformed to slove the optimization problem of eq 9 which generates two sub optimization problems based on the classical prime dual principle 9 e ω 1 2 θ ω v 2 λ ρ v d x where θ is a small constant for guarantee v is a valid approximation for ω herein the optimization procedures for eq 9 are briefly introduced zach et al 2007 1 with v fixed the equation eq 10 is firstly solved 10 min ω ω 1 2 θ ω v 2 d x the first problem has the form of a total variation denoising model of rudin osher fatemi rudin et al 1992 zach et al 2007 which can be solved efficiently and uniquely using a duality based algorithm chambolle 2004 11 ω v θ p to solve eq 11 the auxiliary variable p should fulfilled the equation eq 12 12 θ p v θ p v p eq 12 can be solved by a fixed point scheme iteration as described in eq 13 where τ stands for the time step in the iteration and should be satisfied the condition of τ 1 8 13 p k 1 p k τ div p k v θ 1 τ div p k v θ 2 then with ω fixed the equation eq 14 is to be solved 14 min v ω 1 2 θ ω v 2 λ ρ v d x the solution of eq 14 can be reached through the thresholding theorem in eq 15 15 v ω λ θ i if ρ ω λ θ i 2 λ θ i if ρ ω λ θ i 2 ρ ω i i t i if ρ ω λ θ i 2 it should be noted that these derivations are only valid for small displacements while for other cases they do not behave well due to the previous taylor expansion assumption the problem of large displacement estimation can be tackled by using the multiresolution coarse to fine image pyramid together with the warping strategy heitz et al 2008 brox et al 2004 meinhardt llopis and s a nchez 2012 fig 2 shows the producers of image pyramid by using multi resolution strategy images of interest are down sampled at each pyramid to find larger flow vectors the flow field from the coarser pyramid level is propagated to the finer pyramid level as a good initialization approximation for a finer solution this recursive procedure of propagation is finished until finest level of pyramid reached and warping is helpful for not restricted to a local minima and can produce a better estimation for true displacement vectors at each level as a demonstration fig 3 shows the dense pixel flow field derived from consecutive images based on the the proposed algorithm which reveals the direction and magnitude of flow velocity in the image plane at each pixel position and provides a direct idea of the kinetic characteristics of the channel however due to the perspective effect the flow field in the image is not equal to the flow field in the real world e g m s based on the photogrammetry principle how the flow field in the real physical world could be derived from the pixel flow field will be introduced in detail in section 3 1 the implementation of proposed algorithm were based on the open source library scikit image van der walt et al 2014 and opencv bradski 2000 2 3 proposed l 1 diffusion algorithm relation with stiv method briefly the stiv proposed by fujita et al 2007 is a novel algorithm applied in hydrology for free surface monitoring which is widely used in japan compared to the correlation based lspiv method stiv has the advantage of not requiring a manually released tracer the basic idea of stiv is to observe the angle in the so named spatial temporal image which represents the convection velocity along the direction of the search line fig 4 shows the basic procedure for the spatial temporal image generation based on the assumption that the pixel moves at a constant speed v the orientation angle θ of the spatial temporal image is related to the convection velocity along the streamwise direction by stacking the pixel of the interested search line along the time t the velocity can be calculated using eq 16 where α is the velocity coefficient transferring the pixel velocity to world velocity corresponding to external factors such as spatial resolution and frame rate 16 v α tan θ the key to stiv is to determine an accurate angle θ which has recently been improved for resulting in more accurate and efficient measurements under deteriorated scenarios by using frequency analysis fujita et al 2018 and auto correlation fujita et al 2019 inferring the motion field from observations i e image sequences is a standard inverse problem the inverse problem can be used to interpret the relationship between stiv and the variational method considering the convection equation in the one dimensional case in eq 17 17 c t u c x 0 using the same assumption that c i as in the variational method eq 17 can be formulated as eq 18 18 i t u i x 0 it is clear that the solution to the characteristic line in eq 18 has the form x u t c which implies an unchanged pixel status along the characteristic direction as shown in fig 5 which is the basic assumption of stiv based on the above discussion it can be found that on the assumption of c i both stiv and the variational method can infer the velocity by observing the change in pixel intensity between consecutive frames which is the output of the pixel transportation equation from the perspective of the inverse problem the angle in the spatial temporal image which is the output of the stiv method may exist many different values when it is interpreted as the characteristic line of the corresponding pixel transportation equation this is due to the fact that if the pixel moved exactly as described by the transportation equation there would be a unique characteristic line to the corresponding characteristic line however many solutions of the pixel convection diffusion equation may be generated when observing the line pattern in the spatial temporal image which is also known as an ill posed problem in contrast to the stiv method the variational method convert this ill posed problem into a deterministic optimization problem by including a regularization term in the energy functional resulting in an optimal and unique solution under the assumption of flow continuity and smoothness 3 results and discussion 3 1 data acquisition and geometry correction the proposed l 1 diffusion algorithm which contains the procedure of estimation of pixel velocity field and camera calibration is used in this section to estimate the free surface velocity field of various scenarios from the recorded image sequences two image acquisition approaches from a terrestrial camera and uav unmanned aerial vehicle were considered for the analysis the image acquired from a terrestrial camera is much more challenging to analyze than an uav image sequence because the perspective effect leads to an uneven spatial resolution at different locations for recovering motion in the image plane to world coordinates the relationship between the image plane and world coordinates must be established such a relationship can be described using a projection model of intrinsic extrinsic and scale factors in photogrammetry as shown in eq 19 where u v is the image coordinate in the image plane x y z represents the world coordinate and s represents the scale factor the intrinsic parameters denote the parameters related only to the camera itself which can be described using optical lenses sensors etc the extrinsic parameters relative to the reference frame are determined by the rotation matrix r i j and translator vector t 19 s u v 1 1 d x 0 c x 0 1 d y c y 0 0 1 f 0 1 0 f 1 0 0 1 intrinsic parameters r 11 r 12 r 13 t 1 r 21 r 22 r 23 t 2 r 31 r 32 r 33 t 3 extrinsic parameters x y z 1 in practice the projection model shown in eq 19 is usually rewritten as the direct linear transform equations for clarity as shown in eq 20 to determine the coefficients of l i at least six ground control points gcps are required for 11 unknown variables with each gcp contributing two equations to the linear system 20 u l 1 x l 2 y l 3 z l 4 l 9 x l 10 y l 11 z 1 v l 5 x l 6 y l 7 z l 8 l 9 x l 10 y l 11 z 1 in the following experiments concerning terrestrial cameras the coefficients of l i are obtained through a least squares approach by solving the linear equations composed of pixel coordinates and world coordinates of gcps as shown in eq 21 fig 6 b shows the in situ layout of the gcps deployed to make eq 21 be an over determined system which can increase the stability and robustness of the solution and prevent outliers from affecting the overall accuracy of the solution 21 x 1 y 1

total station while the corresponding image coordinates can be obtained through a manual observation of the image the linear system composed of gcps is further solved to obtain the coefficients of l i finally with the calculated l i and current water levels the world coordinates of each gcp can be recalculated and compared with the world coordinates registered using the total station the results of the comparison are regarded the re projection error as a metric for the calibration accuracy 3 2 results of uav image sequence the use of uavs to estimate free surface velocity is a convenient and effective measurement method particularly when geological disasters caused by flash floods result in conventional measurement equipment disable such as adcp to illustrate the procedure for estimating the two dimensional free surface velocity a video depicting the upstream of the zinal gauging station from a height of 30 m was used from rousseau 2019 the frame rate time step of the video is 25 hz 1 25 s with resolution 1920 1080 fig 8 a shows the region of interest and its water surface appears opaque because of the sediments carried by the flow which provides a good foundation for photogrammetry based computation by enhancing the contrast of the image fig 8 b shows the results of the instant velocity field estimated from two consecutive images based on the l 1 diffusion method the kinetic characteristics of floods in mountain streams are clearly depicted through the flow field especially for regions where the vortex was affected by topographical reasons this trend of the flow field is similar to the result presented by rousseau 2019 fig 9 a shows the computation results of the time averaged spatial distribution of the magnitude of the surface velocity calculated using total 88 consecutive frames and setting frame gap with 2 the velocity reaches a maximum near the center of the stream and decreases from the center to both sides which is in agreement with the principle of river velocity distribution fig 9 a shows the field of magnitude of velocity calculated using the l 1 diffusion method which is compared with the results from rousseau 2019 both methods yield close results concerning velocity magnitude and spatial distribution which verifies that the l 1 diffusion method has the ability to extracting velocity from uav images without post processing procedure 3 3 results of man made channel image sequence the surface velocity is easier to evaluate in an ortho view image sequence because the motion in the world can be recovered from the image plane by a scale factor however when it comes to monitoring tasks related to routine hydrology the limitations of the field conditions make it more difficult to directly capture images from an angle that is perpendicular to the water surface in addition the motion of the fluid in the perspective view is very different from that in the ortho view because the pixel in the region far away from camera represents larger length in the world to study the applicability of the photogrammetry based algorithm under different viewpoints and hydraulic conditions an experiment was conducted in a man made trapezoidal channel with a width of 60 m in henan china the image sequence was obtained using a digital camera with resolution 3840 2140 and frame rate of 25 hz 1 25 s the camera was installed on the right bank of the channel with a tilting angle of 10 towards the water surface the ship mounted adcp guided by a cable system that connects the left bank and right bank of the channel was used for velocity measurement across the section as shown in fig 6 a the results of the surface velocity estimated from different algorithms are compared with the corresponding adcp measurements theoretically the performance of the proposed l 1 diffusion algorithm should be compared with the free surface velocity however the velocity measured by the adcp has a nearest distance of 33 cm to the free surface with maximum channel depth of 7 96 m fig 10 a plots the streamwise velocity distribution measured by the adcp the blank space between the measured data and the trapezoidal boundary is the blind region where no data were available the results of calculation and experiment measurement are shown in fig 10 however the velocity magnitude computed from the l 1 diffusion algorithm is around 0 1 m s smaller than that from the adcp measurement this is probably due to the dip phenomenon where the location of the maximum velocity is below a certain distance from the free surface such dip phenomenon was observed in the previous research on secondary currents due to the anisotropic reynolds stress in the open rectangular channel obtained from numerical simulation shi et al 1999 sofialidis and prinos 1999 and experimental results nezu 1985 nezu and nakagawa 1984 tominaga et al 1989 for comparison the time averaged velocities calculated by the l 1 diffusion and stiv methods are examined with the free surface velocity recovered from the adcp measurement as a reference for removing the dip phenomenon the velocity profile was fitted with a parabolic distribution to recover the surface velocity as shown in fig 10 b g a comparison between the magnitude of streamwise velocity of the adcp and different algorithms along the streamwise direction is shown in fig 11 these photogrammetry based methods yield similar trends in the observation area the stiv method estimates a similar trend of velocity with the time averaged l 1 diffusion method using 98 consecutive frames with frame gap 2 except that it generally produces a larger streamwise velocity magnitude than that of the l 1 diffusion method at approximately 0 2 m s however both the methods reveal the principle that the surface velocity decreases from the midstream of the channel to both sides with respect to the surface velocity field the velocity computed in the perspective image can be recovered through the so called ortho rectification procedure the time averaged magnitude of the velocity field shown in fig 12 a has a blank region near the left bank this is because the motion far away from the terrestrial camera is represented by compressed pixels in the captured image fig 12 b shows the spatial velocity distribution of the man made channel calculated using the l 1 diffusion method the two dimensional velocity fields reveal that the diffusion effect is more evident in the near bank region compared to that in the middle of the channel 3 4 results of nature river sequence in this section the proposed l 1 diffusion method is further compared with earlier experimental data to examine its applicability and robustness under perspective conditions the experiment also studied by yagi et al 2020 in a natural river under different hydraulic conditions by jsce and icharm at the shinano river niigata prefecture japan is used as a comparison study for relatively higher velocity i e 3 4 m s the experiment data as well as the stiv computation results are acquired from hydro technology institute co ltd table 1 illustrates the necessary information of these experimental sites fig 13 shows the result of the instant velocity field obtained by the l 1 diffusion method clearly revealing the kinetic characteristics of the region of interest fig 13 a shows the pixel motion field estimated from two consecutive images with frame gap 2 where each location has a two dimensional motion vector estimated by minimizing the l 1 diffusion energy most areas in the image show the characteristics of convection but present a relatively complex flow pattern near the bank owing to the perspective effect the motion in the image plane is not proportional to the real metric in the world at each pixel position the procedure for recovering motion from the image plane to the world is described in the previous section fig 13 b shows the result of recovered streamwise velocity in world metric i e m s which transferred from pixel flow field in the image plane the velocity reaches its maximum at the center of the river bank and gradually decays to zero from the center to both banks fig 14 shows the velocity measured by the adcp which shows a different hydraulic characteristic of the velocity distribution in natural river with the man made the location of the maximum velocity is less affected by the secondary current in natural river than that in the man made channel situation most likely due to higher velocity and section geometry properties that result in small variations in the velocity near the surface the validation and comparison of stiv and the proposed l 1 diffusion method are shown in fig 15 where the two stiv computation results of hydro stiv watanabe et al 2021 and ku stiv fujita et al 2007 are provided by hydro technology institute co ltd in terms of magnitude the velocity estimated by the l 1 diffusion method is closer to the adcp measurement than that by the stiv method from the velocity spatial distribution the difference in the velocity estimated by different algorithms in the near bank region is smaller than the difference in the center region and a similar phenomenon of oscillation velocity estimated by stiv is observed in the computation result as in the previous channel experiment both methods yielded close results in the region near the center of the river the uncertainty of the l 1 diffusion method is increasing with the distance from the starting point in left bank to the right bank this is reasonable for the compressed pixels that are far away from the camera owing to the perspective effect nevertheless both methods can reveal general kinetic characteristics in a non intrusive way 3 5 discussions 1 velocity estimation in different scenarios generally the process of estimating the surface velocity of a river flow from an image can be divided into two steps image acquisition and motion estimation the first step is to capture the image sequence of the flow in the target area at a stable angle the second step is to calculate the motion vector in the corresponding image plane according to the captured image sequences the displacement in the real world can be obtained by projecting the motion vector in the image plane to the world coordinate system then the velocity can be calculated given the displacement and the time interval both uav and terrestrial cameras can be used for acquiring image sequences for acquiring images from uav the flow pattern is perpendicular to the camera which is the ideal case for calculating surface velocity the motion of the fluid is directly revealed by the change in the pixel intensity during the observation period interestingly image sequences under perspective view will compress the pixels in the far away region from the camera which increases the difficulty in estimating motion once the motion field in the image plane is estimated the velocity in the world can be directly obtained through a scale factor uavs generally shoot in a perpendicular direction on the water surface so uavs are the preferred option for emergencies where other measuring equipment are not available for routine monitoring a terrestrial camera can better fit the field conditions from the viewpoint of different algorithms to estimate the free surface the stiv and the variational method have their advantages and applicable scenarios for flow rate estimation time averaged streamwise velocity is preferred in practice because the flow rate can be efficiently computed by multiplying the time averaged streamwise velocity with the surface velocity coefficient and area of interest in this case the stiv method is preferred over the variational method on the other hand for instant velocity field estimation the optical flow method is a better option which can accurately and efficiently compute two dimensional velocity fields directly without post processing such as interpolation between pixels 2 spatial velocity distribution estimated from different algorithms from the results of the experiments conducted in man made channels and natural rivers it can be found that outliers and oscillation of velocity are much easier to observe in the stiv method compared to the velocity estimated from the l 1 diffusion method the possible reason is that the stiv method evaluates the velocity independently at each search line however the fluids governed by continuity and momentum equations have intrinsic spatial connections as a comparison with the stiv method the construction of the l 1 diffusion method is based on the scalar transportation equation and velocity gradient regularization the velocity field is computed on the basis of the minimization of functional energy which considers the physical properties of the fluid as well as the prior of velocity smoothness as observed through the results in both the man made channel and natural river the streamwise velocity estimated by the l 1 diffusion has a better spatial smoothness accuracy and less possibility of outliers than that by the stiv method considering the magnitude of velocity in the man made channel and nature river both conducted using a terrestrial camera the stiv method exhibits a higher velocity than that in the variational method one possible explanation for this phenomenon is the larger velocity coefficient that transferring the tangent value of texture angle in the spatial temporal image to world velocity i e m s more specifically the length of the search line was set to 15 m in the man made channel and nature river to form a spatial temporal image however a longer search line may lead to a larger velocity coefficient owing to uneven distortion as for the velocity estimated from the uav image sequence the l 1 diffusion method which is based on photogrammetry and the variational principle can efficiently and accurately recover the two dimensional flow fields from the image sequence and scale factor in this case the stiv method is no longer available because the construction of the spatial temporal image relies on the convection motion from a one dimensional search line 4 conclusion and perspective a method named l 1 diffusion method is proposed for estimating the surface flow field of a natural river from an image sequence in different scenarios in this paper the general variational formulation is derived based on the modified scalar transportation and continuity equations as the physical foundation for depicting the surface velocity field from the collected image sequences the l 1 norm is employed as the basis of the energy function in field monitoring for illumination error robustness the three in situ experiments conducted under different hydraulic conditions and shooting angles show that the proposed l 1 diffusion method accurately estimates the surface velocity in different scenarios furthermore a comparison between stiv and the proposed method is also discussed from the perspective of the inverse problem from a practical point of view the proposed method is preferable when an instant surface velocity field is required and the results from terrestrial and uav experiments show that preliminary studies on inferring the free surface velocity of rivers are helpful for future river management and flood prevention however more research on the selection of data term and regularization terms is required to improve accuracy and efficiency credit authorship contribution statement kailin huang methodology writing original draft software
