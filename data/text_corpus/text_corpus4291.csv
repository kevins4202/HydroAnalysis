21455,structural integrity monitoring of jacket structures is an attractive challenge faced by researchers worldwide because of numerous uncertainties in marine environments using statistical methods to reduce the detrimental impacts of uncertainties on model updating and damage detection results are unavoidable in this study a new bayesian model updating framework is proposed using incomplete frequency response function frf data in this methodology the incomplete measurements issue is not dealt with the model reduction or data expansion method and the number of data in the objective function is increased using frf at different excitation frequencies the experimental verification of a scale 2d fixed platform is implemented to reveal the validity of the proposed methodology several numerical damage scenarios are simulated to investigate the effect of noisy data fe model uncertainties incomplete measurement and added mass in the damage detection procedure according to the results the introduced method is entirely successful in the model updating and damage detection of the jacket platform the results also indicate the lower effects of uncertainties and noise levels in damage detection outcomes keywords offshore jacket platform bayesian model updating damage detection frequency response function optimization 1 introduction fixed platforms are the most common types of offshore structures which might be damaged during their service life because of corrosion fatigue vessel impact earthquake and severe storms not only these structures are constantly exposed to hydrodynamic forces by waves and currents but also the platforms members are exposed to damages due to harsh environment wang 2013 lotfollahi yaghin et al 2011 therefore the integrity monitoring of these structures seems to be inevitable structural health monitoring shm is one of the effective methods to increase the operational lifetime and improve the safety of structures the basic idea of these approaches is the use of the changes in structural dynamic parameters such as the mode shape and natural frequency due to damage in structural elements shm methods commonly are classified into four levels doebling et al 1998 rytter 1993 determining the presence of damage in the structure level 1 damage localization level 2 quantification of the damage severity level 3 and prediction of the remaining service life of the structure level 4 however each level requires the occurrence of previous levels on the other hand the shm methods can be classified into probabilistic and deterministic categories the deterministic methods can not quantify the uncertainty of damage detection and model updating results while the effect of noise and uncertainties on the accuracy of damage identification results can be quantified in the probabilistic methods in recent decades several shm techniques have been offered for damage localization level 2 of offshore platforms kim and stubbs 1995 elshafey and haddaramarzouk 2010 asgarian et al 2009 also several researchers presented methods for detecting the severity and location of damage level 3 in offshore structures hwang and kim 2004 li et al 2008 wang 2013 yi 2016 mojtahedi and hosseinlou 2016 li et al 2016 hosseinlou et al 2017 liu et al 2018 mojtahedi et al 2019 most of which are based on deterministic methods therefore hence using the probabilistic methods can be more efficient to reduce the detrimental impacts of uncertainties on damage detection results a new statistical bayesian framework is proposed for the damage identification and model updating of a jacket type platform in this study in which both damage severity and related standard of deviation are computed beck and katafygiotis 1998 proposed the bayesian framework for model updating of a numerical 2d shear frame using mode shape data they considered the mathematical modeling uncertainties and noise in modal data this approach has been used for model updating modal identification and damage detection in the literature vanik et al 2000 katafygiotis and yuen 2001 yuen et al 2002 ching and beck 2004 lam et al 2004 yuen et al 2006 presented a bayesian framework for solving eigenvalue equations using the incomplete noisy modal data they solved the optimization problem utilizing a new iterative method jiang and mahadevan 2008 combined the bayesian approach and the discrete wavelet packet transform for damage localization they have mentioned that the damage localization by this method is more accurate than the deterministic discrete wavelet packet transforms huang et al 2012 offered a new bayesian framework employing incomplete noisy modal data they considered the damage index method dim to detect damage severity employing mode shapes in the simple beam element numerically behmanesh and moaveni 2015 presented the hierarchical bayesian model updating for the damage detection of a shear frame they investigated the effects of the modeling errors incomplete modal data error function correlations and the number of data sets on the damage detection results huang and beck 2015 proposed hierarchical sparse bayesian learning for shm using the incomplete modal data they applied this method for a ten story shear building and a three dimensional braced frame model numerically yin et al 2017 combined the statistical bayesian method and the improved dynamic model reduction for identifying both location and severity of the damage in the 2d frame numerically and experimentally huang et al 2017 applied the hierarchical bayesian for detecting stiffness reductions in the structural elements using modal data song et al 2019 used the hierarchical bayesian model updating approach to calibrate the model parameters and predict the modeling error of a ten story building the optimization problem should be solved for finding optimal values of damage severity in all statistical bayesian damage detection methods the accuracy of the solution depends on the number and accuracy of the data in the objective function in this regard two methods are used to increase the number of data in the literature i increasing the number of tests and ii using the higher modes of the structures these suggestions are infeasible and costly in real structural systems for this reason frf data are proposed to be used in different excitation frequencies to increase the number and accuracy of data in this regard parametric frf h ω θ is defined by using the parametric mode shape φ i θ and measured natural frequency for the first time in this manuscript in the bayesian framework the computational cost to calculate h ω θ is also decreased considering the proposed methodology moreover the full data measurement in the real problem is impossible due to some financial and practical limitations such as access to all parts of the structures and rotational modes measurement problems the incomplete measurement problem was also solved in the literature employing model reduction or data expansion methods two general model reduction or data expansion methods were used to solve the incomplete measurement problem in the literature a expansion reduction method which is based on stiffness and mass matrix guyan 1965 flodén et al 2014 dos santos et al 2005 yin et al 2017 and b expansion reduction method which is based on modal data o callahan 1989 hu et al 2007 wang 2013 hosseinlou et al 2017 ghannadi and kourehli 2019 using the model reduction or data expansion methods may cause some error in the model updating schemes because of using the stiffness matrix of the intact structure in this study a new statistical bayesian framework using incomplete noisy data is proposed for model updating and damage detection of an offshore fixed platform for this purpose frf data which is low in several frequency ranges is utilized to decrease the detrimental effects of noise and uncertainties in this methodology the number of data in the objective function is increased using frf at different excitation frequencies and the incomplete measurements issue is not dealt with the model reduction or data expansion method furthermore the bayesian approach is employed for the first time for damage identification of a marine structure in this paper the presented technique is validated by utilizing a comprehensive set of numerical case studies of a 3d fixed platform and experimental verification of a laboratory 2d jacket platform the effect of noise in measured data uncertainties of the fe model and the added mass on the damage detection are also investigated in the several numerical damage scenarios by considering added mass the results indicated that the proposed method is highly accurate for the damage detection of the fixed offshore platforms however based on the results the accuracy of the proposed damage detection framework decreases as the number of measured dofs is reduced according to the results the presented damage detection method is also efficient under high level noisy data 2 bayesian probabilistic framework 2 1 bayesian probabilistic theory statistical bayesian model updating and damage detection methods have attracted significant interest in recent years for structural health monitoring using measured dynamic response this group of methods provide strong facilities to explicitly treat uncertainties entering the finite element models and measured data of the system statistical bayesian method is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more data becomes available in this framework the optimal values most probable of the model parameters and their associated uncertainties can be quantified also the adverse effects of finite element uncertainties and measurement errors on the results of the parameter estimation is decrease by using the statistical bayesian method in this study a new probabilistic bayesian method is presented for model updating and damage detection of the structure utilizing incomplete error contaminated frf data the conditional probabilities in the statistical bayesian frameworks are interpreted as measures of the plausibility of certain statements given other statements the bayesian theory is used to express the updated probabilities of the model parameters θ given some measured data bayes 1763 1 p θ d m p d θ m p θ m p d m where p θ d m is the posterior distribution of the model parameters given the measured data d and the assumed model class m p d m p d θ m p θ m d θ is a normalizing constant p d θ m is the likelihood function that represents the distribution of the experimental data given the parameters θ and p θ m is the initial prior probability density function pdf of the parameters prior distribution reflects any priori information that one might have about the damage severity in the structural elements before obtaining data however no available information is assumed in this study therefore predicting the damage severity should not depend on the prior distribution beaurepaire et al 2017 hence in the present study a non informative uniform distribution is considered for the prior pdf 2 2 the bayesian formulation in frf framework because the frf matrix is symmetric only the upper or lower triangular matrix should be used for the model updating and damage detection in order to use the frf data in bayesian equations this matrix should be vectorized by converting the matrix into a column vector h ω 2 h ω h 1 1 h 2 1 h n m 1 h i i h i 1 i h n m i h n m n m t where n m is the number of measured degree of freedoms dofs and h i j is corresponding frf entries in the ith row and jth column hence the size of vector h ω is n m 1 n m 2 since the frf data is accessible in the wide frequency range for both numerical and experimental models n ω sets of the frf vector data can be selected for solving the optimization problem 3 d h ω 1 h ω 2 h ω n where d is frf vector in the different selected frequencies and ω n is the nth selected frequency it should be noted that usually the number of the excitation locations are less than number of the measured dofs in the model updating and damage detection process therefore the size of the measured frf matrix is not n m n m to equalize the dimensions of the measured and finite element frf vectors the characters equivalent to unexcited locations in the finite element frf vectors should be removed the relation between parametric frf matrix h θ and the corresponding measured output h ˆ ω can be formulated as follows 4 h ˆ ω h ω θ e h where h ˆ ω and h ω θ are measured and parametric frf vector respectively and e h is a random error term jaynes suggested gaussian distribution with zero mean and covariance matrix σ for random error distribution based on the maximum entropy principle jaynes 2003 covariance matrix σ is obtained by computing the sample covariance matrix of frf data on selected frequencies 5 σ 1 n ω 1 ω 1 n ω h ˆ ω h h ˆ ω h t where h is the mean of the measured frf vector in the selected frequencies h ˆ ω likelihood distribution can be expressed as follow 6 p h ˆ ω θ m c 1 e x p 1 2 h ˆ ω h ω θ t σ 1 h ˆ ω h ω θ where c 1 is the normalized constant since n ω data set of the frf vector are independent likelihood function for whole data set d can be formulated as 7 p d θ m ω 1 n ω p h ˆ ω θ m c 2 exp 1 2 ω 1 n ω h ˆ ω h ω θ t σ 1 h ˆ ω h ω θ where c 2 is the normalized constant furthermore the prior distribution of θ are simulated by the non informative uniform distribution between 1 and 0 2 the numbers 1 and 0 2 corresponds to complete destruction of elements and an increase in the stiffness of the member by 20 due to wrong assumption of the initial parameters finite element uncertainties etc 8 p θ m 1 1 2 1 θ 0 2 0 o t h e r w i s e the posterior distribution can be computed as follows 9 p θ d m c 2 e x p 1 2 ω 1 n ω h ˆ ω h ω θ t σ 1 h ˆ ω h ω θ therefore posterior distribution can be well approximated by a gaussian distribution with mean θ and covariance matrix σ θ the optimal value for θ parameter vector can be approximated by maximizing posterior distribution p θ d m or minimizing the objective function j θ l n p θ d m equivalently the covariance matrix σ θ is equal to the inverse of the hessian of the function j θ in the optimal values θ beck and katafygiotis 1998 10 j θ ln exp 1 2 ω 1 n ω h ˆ ω h ω θ t σ 1 h ˆ ω h ω θ 1 2 ω 1 n ω h ˆ ω h ω θ t σ 1 h ˆ ω h ω θ since the constant coefficients have no effect on solving optimization problems the coefficient c 2 is removed from the equations the objective function j θ can be minimized as an optimization problem using the built in function fminsearch in matlab lagarias et al 1998 used the nelder mead simplex algorithm to minimized a scalar function of all variables in this regard optimal variables are determined based on a direct search method that does not use numerical or analytic derivative the performance and efficiency of this method depend on the initial estimation of unknown parameters θ the parametric frf vector h θ is the lower triangular matrix parametric frf h ω θ the parametric frf is defined as follow 11 h ω θ k θ k n m θ m n ω 2 i ω c θ c n 1 12 k θ k n k 0 n 1 n θ θ k n k n where k θ k n m θ m n and c θ c n are parametric stiffness mass and damping matrices respectively k 0 m 0 and c 0 are fe model stiffness mass and damping matrices k n m n and c n are n th fe model stiffness mass and damping matrices θ k n θ m n and θ c n are the changes in the stiffness mass and damping matrices due to the damages and n θ is the number of the structural elements since the civil structures such as fixed platforms are heavy structures the damages in these structures do not have a significant effect on the mass matrix hence to determine the location and severity of the damage it is assumed that the structural mass stays unchanged as the damage occurs 13 m θ m n m 0 14 c θ c n c 0 calculation of the parametric frf using eq 11 is sophisticated and time consuming therefore this equation can be written as follows 15 h ω θ i 1 n φ i t θ φ i θ ω i d 2 ω 2 2 j ξ i d ω i d ω where φ i θ is i th parametric mode shape ω i d i th measured natural frequency ω is the selected frequency and ξ i d is i th the measured damping coefficient esfandiari et al 2009 suggested that h ˆ ω can be approximated using the fe mode shapes φ i the measured natural frequencies of the damaged structure ω i d and the measured damping loss factor ξ i d as follows 16 h ω θ i 1 n m φ i t θ φ i θ ω i d 2 ω 2 2 j ξ i d ω i d ω i n m 1 n φ i t φ i ω i 2 ω 2 2 j ξ i ω i ω where nm is the number of measured natural frequencies n is the number of dofs and ω i and φ i are the i th natural frequency and mode shape in the fe model the parametric mode shape φ i θ can be written as follows 17 φ i θ φ i δ φ i θ where δ φ i θ corresponds to the difference between parametric and fe mode shape farshadi and esfandiarivahedi 2017 proposed a new equation to define δ φ i θ as follows 18 δ φ i θ δ φ i a k 0 1 δ k θ φ i k 1 n a i k φ k 19 δ φ i a δ λ i k 0 1 m 0 φ i 20 a i k ω i 2 ω k 2 φ i t k θ k n θ k n φ k ω i 2 ω k 2 i k 0 i k where δ λ i is the measured change of the i th natural frequency terms δ k θ is the stiffness matrix changes due to the damage and terms k θ k n θ k n are derivative of stiffness and mass matrix versus its variations since in this study it is assumed that the mass does not change when damage occurs m θ m n θ m n and δ m θ are considered as zero the iterative method is presented to reduce the effect of the initial estimation on the predicted unknown parameters the proposed iterative method procedure for predicting the most probable values of stiffness parameters can be summarized as follows 1 calculate the parametric frf vector by combining eqs 16 and 18 2 compute the objective function j θ 3 solve the optimization problem to find the initial optimal values θ i o p t by assuming zero values for initial estimations of unknown parameters in the fminsearch optimization 4 compute a new stiffness matrix using eq 11 and new modal data by solving the eigenvalue equation 5 repeat steps 1 2 and 3 with initial estimation equal to θ i 1 o p t 6 iterate step 3 until the changes of stiffness scaling parameters decrease to the considered tolerance 7 compute the optimal values for all the unknown stiffness parameters θ o p t the bayesian model updating and damage detection is summarized in fig 1 in the presented model updating procedure the incomplete measurements issue is not deal with the model reduction or data expansion method in this regard the unmeasured degree of freedom on parametric frf matrix h ω θ is removed 2 3 selecting frequency ranges choosing an appropriate frequency range plays a key role in the damage detection procedure the best frequency ranges for the model updating and damage detection process have two important features 1 the frf data in this ranges have high sensitivity to the changes of structural parameters 2 the effect of noise on the damage detection results is low in this region see fig 2 since the frf data is accessible in the wide frequency range for both numerical and experimental models the optimal frequency ranges can be chosen in each damage scenario case for this purpose the sample frf graph for an intact and damaged structure is investigated in fig 2 the regions a b c and d are shown in fig 2 a also the effect of damping on frf data is investigated in fig 2 b it should be noted that since the frf data for the different damage scenarios are not the same the selected frequency range varies in different damage cases as shown in fig 2 a since the differences between the frf values of the intact and damaged structure in region a are significant the frf data in this region are sensitive to the damages and also the effect of the noise in this region is less than other areas therefore the frf data in region a is a suitable selection for model updating and damage detection process the differences between intact and the damaged structure frf values are minimal in the region c therefore the noise effects in this area are significant and specifying the frf data of this area is not suitable for the model updating and damage detection in the regions b and d the dynamic behavior of both intact and damaged models depend on the damping properties because a reliable model to simulate the damping parameter is not available it is suggested do not select the frf data of these regions for the damage identification the following process is suggested to select the appropriate frequency range in different damage scenarios 1 plotting the frf graph of the intact and damaged structure 2 selecting the frequency ranges corresponding to region a in fig 2 for the damage detection and model updating process 2 4 selecting the excitation location selecting the excitation location is crucial in success of the model updating and damage detection frameworks by frf data in this study the excitation points are chosen based on the norms of the summation of each frf column matrix in selected excitations frequency ranges sfrfi using eq 21 therefore the higher the value sfrf i the better the corresponding location of the i th dofs to select excitation point 21 s f r f i ω 1 n ω j 1 n h j i ω 2 however due to practical limitations only emerged translational dofs in x and y directions can be selected as excitation points 3 numerical case study a numerical model of a real 3d platform is used to investigate the effects of the uncertainties and incomplete measurements on the damage detection results this model is chosen from the recent damage detection study by liu et al 2018 the damage detection results are validated based on the chosen offshore platform the numerical model consists of 36 pipe elements and 16 nodes each with 6 degrees of freedom 72 dofs the platform model and the dimension of the elements are presented in fig 3 the modulus of elasticity e poisson s ratio ν mass density ρ are taken as 210 gpa 0 3 and 7850 kg m3 respectively all the outer and inner diameter of the tube elements are chosen as 17 8 cm and 16 02 cm respectively the finite element fe model is simulated in matlab for computing modal parameters the measurement errors are applied by adding random errors in simulated data in this study the errors are simulated based on liu et al 2018 as follow 22 ω ˆ i ω i 0 1 ε x ω i 23 h ˆ ω i j h ω i j 0 1 γ x hωij 24 e ˆ k e k 0 1 σ x ek 25 ρ ˆ k ρ k 0 1 σ x ρk where superscript 0 indicates the initial parameter values no noise parameters k represents the element number and terms x ω i x hωij x ek and x ρk are a random numbers with zero mean value and standard of deviation of 1 parameters ε γ and σ represent the level of noise in the modal measurements frf measurements and uncertainties of fe model respectively the simulated damage scenarios in the numerical jacket platform model are listed in table 1 the values of ε 0 003 σ 0 03 and γ 10 are considered based on liu et al 2018 for a1 and b1 scenarios the translational dofs x z directions related to all nodes are only measured whereas for a2 and b2 scenarios the translational dofs x z directions related to nodes 2 3 9 8 4 and 10 see fig 3 are measured the selected frequency ranges for the damage detection by frf data are shown in table 2 these values are selected based on section 2 3 in this regard the graph of the intact and damaged structure is plotted and frequency ranges corresponding to region a in fig 2 are selected for damage detection and model updating process four excitation locations are selected above the water level at nodes 6 and 3 in the z direction and 11 once in x and once in z directions the broad literature review so far the frf data has not been used to model updating and damage detection of the fixed platforms liu et al 2018 combined the mode shapes and natural frequencies to compute the modal flexibility matrix for damage detection of the fixed platform they solved an optimization problem in the damage detection process the accuracy of the optimization solution depends on the number and accuracy of the data in the objective function the number of data is limited in model updating and damage detection framework based on the shape mode and natural frequency information the addressed problem can be solved using the frf for the damage detection therefore in this study authors compared the result of damage detection of the fixed platform using the presented method and modal data moreover it should be noted that both frf and shape mode data can be extracted from the same vibration test and shape mode and natural frequency data are usually obtained by processing the frf data in this study the accuracy of predicted damaged values in comparison to the actual damaged values is calculated by comparing the mean sizing error mse and root mean square error rmse between the actual and predicted damage parameters eqs 26 and 27 mse criteria shows the average value of the absolute discrepancies between the actual damage ratio θ k n a and the predicted damage ratio θ k n p dos santos et al 2005 26 m s e i 1 n l θ k n a i 1 θ k n p i 1 n l also the results are compared by rmse criteria which is defined as root mean square error between the actual and the predicted damage parameters wu et al 2002 as follows 27 r m s e i 1 n l θ k n a i 1 θ k n p i 1 2 n l where n l is the number of fixed platform elements θ k n a i 1 and θ k n p i 1 are actual and predicted damage ratio is damage ratio corresponding nth element of structure the damage detection results are shown in fig 4 a b c and d the mse and rmse values for all damage scenarios are listed in table 3 the value of error criteria mse and rmse for the present method is smaller than the liu et al 2018 in all damage scenarios which indicates the accuracy of the proposed damage detection framework as the number of measured dofs is reduced the accuracy of the method is also decreased however the method is still accurate for damage detection even by the lower number of measured dofs as mentioned in section 2 2 the covariance matrix σ θ is equal to the inverse of the hessian of the function j θ in the optimal values θ it should be noted that in this study hessian matrix is computed by matlab software using finite difference method the coefficient of variation cov of the predicted damage severity values is exhibited for all scenarios in fig 5 a and b also the predicted damage ratios for each structure elements have normal distribution by mean θ and covariance σ θ the marginal cumulative distribution of the identified damage ratio of the element 1 θ 1 is shown in fig 6 as seen in this figure the uncertainties associated parameter θ 1 in the scenarios a2 and b2 are larger than other scenarios therefore the effect of uncertainties increases by reducing the number of measurement points 3 1 effects of added mass and noise on the damage detection 3 1 1 the added mass effect the added mass concept arises from the tendency of a submerged body moving with acceleration relative to the surrounding fluid to induce accelerations to the fluid patel 2013 the weight of elements in water increases due to the interaction of fluid and structure this added mass per unit length m a can be expressed as follow 28 m a ρ w c m 1 a where a c m and ρ w are the area of structural members the inertia coefficient chosen as 2 2 based on rp2a wsd and api 2007 and seawater density is taken as1024 kg m3 respectively the added mass matrix of each underwater structural element can be computed as follows 29 m a i ρ w c m 1 a l 420 140 0 00 156 0 00 0 00 156 s y m e t r y 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 22 l 0 00 22 l 0 00 140 j a 0 00 4 l 2 0 00 0 00 4 l 2 70 0 0 00 0 00 0 00 54 0 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 54 0 0 00 0 00 13 l 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 13 l 0 00 0 00 70 j a 0 00 13 l 0 00 3 l 2 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 22 l 140 0 00 156 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 156 0 00 140 j a 0 00 0 00 4 l 2 0 00 0 00 0 00 4 l 2 where l is the length of i th element j is the polar moment of inertia of i th element the added mass matrix for each underwater element is computed using eq 29 then the computed added mass matrices are summed by its elements mass matrix and finally the total mass matrix can be gained in this study in other to consider the effect of uncertainties in the added mass modeling the mass modeling error is simulated by adding random noise to the mass matrix 3 1 2 the noise effect one of the most advantages of the bayesian model updating and damage detection framework is reducing the effect of uncertainties on the accuracy of the damage detection results in this section the effect of noisy data and fe model uncertainties in damage detection are investigated two damage scenarios are simulated to investigate the effect of the noise and uncertainties on the damage detection results these scenarios are shown in table 4 the noise level in the measured data and fe model uncertainties for each scenario are presented in table 5 levels 1 to 4 represent no noise low level noise medium level noise and high level noise conditions respectively noise level 4 is usually associated with severe noise conditions which was occurred rarely in real structural response by considering the advances in sensors technology over the last decade however even in this noise level the damage detection results by this method are suitable and the location and severity of the damages are accurately identified it should be noted that selecting the appropriate frequency ranges greatly affects the accuracy of the results if unsuitable frequency ranges are selected the uncertainties and noise effects can seriously deviate the damage detection results in these damage scenarios it is assumed that the height of the water level is 18 3 m the first three natural frequencies decrease by 7 10 and 8 percent respectively due to considering the added mass effect the effects of noisy data on the accuracy of damage detection results are illustrated in fig 7 also the mse and rmse values for all scenarios are listed in table 6 the approximate equation for parametric mode shape φ i θ and incomplete measurement data causes errors in the damage detection results therefore the mse and rmse of level 1 are not zero in table 6 however the errors are acceptable in the damage detection process and the presented method can identify the damages severe and location by suitable accuracy according to table 6 the error values mse and rmse in damage detection results are low in all noise levels therefore the proposed bayesian damage identification framework is acceptable in all scenarios and the effect of noise is insignificant in the detection process 4 experimental verifications 4 1 introduction to the laboratory frame in this manuscript the experimental verification of a steel platform model is used to show the efficiency of the proposed method this platform is recently designed and installed in the persian gulf due to limitations of the laboratory facilities and pipes availability the geometric scale is employed as 1 65 the experimental scaled jacket type platform is shown in fig 8 this model consists of 31 pipe elements and 17 nodes the platform base is fixed into a rigid steel base plate this structure contains columns beams and braces the columns are continuous at the beam column joints and the beams and diagonal braces are welded to the linked beam column joints the geometric dimensions and element types of the platform are listed in table 7 the young s modulus e density ρ and poisson s ratio ν of all elements are taken as 207 g p a 7850 k g m 3 and 0 3 respectively fifteen uni axial accelerometers are attached to the beam column joints of the model to measure translational displacements in x and y directions the structure is excited by an electro dynamic exciter type 4809 with a force sensor ac20 aptech to record structure response driven by a power amplifier model 2706 all made by bruel kjaer company the accelerometers and the exciter of the experiment are shown in fig 9 the white noise signal fig 10 is used to excite the platform model the frf data is used in all damage detection and model updating method the frf data versus frequencies are illustrated in fig 11 to compute the frf matrix the excitation location is at node no 2 in fig 8 as input and 15 uni axial accelerometers at all nodes as the output as the mass of submerged bracing members and legs of a platform increases by 1 5 and 6 times respectively the natural frequencies of the first mode can be reduced only by 8 percent shahrivar 1999 37 this concept confirms that the first three natural frequencies can be reduced by 7 10 and 8 percent respectively due to the effect of added mass hence the effect of wet conditions only causes the natural frequencies of the structures to decrease and on the other hand causes the normalized displacement to increase in both undamaged and damaged cases for this reason in this study the experimental test is performed in dry conditions the frequency range and frequency sampling of the experiment are chosen as 0 800 hz and 16 385 khz respectively these values are determined based on the initial fe modal analysis in this study all tests are carried out at a laboratory temperature of 20 so the influence of temperature variation on the modal parameter estimation is negligible the first tests are implemented on the undamaged structure and the tests are repeated for the damaged structure by removing the bracing members of the model more details on this vibration test are presented in hosseinlou et al 2017 one of the most important challenges in model updating and damage detection methods by frf data in practice is extracting the structural response using the artificial or ambient such as wave current wind excitation technique measuring ambient forces is awkward or impossible in practical cases furthermore the ambient forces not only cannot excite the higher mode of a jacket platform but also are not sufficient for extracting the required vibration data mangal et al 2001 in this regard the excitation of the offshore platform is performed by employing a massive shaker as an external exciter which is attached to a desired node of the platform 4 2 model updating of the numerical model after extracting the dynamic characteristics of the intact structure some discrepancies can be observed between the numerical and the experimental results due to various uncertainties in the finite element model in this case since the intact and fe models do not include the same dynamics characteristics the presence of discrepancy can cause significant errors and false alarms in the damage detection process which requires the fe model updating based on the extracted experimental data however model updating is vital to reduce mathematical modeling errors also the effect of mass matrix changes is significant at high frequency in this study only low frequency ranges are considered within the proposed model updating and damage detection method therefore it is assumed that the mass is simulated with high accuracy and just stiffness matrices of the fe model requires to be updated with the experimental data see sec 2 2 more information about the modeling of the stiffness and mass matrices are presented in marwala 2010 the fe model which consists of 17 nodes and 31 elements and the model dimensions are presented in fig 12 three first experimental and initial numerical mode shapes are compared in fig 13 the mean of the initial numerical mod shapes is mode shape before model updating the selected frequency ranges and the updated natural frequencies are listed in table 8 these values are selected based on section 2 3 in this regard the graph of the intact and damaged structure is plotted and frequency ranges corresponding to region a in fig 2 are selected for damage detection and model updating process the results of the updating the first four finite element natural frequencies are shown in table 9 as shown in this table the error percentage indicates the difference between the updated and experimental natural frequencies the results demonstrate that the presented bayesian model updating framework has a good accuracy to update the structural modal parameters to ensure that the measured and numerical mode shapes are matched well the modal assurance criterion mac is computed the mac parameter determines the correlation coefficient between the fe mode shape φ i and measured mode shape φ j ˆ as follows 30 m a c φ i φ j ˆ φ i φ j ˆ 2 φ i t φ i φ j ˆ t φ j ˆ closer values to one show higher fitness between the two modes and the values near zero indicate uncorrelated modes the mac values between the updated fe model and experimental mode shapes are shown in fig 14 based on fig 14 the values are greater than 0 98 and the updated numerical mode shapes and the experimental modes are well matched 4 3 damage detection of the physical platform model in this section three different experimental damage scenarios are defined to validate the presented bayesian model updating and damage detection framework generally the damage can be simulated using two different methods in the vibration tests in the first method the metal spacer mounted on the middle part of the diagonal brace is removed and in the second method the structural members are replaced with other materials such as aluminum copper brass simulation of the damage scenarios is performed using the first method the definition of damage scenarios in the physical platform model is presented in fig 15 the first three natural frequencies of the experimental steel platform for all damage scenarios and are shown in table 10 the selected excitation frequency ranges for the damage identification are listed in table 11 these values are selected based on section 2 3 in this regard the graph of the intact and damaged structure should be plotted and frequencies corresponding to region a at fig 2 are selected to damage detection and model updating process to find the optimal excitation locations in the damage detection process sfrfi for each node are computed using eq 21 the results of computing sfrfi for all nodes in x direction are shown in table 12 the excitation locations are at nodes no 1 3 and 7 in fig 8 as input locations it should be noted that the nodes 11 12 13 14 and 15 can not be the excitation location due to laboratory limitation also the measured locations are at nods 1 4 6 7 10 12 13 and 14 as the output location for considering the effect of the incomplete measurement all rotational all translational dofs in the z direction and translational dofs in the x direction in nods no 2 3 5 8 9 11 15 and 16 are considered as unmeasured data the damage detection results for all experimental damage scenarios are shown in fig 16 according to the results the proposed method is completely successful in detecting the location and severity of the damage the mse and rmse values for experimental damage scenarios are listed in table 13 since the brace elements are removed to simulate the experimental damage scenarios in addition to the stiffness matrices the total mass matrix is also changed the effects of this mass reduction are considered in the finite element model as mentioned in section 2 2 the covariance matrix σ θ is equal to the inverse of the hessian of the function j θ in the optimal values θ it should be noted that in this study the hessian matrix is computed by matlab software using the finite difference method the covariance of the predicted damage severity values of all elements are shown in fig 17 since the values of the covariance are low the effect of the noise and uncertainties is low in the damage detection process and predicted damage ratio values are valid furthermore the marginal cumulative distribution of the predicted damage ratio for element no 1 θ1 is shown in fig 18 based on fig 18 the uncertainties related to parameter θ1 in scenarios c and b are the highest and the lowest respectively 5 conclusion in this manuscript a new bayesian model updating and damage detection framework using the incomplete noisy frf data is proposed for the first time for damage identification of a marine structure in this methodology the number of data in the objective function is increased using frf at different excitation frequencies and the incomplete measurements issue is not dealt with the model reduction or data expansion method the time consuming to compute the parametric frf matrix is minimized in the presented bayesian model updating and damage detection framework the experimental tests are performed on a scaled jacket platform to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methodology excitation frequency ranges are chosen in a way that the effect of noise and uncertainties on the frf data becomes insignificant selecting the appropriate frequency ranges greatly affects the accuracy of the results if unsuitable frequency ranges are selected the uncertainties and noise effects can seriously deviate the damage detection results moreover several numerical damage scenarios are defined to assess the capability of the incomplete noisy data on the accuracy of the proposed method results the results indicated the proposed method is more accurate than previously introduced methods in the literature for the damage detection of a fixed offshore platform based on the results the accuracy of the proposed damage detection framework decreases as the number of measured dofs is reduced the presented damage detection method is also efficient under high level noisy data the effect of noise in measured data uncertainties of the fe model and the added mass on the damage detection results are also investigated in several numerical damage scenarios by considering water added mass the results indicated that the proposed method is highly accurate for the damage detection of the fixed offshore platforms credit authorship contribution statement amin fathi conceptualization methodology writing

21455,structural integrity monitoring of jacket structures is an attractive challenge faced by researchers worldwide because of numerous uncertainties in marine environments using statistical methods to reduce the detrimental impacts of uncertainties on model updating and damage detection results are unavoidable in this study a new bayesian model updating framework is proposed using incomplete frequency response function frf data in this methodology the incomplete measurements issue is not dealt with the model reduction or data expansion method and the number of data in the objective function is increased using frf at different excitation frequencies the experimental verification of a scale 2d fixed platform is implemented to reveal the validity of the proposed methodology several numerical damage scenarios are simulated to investigate the effect of noisy data fe model uncertainties incomplete measurement and added mass in the damage detection procedure according to the results the introduced method is entirely successful in the model updating and damage detection of the jacket platform the results also indicate the lower effects of uncertainties and noise levels in damage detection outcomes keywords offshore jacket platform bayesian model updating damage detection frequency response function optimization 1 introduction fixed platforms are the most common types of offshore structures which might be damaged during their service life because of corrosion fatigue vessel impact earthquake and severe storms not only these structures are constantly exposed to hydrodynamic forces by waves and currents but also the platforms members are exposed to damages due to harsh environment wang 2013 lotfollahi yaghin et al 2011 therefore the integrity monitoring of these structures seems to be inevitable structural health monitoring shm is one of the effective methods to increase the operational lifetime and improve the safety of structures the basic idea of these approaches is the use of the changes in structural dynamic parameters such as the mode shape and natural frequency due to damage in structural elements shm methods commonly are classified into four levels doebling et al 1998 rytter 1993 determining the presence of damage in the structure level 1 damage localization level 2 quantification of the damage severity level 3 and prediction of the remaining service life of the structure level 4 however each level requires the occurrence of previous levels on the other hand the shm methods can be classified into probabilistic and deterministic categories the deterministic methods can not quantify the uncertainty of damage detection and model updating results while the effect of noise and uncertainties on the accuracy of damage identification results can be quantified in the probabilistic methods in recent decades several shm techniques have been offered for damage localization level 2 of offshore platforms kim and stubbs 1995 elshafey and haddaramarzouk 2010 asgarian et al 2009 also several researchers presented methods for detecting the severity and location of damage level 3 in offshore structures hwang and kim 2004 li et al 2008 wang 2013 yi 2016 mojtahedi and hosseinlou 2016 li et al 2016 hosseinlou et al 2017 liu et al 2018 mojtahedi et al 2019 most of which are based on deterministic methods therefore hence using the probabilistic methods can be more efficient to reduce the detrimental impacts of uncertainties on damage detection results a new statistical bayesian framework is proposed for the damage identification and model updating of a jacket type platform in this study in which both damage severity and related standard of deviation are computed beck and katafygiotis 1998 proposed the bayesian framework for model updating of a numerical 2d shear frame using mode shape data they considered the mathematical modeling uncertainties and noise in modal data this approach has been used for model updating modal identification and damage detection in the literature vanik et al 2000 katafygiotis and yuen 2001 yuen et al 2002 ching and beck 2004 lam et al 2004 yuen et al 2006 presented a bayesian framework for solving eigenvalue equations using the incomplete noisy modal data they solved the optimization problem utilizing a new iterative method jiang and mahadevan 2008 combined the bayesian approach and the discrete wavelet packet transform for damage localization they have mentioned that the damage localization by this method is more accurate than the deterministic discrete wavelet packet transforms huang et al 2012 offered a new bayesian framework employing incomplete noisy modal data they considered the damage index method dim to detect damage severity employing mode shapes in the simple beam element numerically behmanesh and moaveni 2015 presented the hierarchical bayesian model updating for the damage detection of a shear frame they investigated the effects of the modeling errors incomplete modal data error function correlations and the number of data sets on the damage detection results huang and beck 2015 proposed hierarchical sparse bayesian learning for shm using the incomplete modal data they applied this method for a ten story shear building and a three dimensional braced frame model numerically yin et al 2017 combined the statistical bayesian method and the improved dynamic model reduction for identifying both location and severity of the damage in the 2d frame numerically and experimentally huang et al 2017 applied the hierarchical bayesian for detecting stiffness reductions in the structural elements using modal data song et al 2019 used the hierarchical bayesian model updating approach to calibrate the model parameters and predict the modeling error of a ten story building the optimization problem should be solved for finding optimal values of damage severity in all statistical bayesian damage detection methods the accuracy of the solution depends on the number and accuracy of the data in the objective function in this regard two methods are used to increase the number of data in the literature i increasing the number of tests and ii using the higher modes of the structures these suggestions are infeasible and costly in real structural systems for this reason frf data are proposed to be used in different excitation frequencies to increase the number and accuracy of data in this regard parametric frf h ω θ is defined by using the parametric mode shape φ i θ and measured natural frequency for the first time in this manuscript in the bayesian framework the computational cost to calculate h ω θ is also decreased considering the proposed methodology moreover the full data measurement in the real problem is impossible due to some financial and practical limitations such as access to all parts of the structures and rotational modes measurement problems the incomplete measurement problem was also solved in the literature employing model reduction or data expansion methods two general model reduction or data expansion methods were used to solve the incomplete measurement problem in the literature a expansion reduction method which is based on stiffness and mass matrix guyan 1965 flodén et al 2014 dos santos et al 2005 yin et al 2017 and b expansion reduction method which is based on modal data o callahan 1989 hu et al 2007 wang 2013 hosseinlou et al 2017 ghannadi and kourehli 2019 using the model reduction or data expansion methods may cause some error in the model updating schemes because of using the stiffness matrix of the intact structure in this study a new statistical bayesian framework using incomplete noisy data is proposed for model updating and damage detection of an offshore fixed platform for this purpose frf data which is low in several frequency ranges is utilized to decrease the detrimental effects of noise and uncertainties in this methodology the number of data in the objective function is increased using frf at different excitation frequencies and the incomplete measurements issue is not dealt with the model reduction or data expansion method furthermore the bayesian approach is employed for the first time for damage identification of a marine structure in this paper the presented technique is validated by utilizing a comprehensive set of numerical case studies of a 3d fixed platform and experimental verification of a laboratory 2d jacket platform the effect of noise in measured data uncertainties of the fe model and the added mass on the damage detection are also investigated in the several numerical damage scenarios by considering added mass the results indicated that the proposed method is highly accurate for the damage detection of the fixed offshore platforms however based on the results the accuracy of the proposed damage detection framework decreases as the number of measured dofs is reduced according to the results the presented damage detection method is also efficient under high level noisy data 2 bayesian probabilistic framework 2 1 bayesian probabilistic theory statistical bayesian model updating and damage detection methods have attracted significant interest in recent years for structural health monitoring using measured dynamic response this group of methods provide strong facilities to explicitly treat uncertainties entering the finite element models and measured data of the system statistical bayesian method is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more data becomes available in this framework the optimal values most probable of the model parameters and their associated uncertainties can be quantified also the adverse effects of finite element uncertainties and measurement errors on the results of the parameter estimation is decrease by using the statistical bayesian method in this study a new probabilistic bayesian method is presented for model updating and damage detection of the structure utilizing incomplete error contaminated frf data the conditional probabilities in the statistical bayesian frameworks are interpreted as measures of the plausibility of certain statements given other statements the bayesian theory is used to express the updated probabilities of the model parameters θ given some measured data bayes 1763 1 p θ d m p d θ m p θ m p d m where p θ d m is the posterior distribution of the model parameters given the measured data d and the assumed model class m p d m p d θ m p θ m d θ is a normalizing constant p d θ m is the likelihood function that represents the distribution of the experimental data given the parameters θ and p θ m is the initial prior probability density function pdf of the parameters prior distribution reflects any priori information that one might have about the damage severity in the structural elements before obtaining data however no available information is assumed in this study therefore predicting the damage severity should not depend on the prior distribution beaurepaire et al 2017 hence in the present study a non informative uniform distribution is considered for the prior pdf 2 2 the bayesian formulation in frf framework because the frf matrix is symmetric only the upper or lower triangular matrix should be used for the model updating and damage detection in order to use the frf data in bayesian equations this matrix should be vectorized by converting the matrix into a column vector h ω 2 h ω h 1 1 h 2 1 h n m 1 h i i h i 1 i h n m i h n m n m t where n m is the number of measured degree of freedoms dofs and h i j is corresponding frf entries in the ith row and jth column hence the size of vector h ω is n m 1 n m 2 since the frf data is accessible in the wide frequency range for both numerical and experimental models n ω sets of the frf vector data can be selected for solving the optimization problem 3 d h ω 1 h ω 2 h ω n where d is frf vector in the different selected frequencies and ω n is the nth selected frequency it should be noted that usually the number of the excitation locations are less than number of the measured dofs in the model updating and damage detection process therefore the size of the measured frf matrix is not n m n m to equalize the dimensions of the measured and finite element frf vectors the characters equivalent to unexcited locations in the finite element frf vectors should be removed the relation between parametric frf matrix h θ and the corresponding measured output h ˆ ω can be formulated as follows 4 h ˆ ω h ω θ e h where h ˆ ω and h ω θ are measured and parametric frf vector respectively and e h is a random error term jaynes suggested gaussian distribution with zero mean and covariance matrix σ for random error distribution based on the maximum entropy principle jaynes 2003 covariance matrix σ is obtained by computing the sample covariance matrix of frf data on selected frequencies 5 σ 1 n ω 1 ω 1 n ω h ˆ ω h h ˆ ω h t where h is the mean of the measured frf vector in the selected frequencies h ˆ ω likelihood distribution can be expressed as follow 6 p h ˆ ω θ m c 1 e x p 1 2 h ˆ ω h ω θ t σ 1 h ˆ ω h ω θ where c 1 is the normalized constant since n ω data set of the frf vector are independent likelihood function for whole data set d can be formulated as 7 p d θ m ω 1 n ω p h ˆ ω θ m c 2 exp 1 2 ω 1 n ω h ˆ ω h ω θ t σ 1 h ˆ ω h ω θ where c 2 is the normalized constant furthermore the prior distribution of θ are simulated by the non informative uniform distribution between 1 and 0 2 the numbers 1 and 0 2 corresponds to complete destruction of elements and an increase in the stiffness of the member by 20 due to wrong assumption of the initial parameters finite element uncertainties etc 8 p θ m 1 1 2 1 θ 0 2 0 o t h e r w i s e the posterior distribution can be computed as follows 9 p θ d m c 2 e x p 1 2 ω 1 n ω h ˆ ω h ω θ t σ 1 h ˆ ω h ω θ therefore posterior distribution can be well approximated by a gaussian distribution with mean θ and covariance matrix σ θ the optimal value for θ parameter vector can be approximated by maximizing posterior distribution p θ d m or minimizing the objective function j θ l n p θ d m equivalently the covariance matrix σ θ is equal to the inverse of the hessian of the function j θ in the optimal values θ beck and katafygiotis 1998 10 j θ ln exp 1 2 ω 1 n ω h ˆ ω h ω θ t σ 1 h ˆ ω h ω θ 1 2 ω 1 n ω h ˆ ω h ω θ t σ 1 h ˆ ω h ω θ since the constant coefficients have no effect on solving optimization problems the coefficient c 2 is removed from the equations the objective function j θ can be minimized as an optimization problem using the built in function fminsearch in matlab lagarias et al 1998 used the nelder mead simplex algorithm to minimized a scalar function of all variables in this regard optimal variables are determined based on a direct search method that does not use numerical or analytic derivative the performance and efficiency of this method depend on the initial estimation of unknown parameters θ the parametric frf vector h θ is the lower triangular matrix parametric frf h ω θ the parametric frf is defined as follow 11 h ω θ k θ k n m θ m n ω 2 i ω c θ c n 1 12 k θ k n k 0 n 1 n θ θ k n k n where k θ k n m θ m n and c θ c n are parametric stiffness mass and damping matrices respectively k 0 m 0 and c 0 are fe model stiffness mass and damping matrices k n m n and c n are n th fe model stiffness mass and damping matrices θ k n θ m n and θ c n are the changes in the stiffness mass and damping matrices due to the damages and n θ is the number of the structural elements since the civil structures such as fixed platforms are heavy structures the damages in these structures do not have a significant effect on the mass matrix hence to determine the location and severity of the damage it is assumed that the structural mass stays unchanged as the damage occurs 13 m θ m n m 0 14 c θ c n c 0 calculation of the parametric frf using eq 11 is sophisticated and time consuming therefore this equation can be written as follows 15 h ω θ i 1 n φ i t θ φ i θ ω i d 2 ω 2 2 j ξ i d ω i d ω where φ i θ is i th parametric mode shape ω i d i th measured natural frequency ω is the selected frequency and ξ i d is i th the measured damping coefficient esfandiari et al 2009 suggested that h ˆ ω can be approximated using the fe mode shapes φ i the measured natural frequencies of the damaged structure ω i d and the measured damping loss factor ξ i d as follows 16 h ω θ i 1 n m φ i t θ φ i θ ω i d 2 ω 2 2 j ξ i d ω i d ω i n m 1 n φ i t φ i ω i 2 ω 2 2 j ξ i ω i ω where nm is the number of measured natural frequencies n is the number of dofs and ω i and φ i are the i th natural frequency and mode shape in the fe model the parametric mode shape φ i θ can be written as follows 17 φ i θ φ i δ φ i θ where δ φ i θ corresponds to the difference between parametric and fe mode shape farshadi and esfandiarivahedi 2017 proposed a new equation to define δ φ i θ as follows 18 δ φ i θ δ φ i a k 0 1 δ k θ φ i k 1 n a i k φ k 19 δ φ i a δ λ i k 0 1 m 0 φ i 20 a i k ω i 2 ω k 2 φ i t k θ k n θ k n φ k ω i 2 ω k 2 i k 0 i k where δ λ i is the measured change of the i th natural frequency terms δ k θ is the stiffness matrix changes due to the damage and terms k θ k n θ k n are derivative of stiffness and mass matrix versus its variations since in this study it is assumed that the mass does not change when damage occurs m θ m n θ m n and δ m θ are considered as zero the iterative method is presented to reduce the effect of the initial estimation on the predicted unknown parameters the proposed iterative method procedure for predicting the most probable values of stiffness parameters can be summarized as follows 1 calculate the parametric frf vector by combining eqs 16 and 18 2 compute the objective function j θ 3 solve the optimization problem to find the initial optimal values θ i o p t by assuming zero values for initial estimations of unknown parameters in the fminsearch optimization 4 compute a new stiffness matrix using eq 11 and new modal data by solving the eigenvalue equation 5 repeat steps 1 2 and 3 with initial estimation equal to θ i 1 o p t 6 iterate step 3 until the changes of stiffness scaling parameters decrease to the considered tolerance 7 compute the optimal values for all the unknown stiffness parameters θ o p t the bayesian model updating and damage detection is summarized in fig 1 in the presented model updating procedure the incomplete measurements issue is not deal with the model reduction or data expansion method in this regard the unmeasured degree of freedom on parametric frf matrix h ω θ is removed 2 3 selecting frequency ranges choosing an appropriate frequency range plays a key role in the damage detection procedure the best frequency ranges for the model updating and damage detection process have two important features 1 the frf data in this ranges have high sensitivity to the changes of structural parameters 2 the effect of noise on the damage detection results is low in this region see fig 2 since the frf data is accessible in the wide frequency range for both numerical and experimental models the optimal frequency ranges can be chosen in each damage scenario case for this purpose the sample frf graph for an intact and damaged structure is investigated in fig 2 the regions a b c and d are shown in fig 2 a also the effect of damping on frf data is investigated in fig 2 b it should be noted that since the frf data for the different damage scenarios are not the same the selected frequency range varies in different damage cases as shown in fig 2 a since the differences between the frf values of the intact and damaged structure in region a are significant the frf data in this region are sensitive to the damages and also the effect of the noise in this region is less than other areas therefore the frf data in region a is a suitable selection for model updating and damage detection process the differences between intact and the damaged structure frf values are minimal in the region c therefore the noise effects in this area are significant and specifying the frf data of this area is not suitable for the model updating and damage detection in the regions b and d the dynamic behavior of both intact and damaged models depend on the damping properties because a reliable model to simulate the damping parameter is not available it is suggested do not select the frf data of these regions for the damage identification the following process is suggested to select the appropriate frequency range in different damage scenarios 1 plotting the frf graph of the intact and damaged structure 2 selecting the frequency ranges corresponding to region a in fig 2 for the damage detection and model updating process 2 4 selecting the excitation location selecting the excitation location is crucial in success of the model updating and damage detection frameworks by frf data in this study the excitation points are chosen based on the norms of the summation of each frf column matrix in selected excitations frequency ranges sfrfi using eq 21 therefore the higher the value sfrf i the better the corresponding location of the i th dofs to select excitation point 21 s f r f i ω 1 n ω j 1 n h j i ω 2 however due to practical limitations only emerged translational dofs in x and y directions can be selected as excitation points 3 numerical case study a numerical model of a real 3d platform is used to investigate the effects of the uncertainties and incomplete measurements on the damage detection results this model is chosen from the recent damage detection study by liu et al 2018 the damage detection results are validated based on the chosen offshore platform the numerical model consists of 36 pipe elements and 16 nodes each with 6 degrees of freedom 72 dofs the platform model and the dimension of the elements are presented in fig 3 the modulus of elasticity e poisson s ratio ν mass density ρ are taken as 210 gpa 0 3 and 7850 kg m3 respectively all the outer and inner diameter of the tube elements are chosen as 17 8 cm and 16 02 cm respectively the finite element fe model is simulated in matlab for computing modal parameters the measurement errors are applied by adding random errors in simulated data in this study the errors are simulated based on liu et al 2018 as follow 22 ω ˆ i ω i 0 1 ε x ω i 23 h ˆ ω i j h ω i j 0 1 γ x hωij 24 e ˆ k e k 0 1 σ x ek 25 ρ ˆ k ρ k 0 1 σ x ρk where superscript 0 indicates the initial parameter values no noise parameters k represents the element number and terms x ω i x hωij x ek and x ρk are a random numbers with zero mean value and standard of deviation of 1 parameters ε γ and σ represent the level of noise in the modal measurements frf measurements and uncertainties of fe model respectively the simulated damage scenarios in the numerical jacket platform model are listed in table 1 the values of ε 0 003 σ 0 03 and γ 10 are considered based on liu et al 2018 for a1 and b1 scenarios the translational dofs x z directions related to all nodes are only measured whereas for a2 and b2 scenarios the translational dofs x z directions related to nodes 2 3 9 8 4 and 10 see fig 3 are measured the selected frequency ranges for the damage detection by frf data are shown in table 2 these values are selected based on section 2 3 in this regard the graph of the intact and damaged structure is plotted and frequency ranges corresponding to region a in fig 2 are selected for damage detection and model updating process four excitation locations are selected above the water level at nodes 6 and 3 in the z direction and 11 once in x and once in z directions the broad literature review so far the frf data has not been used to model updating and damage detection of the fixed platforms liu et al 2018 combined the mode shapes and natural frequencies to compute the modal flexibility matrix for damage detection of the fixed platform they solved an optimization problem in the damage detection process the accuracy of the optimization solution depends on the number and accuracy of the data in the objective function the number of data is limited in model updating and damage detection framework based on the shape mode and natural frequency information the addressed problem can be solved using the frf for the damage detection therefore in this study authors compared the result of damage detection of the fixed platform using the presented method and modal data moreover it should be noted that both frf and shape mode data can be extracted from the same vibration test and shape mode and natural frequency data are usually obtained by processing the frf data in this study the accuracy of predicted damaged values in comparison to the actual damaged values is calculated by comparing the mean sizing error mse and root mean square error rmse between the actual and predicted damage parameters eqs 26 and 27 mse criteria shows the average value of the absolute discrepancies between the actual damage ratio θ k n a and the predicted damage ratio θ k n p dos santos et al 2005 26 m s e i 1 n l θ k n a i 1 θ k n p i 1 n l also the results are compared by rmse criteria which is defined as root mean square error between the actual and the predicted damage parameters wu et al 2002 as follows 27 r m s e i 1 n l θ k n a i 1 θ k n p i 1 2 n l where n l is the number of fixed platform elements θ k n a i 1 and θ k n p i 1 are actual and predicted damage ratio is damage ratio corresponding nth element of structure the damage detection results are shown in fig 4 a b c and d the mse and rmse values for all damage scenarios are listed in table 3 the value of error criteria mse and rmse for the present method is smaller than the liu et al 2018 in all damage scenarios which indicates the accuracy of the proposed damage detection framework as the number of measured dofs is reduced the accuracy of the method is also decreased however the method is still accurate for damage detection even by the lower number of measured dofs as mentioned in section 2 2 the covariance matrix σ θ is equal to the inverse of the hessian of the function j θ in the optimal values θ it should be noted that in this study hessian matrix is computed by matlab software using finite difference method the coefficient of variation cov of the predicted damage severity values is exhibited for all scenarios in fig 5 a and b also the predicted damage ratios for each structure elements have normal distribution by mean θ and covariance σ θ the marginal cumulative distribution of the identified damage ratio of the element 1 θ 1 is shown in fig 6 as seen in this figure the uncertainties associated parameter θ 1 in the scenarios a2 and b2 are larger than other scenarios therefore the effect of uncertainties increases by reducing the number of measurement points 3 1 effects of added mass and noise on the damage detection 3 1 1 the added mass effect the added mass concept arises from the tendency of a submerged body moving with acceleration relative to the surrounding fluid to induce accelerations to the fluid patel 2013 the weight of elements in water increases due to the interaction of fluid and structure this added mass per unit length m a can be expressed as follow 28 m a ρ w c m 1 a where a c m and ρ w are the area of structural members the inertia coefficient chosen as 2 2 based on rp2a wsd and api 2007 and seawater density is taken as1024 kg m3 respectively the added mass matrix of each underwater structural element can be computed as follows 29 m a i ρ w c m 1 a l 420 140 0 00 156 0 00 0 00 156 s y m e t r y 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 22 l 0 00 22 l 0 00 140 j a 0 00 4 l 2 0 00 0 00 4 l 2 70 0 0 00 0 00 0 00 54 0 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 54 0 0 00 0 00 13 l 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00 0 00

i th element j is the polar moment of inertia of i th element the added mass matrix for each underwater element is computed using eq 29 then the computed added mass matrices are summed by its elements mass matrix and finally the total mass matrix can be gained in this study in other to consider the effect of uncertainties in the added mass modeling the mass modeling error is simulated by adding random noise to the mass matrix 3 1 2 the noise effect one of the most advantages of the bayesian model updating and damage detection framework is reducing the effect of uncertainties on the accuracy of the damage detection results in this section the effect of noisy data and fe model uncertainties in damage detection are investigated two damage scenarios are simulated to investigate the effect of the noise and uncertainties on the damage detection results these scenarios are shown in table 4 the noise level in the measured data and fe model uncertainties for each scenario are presented in table 5 levels 1 to 4 represent no noise low level noise medium level noise and high level noise conditions respectively noise level 4 is usually associated with severe noise conditions which was occurred rarely in real structural response by considering the advances in sensors technology over the last decade however even in this noise level the damage detection results by this method are suitable and the location and severity of the damages are accurately identified it should be noted that selecting the appropriate frequency ranges greatly affects the accuracy of the results if unsuitable frequency ranges are selected the uncertainties and noise effects can seriously deviate the damage detection results in these damage scenarios it is assumed that the height of the water level is 18 3 m the first three natural frequencies decrease by 7 10 and 8 percent respectively due to considering the added mass effect the effects of noisy data on the accuracy of damage detection results are illustrated in fig 7 also the mse and rmse values for all scenarios are listed in table 6 the approximate equation for parametric mode shape φ i θ and incomplete measurement data causes errors in the damage detection results therefore the mse and rmse of level 1 are not zero in table 6 however the errors are acceptable in the damage detection process and the presented method can identify the damages severe and location by suitable accuracy according to table 6 the error values mse and rmse in damage detection results are low in all noise levels therefore the proposed bayesian damage identification framework is acceptable in all scenarios and the effect of noise is insignificant in the detection process 4 experimental verifications 4 1 introduction to the laboratory frame in this manuscript the experimental verification of a steel platform model is used to show the efficiency of the proposed method this platform is recently designed and installed in the persian gulf due to limitations of the laboratory facilities and pipes availability the geometric scale is employed as 1 65 the experimental scaled jacket type platform is shown in fig 8 this model consists of 31 pipe elements and 17 nodes the platform base is fixed into a rigid steel base plate this structure contains columns beams and braces the columns are continuous at the beam column joints and the beams and diagonal braces are welded to the linked beam column joints the geometric dimensions and element types of the platform are listed in table 7 the young s modulus e density ρ and poisson s ratio ν of all elements are taken as 207 g p a 7850 k g m 3 and 0 3 respectively fifteen uni axial accelerometers are attached to the beam column joints of the model to measure translational displacements in x and y directions the structure is excited by an electro dynamic exciter type 4809 with a force sensor ac20 aptech to record structure response driven by a power amplifier model 2706 all made by bruel kjaer company the accelerometers and the exciter of the experiment are shown in fig 9 the white noise signal fig 10 is used to excite the platform model the frf data is used in all damage detection and model updating method the frf data versus frequencies are illustrated in fig 11 to compute the frf matrix the excitation location is at node no 2 in fig 8 as input and 15 uni axial accelerometers at all nodes as the output as the mass of submerged bracing members and legs of a platform increases by 1 5 and 6 times respectively the natural frequencies of the first mode can be reduced only by 8 percent shahrivar 1999 37 this concept confirms that the first three natural frequencies can be reduced by 7 10 and 8 percent respectively due to the effect of added mass hence the effect of wet conditions only causes the natural frequencies of the structures to decrease and on the other hand causes the normalized displacement to increase in both undamaged and damaged cases for this reason in this study the experimental test is performed in dry conditions the frequency range and frequency sampling of the experiment are chosen as 0 800 hz and 16 385 khz respectively these values are determined based on the initial fe modal analysis in this study all tests are carried out at a laboratory temperature of 20 so the influence of temperature variation on the modal parameter estimation is negligible the first tests are implemented on the undamaged structure and the tests are repeated for the damaged structure by removing the bracing members of the model more details on this vibration test are presented in hosseinlou et al 2017 one of the most important challenges in model updating and damage detection methods by frf data in practice is extracting the structural response using the artificial or ambient such as wave current wind excitation technique measuring ambient forces is awkward or impossible in practical cases furthermore the ambient forces not only cannot excite the higher mode of a jacket platform but also are not sufficient for extracting the required vibration data mangal et al 2001 in this regard the excitation of the offshore platform is performed by employing a massive shaker as an external exciter which is attached to a desired node of the platform 4 2 model updating of the numerical model after extracting the dynamic characteristics of the intact structure some discrepancies can be observed between the numerical and the experimental results due to various uncertainties in the finite element model in this case since the intact and fe models do not include the same dynamics characteristics the presence of discrepancy can cause significant errors and false alarms in the damage detection process which requires the fe model updating based on the extracted experimental data however model updating is vital to reduce mathematical modeling errors also the effect of mass matrix changes is significant at high frequency in this study only low frequency ranges are considered within the proposed model updating and damage detection method therefore it is assumed that the mass is simulated with high accuracy and just stiffness matrices of the fe model requires to be updated with the experimental data see sec 2 2 more information about the modeling of the stiffness and mass matrices are presented in marwala 2010 the fe model which consists of 17 nodes and 31 elements and the model dimensions are presented in fig 12 three first experimental and initial numerical mode shapes are compared in fig 13 the mean of the initial numerical mod shapes is mode shape before model updating the selected frequency ranges and the updated natural frequencies are listed in table 8 these values are selected based on section 2 3 in this regard the graph of the intact and damaged structure is plotted and frequency ranges corresponding to region a in fig 2 are selected for damage detection and model updating process the results of the updating the first four finite element natural frequencies are shown in table 9 as shown in this table the error percentage indicates the difference between the updated and experimental natural frequencies the results demonstrate that the presented bayesian model updating framework has a good accuracy to update the structural modal parameters to ensure that the measured and numerical mode shapes are matched well the modal assurance criterion mac is computed the mac parameter determines the correlation coefficient between the fe mode shape φ i and measured mode shape φ j ˆ as follows 30 m a c φ i φ j ˆ φ i φ j ˆ 2 φ i t φ i φ j ˆ t φ j ˆ closer values to one show higher fitness between the two modes and the values near zero indicate uncorrelated modes the mac values between the updated fe model and experimental mode shapes are shown in fig 14 based on fig 14 the values are greater than 0 98 and the updated numerical mode shapes and the experimental modes are well matched 4 3 damage detection of the physical platform model in this section three different experimental damage scenarios are defined to validate the presented bayesian model updating and damage detection framework generally the damage can be simulated using two different methods in the vibration tests in the first method the metal spacer mounted on the middle part of the diagonal brace is removed and in the second method the structural members are replaced with other materials such as aluminum copper brass simulation of the damage scenarios is performed using the first method the definition of damage scenarios in the physical platform model is presented in fig 15 the first three natural frequencies of the experimental steel platform for all damage scenarios and are shown in table 10 the selected excitation frequency ranges for the damage identification are listed in table 11 these values are selected based on section 2 3 in this regard the graph of the intact and damaged structure should be plotted and frequencies corresponding to region a at fig 2 are selected to damage detection and model updating process to find the optimal excitation locations in the damage detection process sfrfi for each node are computed using eq 21 the results of computing sfrfi for all nodes in x direction are shown in table 12 the excitation locations are at nodes no 1 3 and 7 in fig 8 as input locations it should be noted that the nodes 11 12 13 14 and 15 can not be the excitation location due to laboratory limitation also the measured locations are at nods 1 4 6 7 10 12 13 and 14 as the output location for considering the effect of the incomplete measurement all rotational all translational dofs in the z direction and translational dofs in the x direction in nods no 2 3 5 8 9 11 15 and 16 are considered as unmeasured data the damage detection results for all experimental damage scenarios are shown in fig 16 according to the results the proposed method is completely successful in detecting the location and severity of the damage the mse and rmse values for experimental damage scenarios are listed in table 13 since the brace elements are removed to simulate the experimental damage scenarios in addition to the stiffness matrices the total mass matrix is also changed the effects of this mass reduction are considered in the finite element model as mentioned in section 2 2 the covariance matrix σ θ is equal to the inverse of the hessian of the function j θ in the optimal values θ it should be noted that in this study the hessian matrix is computed by matlab software using the finite difference method the covariance of the predicted damage severity values of all elements are shown in fig 17 since the values of the covariance are low the effect of the noise and uncertainties is low in the damage detection process and predicted damage ratio values are valid furthermore the marginal cumulative distribution of the predicted damage ratio for element no 1 θ1 is shown in fig 18 based on fig 18 the uncertainties related to parameter θ1 in scenarios c and b are the highest and the lowest respectively 5 conclusion in this manuscript a new bayesian model updating and damage detection framework using the incomplete noisy frf data is proposed for the first time for damage identification of a marine structure in this methodology the number of data in the objective function is increased using frf at different excitation frequencies and the incomplete measurements issue is not dealt with the model reduction or data expansion method the time consuming to compute the parametric frf matrix is minimized in the presented bayesian model updating and damage detection framework the experimental tests are performed on a scaled jacket platform to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methodology excitation frequency ranges are chosen in a way that the effect of noise and uncertainties on the frf data becomes insignificant selecting the appropriate frequency ranges greatly affects the accuracy of the results if unsuitable frequency ranges are selected the uncertainties and noise effects can seriously deviate the damage detection results moreover several numerical damage scenarios are defined to assess the capability of the incomplete noisy data on the accuracy of the proposed method results the results indicated the proposed method is more accurate than previously introduced methods in the literature for the damage detection of a fixed offshore platform based on the results the accuracy of the proposed damage detection framework decreases as the number of measured dofs is reduced the presented damage detection method is also efficient under high level noisy data the effect of noise in measured data uncertainties of the fe model and the added mass on the damage detection results are also investigated in several numerical damage scenarios by considering water added mass the results indicated that the proposed method is highly accurate for the damage detection of the fixed offshore platforms credit authorship contribution statement amin fathi conceptualization methodology writing

21456,collision is one of the major accidents that put the safety of navigation at risk all the time the effective monitoring on the geographical distribution of collision risk is conducive to reducing the chance of collision accidents in this paper a novel model intended for identifying the geographical distribution of collision risk in water area was proposed on the basis of radial distribution function in molecular dynamics in this model ship traffic and ships were converted into a molecular system after being obtained using an analytical method collision risk was generalized as distance to model the collision risk by radial distribution function finally a space interpolation technique was applied to visualize the geographical distribution of collision risk to validate the proposed model the ais data contained in bohai strait was used to conduct experiment according to the experimental results the map as obtained by the proposed model is capable to identify the geographical distribution of collision risk and is advantageous over the traditional method in the instantaneity and accuracy of identification moreover the proposed model can assist surveillance

leaking and etc kujala et al 2009 these accidents may lead to loss of life and property and cause detrimental effects on the marine environment goerlandt and kujala 2011 among these accidents collision is one of the major risks that present risk to the safety of navigation debnath and chin 2010 which can lead to severe consequences in order to reduce the occurrence rate of collision accidents while lessening collision risk the monitoring of collision risk is performed in vessel traffic service vts by surveillance operators the monitoring is able to be carried out using such advanced equipment as automatic identification system ais which can receive the real time message transmitted from the ships located in the water area of jurisdiction tu et al 2018 however there remain some limitations that the monitoring work is subject to for example subjectivity randomness or insufficient visibility especially in some complicated circumstances in addition the ais data is not fully utilized for the monitoring of collision risk therefore in order to enhance the efficiency of monitoring and improve the safety of navigation it is necessary to construct a visibility model for collision risk monitoring through a more effective utilization of ais data the reminder of this paper is arranged as follows in section 2 the related work of ship collision alert system collision

2 related work in order to improve navigational safety many scholars have been researching in collision risk alert and collision risk modeling in terms of ship collision alert and decision support system huang et al 2020 make a comprehensive review on the collision prevention methods focusing on motion prediction conflict detection and conflict resolution which are critical in ship collision alert and decision support system the merits and drawbacks of the methods are analyzed the authors also discuss the differences and linkages between the research on manned and unmanned ships for example zhao et al 1994 use several fuzzy sets to simulate the collision avoidance behaviors and psychology of mariners the simulation is conducted on the collision avoidance action in different types of encountering in different types of restricted water area the model can make contribution to the development of ship collision decision making system and marine traffic simulation kao et al 2007 propose a fuzzy logic method for identifying all potential collision ships the method is integrated with vts ais system and is used to build up an efficient ship collision alerting system the method can precisely predict the collision position and time by using a gis module and it can make contribution to the decision making of vts operators simsir et al 2014 develop a decision support system for the passing vessels in istanbul strait the system is modeled by artificial neural network to apply the vessel data to predict the future location the system will alert if there is any possibility of collision for the vessels in their future locations and warn the vts operators and the officer on watch in order to guide them avoid the possible collision goerlandt et al 2015 propose a framework for maritime risk informed collision alert system based on risk concept and fuzzy mathematic for establishing the system a method for assessing collision risk is presented zhang et al 2015 propose a real time and distributed anti collision decision support formulation under multi vessel encountering the requirements from colreg are considered in the decision support formulation the formulation can provide initial decision on collision avoidance based on analysis and it can keep own ship avoid all target ships in encounter situation in terms of ship collision risk modeling such as ais based or probabilistic methods to detect ship collision risk lim et al 2018 provide a detailed literature review on maritime risk analysis over 180 papers are included in this review and they are analyzed and discussed on the influence to the maritime industry and the models and computational algorithms the work shows the trend and demand of research in maritime risk analysis and can give some useful suggestions to the future research in this field chen et al 2019 collected extensive literatures on probabilistic risk analysis for the collision between ships and reviewed them focusing on the aspects of stakeholders and methodologies and criteria used for identifying collision risk by reviewing these literatures the advantage and disadvantage of probabilistic methods are concluded and the work is helpful for developing better collision risk model in the future du et al 2020 perform a detailed review of the methods for assessing maritime waterway risk based on the detection of non accident critical events from ais data and analyze the methods on five fundamental questions in risk research and safety science the reviewed methods use non accident critical events as surrogate indicators to identify collision risk which is considered as a promising approach to detect collision risk for example szlapczynski 2006 proposes a method to calculate ship collision risk based on the concept of ship domain the commonly used parameters in identifying collision risk such as distance at closest point of approach dcpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa are replaced mou et al 2010 propose a dynamic approach to identify collision risk based on safety assessment model for shipping and offshore on the north sea samson where a linear regression model is developed to determine the correlation between closest point of approach cpa and the crucial parameters of ship such as speed course and size li and pang 2013 propose a ship collision risk measuring method based on dempster shafer d s evidence theory in order to improve the accuracy and computing efficiency of collision risk assessment zhang et al 2016 propose a method for detecting possible near miss of ship collisions from ais data the method considers ship size by ship domain model and is able to rank the severity of ship encounters without expert judgement weng and xue 2015 evaluate ship collision frequency in port fairways in singapore strait the ship collision frequency is evaluated based on collision probability model and the concept of ship domain by analyzing the collision frequency the types of ships involved in dangerous encounters the numbers of encountering types in different area and the influence of night can be identified cucinotta et al 2017 assess the ship collision frequency in the strait of messina by using the international association of lighthouse authorities waterways risk assessment program iwrap model where the geometrical collisions and the causation probability are calculated zhang et al 2019 propose a macroscopic collision risk model for assessing regional collision risk which combines density complexity and a multi vessel collision risk operator the model can be used to identify high risk collision risk area and aid implementation of safety measures for improving safety some studies focus on the visualization model of navigation in the water area silveira et al 2013 study the ship collision risk off the coast of portugal based on ais data they propose an algorithm to assess the risk profile and the relative importance of routes where the collision risk is assessed by predicting the future distances between ships shelmerdine 2015 uses ais data to visualize the marine traffic around shetland over 730000 ais data points in 2013 from around shetland were processed analyzed and used to plot several maps of marine traffic such as ais pings map vessel density map vessel track map vessel length map etc these maps are useful for marine environment management and can ensure the navigational safety in marine spatial and development plans chen et al 2015 propose a cross disciplinary quantitative approach to delineate the principal fairways of ship passages in a strait based on space use method in animal ecology compared with previous related studies this approach can provide the information of cumulative activity patterns for vessel groups and has advantage in analyzing directional and seasonal factor for principal fairways by utilizing the proposed approach the analysis of principal fairways can be facilitated by identifying the usage of strait corridors in addition it provides a new way to map the geographical distribution of ship movement over time breithaupt et al 2017 plot ship routes between ports along the atlantic coast of the us by ais data from 2010 to 2012 where the route boundary is delineated by analysis wu et al 2017 map the global ship and traffic density using a very large amount of ais data from 2012 to 2015 the density maps are obtained in different resolutions and can indicate the distribution of ships and traffic yoo 2018 map the near miss density of the water area near korea based on a large amount of ais data in 2014 the near miss situation is judged by some criteria of ship relative motion parameters the map can be used to identify the near miss areas and determine the relative densities of the areas for the purpose of safe navigation and the prevention of ship collisions lensu and goerlandt 2019 combine ais data with marine environment data derived from ice charts and ice drift models and some other ship data to build up an accumulating multi purpose database for the northern baltic sea the purpose of this database is to research for the issues of winter navigation a wide range of winter navigation questions can be addressed such as the influence of ice on ship spatial statistics the relationship between ship speed and the thickness of ice and the analysis of convey table 1 was made to compare these visualization methods in 6 aspects which are the data used the receiving interval of ais message the time period of model the parameters included in the model the indicator of collision risk and the representation degree of collision risk it can be found that all of the listed methods use ais data to visualize maritime traffic but the receiving intervals of ais message are different which range from 10 s to 10 min the shorter the interval the more the message will be received with more message received the results can be more accurate in terms of the time period of model these methods visualize maritime traffic ranging from 1 month to 9 years none of them focus on instantaneous moment although it is very helpful for the analysis of maritime traffic it is hard to apply in real time monitoring most of these visualization methods focus on mapping the traffic density or finding traffic route which can only reflect the risk of collision roughly the parameters considered for mapping traffic density are normally ship position and time stamp which are relatively limited in identifying collision risk although shelmerdine 2015 and lensu and goerlandt 2019 incorporate more parameters most of them are used for maritime traffic analysis and make few contribution to collision risk representation the model in silveira et al 2013 can identify the collision candidates by predicting the future locations of ships in the waters but it is difficult to distinguish the collision risk between collision candidates and obtained exact collision risk values yoo 2018 uses the criteria of near miss to map the risk in the water area compared with density and collision candidates near miss can represent collision risk better however the model can only find the near misses and is not able to give the exact risk value although these methods are effective in visualizing the marine traffic in the water area there are also some limitations for them to represent the collision risk sufficiently and comprehensively such as the receiving interval of ais message the instantaneous identification the factors concerned the accuracy of results the collision risk value calculation etc therefore for overcoming the limitations of the previous studies in collision risk identification also for assisting surveillance operators in the monitoring work to reduce collision risk this paper aimed to propose a novel model for identifying the geographical distribution of collision risk based on radial distribution function utilizing the ais data of very short receiving interval the proposed model can map the dynamic collision risk in the water area for any instantaneous moment visually and accurately it can also help surveillance operators to enhance their working efficiency when monitor the collision risk in the jurisdiction water area 3 the proposed model for identifying the geographical distribution of collision risk 3 1 the foundation of the proposed model in molecular dynamics the bonding status and interaction between particles among the particle system e g atom molecule and colloid can be detected by radial distribution function rdf which is also named as pair correlation function it can identify the variation of density by establishing a function between density and distance for example atoms which are considered as the fundamental constituent particles of molecule pauling 1988 are placed in the molecule in a certain spatial order by bonds an atom in a molecule is surrounded by other atoms by using rdf the density around this atom could be identified which is achieved by calculating the number of atoms at different distances from the central atom as the atoms are placed in a three dimensional space different distances from the central atom could be regarded as different spherical shells with the width of δ r mcquarrie 1976 the radial distribution of an atom can be expressed as the following equation 1 g i r n i r δ r ρ v r δ r where g i r refers to the radial distribution of central atom i at the distance of r from the central atom i n i r δ r refers to the number of atoms in the spherical shell with the width of δ r at the distance of r from the central atom i ρ refers to the density of the molecule and v r δ r refers to the volume of the spherical shell mentioned above after the radial distribution of the central atom i at varying distances is calculated the radial distribution function performed by is made achievable an exemplary graph of the rdf of h2o molecule that contains hydrogen and oxygen atoms is presented in fig 1 the density around atom i at varying distances is indicated by the rdf graph the integral of the rdf curve is applied to quantify the overall density around atom i that is the overall distribution probability of atoms around it the integral is called ligancy coordination number in molecular dynamics it represents the number of atoms directly linked to the central atom in a molecule system international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac 2014 and can represent the compactness of the stacking state of the atoms the higher the ligancy coordination number the tighter the atoms will be the ligancy coordination number of atom i can be expressed as the following equation 2 l i 0 r n i r δ r ρ v r δ r d r where l i refers to the coordination number of atom i 3 2 the rdf model for identifying collision risk in liu et al 2020 rdf is used to identify the dynamic ship density of water area because it can be used to study the density around a particle in molecular dynamics for applying rdf in identifying dynamic ship density the particle system is introduced in ship traffic by converting the ship traffic into a ship traffic molecule system in this system ship traffic is assumed as a molecule and the ships are assumed as constituent particles namely atoms in this paper rdf is used to identify the collision risk around a ship the overall collision risk around a ship is denoted as dynamic collision risk dcr similarly the conversion process should take place to identify the dynamic collision risk of a ship by rdf as shown in fig 2 the whole of ship traffic is assumed as a molecule namely the ship traffic molecule while the ships in the ship traffic are assumed as atoms namely the ship atoms for modeling the density around a particle in a particle system rdf is used to indicate the densities at varying distances from the central particle the distance is regarded as a crucial parameter required for the model the more surrounding particles there are in the adjacent distance the greater the density around the central particle would be for modeling collision risk by rdf collision risk was assumed as a distance in a broader sense in this paper for differing from the distance in liu et al 2020 this distance was named as risk distance it doesn t refer to the distance between two ships but the collision risk between two ships as risk distance is the representation of collision risk the longer the risk distance the larger the collision risk in order to model the collision risk around a central ship atom rdf was used to measure the densities of the surrounding ship atoms in different risk distances as indicated in section 3 1 rdf can be used to identify the density around a particle in this section the density identification application of rdf was introduced to ship traffic because there exists some similarities between a particle system e g a molecule system constituted with atoms and a ship traffic system firstly in terms of static characteristic both a particle system and a ship traffic system are located in a space for a molecule particle system the constituent particle is atom the atoms are located in a three dimensional space with certain spatial arrangement pauling 1988 for a ship traffic system the constituent element is ship the ships are also located in a space with certain spatial arrangement secondly in terms of dynamic characteristic both constituent particle in a particle system and constituent element in a ship traffic system are moving constantly through space for a particle system molecules and atoms are moving with certain kinetic energy and potential energy through space hogan 2016 for a ship traffic system ships are moving with their power through space thirdly distance plays a crucial role in both systems as indicated in section 3 1 distance is the most important factor in using rdf to identify the density around a certain particle because rdf is built up with the distribution of particles based on distance and it judges the distribution status around a particle for a ship traffic system distance is also an important parameter it can influence ship density which is a basic metric of ship traffic to describe the traffic situation in aspects of crowdedness and busyness of ship generally the smaller the distance the greater the ship density and the more crowded and busy the ship traffic distance can also represent the collision risk between ships in a ship traffic system with a negative correlation lisowski 2001 in addition the analogy between a particle system and a ship traffic system has been conducted in previous studies of marine traffic molecule is introduced to establish the molecular collision theory fujii and shiobara 1971 macduff 1974 pedersen 1995 which is a widely used method to identify the collision risk in ship traffic for these reasons we wish to assume the ship traffic system as a particle system in this paper in order to apply rdf to identify some features of ship traffic to be specific identify the collision risk in ship traffic although some similarities exist between a particle system and a ship traffic system as mentioned above there are also some differences between them in terms of a normal particle system the constituent particles are ordered in the three dimensional space however ship traffic is formed on the surface of the water so the ship traffic molecule system should be considered as a particle system which is arranged in two dimensional space the calculating process related to the volume of spherical shell should be converted into the area of circular ring therefore the dynamic collision risk namely the overall collision risk around a ship can be expressed as the following equation 3 d c r i 0 r n i r δ r α ρ s r δ r d r 0 r n i r δ r s 2 α n π r δ r d r where d c r i refers to the dynamic collision risk of ship i s r δ r refers to the area of circular ring with the width of δ r at the distance of r and it is a replacement of v r δ r in a normal particle system arranged in the three dimensional space α is an adjusting coefficient which was used to fix the result in a relatively small interval if α was not included in the equation the values of the integrand would be very big which are difficult to handle in the proposed model in this paper the value of α is taken as the number of ships n in the studied area referred to liu et al 2020 it can fix the values of integrand to a relatively small interval and make the computing more efficient r refers to the upper integral interval which is set as 1 according to the research of collision risk index in automatic collision avoidance namely the maximum value of risk distance n i r δ r is similar to that in eq 1 which refers to the number of particles at certain risk distance in a ship traffic molecule system it refers to the number of ships in the circular ring with the width of δ r at the risk distance of r from the central ship which can be obtained by algorithm 1 in fig 3 the key parameters in algorithm 1 are explaining and showing in algorithm 1 r m a x refers to the maximum risk distance as the collision risk index between two ships are considered as between 0 and 1 according to the research of automatic collision avoidance zhen et al 2017 the value of r m a x was assumed as 1 n b refers to the bins divided for the risk distance generally it can be 100 to divide the risk distance into 100 bins and r b refers to the risk distance of each bin in line 4 c r i j refers to the collision risk index between ship i and j c r i j is the function to obtain the collision risk index as collision risk was assumed as risk distance the collision risk index between two ships should be calculated in order to obtain the risk distance between them there are many methods to calculate collision risk index namely the risk distance between two ships such as analytical method zhen et al 2017 fuzzy logic method goerlandt et al 2015 and etc in this paper the method in liu et al 2019 was adopted to calculate the risk distance between two ships which is composed of the collision risk of dcpa tcpa and ship domain overlapping index sdoi i n d e x refers to the tag of the bin after the calculation in line 6 and 7 ships are divided into different bins and n i r δ r of different bins can be obtained namely at different risk distances c r i j can be obtained by algorithm 2 in algorithm 2 l o n g i and l o n g j refer to the longitude of ship i and ship j l a t i and l a t j refer to the latitude of ship i and ship j c i and c j refer to the course of ship i and ship j v i v j refers to the speed of ship i and ship j l i and l j refer to the length of ship i and ship j similar to liu et al 2019 namely regional collision risk model the proposed model is also a model of collision risk but there are many differences between them firstly regional collision risk model is to identify the entire collision risk of certain water area which is a collision risk of macroscopic perspective the proposed model is to map the geographical distribution of collision risk which should be obtained by calculating the collision risk of every single location in the water area it is a collision risk of microscopic perspective secondly the methods used in the two models are different in regional collision risk model spatial clustering algorithm and shapley value method are used in the proposed model the methods used are rdf in molecular dynamic and spatial interpolation technique thirdly the applications of the two models are different regional collision risk model can help maritime surveillance operators recognize the collision risk level of certain water area by an exact collision risk value the proposed model can help them understand the distribution of collision risk by a heatmap visually the only similarity between the two models is to use dcpa tcpa and sdoi to calculate the collision risk between two ships however it serves to different purpose in each of the two models therefore regional collision risk model and the proposed model can be considered two completely different models table 2 was given to show the differences between the two models in the proposed model dcpa tcpa and sdoi were used to calculate risk distance namely the collision risk index between two ships which is expressed as c r i j mentioned above c r i j is the key value to calculate n i r δ r namely the number of ships at certain risk distance in algorithm 1 and n i r δ r is a crucial parameter in the dcr formula an rdf graph for an exemplary ship atom is shown in fig 4 by integrating the rdf graph d c r i can be obtained and it can represent the overall collision risk around ship i for highlighting the collision risk the integral interval was adjusted this is because a lot of low collision risks will be included in the risk distance between 0 and 0 2 if the integrand is integrated from 0 to 1 like eq 3 and the accuracy of the results will be affected seriously therefore the lower bound of the integral interval should be adjusted to a bigger value in order to neglect the influence of those low collision risks in the water area the integration is expressed as follows 4 d c r i r 1 r 2 n i r δ r α ρ s r δ r d r r 1 r 2 n i r δ r s 2 α n π r δ r d r where r 1 and r 2 refer to the two bounds of the integral interval r 1 is the lower bound of this adjusted interval the value of r 1 was recommended to take the value between 0 2 and 0 5 because the collision risks higher than 0 5 are generally few the exact value of the lower integral bound should be determined according to the characteristic of the water area r 2 is the upper bound of the adjusted interval it remains same as upper integral bound in eq 3 which is 1 namely the maximum value of risk distance d c r i refers to the dynamic collision risk of ship i the result of d c r i is an integral value because the integral of rdf in a particle system can represent ligancy coordination number which can describe the overall density of the system to be specific d c r i can be obtained by algorithm 3 after calculating all d c r i in a ship traffic molecule the space interpolation technique can be utilized to create the geographical distribution map of d c r in this paper spline interpolation technique was channeled into interpolating the discrete d c r points in different locations to a continuous d c r surface it can produce a smooth curve passing through discrete data points with variable splines hall and meyer 1976 the d c r can provide assistances to maritime surveillance operators in order to monitor the collision risk in the water area compared with collision near misses happen more often in the traffic reality hence it is necessary to investigate the role of near misses play in the proposed model near miss refers to a situation that there is the danger of collision between ships approaching each other but with no collision eventually occurring reason 2016 in other words near miss can be considered as a pre collision state with the collision risk to some extent the proposed model maps the collision risk distribution in the water area based on risk distance namely the collision risk index between any two ships collision risk index can measure the degree of collision risk from 0 to 1 where 0 means no collision risk at all and 1 means the happening of collision near miss which is treated as a pre collision state with the collision risk to some extent is supposed to be within this interval indicated by collision risk index therefore near miss can be considered to be contained by the proposed model as near miss is included in the proposed model the proposed model can also map the geographical distribution of near miss if the near miss threshold condition was given for example in yoo 2018 the threshold condition of near miss is presented as d c p a 0 1 nm t c p a 3 min and d i s t a n c e 0 3 nm based on this threshold condition a threshold collision risk index can be calculated by collision risk index model kearon 1977 after setting the obtained value of collision risk index as r 1 in eq 4 which is the lower integral bound of dcr modeling the proposed model can map the geographical distribution of near miss in the water area it can be considered as a specific use of the proposed model 4 case study for illustrating and validating the proposed model the real ais data of the ships sailing in bohai strait of china was applied in this study to carry out experiments as the busiest water area in northern china the studied water area consists of east bohai sea and north yellow sea as shown in fig 5 it is a necessity to pass through this water area for the trade conducted between some major ports around bohai sea such as tianjin qinhuangdao yingkou and other locations in addition bohai strait is ranked as one of the largest straits in china which has a relatively large amount of traffic liu et al 2016 the busy water area creates a favorable condition for the formation of collision risk between ships geographically the studied water area is positioned between 38 0 n and 38 6 n 120 95 e and 122 5 e the ais data is dated july 2nd 2018 to illustrate and validate the proposed model the source ais data was decoded besides the information on position speed course dimension of ships time and mmsi were extracted to prevent the temporal discreteness of ais data the extracted ais data was treated by interpolation to obtain the information of the exact same time on top of that the ais data was processed by removing anomaly messages firstly the proposed model was used to establish the dynamic collision risk map based on three different moments these moments are 1600 1700 and 1800 on july 2nd 2018 which are relatively adjacent in time these maps are shown as heatmaps which range from 0 to 1 in collision risk the redder the color is the greater the collision risk will be these three maps are shown in fig 6 it is observed that the water area with relatively high collision risk higher than 0 5 distributes from the northwest to the southeast in the dynamic collision risk map in order to demonstrate the validity of the map the ship trajectory map of the studied water area was drawn for comparison as shown in fig 7 the ship trajectory map was drawn by the ais data from 1600 on july 2nd 2018 to 1600 on july 3rd 2018 this 24 h ship trajectory map could indicate the status of the traffic flows in this studied water area such as the direction of the traffic flows and the intersection of the traffic flows by observing this ship trajectory map the water area which with higher collision risk can be inferred such as the water area with denser trajectories or the water area intersected by two or more traffic flows the water area with denser trajectories could indicate that the traffic volume in this water area is relatively big and easier to form the complicated traffic situation and increase collision risk the water area intersected by two or more traffic flows is much easier to form the complicated situation because all of the encountering types can be formed in this water area therefore this ship trajectory map was used to compare with the proposed dynamic collision risk map it can be seen from the ship trajectory map that there are two main traffic flows in this water area one is from the northwest to the southeast and the other one is from the north to the south these two traffic flows correspond to the two main routes in bohai strait which are the northwest southeast route to enter or exit bohai sea and the north south route to travel between the ports in liaoning province and shandong province most of the ships in this water area sail in these two routes between them the northwest southeast route is much busier and much denser in the ship trajectory map because it connects between the ports around bohai sea and the ports all over the world with such busy traffic the collision risk in this water area would certainly be higher which is the same as the indication of proposed dynamic collision risk map therefore it can be proved that the higher collision risk area shown by fig 6 is well matched with the reality of the traffic indicated by the ship trajectory map it should be noticed that the ship traffic in the ship trajectory map can only indicate the collision risk roughly from the trajectory map we can only observe the locations where ships gathered but the exact collision risk value of such locations cannot be obtained in other words any points in the traffic intersections part of the ship trajectory map seems same the collision risk values of these points cannot be distinguished even the geographical distribution therefore establishing a model which can identify the exact collision risk value is necessary to be specific if the proposed model was adopted the exact collision risk value around the traffic intersection area can be obtained for example calculating by the proposed model the most dangerous location around the traffic intersection area at 1600 on july 2nd 2018 is around 38 18 n 121 77 e where the collision risk value is 0 7755 in addition the geographical distribution can be obtained by the proposed model as shown in fig 6 a it is hard for the ship trajectory map to find this location and the collision risk value and map the geographical distribution accident data can also be used for the validation of the proposed model according to the annual report on maritime accidents 2017 2018 of liaoning maritime safety administration laotieshan waterway is the one of the most concerned regions in the water area because it has largest number of accidents except the near port area and the accident consequence are often severe liaoning maritime safety administration lnmsa 2017 2018 han et al 2018 collect maritime accidents data over the last 15 years and also indicates that the region around laotieshan waterway is the most dangerous region besides the region near port this conclusion is also drawn by peng 2013 which conducts a research on the maritime accidents of dalian jurisdiction water area the laotieshan waterway mentioned above is marked in the three sub figures in fig 6 it can be observed that this region does have relatively high collision risk which is consistent with the pattern of maritime accident data for further proving that the proposed model can represent the collision risk accurately near miss and average collision risk index cri were adopted as collision risk indicators compared with accident data which is a statistical data of long term near miss and average cri are more suitable for the validation because they can represent the risk of collision instantaneously which is consistent with the characteristic of the proposed model in the water area shown by fig 6 three separate regions were selected in each sub figure the range of each region is 0 15 0 15 these regions are featured with different collision risks which can easily observed from the heatmap for each of the region the number of near miss and the average cri were calculated the near miss data was calculated based on the threshold conditions presented in yoo 2018 for the purpose of comparison the threshold for judging near miss situation was lowered the original thresholds for dcpa tcpa and distance are relatively strict if these thresholds were adopted there would be very less even no near miss situation for a single moment the average cri was calculated based on the traditional cri model in kearon 1977 the related results are shown in table 3 it can be observed that there is an obvious relationship between the collision risk indicated by heatmap and the number of near miss and the average cri of the regions selected in each scenario for the regions of relatively high collision risk indicated by heatmap such as region a 1 and a 2 in the first scenario the near misses and the average cri are also relatively high compared with the low risk region such as region a 3 for further illustrating and validating proposed dynamic collision risk map two of the dynamic collision risk maps as shown above were chosen they are the dynamic collision risk map of 1700 and 1800 dated july 2nd 2018 for each of them the studied water area is split into three parts which stretch from 121 0 e to 121 5 e from 121 5 e to 122 0 e and from 122 0 e to 122 5 e respectively these parts are denoted as area 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 2 and 2 3 respectively as shown in fig 8 it is revealed by fig 8 a that the water area with a relatively higher collision risk is located in area 1 1 and area 1 2 in order to verify the map the ship density in these three parts of the map was calculated ship density is defined as the number of ships per unit area for a moment wu et al 2017 it can indicate the degree of crowding and the risk of collision wen et al 2015 the greater the ship density is the higher the collision risk would be in addition the number of near miss and the average cri were also used for the comparison of the results the related results in these three parts is shown in table 4 it can be found out that the ship density in area 1 1 and area 1 2 is significantly higher than in area 1 3 suggesting that the collision risk in area 1 1 and area 1 2 is relatively higher to some extent the number of near miss and the average cri of area 1 1 and area 1 2 are also higher than that in area 1 3 this is consistent with the high collision risk area as indicated by the proposed dynamic collision risk map shown in fig 8 a similarly the ship density near miss number and average cri in the three parts of the second map were also calculated and the results are shown in table 5 it is found that the ship density in area 2 1 and area 2 2 performs much higher than that in area 2 3 which indicates that the collision risk in these two areas is relatively higher to some extent the number of near miss and the average cri of area 2 1 and area 2 2 are also higher than that in area 2 3 it is also in accordance with the high collision risk area indicated by the proposed dynamic collision risk map shown in fig 8 b therefore it can be proved that the proposed dynamic collision risk map can reflect the overall geographical distribution of collision risk in water area effectively and reasonably 5 discussion this paper proposed a novel model to identify the geographical distribution of collision risk based on rdf in molecular dynamics assuming that the ship traffic is a molecule and ships are constituent atoms the rdf model was downgraded from three dimension to two dimension when modeling collision risk an analytical method was applied to obtain the collision risk between each ship pair which was generalized as distance in rdf model at last the space interpolation technique was utilized to map the collision risk in the water area the rdf based dynamic collision risk map can identify the geographical distribution of collision risk in the water area instantaneously by inputting the real time dynamic information extracted from ais data such as position speed course dimension etc into the model the dynamic collision risk map of the water area can be drawn it can identify the instantaneous geographical distribution of collision risk in the water area and report the high collision risk area to the surveillance operators in order to assist them in their monitoring work compared with the traditional method in mapping collision risk in the water area the proposed model has advantage in instantaneous collision risk identification and can better assist the surveillance operators in the real time monitoring work additionally the proposed model can provide more accurate results of collision risk as indicated in table 1 there are many visualization methods of maritime traffic in terms of representing collision risk the methods in shelmerdine 2015 chen et al 2015 breithaupt et al 2017 wu et al 2017 and lensu and goerlandt 2019 belong to the same kind which use traffic density to indicate the risk of collision this kind of methods can only map collision risk roughly high traffic density can indicate that there are more ships in the water area which may form the risk of collision easier however high traffic density does not necessarily mean the risk of collision is high it can only reflect collision risk to some extent the mapping of traffic density is very similar to the ship trajectory map in fig 7 from the map the regions of high density can be observed these regions may feature with relatively high collision risk however it is just a rough estimation and the exact value cannot be obtained from such map in silveira et al 2013 collision candidates are used to map the collision risk off the coast of portugal in this method the future position of ships are predicted for 20 min the future distance between any two ships is compared with the geometrical collision diameter defined by pedersen 1995 if the future distance is less than the geometrical collision diameter the ships are considered as collision candidates in order to contrast this method to the proposed model we used this method to map the collision risk of the studied water area of 1600 on july 2nd 2018 for better displaying the collision risk the criteria of the geometrical collision diameter was relatively loosened the map is shown in fig 9 it can be found that the collision candidates are clearly showed in the studied water area compared with traffic density collision candidates can represent collision risk more sufficiently however it is difficult to distinguish the collision risks of these collision candidates in the map at an instantaneous moment in addition the exact collision risk values of the collision candidates are not obtained the proposed dynamic collision risk map for the same moment is shown in fig 6 a it is easy to observe the difference in collision risk between different locations in addition the exact collision risk values can be obtained behind the map yoo 2018 proposes a near miss density map for the safe navigation of ships in the sea off the south coast of korea near miss refers to a circumstance where there is a real danger of collision risk between the approaching ships reason 2016 which can be used to represent collision risk compared with traffic density and collision candidates near miss is a more suitable metric to represent collision risk instantaneously for visualization of the near miss map a large amount of data for 1 year period is used the threshold of dcpa tcpa and distance is set to judge the occurrence of near miss the data of a relative long period applied to map the collision risk is helpful for analyzing the general state of collision risk in the water area for example to identify the common high collision risk area sum up the ship type involved in near miss etc however it is relatively limited for identifying the real time geographical distribution of collision risk and plays only a limited role in assisting surveillance operators with the real time monitoring in addition despite such crucial parameters as dcpa tcpa and distance used to judge the scenario of near miss situation it is unlikely to further identify the exact collision risk value for distinguishing between the situations which means all of the near miss scenarios are considered as the same sort of emergency therefore the collision risk in the water area is hindered from being represented accurately and sufficiently one example is the studied water area referred to in section 3 the dynamic collision risk map of 1600 dated july 2nd 2018 in fig 6 a was chosen for the comparison drawn between the proposed model and the near miss density map to facilitate such a comparison the threshold applied to judge near miss situation was lowered the original threshold set for dcpa tcpa and distance is relatively higher if these thresholds were adopted there would be few or even no near miss scenarios for a single moment the near miss density map for this moment is shown in fig 10 it can be found out that the proposed dynamic collision risk map is accurate in identifying the geographical distribution of collision risk across the studied water area through a heatmap at 1600 dated july 2nd 2018 in comparison the near miss map is limited to identifying the near miss points of approaching ships by marking them in the map with all of the near miss points appearing identical thus rendering the collision risk of each point indistinguishable also the exact collision risk values cannot be obtained by the near miss map it is demonstrated that the traditional near miss density map is restricted not only in the instantaneous identification of collision risk but also in obtaining the precise collision risk value which is an issue that can be addressed by the dynamic collision risk map proposed in this paper compared with the model in liu et al 2020 namely dynamic density model the model in this paper has the following differences firstly rdf in dynamic density model is mainly used to model ship or traffic density which is a basic measurement of traffic situation in marine traffic however rdf in this paper was not used to model the density any more it was used to identify the collision risk in water area which refers to the possibility of collision accident this is the fundamental difference between the models in two papers secondly the key parameter distance in the two models are different in dynamic density model distance is what it literally means which refers to the amount of space between two things stevenson 2010 namely the amount of space between two ships in this paper although the name distance was used again to build up the rdf model it no longer means the amount of space between two ships it is a distance in a broader sense which represent the collision risk between two ships therefore it was named as risk distance in this paper in order to differ from the distance in dynamic density model thirdly according to the second difference some characteristics of the distance parameters in the two models are different in dynamic density model distance is located in a general plane the space amount between two points on this plane is calculated from the spatial location i e longitude latitude of two points however in the proposed model risk distance is located in a collision risk plane the space amount between two points on this plane is collision risk and is calculated from the collision risk factors i e dcpa tcpa sdoi table 6 is given in order to better show the differences between the two models for obtaining the dynamic collision risk map the proposed model needs to go through the following steps as shown in fig 11 our operating environment is intel r core tm i5 3210m cpu 2 50 ghz 8 00 gb ram the first step is the ais data processing step in this step the ais message should be decoded and extracted at first we decoded ais source messages and stored the ais data in a database however for the application on a real time scenario as the shore based ais of maritime vessel traffic control can receive and decode ais message in real time the time required to decode and extract can be ignored after extracting the needed ais data from the database it should be interpolated to obtain the ship information required for the proposed model in the exact same time because the ais data is not continuous in time and presents different receiving intervals for different ships as mentioned in section 4 the interpolation process should take 0 4231 s on our operating environment the second step is the risk distance calculating step namely the step to calculate the collision risk index in this step the collision risk index between any two ships in the studied area are calculated take the experiment of fig 6 a as example there are 89 ships in the studied area the collision risk index between any two ships of these 89 ships can be calculated through algorithm 2 and it takes 0 9328 s on our operating environment the last step is the dynamic collision risk mapping step in this step the risk distance namely the collision risk index obtained in the second step is used to calculate the key parameter n i r δ r at first by algorithm 1 and then the dynamic collision risk can be mapped based on rdf and spatial interpolation technique this step takes 3 1001 s on our operating environment therefore the whole process of obtaining the dynamic collision risk map should take 4 4560 s for maritime vessel traffic control to apply the proposed model on a real time scenario this time can be further shortened due to the advanced hardware and operating environment it should be noticed that the steps mentioned above is conducted respectively on our operating environment the time will also be shortened if an integrated and optimized software is made to incorporate these steps through the dynamic collision risk map maritime surveillance operator in vessel traffic control can learn the geographical distribution of collision risk in the water area it can make them recognize the region of high risk which has high change of the happening of collision accident and provide them a chance to judge the collision risk in the water area in advance apart from the region of high risk the map can also indicate the regions of sub high risk which has a probability of the happening of collision accident and keep them maintain vigilance maritime surveillance operators can comprehend the collision risk distribution in the water area rapidly and visually through the proposed dynamic collision risk map and keep the priority of the collision risk region in mind which is helpful for them to target on the high risk region quickly the map can enhance their working efficiency when monitor the collision risk in the water area the enhancement in other words the time saved depends on their experience and knowledge it can also release their recognizing pressure in monitoring and avoid the work fault due to subjectivity and randomness of monitoring and the complexity of maritime traffic in sum the proposed dynamic collision risk map can help to obtain the geographical distribution of collision risk in the water area rapidly and quickly and learn the priority of the collision risk area it is helpful to recognize the region of high chance of the happening of collision accidents efficiently save the time of monitoring and release the recognizing pressure which can benefit the decision support subsequently and make contribution to the improvement of maritime traffic safety 6 conclusion herein a novel model to identify the geographical distribution of collision risk in the water area was proposed which is based on radial distribution function in molecular dynamics by using the proposed model the dynamic collision risk map for the water area can be depicted for modeling the collision risk through radial distribution function ship traffic was converted into a molecule system by assuming ship traffic as molecule and assuming ships as constituent atoms the three dimension radial distribution function model was converted into two dimensional to adapt the characteristic of ship traffic the collision risk was generalized as distance in the radial distribution function model and was obtained in an analytical method finally a space interpolation technique was utilized to map the dynamic collision risk of the water area in order to verify the validity of the proposed model experiments were carried out by using the ais data of bohai strait the proposed map was also compared with the traditional method in identifying the geographical distribution of collision risk it reveals that the proposed map could identify the geographical distribution of collision risk effectively and reasonably show its advantages in identifying instantaneous collision risk distribution and can provide more accurate results surveillance operators can be better supported in their monitoring work of collision risk by utilizing the proposed dynamic collision risk map thus enhancing the safety of navigation however the proposed model still has some limitations which should be researched further the proposed model is relatively limited under the situation that there are only very fey ships in the water area in this case the results may be influenced by the number of ships and the geographical distribution shown on the map may not be clear enough this kind of problem can be overcome by using the proposed model combined with microscopic collision risk identification method in addition the proposed model only took some crucial parameters of ship motion into consideration when modeling collision risk some other factors like ship maneuverability weather condition regulations in the water area can be considered into the model in order to further improve the accuracy of the map in the future studies credit authorship contribution statement zihao liu conceptualization methodology software validation formal

21456,collision is one of the major accidents that put the safety of navigation at risk all the time the effective monitoring on the geographical distribution of collision risk is conducive to reducing the chance of collision accidents in this paper a novel model intended for identifying the geographical distribution of collision risk in water area was proposed on the basis of radial distribution function in molecular dynamics in this model ship traffic and ships were converted into a molecular system after being obtained using an analytical method collision risk was generalized as distance to model the collision risk by radial distribution function finally a space interpolation technique was applied to visualize the geographical distribution of collision risk to validate the proposed model the ais data contained in bohai strait was used to conduct experiment according to the experimental results the map as obtained by the proposed model is capable to identify the geographical distribution of collision risk and is advantageous over the traditional method in the instantaneity and accuracy of identification moreover the proposed model can assist surveillance operators in the monitoring of collision risk and the improvement of work efficiency thus enhancing the navigational safety in the water area keywords collision risk radial distribution function

leaking and etc kujala et al 2009 these accidents may lead to loss of life and property and cause detrimental effects on the marine environment goerlandt and kujala 2011 among these accidents collision is one of the major risks that present risk to the safety of navigation debnath and chin 2010 which can lead to severe consequences in order to reduce the occurrence rate of collision accidents while lessening collision risk the monitoring of collision risk is performed in vessel traffic service vts by surveillance operators the monitoring is able to be carried out using such advanced equipment as automatic identification system ais which can receive the real time message transmitted from the ships located in the water area of jurisdiction tu et al 2018 however there remain some limitations that the monitoring work is subject to for example subjectivity randomness or insufficient visibility especially in some complicated circumstances in addition the ais data is not fully utilized for the monitoring of collision risk therefore in order to enhance the efficiency of monitoring and improve the safety of navigation it is necessary to construct a visibility model for collision risk monitoring through a more effective utilization of ais data the reminder of this paper is arranged as follows in section 2 the related work of ship collision alert system collision risk detection method and maritime traffic visualization method are reviewed in section 3 the radial distribution function model for identifying the geographical distribution of collision risk is established some experiments are carried out by ais data contained in bohai strait to validate the proposed model in section 4 in section 5 the proposed model is discussed and is compared with traditional method of maritime traffic visualization in order to show its advantages at last the conclusion is drawn in section 6 and the problems deserved to be researched in the future are presented 2 related work in order to improve navigational safety many scholars have been researching in collision risk alert and collision risk modeling in terms of ship collision alert and decision support system huang et al 2020 make a comprehensive review on the collision prevention methods focusing on motion prediction conflict detection and conflict resolution which are critical in ship collision alert and decision support system the merits and drawbacks of the methods are analyzed the authors also discuss the differences and linkages between the research on manned and unmanned ships for example zhao et al 1994 use several fuzzy sets to simulate the collision avoidance behaviors and psychology of mariners the simulation is conducted on the collision avoidance action in different types of encountering in different types of restricted water area the model can make contribution to the development of ship collision decision making system and marine traffic simulation kao et al 2007 propose a fuzzy logic method for identifying all potential collision ships the method is integrated with vts ais system and is used to build up an efficient ship collision alerting system the method can precisely predict the collision position and time by using a gis module and it can make contribution to the decision making of vts operators simsir et al 2014 develop a decision support system for the passing vessels in istanbul strait the system is modeled by artificial neural network to apply the vessel data to predict the future location the system will alert if there is any possibility of collision for the vessels in their future locations and warn the vts operators and the officer on watch in order to guide them avoid the possible collision goerlandt et al 2015 propose a framework for maritime risk informed collision alert system based on risk concept and fuzzy mathematic for establishing the system a method for assessing collision risk is presented zhang et al 2015 propose a real time and distributed anti collision decision support formulation under multi vessel encountering the requirements from colreg are considered in the decision support formulation the formulation can provide initial decision on collision avoidance based on analysis and it can keep own ship avoid all target ships in encounter situation in terms of ship collision risk modeling such as ais based or probabilistic methods to detect ship collision risk lim et al 2018 provide a detailed literature review on maritime risk analysis over 180 papers are included in this review and they are analyzed and discussed on the influence to the maritime industry and the models and computational algorithms the work shows the trend and demand of research in maritime risk analysis and can give some useful suggestions to the future research in this field chen et al 2019 collected extensive literatures on probabilistic risk analysis for the collision between ships and reviewed them focusing on the aspects of stakeholders and methodologies and criteria used for identifying collision risk by reviewing these literatures the advantage and disadvantage of probabilistic methods are concluded and the work is helpful for developing better collision risk model in the future du et al 2020 perform a detailed review of the methods for assessing maritime waterway risk based on the detection of non accident critical events from ais data and analyze the methods on five fundamental questions in risk research and safety science the reviewed methods use non accident critical events as surrogate indicators to identify collision risk which is considered as a promising approach to detect collision risk for example szlapczynski 2006 proposes a method to calculate ship collision risk based on the concept of ship domain the commonly used parameters in identifying collision risk such as distance at closest point of approach dcpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa are replaced mou et al 2010 propose a dynamic approach to identify collision risk based on safety assessment model for shipping and offshore on the north sea samson where a linear regression model is developed to determine the correlation between closest point of approach cpa and the crucial parameters of ship such as speed course and size li and pang 2013 propose a ship collision risk measuring method based on dempster shafer d s evidence theory in order to improve the accuracy and computing efficiency of collision risk assessment zhang et al 2016 propose a method for detecting possible near miss of ship collisions from ais data the method considers ship size by ship domain model and is able to rank the severity of ship encounters without expert judgement weng and xue 2015 evaluate ship collision frequency in port fairways in singapore strait the ship collision frequency is evaluated based on collision probability model and the concept of ship domain by analyzing the collision frequency the types of ships involved in dangerous encounters the numbers of encountering types in different area and the influence of night can be identified cucinotta et al 2017 assess the ship collision frequency in the strait of messina by using the international association of lighthouse authorities waterways risk assessment program iwrap model where the geometrical collisions and the causation probability are calculated zhang et al 2019 propose a macroscopic collision risk model for assessing regional collision risk which combines density complexity and a multi vessel collision risk operator the model can be used to identify high risk collision risk area and aid implementation of safety measures for improving safety some studies focus on the visualization model of navigation in the water area silveira et al 2013 study the ship collision risk off the coast of portugal based on ais data they propose an algorithm to assess the risk profile and the relative importance of routes where the collision risk is assessed by predicting the future distances between ships shelmerdine 2015 uses ais data to visualize the marine traffic around shetland over 730000 ais data points in 2013 from around shetland were processed analyzed and used to plot several maps of marine traffic such as ais pings map vessel density map vessel track map vessel length map etc these maps are useful for marine environment management and can ensure the navigational safety in marine spatial and development plans chen et al 2015 propose a cross disciplinary quantitative approach to delineate the principal fairways of ship passages in a strait based on space use method in animal ecology compared with previous related studies this approach can provide the information of cumulative activity patterns for vessel groups and has advantage in analyzing directional and seasonal factor for principal fairways by utilizing the proposed approach the analysis of principal fairways can be facilitated by identifying the usage of strait corridors in addition it provides a new way to map the geographical distribution of ship movement over time breithaupt et al 2017 plot ship routes between ports along the atlantic coast of the us by ais data from 2010 to 2012 where the route boundary is delineated by analysis wu et al 2017 map the global ship and traffic density using a very large amount of ais data from 2012 to 2015 the density maps are obtained in different resolutions and can indicate the distribution of ships and traffic yoo 2018 map the near miss density of the water area near korea based on a large amount of ais data in 2014 the near miss situation is judged by some criteria of ship relative motion parameters the map can be used to identify the near miss areas and determine the relative densities of the areas for the purpose of safe navigation and the prevention of ship collisions lensu and goerlandt 2019 combine ais data with marine environment data derived from ice charts and ice drift models and some other ship data to build up an accumulating multi purpose database for the northern baltic sea the purpose of this database is to research for the issues of winter navigation a wide range of winter navigation questions can be addressed such as the influence of ice on ship spatial statistics the relationship between ship speed and the thickness of ice and the analysis of convey table 1 was made to compare these visualization methods in 6 aspects which are the data used the receiving interval of ais message the time period of model the parameters included in the model the indicator of collision risk and the representation degree of collision risk it can be found that all of the listed methods use ais data to visualize maritime traffic but the receiving intervals of ais message are different which range from 10 s to 10 min the shorter the interval the more the message will be received with more message received the results can be more accurate in terms of the time period of model these methods visualize maritime traffic ranging from 1 month to 9 years none of them focus on instantaneous moment although it is very helpful for the analysis of maritime traffic it is hard to apply in real time monitoring most of these visualization methods focus on mapping the traffic density or finding traffic route which can only reflect the risk of collision roughly the parameters considered for mapping traffic density are normally ship position and time stamp which are relatively limited in identifying collision risk although shelmerdine 2015 and lensu and goerlandt 2019 incorporate more parameters most of them are used for maritime traffic analysis and make few contribution to collision risk representation the model in silveira et al 2013 can identify the collision candidates by predicting the future locations of ships in the waters but it is difficult to distinguish the collision risk between collision candidates and obtained exact collision risk values yoo 2018 uses the criteria of near miss to map the risk in the water area compared with density and collision candidates near miss can represent collision risk better however the model can only find the near misses and is not able to give the exact risk value although these methods are effective in visualizing the marine traffic in the water area there are also some limitations for them to represent the collision risk sufficiently and comprehensively such as the receiving interval of ais message the instantaneous identification the factors concerned the accuracy of results the collision risk value calculation etc therefore for overcoming the limitations of the previous studies in collision risk identification also for assisting surveillance operators in the monitoring work to reduce collision risk this paper aimed to propose a novel model for identifying the geographical distribution of collision risk based on radial distribution function utilizing the ais data of very short receiving interval the proposed model can map the dynamic collision risk in the water area for any instantaneous moment visually and accurately it can also help surveillance operators to enhance their working efficiency when monitor the collision risk in the jurisdiction water area 3 the proposed model for identifying the geographical distribution of collision risk 3 1 the foundation of the proposed model in molecular dynamics the bonding status and interaction between particles among the particle system e g atom molecule and colloid can be detected by radial distribution function rdf which is also named as pair correlation function it can identify the variation of density by establishing a function between density and distance for example atoms which are considered as the fundamental constituent particles of molecule pauling 1988 are placed in the molecule in a certain spatial order by bonds an atom in a molecule is surrounded by other atoms by using rdf the density around this atom could be identified which is achieved by calculating the number of atoms at different distances from the central atom as the atoms are placed in a three dimensional space different distances from the central atom could be regarded as different spherical shells with the width of δ r mcquarrie 1976 the radial distribution of an atom can be expressed as the following equation 1 g i r n i r δ r ρ v r δ r where g i r refers to the radial distribution of central atom i at the distance of r from the central atom i n i r δ r refers to the number of atoms in the spherical shell with the width of δ r at the distance of r from the central atom i ρ refers to the density of the molecule and v r δ r refers to the volume of the spherical shell mentioned above after the radial distribution of the central atom i at varying distances is calculated the radial distribution function performed by is made achievable an exemplary graph of the rdf of h2o molecule that contains hydrogen and oxygen atoms is presented in fig 1 the density around atom i at varying distances is indicated by the rdf graph the integral of the rdf curve is applied to quantify the overall density around atom i that is the overall distribution probability of atoms around it the integral is called ligancy coordination number in molecular dynamics it represents the number of atoms directly linked to the central atom in a molecule system international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac 2014 and can represent the compactness of the stacking state of the atoms the higher the ligancy coordination number the tighter the atoms will be the ligancy coordination number of atom i can be expressed as the following equation 2 l i 0 r n i r δ r ρ v r δ r d r where l i refers to the coordination number of atom i 3 2 the rdf model for identifying collision risk in liu et al 2020 rdf is used to identify the dynamic ship density of water area because it can be used to study the density around a particle in molecular dynamics for applying rdf in identifying dynamic ship density the particle system is introduced in ship traffic by converting the ship traffic into a ship traffic molecule system in this system ship traffic is assumed as a molecule and the ships are assumed as constituent particles namely atoms in this paper rdf is used to identify the collision risk around a ship the overall collision risk around a ship is denoted as dynamic collision risk dcr similarly the conversion process should take place to identify the dynamic collision risk of a ship by rdf as shown in fig 2 the whole of ship traffic is assumed as a molecule namely the ship traffic molecule while the ships in the ship traffic are assumed as atoms namely the ship atoms for modeling the density around a particle in a particle system rdf is used to indicate the densities at varying distances from the central particle the distance is regarded as a crucial parameter required for the model the more surrounding particles there are in the adjacent distance the greater the density around the central particle would be for modeling collision risk by rdf collision risk was assumed as a distance in a broader sense in this paper for differing from the distance in liu et al 2020 this distance was named as risk distance it doesn t refer to the distance between two ships but the collision risk between two ships as risk distance is the representation of collision risk the longer the risk distance the larger the collision risk in order to model the collision risk around a central ship atom rdf was used to measure the densities of the surrounding ship atoms in different risk distances as indicated in section 3 1 rdf can be used to identify the density around a particle in this section the density identification application of rdf was introduced to ship traffic because there exists some similarities between a particle system e g a molecule system constituted with atoms and a ship traffic system firstly in terms of static characteristic both a particle system and a ship traffic system are located in a space for a molecule particle system the constituent particle is atom the atoms are located in a three dimensional space with certain spatial arrangement pauling 1988 for a ship traffic system the constituent element is ship the ships are also located in a space with certain spatial arrangement secondly in terms of dynamic characteristic both constituent particle in a particle system and constituent element in a ship traffic system are moving constantly through space for a particle system molecules and atoms are moving with certain kinetic energy and potential energy through space hogan 2016 for a ship traffic system ships are moving with their power through space thirdly distance plays a crucial role in both systems as indicated in section 3 1 distance is the most important factor in using rdf to identify the density around a certain particle because rdf is built up with the distribution of particles based on distance and it judges the distribution status around a particle for a ship traffic system distance is also an important parameter it can influence ship density which is a basic metric of ship traffic to describe the traffic situation in aspects of crowdedness and busyness of ship generally the smaller the distance the greater the ship density and the more crowded and busy the ship traffic distance can also represent the collision risk between ships in a ship traffic system with a negative correlation lisowski 2001 in addition the analogy between a particle system and a ship traffic system has been conducted in previous studies of marine traffic molecule is introduced to establish the molecular collision theory fujii and shiobara 1971 macduff 1974 pedersen 1995 which is a widely used method to identify the collision risk in ship traffic for these reasons we wish to assume the ship traffic system as a particle system in this paper in order to apply rdf to identify some features of ship traffic to be specific identify the collision risk in ship traffic although some similarities exist between a particle system and a ship traffic system as mentioned above there are also some differences between them in terms of a normal particle system the constituent particles are ordered in the three dimensional space however ship traffic is formed on the surface of the water so the ship traffic molecule system should be considered as a particle system which is arranged in two dimensional space the calculating process related to the volume of spherical shell should be converted into the area of circular ring therefore the dynamic collision risk namely the overall collision risk around a ship can be expressed as the following equation 3 d c r i 0 r n i r δ r α ρ s r δ r d r 0 r n i r δ r s 2 α n π r δ r d r where d c r i refers to the dynamic collision risk of ship i s r δ r refers to the area of circular ring with the width of δ r at the distance of r and it is a replacement of v r δ r in a normal particle system arranged in the three dimensional space α is an adjusting coefficient which was used to fix the result in a relatively small interval if α was not included in the equation the values of the integrand would be very big which are difficult to handle in the proposed model in this paper the value of α is taken as the number of ships n in the studied area referred to liu et al 2020 it can fix the values of integrand to a relatively small interval and make the computing more efficient r refers to the upper integral interval which is set as 1 according to the research of collision risk index in automatic collision avoidance namely the maximum value of risk distance n i r δ r is similar to that in eq 1 which refers to the number of particles at certain risk distance in a ship traffic molecule system it refers to the number of ships in the circular ring with the width of δ r at the risk distance of r from the central ship which can be obtained by algorithm 1 in fig 3 the key parameters in algorithm 1 are explaining and showing in algorithm 1 r m a x refers to the maximum risk distance as the collision risk index between two ships are considered as between 0 and 1 according to the research of automatic collision avoidance zhen et al 2017 the value of r m a x was assumed as 1 n b refers to the bins divided for the risk distance generally it can be 100 to divide the risk distance into 100 bins and r b refers to the risk distance of each bin in line 4 c r i j refers to the collision risk index between ship i and j c r i j is the function to obtain the collision risk index as collision risk was assumed as risk distance the collision risk index between two ships should be calculated in order to obtain the risk distance between them there are many methods to calculate collision risk index namely the risk distance between two ships such as analytical method zhen et al 2017 fuzzy logic method goerlandt et al 2015 and etc in this paper the method in liu et al 2019 was adopted to calculate the risk distance between two ships which is composed of the collision risk of dcpa tcpa and ship domain overlapping index sdoi i n d e x refers to the tag of the bin after the calculation in line 6 and 7 ships are divided into different bins and n i r δ r of different bins can be obtained namely at different risk distances c r i j can be obtained by algorithm 2 in algorithm 2 l o n g i and l o n g j refer to the longitude of ship i and ship j l a t i and l a t j refer to the latitude of ship i and ship j c i and c j refer to the course of ship i and ship j v i v j refers to the speed of ship i and ship j l i and l j refer to the length of ship i and ship j similar to liu et al 2019 namely regional collision risk model the proposed model is also a model of collision risk but there are many differences between them firstly regional collision risk model is to identify the entire collision risk of certain water area which is a collision risk of macroscopic perspective the proposed model is to map the geographical distribution of collision risk which should be obtained by calculating the collision risk of every single location in the water area it is a collision risk of microscopic perspective secondly the methods used in the two models are different in regional collision risk model spatial clustering algorithm and shapley value method are used in the proposed model the methods used are rdf in molecular dynamic and spatial interpolation technique thirdly the applications of the two models are different regional collision risk model can help maritime surveillance operators recognize the collision risk level of certain water area by an exact collision risk value the proposed model can help them understand the distribution of collision risk by a heatmap visually the only similarity between the two models is to use dcpa tcpa and sdoi to calculate the collision risk between two ships however it serves to different purpose in each of the two models therefore regional collision risk model and the proposed model can be considered two completely different models table 2 was given to show the differences between the two models in the proposed model dcpa tcpa and sdoi were used to calculate risk distance namely the collision risk index between two ships which is expressed as c r i j mentioned above c r i j is the key value to calculate n i r δ r namely the number of ships at certain risk distance in algorithm 1 and n i r δ r is a crucial parameter in the dcr formula an rdf graph for an exemplary ship atom is shown in fig 4 by integrating the rdf graph d c r i can be obtained and it can represent the overall collision risk around ship i for highlighting the collision risk the integral interval was adjusted this is because a lot of low collision risks will be included in the risk distance between 0 and 0 2 if the integrand is integrated from 0 to 1 like eq 3 and the accuracy of the results will be affected seriously therefore the lower bound of the integral interval should be adjusted to a bigger value in order to neglect the influence of those low collision risks in the water area the integration is expressed as follows 4 d c r i r 1 r 2 n i r δ r α ρ s r δ r d r r 1 r 2 n i r δ r s 2 α n π r δ r d r where r 1 and r 2 refer to the two bounds of the integral interval r 1 is the lower bound of this adjusted interval the value of r 1 was recommended to take the value between 0 2 and 0 5 because the collision risks higher than 0 5 are generally few the exact value of the lower integral bound should be determined according to the characteristic of the water area r 2 is the upper bound of the adjusted interval it remains same as upper integral bound in eq 3 which is 1 namely the maximum value of risk distance d c r i refers to the dynamic collision risk of ship i the result of d c r i is an integral value because the integral of rdf in a particle system can represent ligancy coordination number which can describe the overall density of the system to be specific d c r i can be obtained by algorithm 3 after calculating all d c r i in a ship traffic molecule the space interpolation technique can be utilized to create the geographical distribution map of d c r in this paper spline interpolation technique was channeled into interpolating the discrete d c r points in different locations to a continuous d c r surface it can produce a smooth curve passing through discrete data points with variable splines hall and meyer 1976 the d c r can provide assistances to maritime surveillance operators in order to monitor the collision risk in the water area compared with collision near misses happen more often in the traffic reality hence it is necessary to investigate the role of near misses play in the proposed model near miss refers to a situation that there is the danger of collision between ships approaching each other but with no collision eventually occurring reason 2016 in other words near miss can be considered as a pre collision state with the collision risk to some extent the proposed model maps the collision risk distribution in the water area based on risk distance namely the collision risk index between any two ships collision risk index can measure the degree of collision risk from 0 to 1 where 0 means no collision risk at all and 1 means the happening of collision near miss which is treated as a pre collision state with the collision risk to some extent is supposed to be within this interval indicated by collision risk index therefore near miss can be considered to be contained by the proposed model as near miss is included in the proposed model the proposed model can also map the geographical distribution of near miss if the near miss threshold condition was given for example in yoo 2018 the threshold condition of near miss is presented as d c p a 0 1 nm t c p a 3 min and d i s t a n c e 0 3 nm based on this threshold condition a threshold collision risk index can be calculated by collision risk index model kearon 1977 after setting the obtained value of collision risk index as r 1 in eq 4 which is the lower integral bound of dcr modeling the proposed model can map the geographical distribution of near miss in the water area it can be considered as a specific use of the proposed model 4 case study for illustrating and validating the proposed model the real ais data of the ships sailing in bohai strait of china was applied in this study to carry out experiments as the busiest water area in northern china the studied water area consists of east bohai sea and north yellow sea as shown in fig 5 it is a necessity to pass through this water area for the trade conducted between some major ports around bohai sea such as tianjin qinhuangdao yingkou and other locations in addition bohai strait is ranked as one of the largest straits in china which has a relatively large amount of traffic liu et al 2016 the busy water area creates a favorable condition for the formation of collision risk between ships geographically the studied water area is positioned between 38 0 n and 38 6 n 120 95 e and 122 5 e the ais data is dated july 2nd 2018 to illustrate and validate the proposed model the source ais data was decoded besides the information on position speed course dimension of ships time and mmsi were extracted to prevent the temporal discreteness of ais data the extracted ais data was treated by interpolation to obtain the information of the exact same time on top of that the ais data was processed by removing anomaly messages firstly the proposed model was used to establish the dynamic collision risk map based on three different moments these moments are 1600 1700 and 1800 on july 2nd 2018 which are relatively adjacent in time these maps are shown as heatmaps which range from 0 to 1 in collision risk the redder the color is the greater the collision risk will be these three maps are shown in fig 6 it is observed that the water area with relatively high collision risk higher than 0 5 distributes from the northwest to the southeast in the dynamic collision risk map in order to demonstrate the validity of the map the ship trajectory map of the studied water area was drawn for comparison as shown in fig 7 the ship trajectory map was drawn by the ais data from 1600 on july 2nd 2018 to 1600 on july 3rd 2018 this 24 h ship trajectory map could indicate the status of the traffic flows in this studied water area such as the direction of the traffic flows and the intersection of the traffic flows by observing this ship trajectory map the water area which with higher collision risk can be inferred such as the water area with denser trajectories or the water area intersected by two or more traffic flows the water area with denser trajectories could indicate that the traffic volume in this water area is relatively big and easier to form the complicated traffic situation and increase collision risk the water area intersected by two or more traffic flows is much easier to form the complicated situation because all of the encountering types can be formed in this water area therefore this ship trajectory map was used to compare with the proposed dynamic collision risk map it can be seen from the ship trajectory map that there are two main traffic flows in this water area one is from the northwest to the southeast and the other one is from the north to the south these two traffic flows correspond to the two main routes in bohai strait which are the northwest southeast route to enter or exit bohai sea and the north south route to travel between the ports in liaoning province and shandong province most of the ships in this water area sail in these two routes between them the northwest southeast route is much busier and much denser in the ship trajectory map because it connects between the ports around bohai sea and the ports all over the world with such busy traffic the collision risk in this water area would certainly be higher which is the same as the indication of proposed dynamic collision risk map therefore it can be proved that the higher collision risk area shown by fig 6 is well matched with the reality of the traffic indicated by the ship trajectory map it should be noticed that the ship traffic in the ship trajectory map can only indicate the collision risk roughly from the trajectory map we can only observe the locations where ships gathered but the exact collision risk value of such locations cannot be obtained in other words any points in the traffic intersections part of the ship trajectory map seems same the collision risk values of these points cannot be distinguished even the geographical distribution therefore establishing a model which can identify the exact collision risk value is necessary to be specific if the proposed model was adopted the exact collision risk value around the traffic intersection area can be obtained for example calculating by the proposed model the most dangerous location around the traffic intersection area at 1600 on july 2nd 2018 is around 38 18 n 121 77 e where the collision risk value is 0 7755 in addition the geographical distribution can be obtained by the proposed model as shown in fig 6 a it is hard for the ship trajectory map to find this location and the collision risk value and map the geographical distribution accident data can also be used for the validation of the proposed model according to the annual report on maritime accidents 2017 2018 of liaoning maritime safety administration laotieshan waterway is the one of the most concerned regions in the water area because it has largest number of accidents except the near port area and the accident consequence are often severe liaoning maritime safety administration lnmsa 2017 2018 han et al 2018 collect maritime accidents data over the last 15 years and also indicates that the region around laotieshan waterway is the most dangerous region besides the region near port this conclusion is also drawn by peng 2013 which conducts a research on the maritime accidents of dalian jurisdiction water area the laotieshan waterway mentioned above is marked in the three sub figures in fig 6 it can be observed that this region does have relatively high collision risk which is consistent with the pattern of maritime accident data for further proving that the proposed model can represent the collision risk accurately near miss and average collision risk index cri were adopted as collision risk indicators compared with accident data which is a statistical data of long term near miss and average cri are more suitable for the validation because they can represent the risk of collision instantaneously which is consistent with the characteristic of the proposed model in the water area shown by fig 6 three separate regions were selected in each sub figure the range of each region is 0 15 0 15 these regions are featured with different collision risks which can easily observed from the heatmap for each of the region the number of near miss and the average cri were calculated the near miss data was calculated based on the threshold conditions presented in yoo 2018 for the purpose of comparison the threshold for judging near miss situation was lowered the original thresholds for dcpa tcpa and distance are relatively strict if these thresholds were adopted there would be very less even no near miss situation for a single moment the average cri was calculated based on the traditional cri model in kearon 1977 the related results are shown in table 3 it can be observed that there is an obvious relationship between the collision risk indicated by heatmap and the number of near miss and the average cri of the regions selected in each scenario for the regions of relatively high collision risk indicated by heatmap such as region a 1 and a 2 in the first scenario the near misses and the average cri are also relatively high compared with the low risk region such as region a 3 for further illustrating and validating proposed dynamic collision risk map two of the dynamic collision risk maps as shown above were chosen they are the dynamic collision risk map of 1700 and 1800 dated july 2nd 2018 for each of them the studied water area is split into three parts which stretch from 121 0 e to 121 5 e from 121 5 e to 122 0 e and from 122 0 e to 122 5 e respectively these parts are denoted as area 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 2 and 2 3 respectively as shown in fig 8 it is revealed by fig 8 a that the water area with a relatively higher collision risk is located in area 1 1 and area 1 2 in order to verify the map the ship density in these three parts of the map was calculated ship density is defined as the number of ships per unit area for a moment wu et al 2017 it can indicate the degree of crowding and the risk of collision wen et al 2015 the greater the ship density is the higher the collision risk would be in addition the number of near miss and the average cri were also used for the comparison of the results the related results in these three parts is shown in table 4 it can be found out that the ship density in area 1 1 and area 1 2 is significantly higher than in area 1 3 suggesting that the collision risk in area 1 1 and area 1 2 is relatively higher to some extent the number of near miss and the average cri of area 1 1 and area 1 2 are also higher than that in area 1 3 this is consistent with the high collision risk area as indicated by the proposed dynamic collision risk map shown in fig 8 a similarly the ship density near miss number and average cri in the three parts of the second map were also calculated and the results are shown in table 5 it is found that the ship density in area 2 1 and area 2 2 performs much higher than that in area 2 3 which indicates that the collision risk in these two areas is relatively higher to some extent the number of near miss and the average cri of area 2 1 and area 2 2 are also higher than that in area 2 3 it is also in accordance with the high collision risk area indicated by the proposed dynamic collision risk map shown in fig 8 b therefore it can be proved that the proposed dynamic collision risk map can reflect the overall geographical distribution of collision risk in water area effectively and reasonably 5 discussion this paper proposed a novel model to identify the geographical distribution of collision risk based on rdf in molecular dynamics assuming that the ship traffic is a molecule and ships are constituent atoms the rdf model was downgraded from three dimension to two dimension when modeling collision risk an analytical method was applied to obtain the collision risk between each ship pair which was generalized as distance in rdf model at last the space interpolation technique was utilized to map the collision risk in the water area the rdf based dynamic collision risk map can identify the geographical distribution of collision risk in the water area instantaneously by inputting the real time dynamic information extracted from ais data such as position speed course dimension etc into the model the dynamic collision risk map of the water area can be drawn it can identify the instantaneous geographical distribution of collision risk in the water area and report the high collision risk area to the surveillance operators in order to assist them in their monitoring work compared with the traditional method in mapping collision risk in the water area the proposed model has advantage in instantaneous collision risk identification and can better assist the surveillance operators in the real time monitoring work additionally the proposed model can provide more accurate results of collision risk as indicated in table 1 there are many visualization methods of maritime traffic in terms of representing collision risk the methods in shelmerdine 2015 chen et al 2015 breithaupt et al 2017 wu et al 2017 and lensu and goerlandt 2019 belong to the same kind which use traffic density to indicate the risk of collision this kind of methods can only map collision risk roughly high traffic density can indicate that there are more ships in the water area which may form the risk of collision easier however high traffic density does not necessarily mean the risk of collision is high it can only reflect collision risk to some extent the mapping of traffic density is very similar to the ship trajectory map in fig 7 from the map the regions of high density can be observed these regions may feature with relatively high collision risk however it is just a rough estimation and the exact value cannot be obtained from such map in silveira et al 2013 collision candidates are used to map the collision risk off the coast of portugal in this method the future position of ships are predicted for 20 min the future distance between any two ships is compared with the geometrical collision diameter defined by pedersen 1995 if the future distance is less than the geometrical collision diameter the ships are considered as collision candidates in order to contrast this method to the proposed model we used this method to map the collision risk of the studied water area of 1600 on july 2nd 2018 for better displaying the collision risk the criteria of the geometrical collision diameter was relatively loosened the map is shown in fig 9 it can be found that the collision candidates are clearly showed in the studied water area compared with traffic density collision candidates can represent collision risk more sufficiently however it is difficult to distinguish the collision risks of these collision candidates in the map at an instantaneous moment in addition the exact collision risk values of the collision candidates are not obtained the proposed dynamic collision risk map for the same moment is shown in fig 6 a it is easy to observe the difference in collision risk between different locations in addition the exact collision risk values can be obtained behind the map yoo 2018 proposes a near miss density map for the safe navigation of ships in the sea off the south coast of korea near miss refers to a circumstance where there is a real danger of collision risk between the approaching ships reason 2016 which can be used to represent collision risk compared with traffic density and collision candidates near miss is a more suitable metric to represent collision risk instantaneously for visualization of the near miss map a large amount of data for 1 year period is used the threshold of dcpa tcpa and distance is set to judge the occurrence of near miss the data of a relative long period applied to map the collision risk is helpful for analyzing the general state of collision risk in the water area for example to identify the common high collision risk area sum up the ship type involved in near miss etc however it is relatively limited for identifying the real time geographical distribution of collision risk and plays only a limited role in assisting surveillance operators with the real time monitoring in addition despite such crucial parameters as dcpa tcpa and distance used to judge the scenario of near miss situation it is unlikely to further identify the exact collision risk value for distinguishing between the situations which means all of the near miss scenarios are considered as the same sort of emergency therefore the collision risk in the water area is hindered from being represented accurately and sufficiently one example is the studied water area referred to in section 3 the dynamic collision risk map of 1600 dated july 2nd 2018 in fig 6 a was chosen for the comparison drawn between the proposed model and the near miss density map to facilitate such a comparison the threshold applied to judge near miss situation was lowered the original threshold set for dcpa tcpa and distance is relatively higher if these thresholds were adopted there would be few or even no near miss scenarios for a single moment the near miss density map for this moment is shown in fig 10 it can be found out that the proposed dynamic collision risk map is accurate in identifying the geographical distribution of collision risk across the studied water area through a heatmap at 1600 dated july 2nd 2018 in comparison the near miss map is limited to identifying the near miss points of approaching ships by marking them in the map with all of the near miss points appearing identical thus rendering the collision risk of each point indistinguishable also the exact collision risk values cannot be obtained by the near miss map it is demonstrated that the traditional near miss density map is restricted not only in the instantaneous identification of collision risk but also in obtaining the precise collision risk value which is an issue that can be addressed by the dynamic collision risk map proposed in this paper compared with the model in liu et al 2020 namely dynamic density model the model in this paper has the following differences firstly rdf in dynamic density model is mainly used to model ship or traffic density which is a basic measurement of traffic situation in marine traffic however rdf in this paper was not used to model the density any more it was used to identify the collision risk in water area which refers to the possibility of collision accident this is the fundamental difference between the models in two papers secondly the key parameter distance in the two models are different in dynamic density model distance is what it literally means which refers to the amount of space between two things stevenson 2010 namely the amount of space between two ships in this paper although the name distance was used again to build up the rdf model it no longer means the amount of space between two ships it is a distance in a broader sense which represent the collision risk between two ships therefore it was named as risk distance in this paper in order to differ from the distance in dynamic density model thirdly according to the second difference some characteristics of the distance parameters in the two models are different in dynamic density model distance is located in a general plane the space amount between two points on this plane is calculated from the spatial location i e longitude latitude of two points however in the proposed model risk distance is located in a collision risk plane the space amount between two points on this plane is collision risk and is calculated from the collision risk factors i e dcpa tcpa sdoi table 6 is given in order to better show the differences between the two models for obtaining the dynamic collision risk map the proposed model needs to go through the following steps as shown in fig 11 our operating environment is intel r core tm i5 3210m cpu 2 50 ghz 8 00 gb ram the first step is the ais data processing step in this step the ais message should be decoded and extracted at first we decoded ais source messages and stored the ais data in a database however for the application on a real time scenario as the shore based ais of maritime vessel traffic control can receive and decode ais message in real time the time required to decode and extract can be ignored after extracting the needed ais data from the database it should be interpolated to obtain the ship information required for the proposed model in the exact same time because the ais data is not continuous in time and presents different receiving intervals for different ships as mentioned in section 4 the interpolation process should take 0 4231 s on our operating environment the second step is the risk distance calculating step namely the step to calculate the collision risk index in this step the collision risk index between any two ships in the studied area are calculated take the experiment of fig 6 a as example there are 89 ships in the studied area the collision risk index between any two ships of these 89 ships can be calculated through algorithm 2 and it takes 0 9328 s on our operating environment the last step is the dynamic collision risk mapping step in this step the risk distance namely the collision risk index obtained in the second step is used to calculate the key parameter n i r δ r at first by algorithm 1 and then the dynamic collision risk can be mapped based on rdf and spatial interpolation technique this step takes 3 1001 s on our operating environment therefore the whole process of obtaining the dynamic collision risk map should take 4 4560 s for maritime vessel traffic control to apply the proposed model on a real time scenario this time can be further shortened due to the advanced hardware and operating environment it should be noticed that the steps mentioned above is conducted respectively on our operating environment the time will also be shortened if an integrated and optimized software is made to incorporate these steps through the dynamic collision risk map maritime surveillance operator in vessel traffic control can learn the geographical distribution of collision risk in the water area it can make them recognize the region of high risk which has high change of the happening of collision accident and provide them a chance to judge the collision risk in the water area in advance apart from the region of high risk the map can also indicate the regions of sub high risk which has a probability of the happening of collision accident and keep them maintain vigilance maritime surveillance operators can comprehend the collision risk distribution in the water area rapidly and visually through the proposed dynamic collision risk map and keep the priority of the collision risk region in mind which is helpful for them to target on the high risk region quickly the map can enhance their working efficiency when monitor the collision risk in the water area the enhancement in other words the time saved depends on their experience and knowledge it can also release their recognizing pressure in monitoring and avoid the work fault due to subjectivity and randomness of monitoring and the complexity of maritime traffic in sum the proposed dynamic collision risk map can help to obtain the geographical distribution of collision risk in the water area rapidly and quickly and learn the priority of the collision risk area it is helpful to recognize the region of high chance of the happening of collision accidents efficiently save the time of monitoring and release the recognizing pressure which can benefit the decision support subsequently and make contribution to the improvement of maritime traffic safety 6 conclusion herein a novel model to identify the geographical distribution of collision risk in the water area was proposed which is based on radial distribution function in molecular dynamics by using the proposed model the dynamic collision risk map for the water area can be depicted for modeling the collision risk through radial distribution function ship traffic was converted into a molecule system by assuming ship traffic as molecule and assuming ships as constituent atoms the three dimension radial distribution function model was converted into two dimensional to adapt the characteristic of ship traffic the collision risk was generalized as distance in the radial distribution function model and was obtained in an analytical method finally a space interpolation technique was utilized to map the dynamic collision risk of the water area in order to verify the validity of the proposed model experiments were carried out by using the ais data of bohai strait the proposed map was also compared with the traditional method in identifying the geographical distribution of collision risk it reveals that the proposed map could identify the geographical distribution of collision risk effectively and reasonably show its advantages in identifying instantaneous collision risk distribution and can provide more accurate results surveillance operators can be better supported in their monitoring work of collision risk by utilizing the proposed dynamic collision risk map thus enhancing the safety of navigation however the proposed model still has some limitations which should be researched further the proposed model is relatively limited under the situation that there are only very fey ships in the water area in this case the results may be influenced by the number of ships and the geographical distribution shown on the map may not be clear enough this kind of problem can be overcome by using the proposed model combined with microscopic collision risk identification method in addition the proposed model only took some crucial parameters of ship motion into consideration when modeling collision risk some other factors like ship maneuverability weather condition regulations in the water area can be considered into the model in order to further improve the accuracy of the map in the future studies credit authorship contribution statement zihao liu conceptualization methodology software validation formal

21457,wave impact tests are carried out for a vertical wall with overhanging horizontal cantilever slab in a flume with the scale factor of 1 30 by setting various incoming wave conditions and structural elevations different influences of wave height wave period and clearance on the wave impulse and characteristic pressure are investigated with the increasing of structural clearance both wave impulse and characteristic pressure for cantilever slab and vertical wall show a firstly increasing and then decreasing trend and reach the peak when clearance close to zero and 0 2 times wave height respectively besides bigger wave steepness can induce larger wave impulse and characteristic pressure for the vertical wall the relation between characteristic pressure and rise time present a smaller scatter and has the almost similarity to that of impact pressure and rise time furthermore a positive correlation between wave impulse and total duration is observed and the larger characteristic pressure is always corresponded to the bigger wave impulse all the findings presented here may be used for future research as well as predesign keywords wave impulse characteristic pressure structural clearance rise time total duration 1 introduction in past decades various oceanic and coastal structures have been built up for marine economy development and coastal protection however the severe failure of oceanic and coastal structures is not uncommon especially under the storm or hurricane weather which induces wave loads to exceed the capacity of structures mazinani et al 2015 seiffert et al 2015 hayatdavoodi et al 2016 some researches pointed out that the sea level would arise by 0 72 m influenced by global warming which further increases the occurrence probability and intensity of extreme natural phenomenon such as storm surge and typhoon jongman and ward 2012 nicholls et al 2018 meanwhile as the global population increases it has been estimated that the population of coastal areas would increase to 122 by 2060 neumann et al 2015 in view of this it is important and necessary to further understand the wave impacting on oceanic and coastal structures such as wharf breakwater and revetment the earliest study on wave loads can be dated back to 19 century when stevenson 1874 firstly measured the wave pressure of vertical seawall by load cells after then vertical structures have been widely used in the coastal protection and more and more scholars began to focus on the characteristic of wave loads on vertical structures from qualitatively to quantitatively bagnold 1939 and mitsuyasu 1967 carried out the physical model tests and found the importance of wave s breaking condition breaking or non breaking on the measured wave pressure later hull and müller 2002 also pointed out the resulting wave pressures are dependent on various wave shapes according to different wave breaking shapes four main breaker types of incoming waves have been suggested these are turbulent bore well developed plunging breaker plunging breaker and upward deflected breaker oumeraci et al 1993 despite scholars have given out various classification standards of breaker types kirkgöz 1995 obhrai et al 2005 bullock et al 2007 hofland et al 2011 hu et al 2017 streicher et al 2019 the core idea is that with the evolution of wave from no breaking to broken the volume of trapped air between wave surface and structure changes gradually correspondingly inducing different types of wave impact hull and müller 2002 obhrai et al 2005 hofland et al 2011 and hu et al 2017 pointed out that the largest wave pressure occurs when the breaking wave traps a very thin pocket of air called flip through in order to estimate wave loads on structures goda 1974 conducted a series of wave physical model tests and summarized the classical calculated formula of wave pressure cuomo et al 2010 performed the large scale model test and expanded calculated formulas of wave pressure and wave force respectively after the heavy failures of coastal bridges during extreme storm events mazinani et al 2015 hayatdavoodi et al 2016 such as hurricane katrina striking the coasts of alabama mississippi and louisiana the need for research on wave loads on horizontal structures are increasing cuomo et al 2007 found the quasi static impact and impulse impact in the horizontal structure and proposed calculated formulas of wave pressure based on experimental results by reproducing the wave impacting on the coastal bridges in a wave basin cuomo et al 2009 emphasized the dynamic behavior of the wave impact as well as the effect of air on the wave in deck loads based on the same experiment serinaldi and cuomo 2011 further gave out the relation between maximum pressure and rise times meanwhile chen et al 2016 generated tsunami bores by the mean of dam break and investigated the influence of bore height deck height and slope angle on uplift loads park et al 2017 payed more attention on elevated structure and pointed out that both horizontal and vertical wave loads should be considered during preliminary design moideen et al 2019 used reef3d to study the effect of girder spacing on the wave impact on coastal bridge deck and concluded that the existing girder could enlarge the wave loads on the deck adversely to the previous problem of a simple vertical wall or a horizontal structures a combined structure consisting of both a vertical and a horizontal part has began to be considered and applied practically kisacik et al 2012a 2012b 2014 carried out a series of wave model tests of a vertical structure with an overhanging horizontal cantilever slab and have made a comprehensive research similar to oumeraci et al 1993 kisacik et al described four wave breaker types based on the model test record according to different breaker types wave impact pressures on the vertical structure as well as the horizontal slab were analyzed systematically besides considering different influences of wave height wave period and clearance height on the pressure and total force a series of corrected empirical formulas based on the scale test results were given out by reviewing previous researches it can be known that a number of results and conclusions for horizontal and vertical structures have been given out besides kisacik et al have presented some new findings about the vertical wall with cantilever slab however there is still the structural failure of such combined structure under wave attack reported in italy castellino et al 2018 which reveals there are still some problems need to be studied further admittedly wave pressure has a significant randomness cuomo et al 2010 kisacik et al 2012 marzeddu et al 2017 and it is suggested that the wave impulse which is the integration of wave pressure along time has a much better repeatability and predictability bagnold 1939 bullock et al 2007 hofland et al 2011 chen et al 2019 thus different from kisacik et al who mainly cared about the wave pressure on the vertical wall with overhanging horizontal cantilever slab the present study pays more attention to the characteristic of wave impulse on a vertical wall with cantilever slab meanwhile by setting up different incoming wave conditions and structural clearance the effect of such variable factors on wave impulse are also given out finally the relations between wave impulse and duration are investigated as well this paper is structured as follows in section 1 review of wave impact on marine structure is presented in section 2 a detail introduction of experimental setup is given including physical model setup and measured devices in section 3 methods of data processing are introduced then in section 4 experimental observations and results discussion are given the influences of wave height wave length and structural clearance on wave impulse and characteristic pressure are highlighted relations between wave loads and time are given out finally conclusions useful for design purposes are drawn in section 5 2 experimental setup 2 1 physical model setup in the flume physical model tests have been carried out in a wave flume 80 m 1 m 1 5 m of hohai university china the piston type wave maker assembly is designated in fig 1 and specified as the origin for wave generation x 0 00 m both regular and irregular waves can be generated by the hydraulic actuator assembly of the wave maker which is equipped with an active wave absorption system for reflected wave the water flume is separated into two parts by a glass plate located along the axis of the water flume one part is used to setup the physical model and the other part is empty the physical model is located 50 m away from the wave paddle and a scale factor of 1 30 based on the froude number similarity is adopted to ensure correct reproduction of all wave processes the scaled structure model is consisted of 0 65 m high hm vertical wall and 0 50 m long lm overhanging horizontal cantilever slab in order to prevent the wave overtopping occurring an additional 0 35 m high hm vertical plate is setup on the front edge of the overhanging horizontal cantilever slab the entire physical model is rigid which is built from plexiglass although the overhanging horizontal cantilever slab seems to connected with the vertical wall both of them are separated in which the overhanging horizontal cantilever slab is connected with a steel frame which can shift vertically while the vertical wall is fixed on the bottom of the water flume by using the clump weight as shown in fig 2 and fig 3 when the wave is generated and passing forward a certain distance the wave is correspondingly separated into two parts by the glass plate in which one part impacts on the physical model while the other part transmits directly through the flume and is finally eliminated by the absorbed layer at the end of the flume by dissipating part of the incoming wave energy the cross sloshing problem in the water flume can be reduced to some extend more details about physical model and water flume can be seen in figs 1 figs 2 and 3 2 2 wave conditions instrument and methods wave elevation is recorded by capacitance wave gauges dj800 made from china institute of water resources and hydropower research as shown in fig 1 and significant wave height h s and peak period t p are used for irregular wave irregular waves are generated using the jonswap spectrum with γ 3 3 in order to ensure the accuracy and representation of irregular wave model tests the duration of each irregular wave case is determined by requiring at least 100 waves for each trial based on the expected wave peak period the water depth d is always 0 50 m and the clearance c between overhanging horizontal cantilever slab and still water level can be changed by shifting the steel frame vertically which is connected with the overhanging horizontal cantilever slab when the overhanging horizontal cantilever slab is above the still water level the clearance c is defined as positive while the negative clearance represents the overhanging horizontal cantilever slab below the still water level as shown in dash lines of fig 2 according to the wave peak period t p the corresponding wave length has been calculated and all test conditions are summarized in table 1 moreover in order to record wave pressures at the same time 20 pressure sensors wms 51p2j0l2m0 made from xi an microsensitive instrument and meter co ltd are adopted to measure the local wave pressure for all wave trials the natural frequency of pressure sensors is 80000 hz and has no significant effect on the pressure measuring all the pressure sensors are installed at different parts of the structure such as overhanging horizontal cantilever slab p s 1 p s 8 and vertical wall p s 9 p s 20 the sampling rate of pressure sensors is 5000 hz and that of wave gauges is 100 hz specific locations of pressure sensors as well as wave gauges can be seen in fig 2 and table 2 2 3 data processing wave pressures of different parts are synchronously recorded by pressure sensors there is a surge of pressure reading recorded when the wave first touch the sensors on the base of ensuring the accuracy a medfilt1 function from matlab 2016b has been adopted to pretreat the original data fig 4 a presents the original and treated data together from which it can be seen that the surge problem has been solved properly fig 4 b shows a typical time series of wave pressure in which a relative larger impact load with short duration is followed by a relative smaller quasi static load with long duration as described in previous researches oumeraci et al 1993 cuomo et al 2009 kisacik et al 2014 chen et al 2019 in order to analyze the characteristic of impact load the wave load is separated into impact load and quasi static load respectively by using continuous 1 d wavelet transform cwt fig 5 b shows the frequency domain corresponding to the wave pressure in fig 5 a after setting up a specific cut off frequency as shown in fig 5 b and using the inverse continuous 1 d wavelet transform icwt the signal of high frequency region can be transformed into impact load while that of low frequency region can be transformed into quasi static load fig 6 plots reconstructed quasi static loads with cut off frequency f c 4 hz and f c 8 hz it can be seen that quasi static loads with cut off frequencies of 4 hz blue solid line and 8 hz green solid line match each other well for the first two wave impacts with the lower impact characteristic however in terms of the later five wave impacts which has a significantly higher impact component using the cut off frequency of 4 hz eliminates quite a lot the quasi static loads while that of f c 8 hz can match the quasi static component of original wave loads well it can be concluded that both cut off frequencies of 4 hz and 8 hz are effective to separate the dynamic and quasi static loads for wave impact with lower impact components while the cut off frequency of 8 hz is much better for wave impact with higher impact components thus the choice of adopting cut off frequency at 8 hz to separate the quasi static load and the impact load is more reasonable and adoptable as for an example fig 7 presents the reconstructed impact load and the corresponding quasi static load in the figure the maximum value of impact load is defined as impact pressure p im and the maximum value of quasi static load is defined as quasi static pressure p qs agreed well with previous researches oumeraci and kortenhaus 1994 wood et al 2000 cuomo et al 2010 kisacik et al 2014 chen et al 2019 the impact load is approximately distributed in a triangle along the wave impact duration as shown in the shadow both of figs 7 a and fig 8 a in order to further investigate the relation between wave loads and impact time as shown in fig 8 the time interval between t1 and t2 is defined as the rise time t r and that between t1 and t3 is defined as the total duration t d in which t2 is the moment corresponding to the impact pressure p im for defining t1 and t3 the threshold value is adopted as 1 of impact pressure p im besides the wave impulse i im is defined as the time integral of the wave pressure over the total duration t d as shown in figs 7 a and fig 8 and the ratio between wave impulse i im and total duration t d is further defined as characteristic pressure p cha which can be referred to fig 8 b and calculated by eq 1 as follow 1 p c h a i i m t d t 0 t t d p t d t t d where p cha is the characteristic pressure i im is the wave impulse t d is the total duration of wave impact during one wave period p t is the wave pressure changed with time 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 time series of pressure of different positions fig 9 shows the recording of measured pressures on different positions under incoming wave attack sensors 1 to 8 are located on the bottom of overhanging horizontal cantilever slab and sensors 9 to 20 are located on the vertical wall particularly sensors 9 to 11 are above the still water level while that 12 to 20 are below the still water level correspondingly fig 10 displays the whole wave impact process in 3 photos it can be noted that the initial wave impact occurs on the upper position of vertical wall at t1 267 74s as shown in fig 10 a then the impact pressure quickly shifts downwards from the original attacking point and induces the second wave impact on the lower part of vertical wall at t2 267 76s due to the blocking of vertical wall the incoming wave would induce an up rush jet which causes a significant third wave impact on the connected corner between cantilever slab and vertical wall at t3 267 83s referred to fig 10 b after that such up rush jet turns into horizontal jet flowing along the bottom of cantilever slab and finally transmits to the outer edge of cantilever slab at t4 267 91s as shown in fig 10 c according to the length of cantilever slab as well as the time interval between t3 and t4 the averaged velocity of the horizontal jet can be evaluated at 6 25 m s 3 2 effect of clearance on wave loads of overhanging horizontal cantilever slab upward wave impact beneath the horizontal cantilever slab results in a significant uplift load as mentioned in the research of park et al 2017 loads on an elevated coastal structure will change depending on the structure s elevation above or below the still water level thus the structural clearance has a crucial effect on the wave load of overhanging horizontal cantilever slab similar to wave height the wave load acting on structure can be analyzed by using different definitions for a characteristic wave load several characteristic pressures have been considered previously for example kisacik et al 2012b and ravindar et al 2017 considered the maximum of all pressures p max park et al 2017 has analyzed the p mean p 1 3 p 1 10 p 1 50 p 1 100 p 1 250 and p max at the same time representing the mean significant average of the highest 10 2 1 0 4 and maximum pressure respectively besides other definitions may be adopted based on a structure s importance or use in the present study referring to the characteristic wave height h 13 which has been applied widely characteristic wave impulse i im 13 and characteristic pressure p cha 13 are calculated and discussed for each wave test fig 11 shows the relation between wave impulse of overhanging horizontal cantilever slab and the structural clearance for incoming wave height h s 0 125 m and wave period t p 1 45s in the figure wave impulse i im is normalized by ρgh s t p and clearance c is normalized by h s where ρ is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration h s is the corresponding incoming wave height and t p is the wave period with the increasing c h s i im ρgh s t p generally presents a changing trend of firstly increasing and then rapidly decreasing when c h s is equal to zero i im ρgh s t p reaches the peak value compared with other pressure sensors during the c h s is negative p2 and p8 have showed a different changing trend on one hand p8 is located on the connected corner between vertical and horizontal parts and up rush jet which is climbing on the vertical part has a heavily impact on this point on the other hand when c 0 02 m 0 05 m and 0 10 m p2 has a much higher impact probability and larger wave impulse rather than other pressure sensors as shown in fig 12 thus different from other sensors both p2 and p8 keep the relative larger wave impulse during the c h s is negative fig 13 plots the characteristic pressure p cha against c h s and characteristic pressure p cha is normalized by ρgh s similarly p cha ρgh s shows the firstly increasing and then decreasing trend with increasing c h s when the clearance is enough large both i im ρgh s t p and p cha ρgh s are close to zero and the horizontal cantilever slab is no longer suffered from impact load however different from the quickly increasing and then quickly decreasing of i im ρgh s t p p cha ρgh s presents a relative slowly rising and then rapidly descent meanwhile p cha ρgh s attains the maximum when the c h s is close to 0 2 although both p cha ρgh s and i im ρgh s t p have the similar changing pattern there is an obvious asynchronism between i im ρgh s t p and p cha ρgh s in which the maximum of i im ρgh s t p occurs at about c h s 0 while that of p cha ρgh s appears near c h s 0 2 according to previous researches bullock et al 2007 hofland et al 2011 hu et al 2017 it has been pointed out that the existing air layer between wave surface and structure can induce a much severer wave impact besides the largest wave pressure is always corresponding to the relative smaller air layer and with the increasing volume of air layer the wave pressure shows a decreasing trend hattori and arami 1993 ravindar et al 2017 thus compared with c h s 0 the thin air layer between incoming wave and the bottom of cantilever slab can produce the much larger characteristic pressure when c h s 0 2 on the other hand wave impulse is the integration of wave pressure along the wave duration and represents the total energy of wave impact when c h s is equal to zero the volume of incoming wave impacting on the bottom of cantilever slab reaches the maximum and therefore induces the corresponding largest wave energy consumption and wave impulse as shown in fig 11 admittedly the maximum pressure is crucial for local destruction of structures but manjula and sannasiraj 2019 have revealed that a smaller pressure with relative longer duration is much more dangerous to structural deformation than the largest pressure with shorter duration thus not only wave pressure but also impact duration are important for structural safety and wave impulse as a parameter both considering wave pressure and impact duration should be also emphatically considered in the predesign 3 3 effect of clearance on wave loads of vertical wall when the horizontal cantilever slab transforms from below the still water level to above the still water level the vertical wall correspondingly changes from submerged to non submerged fig 14 shows the effect of relative clearance c h s on the relative wave impulse i im ρgh s t p of vertical wall for incoming wave height h s 0 10 m and wave period t p 1 45s when c h s increases it can be found that i im ρgh s t p of vertical wall also increases firstly and then decreases reaching the peak during c h s equal to zero wave impulses of different pressure sensors have the same changing pattern however with the measured position shifting down i e from p9 to p20 wave impulse shows a decreasing trend when the clearance is larger the difference between wave impulses of different pressure sensors becomes more significant meanwhile fig 15 plots the corresponding characteristic pressure p cha ρgh s against c h s in the figure it can be noted that p cha ρgh s nearly shows the same changing trend as i im ρgh s t p but different from i im ρgh s t p reaches the peak when c h s is equal to zero p cha ρgh s attains the maximum during c h s close to 0 2 which is also observed in the horizontal cantilever slab 3 4 effect of wave steepness on wave loads of vertical wall in addition to structural geometric properties wave loads on vertical wall are also dependent on different incoming wave conditions bagnold 1939 mitsuyasu 1967 oumeraci et al 1993 hull and müller 2002 hofland et al 2011 and hu et al 2017 have pointed out that incoming wave shape has a significant effect on wave loads of vertical structures in this section the effect of incoming wave steepness on the wave impulse of vertical wall has been discussed fig 16 shows the relation between wave steepness h s l and wave impulse which is normalized by ρgh s t p in the figure sensors of p9 p10 and p11 are located above the still water level while the other else are below the still water level in general the increasing h s l results in higher i im ρgh s t p however wave with a larger wave height h s tends to break earlier along the flume causing wave energy to decrease before the wave impacts the vertical wall as a result i im ρgh s t p presents a slowly rising when the h s l is larger meanwhile compared with sensors below the still water level sensors of p9 p10 and p11 have a different characteristic due to the wave impact always hits on the position near the still water level p11 shows a relative larger i im ρgh s t p and is not obviously influenced by the wave steepness besides when the position shifts from p11 to p9 i im ρgh s t p decreases heavily correspondingly meanwhile fig 17 plots normalized characteristic pressure p cha ρgh s against wave steepness h s l in the condition of structural clearance c 0 10 m and wave period t p 1 45s similarly p cha ρgh s shows the increasing trend with increasing h s l and the maximum p cha ρgh s occurs at p11 and p12 located near the still water level which is agreed well with previous researchers such as kirkgöz 1982 allsop et al 1996 cuomo et al 2010 marzeddu et al 2017 and huang and chen 2020 3 5 relations between characteristic pressure pcha and rise time tr 3 5 1 pcha and tr relation on cantilever slab as illustrated in previous researches there is a negative correlation between wave pressure and impact time and the highest wave impact always has a shorter duration kirkgöz et al 1990 hattori et al 1994 bullock et al 2001 cuomo et al 2009 rajasekaran et al 2010 song et al 2015 and ravindar et al 2017 have given out the empirical formulas of the relation between impact pressure p im and rise time t r all of the empirical formulas presented can be expressed as eq 2 2 p i m a t r b where a and b are empirical parameters different values of a and b for all empirical formulas are summarized in table 3 it can be noted that values of a and b for all empirical formulas are different from each other which is mainly due to the dimensionally inconsistent of equation in view of this more researchers prefer to propose the dimensionally consistent form of p im and t r by normalizing the expression cuomo et al 2004 kisacik et al 2012a 2012b and 2014 fig 18 a shows the normalized relation between impact pressure p im and rise time t r for cantilever slab in the figure impact pressure p im is normalized by ρgh s and rise time t r is normalized by t p where ρ is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration h s is the corresponding incoming wave height and t p is the wave period as expected p im ρgh s generally presents a negative correlation with t r t p however there is a significant scatter showing in the figure and it is not adoptable to further study the relation in a quantitative way compared with the scatter in fig 18 a there is no obvious scatter in the relation between characteristic pressure and rise time as shown in fig 18 b similar to impact pressure characteristic pressure p cha is normalized by ρgh s and the dimensionality consistent relation can be described in eq 3 at 99 5 of non exceedance level with a 0 29 and b 0 72 in order to determining the proposed equation all test data along the horizontal axis are divided in different intervals then statistical values are calculated for each interval and a power form function is fitted through the calculated points it can be seen that the largest impact has the relative rise time t r t p close to 0 001 and most of the significant impacts are recorded between 0 001 t r t p 0 01 3 p c h a ρ g h s 99 5 a t r t p b a 0 29 b 0 72 at the same time fig 19 a shows the categorized version of the same test data based on different structural clearances i e c 0 10 0 05 0 02 0 0 02 0 05 0 10 m results of c 0 0 02 0 05 0 10 m are showing low values of p cha ρgh s over a quite extensive range of t r t p average values of p cha ρgh s for c 0 and 0 02 m are larger than that for c 0 05 and 0 10 m meaning that c 0 and 0 02 m produce more significant impacts than c 0 05 and 0 10 m on the other hand results of c 0 02 0 05 and 0 10 m have showed the higher values of p cha ρgh s as well as the significant overlap indicating that when the clearance increases to a certain value the continued increasing of clearance can no longer produce the larger wave impact besides the comparison of best fit equations between the present study and that of kisacik et al 2012b has been shown in fig 19 b first of all it should bear in mind that there are several differences between the present study and that of kisacik et al in this model test there is no foreshore slope which has been modeled in the experiment of kisacik et al meanwhile both experiments have different scales which has an effect on the dynamic loading and different threshold values adopted to define rise time t r and wave impact duration t d furthermore the equation of kisacik et al 2012b is corresponded to the relation between impact pressure and rise time but that of present study is describing the relation between characteristic pressure and rise time although there are such distinctions it can be seen that the equation of kisacik et al is also suitable for the relation between characteristic pressure and rise time which may be due to the normalization moreover compared with the result of kisacik et al the best fit equation of this study has a larger enclosed area which indicates the equation proposed in this study is more conservative 3 5 2 pcha and tr relation on vertical wall as for a vertical wall with overhanging horizontal cantilever slab wave impacts will occur both on the horizontal and vertical parts fig 20 a shows the normalized relation between p im and t r and fig 20 b shows the normalized relation between p cha and t r for the vertical part compared with the large scatter in fig 20 a and b shows a smaller scatter in terms of the relation between p cha and t r eq 4 represents the adopted functions at 99 5 of non exceedance level with a 0 45 and b 0 43 from fig 20 b view of point the largest recorded pressure features a relative rise time t r t p 0 01 and most of significant impacts are measured between 0 01 t r t p 0 06 fig 21 a presents the same experimental result which is categorized based on various structural clearances results with higher values of p cha ρgh s are observed on the vertical wall from cases of c 0 02 0 05 and 0 10 m at the same time lower positions of the vertical wall present smaller values of pressure with a relative longer rise time i e 0 01 t r t p 0 06 such as p17 p18 p19 and p20 furthermore fig 21 b shows the comparison of proposed equations from the present study and from the earlier experimental work of kisacik et al 2012b similarly despite there are several different assumptions in such two model tests as illustrated in section 4 5 1 it can be noted that the present adopted equation for vertical wall is line with the experimental result from kisacik et al 2012b 4 p c h a ρ g h s 99 5 a t r t p b a 0 45 b 0 43 it may be concluded from results in this section that i compared with impact pressure characteristic pressure shows a much smaller scatter and ii the normalized relation between impact pressure and total duration is almost similar to that between characteristic pressure and total duration 3 6 relations between impulse iim and total duration td 3 6 1 iim and td relation on cantilever slab wave impulse which can better represent the total energy of wave impact also has a significant effect on the safety of marine structure by reviewing previous researches seldom scholar has payed attention to the relation between wave impulse and wave total duration in view of this fig 22 a plots wave impulse against total duration for cantilever slab in the figure wave impulse i im is normalized by ρgh s t p and total duration t d is normalized by t p in general with the increasing t d t p relative impulse i im ρgh s t p shows a corresponding increasing trend eq 5 represents the proposed function for such relation at 99 5 of non exceedance level with a 0 38 and b 0 53 to determine the proposed equation all data points along the axis of t d t p are divided into different intervals then statistical values are calculated for each interval and a power form function is fitted through such calculated points the normalized equation is dimensionally consistent and has less scale effect 5 i i m ρ g h s t m 99 5 a t d t p b a 0 38 b 0 53 fig 22 b shows the categorized version for identical experimental data based on the clearance when 0 t d t p 0 4 the shorter duration induces the larger impact where the structural clearance plays a leading role there are obvious dividing lines between the distribution of i im ρgh s t p for c 0 02 0 0 02 0 05 0 10 m and the larger clearance is usually corresponded to the bigger impulse nevertheless when t d t p 0 4 the distribution of i im ρgh s t p shows a severe scatter and mixture between different clearances 3 6 2 iim and td relation on vertical wall similarly for the vertical part of the scale model fig 23 a plots the normalized relation between impulse and total duration while fig 23 b shows the same test data categorized based on different clearances eq 6 represents the function at 99 5 of non exceedance level with a 0 38 and b 0 45 in the equation normalized impulse of vertical wall also witnesses an increasing trend when total duration is enlarged meanwhile most of impulses are mainly distributed between 0 t d t p 0 4 and the larger impulse can be easier to acquired from the case of c 0 0 02 0 05 and 0 10 m in general both equations eq 5 and 6 for vertical wall and cantilever slab have almost identical coefficients 6 i i m ρ g h s t m 99 5 a t d t p b a 0 38 b 0 45 3 7 relation between impact pressure and characteristic pressure numbers of scholars have already summarized the characteristic of impact pressure systematically during recent decades however in this study more attentions have been payed to investigate the influence of clearance and wave conditions on the characteristic pressure in order to build up the relation between impact pressure and defined characteristic pressure fig 24 plots the normalized characteristic pressure against normalized impact pressure as expected characteristic pressure is smaller than impact pressure meanwhile it can be noted that there are obvious positive correlations between normalized characteristic pressure and normalized impact pressure both for cantilever slab and vertical wall in fig 24 a the observed linear relation between normalized characteristic pressure and normalized impact pressure for cantilever slab can be described by eq 7 with coefficients α 0 13 and β 0 34 meanwhile for the vertical wall the function proposed to describe such relation can be expressed by eq 8 with coefficients α 0 21 and β 0 26 7 p c h a 13 ρ g h s α p i m 13 ρ g h s β α 0 13 β 0 34 8 p c h a 13 ρ g h s α p i m 13 ρ g h s β α 0 21 β 0 26 4 conclusion a vertical wall with an overhanging horizontal cantilever slab is tested on a two dimensional flume under irregular wave impact a series of model tests are carried out with a scale factor of 1 30 by setting up the cut off frequency and using wavelet transform the original wave load has been separated into impact load and quasi static load respectively after defining the integration of impact load along total duration as wave impulse and the ratio between wave impulse and total duration as characteristic pressure different influences of wave height wave period and structural clearance on wave impulse and characteristic pressure are investigated meanwhile relations between wave impulse characteristic pressure and wave impact time are further proposed different structural clearances have a significant effect both on wave impulse and characteristic pressure for cantilever slab and vertical wall with the increasing of relative clearance c h s both wave impulse and characteristic pressure show a firstly increasing and then decreasing trend however different from the wave impulse reaches the peak when c h s close to zero the characteristic pressure attains the maximum when c h s close to 0 2 besides with the increasing wave steepness not only wave impulse but characteristic pressure of vertical wall increase correspondingly and the maximum wave impulse and characteristic pressure occur near the still water level which is agreed well with previous researches compared with the large scatter in the relation between impact pressure and rise time there is no significant scatter in that between characteristic pressure and rise time at 99 5 of non exceedance level the adopted function describing the relation between characteristic pressure and rise time has been proposed both for cantilever slab and vertical wall as expected structural clearances have an obvious effect on these relations and the larger clearance can induce the stronger wave impact with shorter rise time furthermore by comparing these proposed functions in the present paper with that of kisacik et al in 2012 it is interesting to find that the normalized relation between characteristic pressure and rise time is almost similar to that corresponded to impact pressure and rise time finally not only relation between wave impulse and total duration but that between wave impulse and characteristic pressure are given out as well the present paper mainly investigates different influences of wave height wave length and structural clearance on characteristic pressure and wave impulse besides the corresponding relations between wave loads and impact time are studied as well all the results are based on the analysis of experimental data and limited by the range of the model test the findings here may be used by oceanic planners numerical modelers and engineers for future research and predesign credit authorship contribution statement jianjun huang conceptualization

21457,wave impact tests are carried out for a vertical wall with overhanging horizontal cantilever slab in a flume with the scale factor of 1 30 by setting various incoming wave conditions and structural elevations different influences of wave height wave period and clearance on the wave impulse and characteristic pressure are investigated with the increasing of structural clearance both wave impulse and characteristic pressure for cantilever slab and vertical wall show a firstly increasing and then decreasing trend and reach the peak when clearance close to zero and 0 2 times wave height respectively besides bigger wave steepness can induce larger wave impulse and characteristic pressure for the vertical wall the relation between characteristic pressure and rise time present a smaller scatter and has the almost similarity to that of impact pressure and rise time furthermore a positive correlation between wave impulse and total duration is observed and the larger characteristic pressure is always corresponded to the bigger wave impulse all the findings presented here may be used for future research as well as predesign keywords wave impulse characteristic pressure structural clearance rise time total duration 1 introduction in past decades various oceanic and coastal structures have been built up for marine economy development and coastal protection however the severe failure of oceanic and coastal structures is not uncommon especially under the storm or hurricane weather which induces wave loads to exceed the capacity of structures mazinani et al 2015 seiffert et al 2015 hayatdavoodi et al 2016 some researches pointed out that the sea level would arise by 0 72 m influenced by global warming which further increases the occurrence probability and intensity of extreme natural phenomenon such as storm surge and typhoon jongman and ward 2012 nicholls et al 2018 meanwhile as the global population increases it has been estimated that the population of coastal areas would increase to 122 by 2060 neumann et al 2015 in view of this it is important and necessary to further understand the wave impacting on oceanic and coastal structures such as wharf breakwater and revetment the earliest study on wave loads can be dated back to 19 century when stevenson 1874 firstly measured the wave pressure of vertical seawall by load cells after then vertical structures have been widely used in the coastal protection and more and more scholars began to focus on the characteristic of wave loads on vertical structures from qualitatively to quantitatively bagnold 1939 and mitsuyasu 1967 carried out the physical model tests and found the importance of wave s breaking condition breaking or non breaking on the measured wave pressure later hull and müller 2002 also pointed out the resulting wave pressures are dependent on various wave shapes according to different wave breaking shapes four main breaker types of incoming waves have been suggested these are turbulent bore well developed plunging breaker plunging breaker and upward deflected breaker oumeraci et al 1993 despite scholars have given out various classification standards of breaker types kirkgöz 1995 obhrai et al 2005 bullock et al 2007 hofland et al 2011 hu et al 2017 streicher et al 2019 the core idea is that with the evolution of wave from no breaking to broken the volume of trapped air between wave surface and structure changes gradually correspondingly inducing different types of wave impact hull and müller 2002 obhrai et al 2005 hofland et al 2011 and hu et al 2017 pointed out that the largest wave pressure occurs when the breaking wave traps a very thin pocket of air called flip through in order to estimate wave loads on structures goda 1974 conducted a series of wave physical model tests and summarized the classical calculated formula of wave pressure cuomo et al 2010 performed the large scale model test and expanded calculated formulas of wave pressure and wave force respectively after the heavy failures of coastal bridges during extreme storm events mazinani et al 2015 hayatdavoodi et al 2016 such as hurricane katrina striking the coasts of alabama mississippi and louisiana the need for research on wave loads on horizontal structures are increasing cuomo et al 2007 found the quasi static impact and impulse impact in the horizontal structure and proposed calculated formulas of wave pressure based on experimental results by reproducing the wave impacting on the coastal bridges in a wave basin cuomo et al 2009 emphasized the dynamic behavior of the wave impact as well as the effect of air on the wave in deck loads based on the same experiment serinaldi and cuomo 2011 further gave out the relation between maximum pressure and rise times meanwhile chen et al 2016 generated tsunami bores by the mean of dam break and investigated the influence of bore height deck height and slope angle on uplift loads park et al 2017 payed more attention on elevated structure and pointed out that both horizontal and vertical wave loads should be considered during preliminary design moideen et al 2019 used reef3d to study the effect of girder spacing on the wave impact on coastal bridge deck and concluded that the existing girder could enlarge the wave loads on the deck adversely to the previous problem of a simple vertical wall or a horizontal structures a combined structure consisting of both a vertical and a horizontal part has began to be considered and applied practically kisacik et al 2012a 2012b 2014 carried out a series of wave model tests of a vertical structure with an overhanging horizontal cantilever slab and have made a comprehensive research similar to oumeraci et al 1993 kisacik et al described four wave breaker types based on the model test record according to different breaker types wave impact pressures on the vertical structure as well as the horizontal slab were analyzed systematically besides considering different influences of wave height wave period and clearance height on the pressure and total force a series of corrected empirical formulas based on the scale test results were given out by reviewing previous researches it can be known that a number of results and conclusions for horizontal and vertical structures have been given out besides kisacik et al have presented some new findings about the vertical wall with cantilever slab however there is still the structural failure of such combined structure under wave attack reported in italy castellino et al 2018 which reveals there are still some problems need to be studied further admittedly wave pressure has a significant randomness cuomo et al 2010 kisacik et al 2012 marzeddu et al 2017 and it is suggested that the wave impulse which is the integration of wave pressure along time has a much better repeatability and predictability bagnold 1939 bullock et al 2007 hofland et al 2011 chen et al 2019 thus different from kisacik et al who mainly cared about the wave pressure on the vertical wall with overhanging horizontal cantilever slab the present study pays more attention to the characteristic of wave impulse on a vertical wall with cantilever slab meanwhile by setting up different incoming wave conditions and structural clearance the effect of such variable factors on wave impulse are also given out finally the relations between wave impulse and duration are investigated as well this paper is structured as follows in section 1 review of wave impact on marine structure is presented in section 2 a detail introduction of experimental setup is given including physical model setup and measured devices in section 3 methods of data processing are introduced then in section 4 experimental observations and results discussion are given the influences of wave height wave length and structural clearance on wave impulse and characteristic pressure are highlighted relations between wave loads and time are given out finally conclusions useful for design purposes are drawn in section 5 2 experimental setup 2 1 physical model setup in the flume physical model tests have been carried out in a wave flume 80 m 1 m 1 5 m of hohai university china the piston type wave maker assembly is designated in fig 1 and specified as the origin for wave generation x 0 00 m both regular and irregular waves can be generated by the hydraulic actuator assembly of the wave maker which is equipped with an active wave absorption system for reflected wave the water flume is separated into two parts by a glass plate located along the axis of the water flume one part is used to setup the physical model and the other part is empty the physical model is located 50 m away from the wave paddle and a scale factor of 1 30 based on the froude number similarity is adopted to ensure correct reproduction of all wave processes the scaled structure model is consisted of 0 65 m high hm vertical wall and 0 50 m long lm overhanging horizontal cantilever slab in order to prevent the wave overtopping occurring an additional 0 35 m high hm vertical plate is setup on the front edge of the overhanging horizontal cantilever slab the entire physical model is rigid which is built from plexiglass although the overhanging horizontal cantilever slab seems to connected with the vertical wall both of them are separated in which the overhanging horizontal cantilever slab is connected with a steel frame which can shift vertically while the vertical wall is fixed on the bottom of the water flume by using the clump weight as shown in fig 2 and fig 3 when the wave is generated and passing forward a certain distance the wave is correspondingly separated into two parts by the glass plate in which one part impacts on the physical model while the other part transmits directly through the flume and is finally eliminated by the absorbed layer at the end of the flume by dissipating part of the incoming wave energy the cross sloshing problem in the water flume can be reduced to some extend more details about physical model and water flume can be seen in figs 1 figs 2 and 3 2 2 wave conditions instrument and methods wave elevation is recorded by capacitance wave gauges dj800 made from china institute of water resources and hydropower research as shown in fig 1 and significant wave height h s and peak period t p are used for irregular wave irregular waves are generated using the jonswap spectrum with γ 3 3 in order to ensure the accuracy and representation of irregular wave model tests the duration of each irregular wave case is determined by requiring at least 100 waves for each trial based on the expected wave peak period the water depth d is always 0 50 m and the clearance c between overhanging horizontal cantilever slab and still water level can be changed by shifting the steel frame vertically which is connected with the overhanging horizontal cantilever slab when the overhanging horizontal cantilever slab is above the still water level the clearance c is defined as positive while the negative clearance represents the overhanging horizontal cantilever slab below the still water level as shown in dash lines of fig 2 according to the wave peak period t p the corresponding wave length has been calculated and all test conditions are summarized in table 1 moreover in order to record wave pressures at the same time 20 pressure sensors wms 51p2j0l2m0 made from xi an microsensitive instrument and meter co ltd are adopted to measure the local wave pressure for all wave trials the natural frequency of pressure sensors is 80000 hz and has no significant effect on the pressure measuring all the pressure sensors are installed at different parts of the structure such as overhanging horizontal cantilever slab p s 1 p s 8 and vertical wall p s 9 p s 20 the sampling rate of pressure sensors is 5000 hz and that of wave gauges is 100 hz specific locations of pressure sensors as well as wave gauges can be seen in fig 2 and table 2 2 3 data processing wave pressures of different parts are synchronously recorded by pressure sensors there is a surge of pressure reading recorded when the wave first touch the sensors on the base of ensuring the accuracy a medfilt1 function from matlab 2016b has been adopted to pretreat the original data fig 4 a presents the original and treated data together from which it can be seen that the surge problem has been solved properly fig 4 b shows a typical time series of wave pressure in which a relative larger impact load with short duration is followed by a relative smaller quasi static load with long duration as described in previous researches oumeraci et al 1993 cuomo et al 2009 kisacik et al 2014 chen et al 2019 in order to analyze the characteristic of impact load the wave load is separated into impact load and quasi static load respectively by using continuous 1 d wavelet transform cwt fig 5 b shows the frequency domain corresponding to the wave pressure in fig 5 a after setting up a specific cut off frequency as shown in fig 5 b and using the inverse continuous 1 d wavelet transform icwt the signal of high frequency region can be transformed into impact load while that of low frequency region can be transformed into quasi static load fig 6 plots reconstructed quasi static loads with cut off frequency f c 4 hz and f c 8 hz it can be seen that quasi static loads with cut off frequencies of 4 hz blue solid line and 8 hz green solid line match each other well for the first two wave impacts with the lower impact characteristic however in terms of the later five wave impacts which has a significantly higher impact component using the cut off frequency of 4 hz eliminates quite a lot the quasi static loads while that of f c 8 hz can match the quasi static component of original wave loads well it can be concluded that both cut off frequencies of 4 hz and 8 hz are effective to separate the dynamic and quasi static loads for wave impact with lower impact components while the cut off frequency of 8 hz is much better for wave impact with higher impact components thus the choice of adopting cut off frequency at 8 hz to separate the quasi static load and the impact load is more reasonable and adoptable as for an example fig 7 presents the reconstructed impact load and the corresponding quasi static load in the figure the maximum value of impact load is defined as impact pressure p im and the maximum value of quasi static load is defined as quasi static pressure p qs agreed well with previous researches oumeraci and kortenhaus 1994 wood et al 2000 cuomo et al 2010 kisacik et al 2014 chen et al 2019 the impact load is approximately distributed in a triangle along the wave impact duration as shown in the shadow both of figs 7 a and fig 8 a in order to further investigate the relation between wave loads and impact time as shown in fig 8 the time interval between t1 and t2 is defined as the rise time t r and that between t1 and t3 is defined as the total duration t d in which t2 is the moment corresponding to the impact pressure p im for defining t1 and t3 the threshold value is adopted as 1 of impact pressure p im besides the wave impulse i im is defined as the time integral of the wave pressure over the total duration t d as shown in figs 7 a and fig 8 and the ratio between wave impulse i im and total duration t d is further defined as characteristic pressure p cha which can be referred to fig 8 b and calculated by eq 1 as follow 1 p c h a i i m t d t 0 t t d p t d t t d where p cha is the characteristic pressure i im is the wave impulse t d is the total duration of wave impact during one wave period p t is the wave pressure changed with time 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 time series of pressure of different positions fig 9 shows the recording of measured pressures on different positions under incoming wave attack sensors 1 to 8 are located on the bottom of overhanging horizontal cantilever slab and sensors 9 to 20 are located on the vertical wall particularly sensors 9 to 11 are above the still water level while that 12 to 20 are below the still water level correspondingly fig 10 displays the whole wave impact process in 3 photos it can be noted that the initial wave impact occurs on the upper position of vertical wall at t1 267 74s as shown in fig 10 a then the impact pressure quickly shifts downwards from the original attacking point and induces the second wave impact on the lower part of vertical wall at t2 267 76s due to the blocking of vertical wall the incoming wave would induce an up rush jet which causes a significant third wave impact on the connected corner between cantilever slab and vertical wall at t3 267 83s referred to fig 10 b after that such up rush jet turns into horizontal jet flowing along the bottom of cantilever slab and finally transmits to the outer edge of cantilever slab at t4 267 91s as shown in fig 10 c according to the length of cantilever slab as well as the time interval between t3 and t4 the averaged velocity of the horizontal jet can be evaluated at 6 25 m s 3 2 effect of clearance on wave loads of overhanging horizontal cantilever slab upward wave impact beneath the horizontal cantilever slab results in a significant uplift load as mentioned in the research of park et al 2017 loads on an elevated coastal structure will change depending on the structure s elevation above or below the still water level thus the structural clearance has a crucial effect on the wave load of overhanging horizontal cantilever slab similar to wave height the wave load acting on structure can be analyzed by using different definitions for a characteristic wave load several characteristic pressures have been considered previously for example kisacik et al 2012b and ravindar et al 2017 considered the maximum of all pressures p max park et al 2017 has analyzed the p mean p 1 3 p 1 10 p 1 50 p 1 100 p 1 250 and p max at the same time representing the mean significant average of the highest 10 2 1 0 4 and maximum pressure respectively besides other definitions may be adopted based on a structure s importance or use in the present study referring to the characteristic wave height h 13 which has been applied widely characteristic wave impulse i im 13 and characteristic pressure p cha 13 are calculated and discussed for each wave test fig 11 shows the relation between wave impulse of overhanging horizontal cantilever slab and the structural clearance for incoming wave height h s 0 125 m and wave period t p 1 45s in the figure wave impulse i im is normalized by ρgh s t p and clearance c is normalized by h s where ρ is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration h s is the corresponding incoming wave height and t p is the wave period with the increasing c h s i im ρgh s t p generally presents a changing trend of firstly increasing and then rapidly decreasing when c h s is equal to zero i im ρgh s t p reaches the peak value compared with other pressure sensors during the c h s is negative p2 and p8 have showed a different changing trend on one hand p8 is located on the connected corner between vertical and horizontal parts and up rush jet which is climbing on the vertical part has a heavily impact on this point on the other hand when c 0 02 m 0 05 m and 0 10 m p2 has a much higher impact probability and larger wave impulse rather than other pressure sensors as shown in fig 12 thus different from other sensors both p2 and p8 keep the relative larger wave impulse during the c h s is negative fig 13 plots the characteristic pressure p cha against c h s and characteristic pressure p cha is normalized by ρgh s similarly p cha ρgh s shows the firstly increasing and then decreasing trend with increasing c h s when the clearance is enough large both i im ρgh s t p and p cha ρgh s are close to zero and the horizontal cantilever slab is no longer suffered from impact load however different from the quickly increasing and then quickly decreasing of i im ρgh s t p p cha ρgh s presents a relative slowly rising and then rapidly descent meanwhile p cha ρgh s attains the maximum when the c h s is close to 0 2 although both p cha ρgh s and i im ρgh s t p have the similar changing pattern there is an obvious asynchronism between i im ρgh s t p and p cha ρgh s in which the maximum of i im ρgh s t p occurs at about c h s 0 while that of p cha ρgh s appears near c h s 0 2 according to previous researches bullock et al 2007 hofland et al 2011 hu et al 2017 it has been pointed out that the existing air layer between wave surface and structure can induce a much severer wave impact besides the largest wave pressure is always corresponding to the relative smaller air layer and with the increasing volume of air layer the wave pressure shows a decreasing trend hattori and arami 1993 ravindar et al 2017 thus compared with c h s 0 the thin air layer between incoming wave and the bottom of cantilever slab can produce the much larger characteristic pressure when c h s 0 2 on the other hand wave impulse is the integration of wave pressure along the wave duration and represents the total energy of wave impact when c h s is equal to zero the volume of incoming wave impacting on the bottom of cantilever slab reaches the maximum and therefore induces the corresponding largest wave energy consumption and wave impulse as shown in fig 11 admittedly the maximum pressure is crucial for local destruction of structures but manjula and sannasiraj 2019 have revealed that a smaller pressure with relative longer duration is much more dangerous to structural deformation than the largest pressure with shorter duration thus not only wave pressure but also impact duration are important for structural safety and wave impulse as a parameter both considering wave pressure and impact duration should be also emphatically considered in the predesign 3 3 effect of clearance on wave loads of vertical wall when the horizontal cantilever slab transforms from below the still water level to above the still water level the vertical wall correspondingly changes from submerged to non submerged fig 14 shows the effect of relative clearance c h s on the relative wave impulse i im ρgh s t p of vertical wall for incoming wave height h s 0 10 m and wave period t p 1 45s when c h s increases it can be found that i im ρgh s t p of vertical wall also increases firstly and then decreases reaching the peak during c h s equal to zero wave impulses of different pressure sensors have the same changing pattern however with the measured position shifting down i e from p9 to p20 wave impulse shows a decreasing trend when the clearance is larger the difference between wave impulses of different pressure sensors becomes more significant meanwhile fig 15 plots the corresponding characteristic pressure p cha ρgh s against c h s in the figure it can be noted that p cha ρgh s nearly shows the same changing trend as i im ρgh s t p but different from i im ρgh s t p reaches the peak when c h s is equal to zero p cha ρgh s attains the maximum during c h s close to 0 2 which is also observed in the horizontal cantilever slab 3 4 effect of wave steepness on wave loads of vertical wall in addition to structural geometric properties wave loads on vertical wall are also dependent on different incoming wave conditions bagnold 1939 mitsuyasu 1967 oumeraci et al 1993 hull and müller 2002 hofland et al 2011 and hu et al 2017 have pointed out that incoming wave shape has a significant effect on wave loads of vertical structures in this section the effect of incoming wave steepness on the wave impulse of vertical wall has been discussed fig 16 shows the relation between wave steepness h s l and wave impulse which is normalized by ρgh s t p in the figure sensors of p9 p10 and p11 are located above the still water level while the other else are below the still water level in general the increasing h s l results in higher i im ρgh s t p however wave with a larger wave height h s tends to break earlier along the flume causing wave energy to decrease before the wave impacts the vertical wall as a result i im ρgh s t p presents a slowly rising when the h s l is larger meanwhile compared with sensors below the still water level sensors of p9 p10 and p11 have a different characteristic due to the wave impact always hits on the position near the still water level p11 shows a relative larger i im ρgh s t p and is not obviously influenced by the wave steepness besides when the position shifts from p11 to p9 i im ρgh s t p decreases heavily correspondingly meanwhile fig 17 plots normalized characteristic pressure p cha ρgh s against wave steepness h s l in the condition of structural clearance c 0 10 m and wave period t p 1 45s similarly p cha ρgh s shows the increasing trend with increasing h s l and the maximum p cha ρgh s occurs at p11 and p12 located near the still water level which is agreed well with previous researchers such as kirkgöz 1982 allsop et al 1996 cuomo et al 2010 marzeddu et al 2017 and huang and chen 2020 3 5 relations between characteristic pressure pcha and rise time tr 3 5 1 pcha and tr relation on cantilever slab as illustrated in previous researches there is a negative correlation between wave pressure and impact time and the highest wave impact always has a shorter duration kirkgöz et al 1990 hattori et al 1994 bullock et al 2001 cuomo et al 2009 rajasekaran et al 2010 song et al 2015 and ravindar et al 2017 have given out the empirical formulas of the relation between impact pressure p im and rise time t r all of the empirical formulas presented can be expressed as eq 2 2 p i m a t r b where a and b are empirical parameters different values of a and b for all empirical formulas are summarized in table 3 it can be noted that values of a and b for all empirical formulas are different from each other which is mainly due to the dimensionally inconsistent of equation in view of this more researchers prefer to propose the dimensionally consistent form of p im and t r by normalizing the expression cuomo et al 2004 kisacik et al 2012a 2012b and 2014 fig 18 a shows the normalized relation between impact pressure p im and rise time t r for cantilever slab in the figure impact pressure p im is normalized by ρgh s and rise time t r is normalized by t p where ρ is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration h s is the corresponding incoming wave height and t p is the wave period as expected p im ρgh s generally presents a negative correlation with t r t p however there is a significant scatter showing in the figure and it is not adoptable to further study the relation in a quantitative way compared with the scatter in fig 18 a there is no obvious scatter in the relation between characteristic pressure and rise time as shown in fig 18 b similar to impact pressure characteristic pressure p cha is normalized by ρgh s and the dimensionality consistent relation can be described in eq 3 at 99 5 of non exceedance level with a 0 29 and b 0 72 in order to determining the proposed equation all test data along the horizontal axis are divided in different intervals then statistical values are calculated for each interval and a power form function is fitted through the calculated points it can be seen that the largest impact has the relative rise time t r t p close to 0 001 and most of the significant impacts are recorded between 0 001 t r t p 0 01 3 p c h a ρ g h s 99 5 a t r t p b a 0 29 b 0 72 at the same time fig 19 a shows the categorized version of the same test data based on different structural clearances i e c 0 10 0 05 0 02 0 0 02 0 05 0 10 m results of c 0 0 02 0 05 0 10 m are showing low values of p cha ρgh s over a quite extensive range of t r t p average values of p cha ρgh s for c 0 and 0 02 m are larger than that for c 0 05 and 0 10 m meaning that c 0 and 0 02 m produce more significant impacts than c 0 05 and 0 10 m on the other hand results of c 0 02 0 05 and 0 10 m have showed the higher values of p cha ρgh s as well as the significant overlap indicating that when the clearance increases to a certain value the continued increasing of clearance can no longer produce the larger wave impact besides the comparison of best fit equations between the present study and that of kisacik et al 2012b has been shown in fig 19 b first of all it should bear in mind that there are several differences between the present study and that of kisacik et al in this model test there is no foreshore slope which has been modeled in the experiment of kisacik et al meanwhile both experiments have different scales which has an effect on the dynamic loading and different threshold values adopted to define rise time t r and wave impact duration t d furthermore the equation of kisacik et al 2012b is corresponded to the relation between impact pressure and rise time but that of present study is describing the relation between characteristic pressure and rise time although there are such distinctions it can be seen that the equation of kisacik et al is also suitable for the relation between characteristic pressure and rise time which may be due to the normalization moreover compared with the result of kisacik et al the best fit equation of this study has a larger enclosed area which indicates the equation proposed in this study is more conservative 3 5 2 pcha and tr relation on vertical wall as for a vertical wall with overhanging horizontal cantilever slab wave impacts will occur both on the horizontal and vertical parts fig 20 a shows the normalized relation between p im and t r and fig 20 b shows the normalized relation between p cha and t r for the vertical part compared with the large scatter in fig 20 a and b shows a smaller scatter in terms of the relation between p cha and t r eq 4 represents the adopted functions at 99 5 of non exceedance level with a 0

presents the same experimental result which is categorized based on various structural clearances results with higher values of p cha ρgh s are observed on the vertical wall from cases of c 0 02 0 05 and 0 10 m at the same time lower positions of the vertical wall present smaller values of pressure with a relative longer rise time i e 0 01 t r t p 0 06 such as p17 p18 p19 and p20 furthermore fig 21 b shows the comparison of proposed equations from the present study and from the earlier experimental work of kisacik et al 2012b similarly despite there are several different assumptions in such two model tests as illustrated in section 4 5 1 it can be noted that the present adopted equation for vertical wall is line with the experimental result from kisacik et al 2012b 4 p c h a ρ g h s 99 5 a t r t p b a 0 45 b 0 43 it may be concluded from results in this section that i compared with impact pressure characteristic pressure shows a much smaller scatter and ii the normalized relation between impact pressure and total duration is almost similar to that between characteristic pressure and total duration 3 6 relations between impulse iim and total duration td 3 6 1 iim and td relation on cantilever slab wave impulse which can better represent the total energy of wave impact also has a significant effect on the safety of marine structure by reviewing previous researches seldom scholar has payed attention to the relation between wave impulse and wave total duration in view of this fig 22 a plots wave impulse against total duration for cantilever slab in the figure wave impulse i im is normalized by ρgh s t p and total duration t d is normalized by t p in general with the increasing t d t p relative impulse i im ρgh s t p shows a corresponding increasing trend eq 5 represents the proposed function for such relation at 99 5 of non exceedance level with a 0 38 and b 0 53 to determine the proposed equation all data points along the axis of t d t p are divided into different intervals then statistical values are calculated for each interval and a power form function is fitted through such calculated points the normalized equation is dimensionally consistent and has less scale effect 5 i i m ρ g h s t m 99 5 a t d t p b a 0 38 b 0 53 fig 22 b shows the categorized version for identical experimental data based on the clearance when 0 t d t p 0 4 the shorter duration induces the larger impact where the structural clearance plays a leading role there are obvious dividing lines between the distribution of i im ρgh s t p for c 0 02 0 0 02 0 05 0 10 m and the larger clearance is usually corresponded to the bigger impulse nevertheless when t d t p 0 4 the distribution of i im ρgh s t p shows a severe scatter and mixture between different clearances 3 6 2 iim and td relation on vertical wall similarly for the vertical part of the scale model fig 23 a plots the normalized relation between impulse and total duration while fig 23 b shows the same test data categorized based on different clearances eq 6 represents the function at 99 5 of non exceedance level with a 0 38 and b 0 45 in the equation normalized impulse of vertical wall also witnesses an increasing trend when total duration is enlarged meanwhile most of impulses are mainly distributed between 0 t d t p 0 4 and the larger impulse can be easier to acquired from the case of c 0 0 02 0 05 and 0 10 m in general both equations eq 5 and 6 for vertical wall and cantilever slab have almost identical coefficients 6 i i m ρ g h s t m 99 5 a t d t p b a 0 38 b 0 45 3 7 relation between impact pressure and characteristic pressure numbers of scholars have already summarized the characteristic of impact pressure systematically during recent decades however in this study more attentions have been payed to investigate the influence of clearance and wave conditions on the characteristic pressure in order to build up the relation between impact pressure and defined characteristic pressure fig 24 plots the normalized characteristic pressure against normalized impact pressure as expected characteristic pressure is smaller than impact pressure meanwhile it can be noted that there are obvious positive correlations between normalized characteristic pressure and normalized impact pressure both for cantilever slab and vertical wall in fig 24 a the observed linear relation between normalized characteristic pressure and normalized impact pressure for cantilever slab can be described by eq 7 with coefficients α 0 13 and β 0 34 meanwhile for the vertical wall the function proposed to describe such relation can be expressed by eq 8 with coefficients α 0 21 and β 0 26 7 p c h a 13 ρ g h s α p i m 13 ρ g h s β α 0 13 β 0 34 8 p c h a 13 ρ g h s α p i m 13 ρ g h s β α 0 21 β 0 26 4 conclusion a vertical wall with an overhanging horizontal cantilever slab is tested on a two dimensional flume under irregular wave impact a series of model tests are carried out with a scale factor of 1 30 by setting up the cut off frequency and using wavelet transform the original wave load has been separated into impact load and quasi static load respectively after defining the integration of impact load along total duration as wave impulse and the ratio between wave impulse and total duration as characteristic pressure different influences of wave height wave period and structural clearance on wave impulse and characteristic pressure are investigated meanwhile relations between wave impulse characteristic pressure and wave impact time are further proposed different structural clearances have a significant effect both on wave impulse and characteristic pressure for cantilever slab and vertical wall with the increasing of relative clearance c h s both wave impulse and characteristic pressure show a firstly increasing and then decreasing trend however different from the wave impulse reaches the peak when c h s close to zero the characteristic pressure attains the maximum when c h s close to 0 2 besides with the increasing wave steepness not only wave impulse but characteristic pressure of vertical wall increase correspondingly and the maximum wave impulse and characteristic pressure occur near the still water level which is agreed well with previous researches compared with the large scatter in the relation between impact pressure and rise time there is no significant scatter in that between characteristic pressure and rise time at 99 5 of non exceedance level the adopted function describing the relation between characteristic pressure and rise time has been proposed both for cantilever slab and vertical wall as expected structural clearances have an obvious effect on these relations and the larger clearance can induce the stronger wave impact with shorter rise time furthermore by comparing these proposed functions in the present paper with that of kisacik et al in 2012 it is interesting to find that the normalized relation between characteristic pressure and rise time is almost similar to that corresponded to impact pressure and rise time finally not only relation between wave impulse and total duration but that between wave impulse and characteristic pressure are given out as well the present paper mainly investigates different influences of wave height wave length and structural clearance on characteristic pressure and wave impulse besides the corresponding relations between wave loads and impact time are studied as well all the results are based on the analysis of experimental data and limited by the range of the model test the findings here may be used by oceanic planners numerical modelers and engineers for future research and predesign credit authorship contribution statement jianjun huang conceptualization

21458,ice resistance is affected by many parameters i e ship geometries ice properties and interaction properties over the years various methods ranging from empirical semi empirical numerical methods and various of their combinations were developed to calculate the ice resistance with certain degree of success in this study from a brand new perspective a data driven approach for estimating ice resistance based on the artificial neural network was proposed the artificial neural network ann is one of the main tools for machine learning it can accurately and efficiently correlate directly the inputs and outputs of complex and nonlinear systems such as the ice resistance calculation system this physical system involves several interaction phases and at least three groups of input parameters i e ship ice and interaction characteristics following the basic idea of ann we trained and built six ann models based on datasets that were collected over past decades involving both model tests and full scale measurements the six different ann models differ in the amount of input parameters based on comparative studies among all the input parameters i e 7 variables in total ship length ship breadth ship draft stem angle ship speed ice flexural strength and ice thickness we found that the ship breadth ice thickness and ship speed have the largest influence on the calculation of ice resistance afterwards the 7 variable ann model s prediction was compared with existing semi empirical methods and measurements and favorable agreement was achieved with fairly simple matrix form formulas i e eq 19 the formula offers another simple yet reliable approach to calculate ice resistance however since the method is data driven high quality data are always needed in improving the predicting capability of the relevant ann model following the methodology outlined in this paper keywords ice going ship ice resistance artificial neural networks semi empirical ice resistance prediction method 1 introduction the performance of ice going ships is normally defined by the ability to freely transit in level ice a good icebreaking performance is manifested by low ice resistance efficient propulsion and the maintenance of the continuous ice breaking mode myland and ehlers 2014 i e without reverting to the intermittent ramming mode ashton 1986 there are several approaches to calculate the ice resistance for a given ice going ship such as by full scale field measurements model scale tests in ice basins numerical simulations and semi empirical methods the use of full scale measurements is considered as the most reliable approach but it involves high costs and its inflexibility in varying the hull form and or ice conditions ice resistance predicted by model scale basin tests is relatively less expensive but requires a good understanding about ice scaling to obtain reliable results additionally the model scale tests are also suffering from limited boundary conditions which are not necessarily present in nature thanks to the increase in computational power numerical simulations as one of the least expensive alternatives and because of its versatility in varying different parameters have gained popularity in recent years e g konno et al 2011 lubbad and løset 2011 metrikin and løset 2013 daley et al 2012 zhou et al 2013 su et al 2010 tan et al 2013 lu et al 2014b however numerical methods often rely on many practical assumptions and above all require a thorough understanding of ice mechanics and ice structure interactions løset et al 2006 palmer and croasdale 2013 sanderson 1988 another school of researchers focus on constructing the ice load history by formulating and quantifying the ice load experienced in each of physical interaction process as carried out by some of the authors valanto 2001b kämäräinen 2007 kotras et al 1983 naegle 1980 lu et al 2014a without going into different interaction processes in this paper we focus on the overall effect of the ice load i e the ice resistance defined as the time average of the longitudinal component of the global or total ice load in riska 2011 in this regard the most cost effective and widely adopted approach in the early design phase is by adopting the semi empirical method such as vance 1980 lewis et al 1982 zahn and phillips 1987 lindqvist 1989 keinonen et al 1991 1996 and riska et al 1998 erceg and ehlers 2017 presented the characteristics of six commonly used semi empirical methods and validated them against measurements of four vessels of different sizes and bow shapes these authors found that when the ship geometry differs a lot from the conventional geometry based on which those empirical formulae were developed discrepancies up to 200 can be encountered therefore it is necessary to develop a new method that takes into account various ship sizes bow geometries and ice conditions because many ice resistance data are available from various model scale and full scale measurements over the years a data driven approach that builds the relationship between various inputs and outputs are considered as a feasible alternative to the authors knowledge studies for the predicting of ice resistance using a data driven approach are rare cho and lee 2015 predicted ice resistance using a multi regression technique based on dimensional analysis linear regression method was applied to the pre selected variables that are considered important based on literature studies however this method suffers from its increasing calculation complexities when the number of variables increases in addition there is a limitation on the form of the formula that can be created in contrast different from traditional regression methods the artificial neural networks ann can efficiently model nonlinear and complex systems without any prior assumptions and complex equations sharifi and mohebbi 2012 given the nonlinearity and complexity of ice ship interactions the ann approach is considered a superior approach in this study the ice resistance of ice going ship is estimated using an artificial neural network technique a number of model tests and full scale measurement results have been collected based on these data a predictor model is developed to investigate the influence of various ship geometry and test condition related variables the developed models were trained by various parameters i e varying ship geometries and test conditions finally the trained model is validated against the remaining unused full scale measurements and existing semi empirical formulas 2 ship resistance in level ice and semi empirical ice resistance prediction methods the total resistance of an ice going ship is usually defined by the sum of ice resistance r i c e and open water resistance r o w as eq 1 this decoupled approach is a practical approach since the open water resistance is normally small compared with the pure ice resistance at the speeds in which ice breaking takes place erceg and ehlers 2017 1 r t o t r i c e r o w the ice resistance can be subdivided into the ice breaking r b and the submersion r s components as eq 2 2 r i c e r b r s the breaking phase begins when the ship starts to contact with the ice cover then crushing of the ice edge occurs and the crushing process continues until the force is sufficient to induce flexural failures in ice the level of the breaking force is strongly dependent on the bow shape and the ice properties the submergence resistance component consists of forces required to push the ice floes downwards and sideways by the hull it can be subdivided into the buoyancy and clearing resistance kim et al 2018 jeong et al 2017 the submerged floes in contact with the ship hull continue to slide along the ship bottom and sideways this increases the frictional forces which affect the submersion resistance among the various semi empirical methods for calculating ice resistance the method by vance 1980 was developed based on the full scale measurement dataset of the uscg katmai bay since only one ship was considered this method may be theoretically difficult to apply to ships of different sizes nevertheless it has been reported to match well with the measurements for vessels of certain sizes erceg and ehlers 2017 the equation consists of a submersion term and a speed dependent term as eq 3 it is noted that the ship length l is not considered in this equation whereas both terms are linearly dependent on the ship breadth b 3 r i c e 55 8583 ρ w ρ i g b h 2 0 0188 σ f v b h g where ρ w and ρ i are the density of water and ice respectively g is the gravitational acceleration h is the ice thickness σ f and v are the flexural strength of ice and the ship velocity respectively next the formulation by lewis et al 1982 was derived from the full scale trials of four ships with lengths ranging from 39 6 to 295 7 m lewis et al 1982 applied dimensional analysis on the available datasets and obtained an equation which includes a strength dependent term and a velocity dependent term as eq 4 4 r i c e 3 8989 0 0123 σ f ρ w g h 0 223 v l g b h ρ w g b h 2 the method by zahn and phillips 1987 was also developed see eqs 5 and 6 based on only one measurement dataset i e uscg mobile bay different from the formulation by vance 1980 ship length is included in both eq 5 and eq 6 in its linear and nonlinear forms respectively the ice resistance calculated by the nonlinear form in eq 6 is characterized by being proportional to the square of the ship speed whereas the linear dependence can be found in many other semi empirical methods as the linear form of eq 5 this method is featured by 5 r i c e 2 231 0 216 v l g b h ρ w g b h 2 6 r i c e 4 254 3 963 10 5 v g b 2 l h 3 ρ w g b h 2 the semi empirical ice resistance calculation method by lindqvist 1989 is one of the most commonly used methods it was developed to identify the main components in ice resistance and to show how ice resistance is affected by the major ship dimensions hull shapes and friction the equation was validated by full scale data of seven different ice going ship in baltic condition lindqvist

angle respectively ψ is the bow flare angle at waterline e is the elastic modulus and ν is the poisson s ratio μ is the hull ice friction coefficient δ ρ is the difference of density between the water and the ice t is the ship draft the method of keinonen et al 1991 1996 were developed based on comprehensive studies on ice resistance they analyzed full scale data and interviewed the operators of eighteen icebreakers the equation of keinonen et al 1991 1996 consists of the summation of the ice resistances at the speed of 1 m s and those above 1 m s in eq 8 because the results showed that the bow form has a significant influence on the ice resistance different formulas are applied depending on the hull form equations for ice resistance calculation at 1 m s are presented in eq 9 for ships with rounded hull forms and in eq 10 for ships with sharply chinned hull forms keinonen et al 1991 equations for resistance increase at the speed above 1 m s are presented in eq 11 for ships with rounded hull forms and in eq 12 for ships with sharply chinned hull forms keinonen et al 1996 unlike the other methods introduced above a hull condition factor c h a water salinity factor c s and an ice surface temperature t are considered in this method in addition a snow cover thickness h s was additionally considered in the ice thickness the hull condition factor indicates the roughness of the hull surface which is included in the friction correction term of the equation the temperature dependent ice surface friction is considered and the ice strength is reflected by the water salinity 8 r

1988 lindqvist 1989 and kämäräinen 1993 the equation was calibrated against full scale data of ten finnish merchant ships with baltic ice classes e g juva and riska 2002 the equation consists of a speed independent term i e c 1 and speed dependent term i e c 2 v as eq 13 the method assumes constant ice strength density and the friction coefficient between the hull and ice and the only variable is the ice thickness in this method see the c 1 term the ship length is considered separately by the mid body length term l p a r and the bow length term l b o w 13 r i c e c 1 c 2 v c 1 0 23 1 2 t b

number of numerical factors used in the semi empirical methods described above examining the six methods considered in this paper we can see that more variables and more physical processes are included in these empirical formulas during the course of historical development among them riska s method riska et al 1998 is considered a versatile method as it combines and extends different pre existing methods however the generality of its application can still be discussed as it is still developed from limited types of ships and ice conditions 3 data preparation the artificial neural network technique depends heavily on the available data if the dataset used in training and validation is of low quality or cannot sufficiently describe the involved physics the prediction model shall be of little value therefore sufficient high quality and comprehensive data preparation is necessary effort has been made in this paper to collect relevant data from previously conducted model scale and field scale experiments since full scale data related to the ice resistance are limited we considered only three full scale datasets and all other datasets were from model tests related research papers and ships used for data preparation are summarized in table 2 selection of input variables is required for the application of multivariate regression based on the artificial neural network in this study six variables which are commonly used in the six semi empirical ice resistance prediction methods and one variable related to the hull form are selected as potential input parameters shown in table 3 220 datasets are made available from 22 different tests each dataset consists of the ship length ship breadth ship draft stem angle ship velocity ice thickness ice flexural strength and corresponding ice resistance values all data are presented and studied in full scale i e model scale data are scaled up according to given scaling factors unlike ship related parameters that can be clearly known it is important to use data that minimizes errors or uncertainties for ice related parameters because full scale measurement is likely to include uncertainties although a general neural network was applied in this study a good alternative is to use a stochastic neural network samli 2012 that can take into account errors or uncertainties in the neural networks at this stage it is of interest to investigate the relative importance of each of the parameters in table 2 in influencing in the measured ice resistance fig 1 shows the scatter plots between each of the parameters i e 4 ship features 2 ice features and 1 interaction feature and ice resistance 220 data points are plotted in each plot of fig 1 numbers in fig 1 represent the pearson correlation coefficients between each parameter and the measured ice resistance the pearson correlation coefficient defined in eq 14 is normally employed to quantify the linear relationship between an input and an output variable a strong correlation is close to 1 or 1 while a value close to 0 indicates almost no correlation 14 ρ x y c o v x y σ x σ y where ρ x y is the pearson correlation coefficient c o v x y is the covariance of variables x and y σ x and σ y are the standard deviation of x and y a larger ρ x y means a stronger dependence between the two variables comparatively the numbers in fig 1 show that the ice resistance has the strongest linear dependence on the ship breadth ρ x y 0 63 and ice thickness ρ x y 0 62 less linear dependence on the ship length ρ x y 0 53 and the ship draft ρ x y 0 50 and little linear dependence on the ice flexural strength ρ x y 0 09 the ship velocity ρ x y 0 19 and the stem angle ρ x y 0 22 however it should be noted that we cannot simply conclude that there is no relationship between ship speed stem angle and ice flexural strength from the pearson correlation analysis which identifies only the univariate and linear relationship interestingly keinonen et al 1996 suggests that no evident influence from ice strength was found on the ice resistance when the transit speed is above 1 m s moreover according to numerical model studies e g valanto 2006 valanto 2001b valanto 2001a it was found out that the ice submergence phase contributes to the majority part of the ice resistance i e r s 50 r i c e and according to the lindqvist formula 1989 in eq 7 the ice submergence phase induced resistance r s is linearly increasing with ice thickness h and ship width b this can explain the relative importance of ice thickness and ship width 4 prediction model using the artificial neural network the artificial neural network ann is one of the main tools applied in machine learning it is intended for modelling the brain inspired systems to replicate the way that human s learning process the important feature of the networks is their adaptive nature where learning by examples replaces programming in solving problems zurada 1997 in this paper the design of the ann model is shown in fig 2 it is a three layer perceptron model that consists of an input a hidden and an output layer the number of neurons in the hidden layer is set to equal to the number of variables considered in the model however it can be adjusted when convergence problems occur the input layer contains the input vectors p of a given length the hidden layer takes the input vectors and it multiplies the input vectors by a weight matrix u and adds the bias vector b in the hidden layer the calculated vectors u p b are entered into the nonlinear activation function to realize a nonlinear mapping between input and output there are many types of nonlinear activation functions with different characteristics such as the hyperbolic tangent function and the sigmoid function in this study the hyperbolic tangent function which is the most frequently used activation function because of its fast convergence was applied gomes et al 2011 before entering into the activation function the input data for training purpose need to be normalized this is to ensure all variables are treated equally an adequate normalization for the input and output data is of importance for calculation efficiency and accuracy sola and sevilla 1997 in this study all data were normalized to within the range of 1 1 through eq 15 finally the activated vectors enter the output layer in which a bias value s is added to yield the output y all the calculation process can be expressed in vector notations as shown in eq 16 15 x n 2 x r x m i n x m a x x m i n 1 16 y s w t tanh u p b where x n is the normalized value x r is the original value x m i n and x m a x are the minimum and maximum values of x r respectively to estimate the model accuracy and deal with the typical problem of over fitting the original dataset for the neural network model is randomly divided into training validation and testing datasets the training dataset is used to derive the weights of connections between neurons i e to fit the parameters of the neural network model successively the performance of the fitted model is evaluated based on the validation dataset and the parameters are tuned to prevent overfitting the creation of the neural network model is completed based on these two datasets the test dataset is used to perform an unbiased evaluation for the final model the division ratio of each dataset can vary depending on the size of the dataset or the nature of the dataset however commonly used division ratios are 80 10 10 70 15 15 and 60 20 20 for training validation and testing respectively if the size of the dataset is not large as in this study a small test ratio i e 10 or 15 may lead to inconsistent results to this end a sensitivity study was conducted on one example a neural network model considering the seven variables in table 3 performances for each model with different division ratio for the same dataset were evaluated using eq 17 as a result of conducting five trials for each ratio the performance in different trials shows larger variations in the case of 80 10 10 while the case of 60 20 20 shows relatively consistent performances fig 3 this is as expected because the performance of the model depends more on the selected test data when the test ratio is small therefore 60 20 20 was chosen as the data division ratio in this study after the training and validation a neural network model is made and the model is tested using the remaining 20 of the original data the model performance was evaluated using the mean squared error mse in eq 17 then we use the levenberg marquardt lm optimization algorithm to minimize the error function the lm optimization algorithm is a backpropagation function based on calculating the second derivatives of a cost function viejo et al 2019 which is a measure on how wrong a machine learning model is in terms of its ability to estimate the relationship between inputs and outputs the lm algorithm is an alternative of the gauss newton algorithm and the gradient descent method markopoulos et al 2016 17 m s e 1 n y y ˆ 2 where n is the number of data y is the predicted output and y ˆ is the target case studies have been conducted by varying the number of variables to develop an optimal prediction model six cases were made based on the seven variables considered in chapter 3 see table 4 the ann models for each case are tested the training of each model is stopped when the best validation performance occurs fig 4 shows the ann performance of case 1 with respect to the mean square error for training validation and testing the training was terminated at epoch 5 where the mean squared error for validation reached a minimum and became almost stationary here epoch represents the number of iterations in the entire training heaton 2008 fig 5 shows the regression plots for the test data of each case the dashed line represents the perfect prediction where calculated outputs equal to the targets y y ˆ the solid line represents the best fitting linear regression between the predicted outputs and the targets the r value on the top of the graph indicates the pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted outputs and the targets as shown in eq 14 in addition to the pearson correlation coefficients which merely evaluate a linear relationship this study further employs the index of agreement i to evaluate the model performance in terms of the observation and predictions the index of agreement is generally used to measure the prediction error of a model and it represents the ratio of the mean squared error and the potential error as given in eq 18 willmott 1981 18 i 1 i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 n y i y ˆ y ˆ i y ˆ 2 where n is the number of samples y i and y ˆ i are the predicted and target values respectively y ˆ is the average of the target values the performance of the ann models is summarized in table 5 case 1 which features an input vector of seven variables scores the highest pearson correlation coefficient r and index of agreement i suggesting the highest performance among all cases nevertheless all other models also show good prediction performance with the index of agreement of around 0 9 in particular case 6 shows a high prediction accuracy despite its limited input numbers i e only three variables it can be seen that comparatively the ship breadth ice thickness and ship speed have a large influence on the ice resistance this is in accordance to the ice submergence phase formulation r s in eq 7 5 application of the prediction models to full scale measurement data the ann models developed in this study were applied to full scale measurement data of two different ice going ships which are not used for training the ann models and stands for the remaining 20 of the data the results are compared with those that are calculated by other semi empirical formulas these two ice going ships are 1 otso which is a finnish icebreaker built in 1986 and 2 the us coast guard icebreaker polar star which was built in 1976 the main parameters for ice resistance calculations are shown in table 6 the ann models developed previously are based on six different cases however we shall present the results from three of the cases these are case 1 that considers all seven parameters and case 2 that considers six parameters and case 5 that considers only four parameters although the model for case 6 shows a relatively good result in the performance evaluation due to its obvious physical limitation i e no ice properties are considered we choose the model of case 5 which additionally considers the ice flexural strength each input is normalized before using the predicted ann model and the derived output is denormalized the minimum and maximum values for normalization and denormalization according to eq 15 are shown in table 7 note here that the maximum and minimum numbers are determined by the data availability thus an inherent limitation exists in the developed ann model due to the data limitation for example if the ice thickness applied to prediction exceeds 1 6 m this neural network model cannot be used because it is outside the data range

among the results derived from the three ann models from the six semi empirical methods and the full scale measurement data for otso parameters required for the calculation of the semi empirical equation are obtained from erceg and ehlers 2017 comparing the results calculated by the semi empirical methods with the measured data except for vance 1980 and lewis et al 1982 the results calculated by the other four methods show good agreement in particular the methods by lindqvist 1989 and riska et al 1998 yield rather satisfactory predictions however it should be noted that the lindqvist 1989 method was developed based on the measurements of otso and the model by riska et al 1998 was made by modifying three existing equations including the lindqvist s equation therefore the measured data from otso were already implicitly included calibrated in these two models zahn and phillips 1987 fit relatively well in the speed range 1 5 3 but larger deviation is observed at a higher transit speed the model by keinonen et al 1991 1996 also shows a relatively good match this is also understandable since the keinonen et al 1991 1996 model is based on the results of 18 important icebreakers including otso with regard to the comparison with the ann models it shows that the four variables ann model i e case 5 yields poor predictions on the other hand the seven variable based ann model case 1 and the six variable based ann model case 2 match well at a low transit speed range i e it shows minor difference at around 2 7 m s but a large difference at around 4 m s this can be explained from the data distribution in fig 1 from the speed plot it can be seen that most of the data are distributed below 3 m s it is expected that better predictions will be obtained if more data from 2 7 m s to 4 m s are collected the results comparison for polar star is presented in fig 7 different from the comparison made in the otso s case in fig 6 the seven variable based ann model case 1 and the empirical calculations that are based on models of lindqvist 1989 keinonen et al 1991 1996 and riska et al 1998 are not adopted because the lack of detailed hull geometry when plotted for different thicknesses in a b and c of fig 7 none of the semi empirical methods yield satisfactory results the results of vance 1980 and lewis et al 1982 match well only for the 0 5 m and 1 8 m ice thickness conditions respectively large deviations are found under other conditions in case of predictions by the ann the four variable based results case 5 showed good prediction for the 1 8 m ice thickness condition whereas poor performances are shown under other conditions the good agreement under the 1 8 m ice thickness condition is perplexing as the model was not trained in such ice thickness in the case of the six variables based ann model case 2 the prediction was not good under the 1 8 m ice thickness condition similarly the poor results are shown in the range when the transit speed is larger than 3 m s however in the range where sufficient data was prepared i e in the transit speed of less than 3 m s for the ice thickness of 0 5 m and 1 2 m the predictions are quite good based on these results it is expected that better performance can be achieved if more data is available 6 discussions this paper collects a large amount of experimental data from both the model ice tank and the field to train to build and to validate a series of artificial neural network ann models correlating the inputs e g different ship ice and interaction parameters and outputs i e ice resistance directly based on simply initial data correlation studies it is found that comparatively the most important parameters that influence the overall ice resistance are ship width ice thickness and interaction velocity b h v this is particularly illustrated by the index of agreement which is larger than 0 9 in table 5 for the ann model of case 6 to explain such comparative importance of b h and v we may need to use the lindqvist formula 1989 in eq 7 in which the ice submergence phase induced resistance r s is linearly increasing with ice thickness h and ship width b additionally the total ice resistance r i c e is also linearly scaled with the interaction velocity v in eq 7 this might explain the physical importance of b h and v with regard to other terms the ship length l is a measure of how much ice rubble is beneath the entire ship and in eq 7 lindqvist 1989 assumed a 70 constant coverage beneath the ship length thus we have the coefficient 0 7 in the formula however recent numerical evidence indicates that the amount of ice rubble coverage beneath the ship is not directly scaled with ship length when the ship length is beyond certain value raza et al 2019 lubbad et al 2018 this might explain the less importance of ship length in the formula the ice flexural strength σ f exists in the formulation of the ice crushing r c and ice bending r b s formulation as partially discussed for the pearson correlation coefficients in fig 1 these two terms are comparatively smaller comparing with the ice submergence term i e r s according to related numerical results valanto 2001a 2001b 2006 bib valanto 2006 bib valanto 2001b bib valanto 2001a lubbad and løset 2011 this explains why σ f is relatively less important comparing to the b h and v values however it is important to stress the premises of such comparative importance i e we are considering level ice resistance in other conditions for example in a broken ice field the importance of ice fracture in ice resistance calculation becomes larger lu et al 2015a 2015b 2016 bib lu et al 2016 bib lu et al 2015a bib lu et al 2015b therefore the parameter σ f also becomes relatively more important this straightforward data analysis agrees well with the underlying physical process in terms of ice resistance in level ice this signifies the correctness of our collected data and corresponding data analysis following the methods of ann see fig 2 we trained developed and validated six ann models this data driven approach is rather different form the previously physical process based and or empirical based approaches the advantages and disadvantages of the ann models are discussed in the following on the disadvantageous side 1 this method is not physically based therefore we need to be cautious about the produced model and have a good understanding on the feasibility of input variables choices the method utilized is essentially driven by available data high quality and comprehensive data are needed to construct a trustworthy model in this study we utilized 220 datasets to derive six ann models the validation against two ice going ships appears to be promising however are still far from perfect the trend observed i e better agreement with more available data and vice versa signifies the importance of improving the models by feeding them with more data for training purpose 2 as shown by the normalization procedure see eq 15 of the model s algorithm the developed model can only be applied in a range where enough data are prepared its generality is questionable beyond the available training data the usage of the developed formulas in eq 19 should be followed by its limitation stated in table 7 however the advantage of the ann models should not be underestimated in the current paper particularly with the increasing of data and computational power 1 the method builds a straightforward analytical model often in the form of a system of equations expressed in matrix forms comparing to the empirical formulas and numerical simulations it is rather efficient and can be utilized in large scale simulations e g for probabilistic studies in generating sufficient ice load resistance data jordaan 2001 2 the method directly utilizes the measured data and can potentially discover important physical processes parameters that are unknown to existing physical and mechanical descriptions for example in this paper through the model development we re discovered the relatively importance of the ship width ice thickness and interaction velocity in calculating the ice resistance as discussed previously 7 a suggestion for further study there is no doubt that a better understanding of the physics behind the ship ice interaction helps to estimate more accurate ice resistance however since the method used in this study is a completely statistical method which involves no detailed physical process as a suggestion for further study we propose to develop sub ann models corresponding to major physical processes that contributes to the calculation of ice resistance afterwards the final ann model can be derived as a combination of all the sub ann models for example in lindqvist s equation ice resistance is calculated through a combination of crushing breaking by bending and submersion terms with some numerical factors here the method we propose is to developed ann models for each component for crushing term the ice property can be a very important factor therefore an ann model to calculate the crushing force can be made based on numerous experimental data of kellner et al 2019 the combination of various parameters such as elastic modulus ice compressible strength and so forth enables a more sophisticated crushing force prediction model in case of the breaking by bending term not only the ice property but also the geometric characteristics of the ice and ice structure interaction mechanisms are involved relevant experiments or numerical simulation results can be used in training the model nowadays simulation technology is very developed so a well established simulation model can generate a lot of training data similarly the submersion model also can be made based on experimental or simulation results keijdener et al 2018 li et al 2020 and lu et al 2012 2014a 2015b can be referred to for experiments or simulations for each component calculation in this way it is possible to perform a high precision calculation for each physical process and to tune the relationship of each component using a numerical factor based on comparison with experimental data the calculation formula made in this way can increase the degree of calculation by minimizing assumptions that are inevitably included in the existing empirical method in addition by applying the probabilistic ann technique the force of each component can be probabilistically calculated and in this case error or uncertainty can be considered in the model 8 conclusions different methods are available to calculate the ice resistance of an ice going vessel among these different methods the semi empirical ice resistance prediction methods are cost effective and widely used in the initial design stage of ice going ships however these methods generality may often be limited by the characteristics of the vessel based on which these empirical formulae were developed additional work and additional parameters are often needed to continuously extend these formulas in this study from a rather different perspective we introduced a data driven prediction model based on the artificial neural networks ann that can compensate for the disadvantages of the semi empirical methods the artificial neural networks ann is demonstrated to be able to efficiently model the nonlinear and complex systems without any prior assumptions and complex equations in addition given the proposed theoretical framework the form of the formulation remains unchanged irrespective of the number of input variables see e g eq 16 the flexibility in extending the ann models proposed in this paper is thus demonstrated following the proposed ann framework in fig 2 and eq 16 we developed six ann models in predicting ice resistance with different amount of input parameters these models were trained and developed based on the use of 220 datasets from model scale and full scale ice resistance measurements of ice going ships with different characteristics all six models demonstrate reasonable predictions capabilities see table 5 based on the results in table 5 we found that the ship width ice thickness and transit velocity are the most important parameters in evaluating the level ice resistance of an ice going vessel this finding is in accordance with the physical importance of the ice submergence phase formulated in the lindqvist formula 1986 next the three most promising ann models are further validated against unused data comparisons are made among the three ann models existing semi empirical formulae and measurements based on the result the following conclusions are further drawn the developed ann models show promising comparisons with the available field measurements the model considering a small number of input variables show poor prediction even if sufficient input variables were considered the ann model still suffers in the range where the trained data is scarce on the other hand with sufficient training data and input variables the corresponding ann models demonstrate a favorable agreement with measurement the model is considered to be more advantageous than the evaluated semi empirical models in the sense that 1 the developed models are if not more at least equally simple 2 the models can take into account more physical quantities such as ship parameters ice properties and interaction characteristics without further complication of the formulas and 3 the ann model is based on similar data that the semi empirical formulae were developed implicitly this means the ann model encompasses more enriched information than individual semi empirical formula in this study only stem angle was considered among various hull form related parameters due to lack of data additional consideration of the stem angle allowed for more sophisticated regression if the bow form type as well as the water entry angle and bow flare angle are considered in the model more accurate prediction will be possible the major contribution of this paper is the ann model described in eq 19 based on which ice resistance of various ice going ships in various ice thickness can be evaluated however the ann model is data driven this means that more high quality and comprehensive data is needed to constantly improve the model if the model is not built on sufficient data reliable results cannot be expected in addition the developed model can only be applied in the range where the data are prepared and normalized therefore for the general prediction model the range of data used must be sufficiently wide in this paper the usage of eq 19 should be applied with joint consideration of the training data range presented in table 6 credit authorship

21458,ice resistance is affected by many parameters i e ship geometries ice properties and interaction properties over the years various methods ranging from empirical semi empirical numerical methods and various of their combinations were developed to calculate the ice resistance with certain degree of success in this study from a brand new perspective a data driven approach for estimating ice resistance based on the artificial neural network was proposed the artificial neural network ann is one of the main tools for machine learning it can accurately and efficiently correlate directly the inputs and outputs of complex and nonlinear systems such as the ice resistance calculation system this physical system involves several interaction phases and at least three groups of input parameters i e ship ice and interaction characteristics following the basic idea of ann we trained and built six ann models based on datasets that were collected over past decades involving both model tests and full scale measurements the six different ann models differ in the amount of input parameters based on comparative studies among all the input parameters i e 7 variables in total ship length ship breadth ship draft stem angle ship speed ice flexural strength and ice thickness we found that the ship breadth ice thickness and ship speed have the largest influence on the calculation of ice resistance afterwards the 7 variable ann model s prediction was compared with existing semi empirical methods and measurements and favorable agreement was achieved with fairly simple matrix form formulas i e eq 19 the formula offers another simple yet reliable approach to calculate ice resistance however since the method is data driven high quality data are always needed in improving the predicting capability of the relevant ann model following the methodology outlined in this paper keywords ice going ship ice resistance artificial neural networks semi empirical ice resistance prediction method 1 introduction the performance of ice going ships is normally defined by the ability to freely transit in level ice a good icebreaking performance is manifested by low ice resistance efficient propulsion and the maintenance of the continuous ice breaking mode myland and ehlers 2014 i e without reverting to the intermittent ramming mode ashton 1986 there are several approaches to calculate the ice resistance for a given ice going ship such as by full scale field measurements model scale tests in ice basins numerical simulations and semi empirical methods the use of full scale measurements is considered as the most reliable approach but it involves high costs and its inflexibility in varying the hull form and or ice conditions ice resistance predicted by model scale basin tests is relatively less expensive but requires a good understanding about ice scaling to obtain reliable results additionally the model scale tests are also suffering from limited boundary conditions which are not necessarily present in nature thanks to the increase in computational power numerical simulations as one of the least expensive alternatives and because of its versatility in varying different parameters have gained popularity in recent years e g konno et al 2011 lubbad and løset 2011 metrikin and løset 2013 daley et al 2012 zhou et al 2013 su et al 2010 tan et al 2013 lu et al 2014b however numerical methods often rely on many practical assumptions and above all require a thorough understanding of ice mechanics and ice structure interactions løset et al 2006 palmer and croasdale 2013 sanderson 1988 another school of researchers focus on constructing the ice load history by formulating and quantifying the ice load experienced in each of physical interaction process as carried out by some of the authors valanto 2001b kämäräinen 2007 kotras et al 1983 naegle 1980 lu et al 2014a without going into different interaction processes in this paper we focus on the overall effect of the ice load i e the ice resistance defined as the time average of the longitudinal component of the global or total ice load in riska 2011 in this regard the most cost effective and widely adopted approach in the early design phase is by adopting the semi empirical method such as vance 1980 lewis et al 1982 zahn and phillips 1987 lindqvist 1989 keinonen et al 1991 1996 and riska et al 1998 erceg and ehlers 2017 presented the characteristics of six commonly used semi empirical methods and validated them against measurements of four vessels of different sizes and bow shapes these authors found that when the ship geometry differs a lot from the conventional geometry based on which those empirical formulae were developed discrepancies up to 200 can be encountered therefore it is necessary to develop a new method that takes into account various ship sizes bow geometries and ice conditions because many ice resistance data are available from various model scale and full scale measurements over the years a data driven approach that builds the relationship between various inputs and outputs are considered as a feasible alternative to the authors knowledge studies for the predicting of ice resistance using a data driven approach are rare cho and lee 2015 predicted ice resistance using a multi regression technique based on dimensional analysis linear regression method was applied to the pre selected variables that are considered important based on literature studies however this method suffers from its increasing calculation complexities when the number of variables increases in addition there is a limitation on the form of the formula that can be created in contrast different from traditional regression methods the artificial neural networks ann can efficiently model nonlinear and complex systems without any prior assumptions and complex equations sharifi and mohebbi 2012 given the nonlinearity and complexity of ice ship interactions the ann approach is considered a superior approach in this study the ice resistance of ice going ship is estimated using an artificial neural network technique a number of model tests and full scale measurement results have been collected based on these data a predictor model is developed to investigate the influence of various ship geometry and test condition related variables the developed models were trained by various parameters i e varying ship geometries and test conditions finally the trained model is validated against the remaining unused full scale measurements and existing semi empirical formulas 2 ship resistance in level ice and semi empirical ice resistance prediction methods the total resistance of an ice going ship is usually defined by the sum of ice resistance r i c e and open water resistance r o w as eq 1 this decoupled approach is a practical approach since the open water resistance is normally small compared with the pure ice resistance at the speeds in which ice breaking takes place erceg and ehlers 2017 1 r t o t r i c e r o w the ice resistance can be subdivided into the ice breaking r b and the submersion r s components as eq 2 2 r i c e r b r s the breaking phase begins when the ship starts to contact with the ice cover then crushing of the ice edge occurs and the crushing process continues until the force is sufficient to induce flexural failures in ice the level of the breaking force is strongly dependent on the bow shape and the ice properties the submergence resistance component consists of forces required to push the ice floes downwards and sideways by the hull it can be subdivided into the buoyancy and clearing resistance kim et al 2018 jeong et al 2017 the submerged floes in contact with the ship hull continue to slide along the ship bottom and sideways this increases the frictional forces which affect the submersion resistance among the various semi empirical methods for calculating ice resistance the method by vance 1980 was developed based on the full scale measurement dataset of the uscg katmai bay since only one ship was considered this method may be theoretically difficult to apply to ships of different sizes nevertheless it has been reported to match well with the measurements for vessels of certain sizes erceg and ehlers 2017 the equation consists of a submersion term and a speed dependent term as eq 3 it is noted that the ship length l is not considered in this equation whereas both terms are linearly dependent on the ship breadth b 3 r i c e 55 8583 ρ w ρ i g b h 2 0 0188 σ f v b h g where ρ w and ρ i are the density of water and ice respectively g is the gravitational acceleration h is the ice thickness σ f and v are the flexural strength of ice and the ship velocity respectively next the formulation by lewis et al 1982 was derived from the full scale trials of four ships with lengths ranging from 39 6 to 295 7 m lewis et al 1982 applied dimensional analysis on the available datasets and obtained an equation which includes a strength dependent term and a velocity dependent term as eq 4 4 r i c e 3 8989 0 0123 σ f ρ w g h 0 223 v l g b h ρ w g b h 2 the method by zahn and phillips 1987 was also developed see eqs 5 and 6 based on only one measurement dataset i e uscg mobile bay different from the formulation by vance 1980 ship length is included in both eq 5 and eq 6 in its linear and nonlinear forms respectively the ice resistance calculated by the nonlinear form in eq 6 is characterized by being proportional to the square of the ship speed whereas the linear dependence can be found in many other semi empirical methods as the linear form of eq 5 this method is featured by 5 r i c e 2 231 0 216 v l g b h ρ w g b h 2 6 r i c e 4 254 3 963 10 5 v g b 2 l h 3 ρ w g b h 2 the semi empirical ice resistance calculation method by lindqvist 1989 is one of the most commonly used methods it was developed to identify the main components in ice resistance and to show how ice resistance is affected by the major ship dimensions hull shapes and friction the equation was validated by full scale data of seven different ice going ship in baltic condition lindqvist

and the ice t is the ship draft the method of keinonen et al 1991 1996 were developed based on comprehensive studies on ice resistance they analyzed full scale data and interviewed the operators of eighteen icebreakers the equation of keinonen et al 1991 1996 consists of the summation of the ice resistances at the speed of 1 m s and those above 1 m s in eq 8 because the results showed that the bow form has a significant influence on the ice resistance different formulas are applied depending on the hull form equations for ice resistance calculation at 1 m s are presented in eq 9 for ships with rounded hull forms and in eq 10 for ships with sharply chinned hull forms keinonen et al 1991 equations for resistance increase at the speed above 1 m s are presented in eq 11 for ships with rounded hull forms and in eq 12 for ships with sharply chinned hull forms keinonen et al 1996 unlike the other methods introduced above a hull condition factor c h a water salinity factor c s and an ice surface temperature t are considered in this method in addition a snow cover thickness h s was additionally considered in the ice thickness the hull condition factor indicates the roughness of the hull surface which is included in the friction correction term of the equation the temperature dependent ice surface friction is considered and the ice strength is reflected by the water salinity 8 r

number of numerical factors used in the semi empirical methods described above examining the six methods considered in this paper we can see that more variables and more physical processes are included in these empirical formulas during the course of historical development among them riska s method riska et al 1998 is considered a versatile method as it combines and extends different pre existing methods however the generality of its application can still be discussed as it is still developed from limited types of ships and ice conditions 3 data preparation the artificial neural network technique depends heavily on the available data if the dataset used in training and validation is of low quality or cannot sufficiently describe the involved physics the prediction model shall be of little value therefore sufficient high quality and comprehensive data preparation is necessary effort has been made in this paper to collect relevant data from previously conducted model scale and field scale experiments since full scale data related to the ice resistance are limited we considered only three full scale datasets and all other datasets were from model tests related research papers and ships used for data preparation are summarized in table 2 selection of input variables is required for the application of multivariate regression based on the artificial neural network in this study six variables which are commonly used in the six semi empirical ice resistance prediction methods and one variable related to the hull form are selected as potential input parameters shown in table 3 220 datasets are made available from 22 different tests each dataset consists of the ship length ship breadth ship draft stem angle ship velocity ice thickness ice flexural strength and corresponding ice resistance values all data are presented and studied in full scale i e model scale data are scaled up according to given scaling factors unlike ship related parameters that can be clearly known it is important to use data that minimizes errors or uncertainties for ice related parameters because full scale measurement is likely to include uncertainties although a general neural network was applied in this study a good alternative is to use a stochastic neural network samli 2012 that can take into account errors or uncertainties in the neural networks at this stage it is of interest to investigate the relative importance of each of the parameters in table 2 in influencing in the measured ice resistance fig 1 shows the scatter plots between each of the parameters i e 4 ship features 2 ice features and 1 interaction feature and ice resistance 220 data points are plotted in each plot of fig 1 numbers in fig 1 represent the pearson correlation coefficients between each parameter and the measured ice resistance the pearson correlation coefficient defined in eq 14 is normally employed to quantify the linear relationship between an input and an output variable a strong correlation is close to 1 or 1 while a value close to 0 indicates almost no correlation 14 ρ x y c o v x y σ x σ y where ρ x y is the pearson correlation coefficient c o v x y is the covariance of variables x and y σ x and σ y are the standard deviation of x and y a larger ρ x y means a stronger dependence between the two variables comparatively the numbers in fig 1 show that the ice resistance has the strongest linear dependence on the ship breadth ρ x y 0 63 and ice thickness ρ x y 0 62 less linear dependence on the ship length ρ x y 0 53 and the ship draft ρ x y 0 50 and little linear dependence on the ice flexural strength ρ x y 0 09 the ship velocity ρ x y 0 19 and the stem angle ρ x y 0 22 however it should be noted that we cannot simply conclude that there is no relationship between ship speed stem angle and ice flexural strength from the pearson correlation analysis which identifies only the univariate and linear relationship interestingly keinonen et al 1996 suggests that no evident influence from ice strength was found on the ice resistance when the transit speed is above 1 m s moreover according to numerical model studies e g valanto 2006 valanto 2001b valanto 2001a it was found out that the ice submergence phase contributes to the majority part of the ice resistance i e r s 50 r i c e and according to the lindqvist formula 1989 in eq 7 the ice submergence phase induced resistance r s is linearly increasing with ice thickness h and ship width b this can explain the relative importance of ice thickness and ship width 4 prediction model using the artificial neural network the artificial neural network ann is one of the main tools applied in machine learning it is intended for modelling the brain inspired systems to replicate the way that human s learning process the important feature of the networks is their adaptive nature where learning by examples replaces programming in solving problems zurada 1997 in this paper the design of the ann model is shown in fig 2 it is a three layer perceptron model that consists of an input a hidden and an output layer the number of neurons in the hidden layer is set to equal to the number of variables considered in the model however it can be adjusted when convergence problems occur the input layer contains the input vectors p of a given length the hidden layer takes the input vectors and it multiplies the input vectors by a weight matrix u and adds the bias vector b in the hidden layer the calculated vectors u p b are entered into the nonlinear activation function to realize a nonlinear mapping between input and output there are many types of nonlinear activation functions with different characteristics such as the hyperbolic tangent function and the sigmoid function in this study the hyperbolic tangent function which is the most frequently used activation function because of its fast convergence was applied gomes et al 2011 before entering into the activation function the input data for training purpose need to be normalized this is to ensure all variables are treated equally an adequate normalization for the input and output data is of importance for calculation efficiency and accuracy sola and sevilla 1997 in this study all data were normalized to within the range of 1 1 through eq 15 finally the activated vectors enter the output layer in which a bias value s is added to yield the output y all the calculation process can be expressed in vector notations as shown in eq 16 15 x n 2 x r x m i n x m a x x m i n 1 16 y s w t tanh u p b where x n is the normalized value x r is the original value x m i n and x m a x are the minimum and maximum values of x r respectively to estimate the model accuracy and deal with the typical problem of over fitting the original dataset for the neural network model is randomly divided into training validation and testing datasets the training dataset is used to derive the weights of connections between neurons i e to fit the parameters of the neural network model successively the performance of the fitted model is evaluated based on the validation dataset and the parameters are tuned to prevent overfitting the creation of the neural network model is completed based on these two datasets the test dataset is used to perform an unbiased evaluation for the final model the division ratio of each dataset can vary depending on the size of the dataset or the nature of the dataset however commonly used division ratios are 80 10 10 70 15 15 and 60 20 20 for training validation and testing respectively if the size of the dataset is not large as in this study a small test ratio i e 10 or 15 may lead to inconsistent results to this end a sensitivity study was conducted on one example a neural network model considering the seven variables in table 3 performances for each model with different division ratio for the same dataset were evaluated using eq 17 as a result of conducting five trials for each ratio the performance in different trials shows larger variations in the case of 80 10 10 while the case of 60 20 20 shows relatively consistent performances fig 3 this is as expected because the performance of the model depends more on the selected test data when the test ratio is small therefore 60 20 20 was chosen as the data division ratio in this study after the training and validation a neural network model is made and the model is tested using the remaining 20 of the original data the model performance was evaluated using the mean squared error mse in eq 17 then we use the levenberg marquardt lm optimization algorithm to minimize the error function the lm optimization algorithm is a backpropagation function based on calculating the second derivatives of a cost function viejo et al 2019 which is a measure on how wrong a machine learning model is in terms of its ability to estimate the relationship between inputs and outputs the lm algorithm is an alternative of the gauss newton algorithm and the gradient descent method markopoulos et al 2016 17 m s e 1 n y y ˆ 2 where n is the number of data y is the predicted output and y ˆ is the target case studies have been conducted by varying the number of variables to develop an optimal prediction model six cases were made based on the seven variables considered in chapter 3 see table 4 the ann models for each case are tested the training of each model is stopped when the best validation performance occurs fig 4 shows the ann performance of case 1 with respect to the mean square error for training validation and testing the training was terminated at epoch 5 where the mean squared error for validation reached a minimum and became almost stationary here epoch represents the number of iterations in the entire training heaton 2008 fig 5 shows the regression plots for the test data of each case the dashed line represents the perfect prediction where calculated outputs equal to the targets y y ˆ the solid line represents the best fitting linear regression between the predicted outputs and the targets the r value on the top of the graph indicates the pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted outputs and the targets as shown in eq 14 in addition to the pearson correlation coefficients which merely evaluate a linear relationship this study further employs the index of agreement i to evaluate the model performance in terms of the observation and predictions the index of agreement is generally used to measure the prediction error of a model and it represents the ratio of the mean squared error and the potential error as given in eq 18 willmott 1981 18 i 1 i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 n y i y ˆ y ˆ i y ˆ 2 where n is the number of samples y i and y ˆ i are the predicted and target values respectively y ˆ is the average of the target values the performance of the ann models is summarized in table 5 case 1 which features an input vector of seven variables scores the highest pearson correlation coefficient r and index of agreement i suggesting the highest performance among all cases nevertheless all other models also show good prediction performance with the index of agreement of around 0 9 in particular case 6 shows a high prediction accuracy despite its limited input numbers i e only three variables it can be seen that comparatively the ship breadth ice thickness and ship speed have a large influence on the ice resistance this is in accordance to the ice submergence phase formulation r s in eq 7 5 application of the prediction models to full scale measurement data the ann models developed in this study were applied to full scale measurement data of two different ice going ships which are not used for training the ann models and stands for the remaining 20 of the data the results are compared with those that are calculated by other semi empirical formulas these two ice going ships are 1 otso which is a finnish icebreaker built in 1986 and 2 the us coast guard icebreaker polar star which was built in 1976 the main parameters for ice resistance calculations are shown in table 6 the ann models developed previously are based on six different cases however we shall present the results from three of the cases these are case 1 that considers all seven parameters and case 2 that considers six parameters and case 5 that considers only four parameters although the model for case 6 shows a relatively good result in the performance evaluation due to its obvious physical limitation i e no ice properties are considered we choose the model of case 5 which additionally considers the ice flexural strength each input is normalized before using the predicted ann model and the derived output is denormalized the minimum and maximum values for normalization and denormalization according to eq 15 are shown in table 7 note here that the maximum and minimum numbers are determined by the data availability thus an inherent limitation exists in the developed ann model due to the data limitation for example if the ice thickness applied to prediction exceeds 1 6 m this neural network model cannot be used because it is outside the data range the ann models for case 1 2 and case 5 are presented in eq 19 eq 20 and eq 21 respectively here the subscript of each parameter represented the case number i e p 1 is the inputs for case 1 p 2 is the inputs for case 2 and p 5 is the inputs for case 5 19 y 1 s 1 w 1 t tanh u 1 p 1 b 1 s 1 0 1794 w 1 1 99 2 7814 1 9707 1 1813 2 0298 1 8269 0 9985 1 3432 0 982 p 1 l n b n t n h n σ f n v n ϕ n b 1 0

among the results derived from the three ann models from the six semi empirical methods and the full scale measurement data for otso parameters required for the calculation of the semi empirical equation are obtained from erceg and ehlers 2017 comparing the results calculated by the semi empirical methods with the measured data except for vance 1980 and lewis et al 1982 the results calculated by the other four methods show good agreement in particular the methods by lindqvist 1989 and riska et al 1998 yield rather satisfactory predictions however it should be noted that the lindqvist 1989 method was developed based on the measurements of otso and the model by riska et al 1998 was made by modifying three existing equations including the lindqvist s equation therefore the measured data from otso were already implicitly included calibrated in these two models zahn and phillips 1987 fit relatively well in the speed range 1 5 3 but larger deviation is observed at a higher transit speed the model by keinonen et al 1991 1996 also shows a relatively good match this is also understandable since the keinonen et al 1991 1996 model is based on the results of 18 important icebreakers including otso with regard to the comparison with the ann models it shows that the four variables ann model i e case 5 yields poor predictions on the other hand the seven variable based ann model case 1 and the six variable based ann model case 2 match well at a low transit speed range i e it shows minor difference at around 2 7 m s but a large difference at around 4 m s this can be explained from the data distribution in fig 1 from the speed plot it can be seen that most of the data are distributed below 3 m s it is expected that better predictions will be obtained if more data from 2 7 m s to 4 m s are collected the results comparison for polar star is presented in fig 7 different from the comparison made in the otso s case in fig 6 the seven variable based ann model case 1 and the empirical calculations that are based on models of lindqvist 1989 keinonen et al 1991 1996 and riska et al 1998 are not adopted because the lack of detailed hull geometry when plotted for different thicknesses in a b and c of fig 7 none of the semi empirical methods yield satisfactory results the results of vance 1980 and lewis et al 1982 match well only for the 0 5 m and 1 8 m ice thickness conditions respectively large deviations are found under other conditions in case of predictions by the ann the four variable based results case 5 showed good prediction for the 1 8 m ice thickness condition whereas poor performances are shown under other conditions the good agreement under the 1 8 m ice thickness condition is perplexing as the model was not trained in such ice thickness in the case of the six variables based ann model case 2 the prediction was not good under the 1 8 m ice thickness condition similarly the poor results are shown in the range when the transit speed is larger than 3 m s however in the range where sufficient data was prepared i e in the transit speed of less than 3 m s for the ice thickness of 0 5 m and 1 2 m the predictions are quite good based on these results it is expected that better performance can be achieved if more data is available 6 discussions this paper collects a large amount of experimental data from both the model ice tank and the field to train to build and to validate a series of artificial neural network ann models correlating the inputs e g different ship ice and interaction parameters and outputs i e ice resistance directly based on simply initial data correlation studies it is found that comparatively the most important parameters that influence the overall ice resistance are ship width ice thickness and interaction velocity b h v this is particularly illustrated by the index of agreement which is larger than 0 9 in table 5 for the ann model of case 6 to explain such comparative importance of b h and v we may need to use the lindqvist formula 1989 in eq 7 in which the ice submergence phase induced resistance r s is linearly increasing with ice thickness h and ship width b additionally the total ice resistance r i c e is also linearly scaled with the interaction velocity v in eq 7 this might explain the physical importance of b h and v with regard to other terms the ship length l is a measure of how much ice rubble is beneath the entire ship and in eq 7 lindqvist 1989 assumed a 70 constant coverage beneath the ship length thus we have the coefficient 0 7 in the formula however recent numerical evidence indicates that the amount of ice rubble coverage beneath the ship is not directly scaled with ship length when the ship length is beyond certain value raza et al 2019 lubbad et al 2018 this might explain the less importance of ship length in the formula the ice flexural strength σ f exists in the formulation of the ice crushing r c and ice bending r b s formulation as partially discussed for the pearson correlation coefficients in fig 1 these two terms are comparatively smaller comparing with the ice submergence term i e r s according to related numerical results valanto 2001a 2001b 2006 bib valanto 2006 bib valanto 2001b bib valanto 2001a lubbad and løset 2011 this explains why σ f is relatively less important comparing to the b h and v values however it is important to stress the premises of such comparative importance i e we are considering level ice resistance in other conditions for example in a broken ice field the importance of ice fracture in ice resistance calculation becomes larger lu et al 2015a 2015b 2016 bib lu et al 2016 bib lu et al 2015a bib lu et al 2015b therefore the parameter σ f also becomes relatively more important this straightforward data analysis agrees well with the underlying physical process in terms of ice resistance in level ice this signifies the correctness of our collected data and corresponding data analysis following the methods of ann see fig 2 we trained developed and validated six ann models this data driven approach is rather different form the previously physical process based and or empirical based approaches the advantages and disadvantages of the ann models are discussed in the following on the disadvantageous side 1 this method is not physically based therefore we need to be cautious about the produced model and have a good understanding on the feasibility of input variables choices the method utilized is essentially driven by available data high quality and comprehensive data are needed to construct a trustworthy model in this study we utilized 220 datasets to derive six ann models the validation against two ice going ships appears to be promising however are still far from perfect the trend observed i e better agreement with more available data and vice versa signifies the importance of improving the models by feeding them with more data for training purpose 2 as shown by the normalization procedure see eq 15 of the model s algorithm the developed model can only be applied in a range where enough data are prepared its generality is questionable beyond the available training data the usage of the developed formulas in eq 19 should be followed by its limitation stated in table 7 however the advantage of the ann models should not be underestimated in the current paper particularly with the increasing of data and computational power 1 the method builds a straightforward analytical model often in the form of a system of equations expressed in matrix forms comparing to the empirical formulas and numerical simulations it is rather efficient and can be utilized in large scale simulations e g for probabilistic studies in generating sufficient ice load resistance data jordaan 2001 2 the method directly utilizes the measured data and can potentially discover important physical processes parameters that are unknown to existing physical and mechanical descriptions for example in this paper through the model development we re discovered the relatively importance of the ship width ice thickness and interaction velocity in calculating the ice resistance as discussed previously 7 a suggestion for further study there is no doubt that a better understanding of the physics behind the ship ice interaction helps to estimate more accurate ice resistance however since the method used in this study is a completely statistical method which involves no detailed physical process as a suggestion for further study we propose to develop sub ann models corresponding to major physical processes that contributes to the calculation of ice resistance afterwards the final ann model can be derived as a combination of all the sub ann models for example in lindqvist s equation ice resistance is calculated through a combination of crushing breaking by bending and submersion terms with some numerical factors here the method we propose is to developed ann models for each component for crushing term the ice property can be a very important factor therefore an ann model to calculate the crushing force can be made based on numerous experimental data of kellner et al 2019 the combination of various parameters such as elastic modulus ice compressible strength and so forth enables a more sophisticated crushing force prediction model in case of the breaking by bending term not only the ice property but also the geometric characteristics of the ice and ice structure interaction mechanisms are involved relevant experiments or numerical simulation results can be used in training the model nowadays simulation technology is very developed so a well established simulation model can generate a lot of training data similarly the submersion model also can be made based on experimental or simulation results keijdener et al 2018 li et al 2020 and lu et al 2012 2014a 2015b can be referred to for experiments or simulations for each component calculation in this way it is possible to perform a high precision calculation for each physical process and to tune the relationship of each component using a numerical factor based on comparison with experimental data the calculation formula made in this way can increase the degree of calculation by minimizing assumptions that are inevitably included in the existing empirical method in addition by applying the probabilistic ann technique the force of each component can be probabilistically calculated and in this case error or uncertainty can be considered in the model 8 conclusions different methods are available to calculate the ice resistance of an ice going vessel among these different methods the semi empirical ice resistance prediction methods are cost effective and widely used in the initial design stage of ice going ships however these methods generality may often be limited by the characteristics of the vessel based on which these empirical formulae were developed additional work and additional parameters are often needed to continuously extend these formulas in this study from a rather different perspective we introduced a data driven prediction model based on the artificial neural networks ann that can compensate for the disadvantages of the semi empirical methods the artificial neural networks ann is demonstrated to be able to efficiently model the nonlinear and complex systems without any prior assumptions and complex equations in addition given the proposed theoretical framework the form of the formulation remains unchanged irrespective of the number of input variables see e g eq 16 the flexibility in extending the ann models proposed in this paper is thus demonstrated following the proposed ann framework in fig 2 and eq 16 we developed six ann models in predicting ice resistance with different amount of input parameters these models were trained and developed based on the use of 220 datasets from model scale and full scale ice resistance measurements of ice going ships with different characteristics all six models demonstrate reasonable predictions capabilities see table 5 based on the results in table 5 we found that the ship width ice thickness and transit velocity are the most important parameters in evaluating the level ice resistance of an ice going vessel this finding is in accordance with the physical importance of the ice submergence phase formulated in the lindqvist formula 1986 next the three most promising ann models are further validated against unused data comparisons are made among the three ann models existing semi empirical formulae and measurements based on the result the following conclusions are further drawn the developed ann models show promising comparisons with the available field measurements the model considering a small number of input variables show poor prediction even if sufficient input variables were considered the ann model still suffers in the range where the trained data is scarce on the other hand with sufficient training data and input variables the corresponding ann models demonstrate a favorable agreement with measurement the model is considered to be more advantageous than the evaluated semi empirical models in the sense that 1 the developed models are if not more at least equally simple 2 the models can take into account more physical quantities such as ship parameters ice properties and interaction characteristics without further complication of the formulas and 3 the ann model is based on similar data that the semi empirical formulae were developed implicitly this means the ann model encompasses more enriched information than individual semi empirical formula in this study only stem angle was considered among various hull form related parameters due to lack of data additional consideration of the stem angle allowed for more sophisticated regression if the bow form type as well as the water entry angle and bow flare angle are considered in the model more accurate prediction will be possible the major contribution of this paper is the ann model described in eq 19 based on which ice resistance of various ice going ships in various ice thickness can be evaluated however the ann model is data driven this means that more high quality and comprehensive data is needed to constantly improve the model if the model is not built on sufficient data reliable results cannot be expected in addition the developed model can only be applied in the range where the data are prepared and normalized therefore for the general prediction model the range of data used must be sufficiently wide in this paper the usage of eq 19 should be applied with joint consideration of the training data range presented in table 6 credit authorship

21459,some new built ship shaped offshore structures like fpso or fpu are found to show insufficient course stability due to rough design which makes the towing operation hazardous this paper aims at investigating the stern fin as a proposed solution for improving the poor course stability of a fpso in towing operation by creating a practical approach the fin s hydrodynamic lift coefficient is predicted by the vortex lattice method the numerical towing system is of three degrees of freedoms and accounts for hydrodynamic forces the interactions acting on the hull and other appendages as well as the towing line various hydrodynamic derivatives are considered linear and estimated by the empirical method the configurations of single fin double fins and twin fins as well as the influence on towing stability are studied in particular the hydrodynamic interaction of twin fins lift coefficient reduction and the impact of spacing are analysed different stable and unstable behaviours in the time domain are observed and discussed in depth the eigenvalue analysis is conducted based on the linearized towing system keywords course stability fin vortex lattice method fpso 1 introduction the vessel s course stability ties up with the concept of path keeping it indicates that the vessel is stable in any state of equilibrium or it is moving when disturbed by external force or moment and it will return to the state of equilibrium after release from the disturbing force lewis 1988 the ship shaped offshore structure to be towed such as fpso or fpu should ideally possess sufficient course stability and also acceptable manoeuvring performance however the rough design happens sometimes since the design priority may not be for sailing it produces safety hazard and may cause incident when the towing operation is performed therefore the assessment of course stability is important to avoid unexpected incidents during towing in case of poor stability one practical way to improve is to install the temporary fin at the aft part of the vessel the parameters such as the fin size the number of fin and spacing between fins etc determine how much the fin can improve the course stability and whether it can be improved by modifying the design unfortunately it always requires a tight schedule to diagnose and correct this design defect in reality because the vessel is waiting to be towed nevertheless the existing engineering standards have rarely covered this need and the methodology for design and analysis has not been fully developed and investigated for instance there are some methods to calculate the lift coefficient of fin which is crucial in our case certainly the simplest approach is using empirical expression i e a formula by curve fitting however it requests the availability of experimental data moreover this simple way does not contain the hydrodynamic interaction in case of multiple fins for most cases lewis 1988 another method is using cfd computational fluid dynamics liu et al 2017 hasanvand et al 2019 to deal with the issues e g flow separation in the large angle of attack as it is usually considered as an approach without applicability limitations regarding the angle of attack this method is powerful however the results need to be validated in most instances and the computations are expensive and time consuming the hydrodynamic feature of the fin is similar to the hydrofoil one essential objective is to compute the slope of the lift coefficient i e the derivative of lift coefficient with respect to the angle of attack it should be noted that the angle of attack between the fixed fin and inflow is relatively small which is different from the case of the rudder liang et al 2013a established a theoretical lifting surface model for predicting the hydrodynamic load on the three dimensional hydrofoil with winglets operating beneath a free surface in their model the hydrofoil surface is discretized into a finite number of elements along with the span and chord directions and each element is represented by a horseshoe vortex then liang et al 2013c extended their theory to nonlinear analysis of the unsteady wing in ground wig effect above progressive water waves inspired from their studies the vortex lattice method would be an ideal choice to calculate the fin hydrodynamics in the present study because of the accuracy robustness and efficiency to analyse the vessel s course stability in towing operation a reliable numerical model of the towing system is essential quite a few works have been carried out to study the dynamic motions and behaviour of towing stability bernitsas and kekridis 1985 1986 developed a nonlinear time domain model for the horizontal motions of a ship towed by a nonlinear elastic rope bernitsas and chung 1990 extended the model to take into account the wave and wind force effect and simulated a ship towed by two tug boats lee 1989 adopted a similar approach with bernitsas and kekridis 1985 1986 to simulate a vessel towed by a tug considering the effect of the skeg and also investigated the stability when towed by different rope materials kijima and varyani 1985 studied the effects of wind on the two towed systems as well as various factors including the tow line length the location of the towed points etc sinibaldi and bulian 2014 simulated the towing operation considering 4 degrees of freedom dofs i e traditional horizontal 3dofs plus roll and the bifurcation analysis and occurrence of fishtailing are studied by taking into account the wind fitriadhy and yasukawa 2011 proposed a numerical model for course stability of a towed ship through towline using both nonlinear and linear approaches yasukawa et al 2012 analysed the course stability and yaw motion of a ship travelling under steady wind conditions and fitriadhy et al 2013 analysed the course stability of a towed ship at various angles and velocities of wind actually the governing equations of the towing system are all deduced based on newton s second law the prediction of vessel hydrodynamic derivatives is one of the challenging issues to deal with if model tests data is inaccessible and cfd computation is unrealistic due to capital and schedule limits the empirical formulation is another implementable choice we could rely on the objective of this article is to create a practical approach for analysing fin and the enhancement on the vessel s course stability during towing the theoretical background of the vortex lattice method and the numerical towing system are introduced in sections 2 and 3 the prediction of hydrodynamic derivatives is described in detail in section 4 section 5 elucidates the engineering background of fpso and the stern fin in design considerations in section 6 a verification of the numerical towing system is performed the discussion of the relationship between fin s lift coefficient by the vortex lattice method and the aspect ratio is carried out then the towing system is simulated in the time domain and solved by the fourth order runge kutta method various behaviours of the vessel regarding single fin double fins and twin fins configurations are observed and explained especially the hydrodynamic interference of twin fins configuration is analysed such as lift coefficient reduction as well as the impact due to the spacing lastly the eigenvalue of the jacobian matrix is solved by using the qr algorithm based on the linearised towing system the largest real part of the eigenvalues indicates qualitatively the course stability against various fin configurations equations used to identify the hydrodynamic derivatives and the jacobian matrix are listed in appendices a and b finally concluding remarks are presented in section 7 2 fin hydrodynamic prediction by vortex lattice method the vortex lattice method is widely adopted to calculate the lift force of a three dimensional foil faltinsen 2005 typically a fin surface is a thin streamlined body that moves through the surrounding fluid at a small angle of attack β with a resultant lift force acting on the fin normal to the forward translation which means that the flow separation from the leading edge is negligible suppose that the fin moves with a constant speed u f in the negative x f direction as shown in fig 1 the free surface effect is represented by a mirror with respect to the undisturbed free surface and this assumption holds at a low or moderate forward speed the principal geometrical dimensions of the fin surface consist of the span length s accounting for the mirroring effect and chord length c r measured parallel to the y f and x f axes respectively generally the chord length c r varies spanwise a non dimensional parameter a referred to aspect ratio defined as 1 a s 2 s which describes the relation between span and chord where s is the projected area of the fin surface on the plane o x f z f the aspect ratio is an important parameter to evaluate the significance of the three dimensional effect the key technique of the vortex lattice method lies in dividing the mean camber fin surface into a finite number of quadrilateral elements and each of them is represented by a horseshoe vortex filament the bound vortex of the horseshoe vortex filament is placed on the one quarter line of the element and the free vortices consist of two semi finite vortex filaments stretching afterwards till infinity the collocation point locates at the three quarter chord station measured from the leading edge of the element the velocity components induced by the horseshoe vortex filament can be calculated by the biot savart law newman 1977 which is expressed as 2 u f u f v f w f γ 4 π ℓ r f d l r f 3 where γ and ℓ denote the strength and contour of the horseshoe vortex filament respectively d l represents the differential element of the integration along the contour ℓ and r f stands for the vector to the field point from each point along the curve of integration the kinematic flow condition that zero normal flow passes across the fin s surface should be satisfied at the collocation point which is expressed as 3 v f x f z f ε u f ε x f z f x f where ε represents the function of the mean camber fin s surface as shown in fig 2 by imposing eq 3 on the collocation point of each element we can obtain an equation system with respect to the strength of horseshoe vortex γ m placed on each quadrilateral element where m is the element index as a consequence the lift force exerting on the fin can be calculated through the following formulation newman 1977 4 l f m ρ u f γ m l m cos γ m where l m denotes the length of the bound vortex on the m element and γ m denotes the intersection angle between the bound vortex and y f axis as illustrated in fig 1 the corresponding lift coefficient is 5 c l l f 1 2 ρ u f 2 s 3 numerical model of towing system to describe the towing system two coordinate systems are defined one is the global reference frame o x y z and the other is the body fixed reference frame o x y z in the body fixed frame of reference x y and z axes are defined positive orienting towards bow portside and upward respectively and the origin is defined at the mid ship it is assumed that the centre of gravity is located at the origin the right hand rule is applied to both coordinate systems moreover it should be noted that the reference system in this paper is more typical in seakeeping the towing system using one single fibre rope is illustrated in fig 3 the nonlinear motion equation is established in the body fixed reference frame o x y z considering the hydrodynamic force tug force acting on the vessel and it is written as 6 m u v r x t x m v u r y t y i z r n m z where m and i z are the mass and mass moment of inertia of the vessel respectively in addition u v and r denote the velocity components due to surge sway and yaw motions defined in the body fixed reference frame o x y z u denote the derivative of u with respect to the time t which is written as u d u d t for the variables v and r the same equations are applied x y and n are the velocity dependent hydrodynamic forces and moments t x t y and m z are the towing forces and moments in x y and z directions the prime means that the variables are non dimensional according to the equations presented in table 1 the hydrodynamic force is expressed as follows 7 x r s x v r v r x u u y y v v y r r y v v r v 2 r y v r r v r 2 y v v v v 3 y r r r r 3 y v v y r r n n v v n r r n v v r v 2 r n v r r v r 2 n v v v v 3 n r r r r 3 n v v n r r where r s is the resistance of the towed vessel y v y r n v and n r the linear derivatives y v v r y v r r y v v v y r r r n v v r n v r r n v v v and n r r r the nonlinear derivatives x u y v and n r are the added mass coefficients due to surge sway and yaw motions respectively y r and n v the cross coupling added mass coefficient and x v r the derivative of surge force with respect to v and r here in this expression of formula it is assumed that second order term like x v v and x r r is ignored as there is no notable interaction between viscous and inertia properties of the fluid acceleration and inertial force computed from potential flow theory bernitsas and kekridis 1985 the towing force by the tug can be written as 8 t x t cos γ ψ t y t sin γ ψ m z t x p sin γ ψ where t is the tension of the towing rope x p is the longitudinal coordinate of the towing point with respect to the centre of gravity ψ is the yaw angle of the vessel and γ is the angle between towing rope and translational direction of the tug the nonlinear relationship between the tension and stretched length can be written as 9 t s b p l l 0 l 0 q where s b is the average breaking strength l 0 and l are unstretched and stretched length of the towing rope respectively if l l 0 then t 0 p and q are the empirical constants for the material of the rope the non dimensional terms in eqs 6 9 are listed in table 1 the state variables are defined and the state equation is established as shown in appendix a 4 hydrodynamic derivatives determining the hydrodynamic derivatives is a key procedure for simulating the towing process in this paper both theoretical and empirical methods are adopted and the procedure is described as below in detail the added mass coefficients are determined by the potential flow method 4 1 fin hydrodynamic derivatives the non dimensional derivative of the force in the y direction with respect to the transverse velocity can be expressed as 10 y v f ρ 2 a f u 0 c l β f ρ 2 l 2 u 0 a f c l β f where a f is the area of the fin a f the non dimensional fin area which defined as a f a f l 2 u 0 the resultant velocity m s l the overall length of the ship and c l β f the lift coefficient slope per radian where β stands for the attack angle of the fin it should be noted that eq 10 neglects wake and flow straightening effects the non dimensional derivative of moment about the z axis with respect to transverse velocity can be expressed as 11 n v f y v f x f where x f denotes the non dimensional position along x axis of the fin the non dimensional derivative force in the y axis with respect to angular velocity is expressed as 12 y r f y v f x f the non dimensional derivative of moment about the z axis with respect to angular velocity is 13 n r f y v f x f 2 4 2 hull hydrodynamic derivatives in this section the empirical equations are presented to determine the hydrodynamic derivatives of the bare hull which is a crucial step to determine the total coefficients including the fins indeed the bare hull of the ship can be regarded as a low aspect ratio fin with a large area because of the low aspect ratio characteristics it may be expected that a ship s hull would generate small hydrodynamic forces and moments compared to the rudder however due to the large profile area a ship s hull does in fact generate forces and moments far larger than the control forces generated by the rudder the only difference of each coefficient compared with the formula in lewis 1988 is that the variable used for the non dimensional process is different the non dimensional velocity dependent force derivative for the bare hull is written as 14 y v h y v h ρ 2 l 2 u 0 π t 2 l 2 where the subscript h denotes the bare hull and t is the draught of the vessel the non dimensional derivative of moment about z axis with respect to transverse velocity is written as 15 n v h y v h x u h x v s l y v h where x v s is the distance from the origin to the application point of the lateral force the last term is due to the viscous effect and x v s l 0 25 the non dimensional derivative of force in the y direction with respect to r for the hull is 16 y r h y r h ρ 2 l 3 u 0 t l x u h x v s l y v h similarly the non dimensional derivative of moment about z axis with respect to r is 17 n r h n r h ρ 2 l 4 u 0 t l c p 2 2 y v h where c p denotes the prismatic coefficient of the ship 4 3 prediction of hull hydrodynamics by the potential flow theory to determine the added mass of the ship at the infinite frequency the existing wave radiation diffraction code based on the boundary element method liang et al 2018 wu et al 2018 is adopted the boundary integral equation constructed on the hull surface h is written as 18 2 π ϕ j x h g x ξ n j ξ g x ξ n ξ ϕ j ξ d s with j 1 2 6 where x x y z and ξ ξ η ζ are defined as the flow field point and the source point respectively besides g denotes the green function satisfying the linear free surface boundary condition at infinite frequency i e ϕ 0 and it is expressed as 19 g 1 r 1 d with r d x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 in eq 18 n j means the generalized normal vector which is written as 20 n j n j when j 1 2 3 x x 0 n j 3 when j 4 5 6 where x 0 denotes the coordinate of the reference point by solving the linear system eq 18 ϕ j can be determined and thus the added mass of the ship at infinite frequency can be obtained 21 a i j ρ h ϕ j n i d s 5 fpso particulars and fin configuration 5 1 description of fpso the overall length and the breadth of the fpso are 240 m and 40 m the mean draught and the displacement are 11 m and 90 000 tons the body plan of the vessel is shown in fig 4 the non dimensional parameters such as hydrodynamic derivatives are summarised in table 2 it should be noted that the model is developed to account for nonlinear derivatives however in this fpso case only the linear derivatives are used based on the body plan and draught the hydrodynamic model of fpso can be established the view of the panel models is shown in fig 5 it should be pointed out that we only use linear derivatives to simulate the fpso considering the effect of the fin 5 2 the fin configuration for the fin geometry the aspect ratio ratio of span to mean chord has an important impact on its hydrodynamic behaviours typically a fin of a larger aspect ratio can generate larger lift and lower drag i e higher lift to drag ratio when the configuration of twin fins or multiple fins is deployed the lift coefficients are sensitive to the spacing distance between fins and are not identical to that of a single fin due to interactions fig 6 gives the definition of fin geometry and the angle of attack between incident flow and fin due to the temporary utilisation and cost saving purposes the fin in engineering practice is simply designed in the form of a thin plate and the chord is identical from the tip to root fins are going to be installed at the aft most part of the vessel it should be ensured that the fin and the extra supporting structure would not influence or damage the existing hull structures and appendages once the vessel is towed to the desired site the additional fin is convenient to be dismounted from the vessel and abandoned or retrieved fig 7 shows the sketch of the vessel stern part and additional fin the fin span is restricted mainly by the draught of the vessel in the transit condition and therefore the maximum span in this case is about 9 m the variation of aspect ratio discussed in this paper is roughly from 1 to 3 which is the common range of ship fin and rudder 6 results and discussions 6 1 verification of present numerical towing system the present numerical model of the towing system described in section 3 is validated by comparing to the previous study lee 1989 the vessel particulars hydrodynamic coefficients towing pattern and other parameters are listed in table 3 as shown in fig 8 a satisfactory agreement has been obtained and moreover it can be observed that starting from 0 rad the yaw angle of the towed vessel oscillates for a couple of cycles before it stabilizes at a steady angle fig 8 illustrates an example of a condition associated with a stable asymmetric towing configuration 6 2 simulation of unstable fpso without fin a bare hull fpso was simulated based on the present model and the towing speed is 4 knots in calm water fig 9 shows simulated yaw motion and lateral offset along global y basically the course stability during towing was poor as the vessel kept swaying with the increasing yaw which is clearly shown by observing the curves in the figure the course of the vessel did not stabilize along the central line initial path 6 3 fin lift coefficient the lift coefficient of the fin is predicted by the vortex lattice method which is described in detail in section 2 in general a large amount of elements are not needed however the basic convergence test is still necessary fig 10 depicts lift coefficients of a single fin against the angle of attack in different mesh density the corresponding aspect ratio is 3 i e span and chord 9 m and 3 m respectively the angle of attack is chosen from 0 to 12 as the used numerical method cannot predict stall due to the flow separation from the leading edge at a large angle of attack the lift coefficient gradually converges as an increase in the number of elements in the current case convergence can be obtained with 100 elements actually the key parameter d c l d β shown in eq 10 i e the slope of the lift coefficient plays an important role to improve the course stability it should be figured out that the lift coefficient is calculated in the free space for the purpose of validating the vortex lattice method simulated curves of d c l d β at β 0 versus aspect ratio are shown in fig 11 which is compared to existing model test results in free space katz and plotkin 2001 the comparison shows that the simulation perfectly matches the experimental measurement the vortex lattice method has provided an accurate and reliable prediction over the expected aspect ratio range and even more the figure also shows that with the increase of the aspect ratio d c l d β monotonically increases but the rate of increase gradually declines after aspect ratio equals to 2 6 4 towing stability of fpso with single and double fins for the studies from this section hereafter the aspect ratio of the fin is fixed at 3 which gives the largest lift coefficient slope considering the actual aspect range 1 3 in this case the fourth order runge kutta method is employed to solve numerically the motion eqs 6 9 of the towing system two configurations are discussed in this section i e single fin and double fins the single fin locates in the central line at the stern of the fpso whereas double fins which bear resemblance with the biplane liang et al 2013b locate symmetrically at the portside and starboard which are far enough from each other therefore the impact of lifting force due to fins interaction is negligible the towing speed remains at 4 knots in the simulation as shown in fig 12 the in line towing equilibrium configuration in the single fin is unstable and both slow and fast components of motions are clearly observed the system behaviour is totally different from the one in fig 9 it does not drift away due to the presence of the fin but oscillates around 0 which corresponds to the tow parallel to the tug see fig 3 although in line towing equilibrium configuration in single and double fins are both unstable the yaw motion in single fin exhibits irregular behaviours with fast oscillation of quite a few different frequencies the trajectory map displayed in fig 13 further corroborates the behaviour the offset fig 12 c and d basically shares similar characteristics with yaw however time series are much smoother especially for double fins configuration 6 5 twin fins and the efficiency of the lift coefficient the configuration of multiple fins is a practical solution if a single fin or double fins fail to stabilize the towed vessel when twin fins are applied the interaction among the fins should be properly taken into account because the hydrodynamic characteristics of each fin in twin fins configuration are impacted by the interaction basically the spacing between fins plays a vital role and consequently alters the pressure distribution therefore in this section the spacing and its influence on the lift coefficient is analysed firstly and the impact on the towed vessel stability is discussed later the fin size remains at 9 m span and 3 m chord which gives the aspect ratio 3 the considered range of spacing is 0 5 to 2 times of the chord using the vortex lattice method the lift coefficient of each fin is computed for different spacing and given at different angles of attack according to fig 14 for all five different spacing scenarios the lift coefficient of the fin on the portside identified as fp is different from the one on the starboard identified as fs in fig 6 this difference is magnified when the spacing is small such as 0 25 c r c r is the chord length and the difference further increases at a large angle of attack fig 14 also clearly shows that when the spacing is smaller than 2 0 c r the lift coefficient is lower than that of a single fin the total lift coefficient for the twin fin system is shown in fig 15 and the single fin case is just set twice of its lift coefficient for the comparison purposes not only the lift coefficient but its slope against the angle of attack also increases as the spacing increases which possesses positive effect to improve the course stability fig 15 shows that the hydrodynamic interaction between twin fins is strong enough to affect the effectiveness of the lift coefficient and may be omitted only when the spacing equals to or is larger than twice of the chord length in this study two sets of twin fins are arranged separately on portside and starboard of fpso to avoid the asymmetrical manoeuvring behaviour by solving the numerical model of the towing system figs 16 20 shows yaw and offset in time history of towed fpso by considering twin fins with different spacings the red curves are intentionally added to capture motion peaks as an illustration of the trajectory map in fig 21 both yaw and offset of 0 25 c r and 0 5 c r show more regular responses compared to these in previous single and double fin configurations the yaw and offset series oscillate periodically and increase gradually until a steady amplitude is achieved which shows quite a typical fishtailing characteristics the fpso fails to return to the original trajectory the amplitudes reduce as the fin spacing increases according to table 4 regarding cases of 1 c r 1 5 c r and 2 c r all results show clear decay however the difference is the time they take table 4 presents the corresponding linear damping ratios estimated by the logarithm of response amplitudes and it shows a significant increase in the damping ratio as fin spacing increases as time history demonstrates the towed fpso spent much less time in stabilizing as the fin spacing increases which provides a pretty useful reference for the pilot when conducting the operation in terms of trajectory map fig 21 the largest 2 0 c r case uses the minimum cycles to converge to the stable in line towing configuration 6 6 eigenvalue analysis the time domain solutions have been discussed in detail in the previous sections we are focused on evaluating the towing stability by using the eigenvalue approach as aforementioned the numerical towing system needs to be linearized here the taylor expansion is employed and higher order terms are neglected the expansion point is the state corresponding to the in line towing equilibrium configuration therefore the jacobian matrix of the entire towing system can be obtained the formula of each element in the matrix is derived and listed in appendix b the eigenvalues are then computed by using the qr method watkins 1982 according to the criterion the stable system requires the maximum real part of all eigenvalues to be a negative number fig 22 shows the maximum real part of eigenvalues versus the spacing for all discussed twin fins configurations in addition results of the single fin and twin fins are included as independent data regardless of the spacing the cases of the single and double fins show relatively large positive value which indicates an unstable state cases 0 25 c r and 0 5 c r correspond to unstable in line towing equilibrium configurations for the cases of 1 c r 1 5 c r and 2 c r the maximum real part of eigenvalues are almost zero but negative which means that the in line towing equilibrium configuration is stable in fact it looks like the eigenvalues do not change significantly which implies the improvement of stability is limited under current configurations according to the analysis the contribution of the fin is further verified by the eigenvalue analysis the stability analysis of the in line towing equilibrium configuration based on the determination of eigenvalues of the jacobian is capable of providing appropriate indications on whether the in line towing equilibrium is a stable configuration or not however the short term time domain analysis is still necessary for towing analysis because the output is much more fruitful such as how long does vessel take to stabilize and how much amplitude and what is the motion characteristic which is also important information or reference to the pilot we have carried out simulations for the fpso considering only linear derivatives and this may affect some of the results therefore further assessment would be necessary by introducing also nonlinear derivatives 7 conclusions an efficient method has been developed for the analysis of hydrodynamic properties of fins as well as its enhancement of the fpso s course stability during towing the method consists of the determination of fin s lift coefficient by the vortex lattice method the empirical formulation of hydrodynamic derivatives and a 3dofs numerical model of the towing system the fin s hydrodynamic characteristics and interactions have been discussed first and then followed by the time domain simulations of fpso s yaw and offset in diverse fin configurations the eigenvalue analysis is performed based on a linearised towing system model to cross check for comparison purposes the primary conclusions are summarized as follows in the case of twin fins the spacing influences obviously the lift coefficient the hydrodynamic interaction makes the fin s lift coefficient different from each other especially when the angle of attack is large besides compared with the lift coefficients for the single fin case the ones for twin fins are smaller the interaction is stronger as the spacing becomes smaller and when the spacing is the twice or above the chord length the interaction is inconsequential the slope of the total lift coefficient by twin fins increases gradually as an increase of the spacing which provides a positive contribution to improve the vessel s course stability the time domain analysis shows distinct manoeuvring behaviours the worst case shows fpso s yaw and offset kept drifting without the fin in place by introducing single fin the motions demonstrate clearly the combination of slow and fast components and can oscillate around the initial location but shows irregular characteristics however these are minimal compared to the large amplitude low frequency motion by introducing twin fins the motions oscillated periodically and increased gradually until a constant amplitude is reached which shows typical fishtailing characteristics as an increase of the spacing of twin fins the yaw and offset started to decay after the first peak and eventually returned to the original path compared to the time domain analysis the analysis of the eigenvalues based on the linearized towing system produces quick results and can indicate whether the in line towing equilibrium configuration is stable nevertheless the short term time domain study provides much more information such as how long does vessel take to stabilize and how much amplitude and what is the motion characteristic which are all useful references to the pilot during the towing operation it should be noted that we use only linear derivatives for simulating the fpso and further assessment would be necessary by introducing nonlinear derivatives from an engineering point of view the fin at stern could be a pragmatic and economical solution in case of inadequate course stability moreover as a temporary appendage it does not require any modification on the vessel s primary structure and it is easy to be dismantled credit authorship contribution statement binbin li

21459,some new built ship shaped offshore structures like fpso or fpu are found to show insufficient course stability due to rough design which makes the towing operation hazardous this paper aims at investigating the stern fin as a proposed solution for improving the poor course stability of a fpso in towing operation by creating a practical approach the fin s hydrodynamic lift coefficient is predicted by the vortex lattice method the numerical towing system is of three degrees of freedoms and accounts for hydrodynamic forces the interactions acting on the hull and other appendages as well as the towing line various hydrodynamic derivatives are considered linear and estimated by the empirical method the configurations of single fin double fins and twin fins as well as the influence on towing stability are studied in particular the hydrodynamic interaction of twin fins lift coefficient reduction and the impact of spacing are analysed different stable and unstable behaviours in the time domain are observed and discussed in depth the eigenvalue analysis is conducted based on the linearized towing system keywords course stability fin vortex lattice method fpso 1 introduction the vessel s course stability ties up with the concept of path keeping it indicates that the vessel is stable in any state of equilibrium or it is moving when disturbed by external force or moment and it will return to the state of equilibrium after release from the disturbing force lewis 1988 the ship shaped offshore structure to be towed such as fpso or fpu should ideally possess sufficient course stability and also acceptable manoeuvring performance however the rough design happens sometimes since the design priority may not be for sailing it produces safety hazard and may cause incident when the towing operation is performed therefore the assessment of course stability is important to avoid unexpected incidents during towing in case of poor stability one practical way to improve is to install the temporary fin at the aft part of the vessel the parameters such as the fin size the number of fin and spacing between fins etc determine how much the fin can improve the course stability and whether it can be improved by modifying the design unfortunately it always requires a tight schedule to diagnose and correct this design defect in reality because the vessel is waiting to be towed nevertheless the existing engineering standards have rarely covered this need and the methodology for design and analysis has not been fully developed and investigated for instance there are some methods to calculate the lift coefficient of fin which is crucial in our case certainly the simplest approach is using empirical expression i e a formula by curve fitting however it requests the availability of experimental data moreover this simple way does not contain the hydrodynamic interaction in case of multiple fins for most cases lewis 1988 another method is using cfd computational fluid dynamics liu et al 2017 hasanvand et al 2019 to deal with the issues e g flow separation in the large angle of attack as it is usually considered as an approach without applicability limitations regarding the angle of attack this method is powerful however the results need to be validated in most instances and the computations are expensive and time consuming the hydrodynamic feature of the fin is similar to the hydrofoil one essential objective is to compute the slope of the lift coefficient i e the derivative of lift coefficient with respect to the angle of attack it should be noted that the angle of attack between the fixed fin and inflow is relatively small which is different from the case of the rudder liang et al 2013a established a theoretical lifting surface model for predicting the hydrodynamic load on the three dimensional hydrofoil with winglets operating beneath a free surface in their model the hydrofoil surface is discretized into a finite number of elements along with the span and chord directions and each element is represented by a horseshoe vortex then liang et al 2013c extended their theory to nonlinear analysis of the unsteady wing in ground wig effect above progressive water waves inspired from their studies the vortex lattice method would be an ideal choice to calculate the fin hydrodynamics in the present study because of the accuracy robustness and efficiency to analyse the vessel s course stability in towing operation a reliable numerical model of the towing system is essential quite a few works have been carried out to study the dynamic motions and behaviour of towing stability bernitsas and kekridis 1985 1986 developed a nonlinear time domain model for the horizontal motions of a ship towed by a nonlinear elastic rope bernitsas and chung 1990 extended the model to take into account the wave and wind force effect and simulated a ship towed by two tug boats lee 1989 adopted a similar approach with bernitsas and kekridis 1985 1986 to simulate a vessel towed by a tug considering the effect of the skeg and also investigated the stability when towed by different rope materials kijima and varyani 1985 studied the effects of wind on the two towed systems as well as various factors including the tow line length the location of the towed points etc sinibaldi and bulian 2014 simulated the towing operation considering 4 degrees of freedom dofs i e traditional horizontal 3dofs plus roll and the bifurcation analysis and occurrence of fishtailing are studied by taking into account the wind fitriadhy and yasukawa 2011 proposed a numerical model for course stability of a towed ship through towline using both nonlinear and linear approaches yasukawa et al 2012 analysed the course stability and yaw motion of a ship travelling under steady wind conditions and fitriadhy et al 2013 analysed the course stability of a towed ship at various angles and velocities of wind actually the governing equations of the towing system are all deduced based on newton s second law the prediction of vessel hydrodynamic derivatives is one of the challenging issues to deal with if model tests data is inaccessible and cfd computation is unrealistic due to capital and schedule limits the empirical formulation is another implementable choice we could rely on the objective of this article is to create a practical approach for analysing fin and the enhancement on the vessel s course stability during towing the theoretical background of the vortex lattice method and the numerical towing system are introduced in sections 2 and 3 the prediction of hydrodynamic derivatives is described in detail in section 4 section 5 elucidates the engineering background of fpso and the stern fin in design considerations in section 6 a verification of the numerical towing system is performed the discussion of the relationship between fin s lift coefficient by the vortex lattice method and the aspect ratio is carried out then the towing system is simulated in the time domain and solved by the fourth order runge kutta method various behaviours of the vessel regarding single fin double fins and twin fins configurations are observed and explained especially the hydrodynamic interference of twin fins configuration is analysed such as lift coefficient reduction as well as the impact due to the spacing lastly the eigenvalue of the jacobian matrix is solved by using the qr algorithm based on the linearised towing system the largest real part of the eigenvalues indicates qualitatively the course stability against various fin configurations equations used to identify the hydrodynamic derivatives and the jacobian matrix are listed in appendices a and b finally concluding remarks are presented in section 7 2 fin hydrodynamic prediction by vortex lattice method the vortex lattice method is widely adopted to calculate the lift force of a three dimensional foil faltinsen 2005 typically a fin surface is a thin streamlined body that moves through the surrounding fluid at a small angle of attack β with a resultant lift force acting on the fin normal to the forward translation which means that the flow separation from the leading edge is negligible suppose that the fin moves with a constant speed u f in the negative x f direction as shown in fig 1 the free surface effect is represented by a mirror with respect to the undisturbed free surface and this assumption holds at a low or moderate forward speed the principal geometrical dimensions of the fin surface consist of the span length s accounting for the mirroring effect and chord length c r measured parallel to the y f and x f axes respectively generally the chord length c r varies spanwise a non dimensional parameter a referred to aspect ratio defined as 1 a s 2 s which describes the relation between span and chord where s is the projected area of the fin surface on the plane o x f z f the aspect ratio is an important parameter to evaluate the significance of the three dimensional effect the key technique of the vortex lattice method lies in dividing the mean camber fin surface into a finite number of quadrilateral elements and each of them is represented by a horseshoe vortex filament the bound vortex of the horseshoe vortex filament is placed on the one quarter line of the element and the free vortices consist of two semi finite vortex filaments stretching afterwards till infinity the collocation point locates at the three quarter chord station measured from the leading edge of the element the velocity components induced by the horseshoe vortex filament can be calculated by the biot savart law newman 1977 which is expressed as 2 u f u f v f w f γ 4 π ℓ r f d l r f 3 where γ and ℓ denote the strength and contour of the horseshoe vortex filament respectively d l represents the differential element of the integration along the contour ℓ and r f stands for the vector to the field point from each point along the curve of integration the kinematic flow condition that zero normal flow passes across the fin s surface should be satisfied at the collocation point which is expressed as 3 v f x f z f ε u f ε x f z f x f where ε represents the function of the mean camber fin s surface as shown in fig 2 by imposing eq 3 on the collocation point of each element we can obtain an equation system with respect to the strength of horseshoe vortex γ m placed on each quadrilateral element where m is the element index as a consequence the lift force exerting on the fin can be calculated through the following formulation newman 1977 4 l f m ρ u f γ m l m cos γ m where l m denotes the length of the bound vortex on the m element and γ m denotes the intersection angle between the bound vortex and y f axis as illustrated in fig 1 the corresponding lift coefficient is 5 c l l f 1 2 ρ u f 2 s 3 numerical model of towing system to describe the towing system two coordinate systems are defined one is the global reference frame o x y z and the other is the body fixed reference frame o x y z in the body fixed frame of reference x y and z axes are defined positive orienting towards bow portside and upward respectively and the origin is defined at the mid ship it is assumed that the centre of gravity is located at the origin the right hand rule is applied to both coordinate systems moreover it should be noted that the reference system in this paper is more typical in seakeeping the towing system using one single fibre rope is illustrated in fig 3 the nonlinear motion equation is established in the body fixed reference frame o x y z considering the hydrodynamic force tug force acting on the vessel and it is written as 6 m u v r x t x m v u r y t y i z r n m z where m and i z are the mass and mass moment of inertia of the vessel respectively in addition u v and r denote the velocity components due to surge sway and yaw motions defined in the body fixed reference frame o x y z u denote the derivative of u with respect to the time t which is written as u d u d t for the variables v and r the same equations are applied x y and n are the velocity dependent hydrodynamic forces and moments t x t y and m z are the towing forces and moments in x y and z directions the prime means that the variables are non dimensional according to the equations presented in table 1 the hydrodynamic force is expressed as follows 7 x r s x v r v r x u u y y v v y r r y v v r v 2 r y v r r v r 2 y v v v v 3 y r r r r 3 y v v y r r n n v v n r r n v v r v 2 r n v r r v r 2 n v v v v 3 n r r r r 3 n v v n r r where r s is the resistance of the towed vessel y v y r n v and n r the linear derivatives y v v r y v r r y v v v y r r r n v v r n v r r n v v v and n r r r the nonlinear derivatives x u y v and n r are the added mass coefficients due to surge sway and yaw motions respectively y r and n v the cross coupling added mass coefficient and x v r the derivative of surge force with respect to v and r here in this expression of formula it is assumed that second order term like x v v and x r r is ignored as there is no notable interaction between viscous and inertia properties of the fluid acceleration and inertial force computed from potential flow theory bernitsas and kekridis 1985 the towing force by the tug can be written as 8 t x t cos γ ψ t y t sin γ ψ m z t x p sin γ ψ where t is the tension of the towing rope x p is the longitudinal coordinate of the towing point with respect to the centre of gravity ψ is the yaw angle of the vessel and γ is the angle between towing rope and translational direction of the tug the nonlinear relationship between the tension and stretched length can be written as 9 t s b p l l 0 l 0 q where s b is the average breaking strength l 0 and l are unstretched and stretched length of the towing rope respectively if l l 0 then t 0 p and q are the empirical constants for the material of the rope the non dimensional terms in eqs 6 9 are listed in table 1 the state variables are defined and the state equation is established as shown in appendix a 4 hydrodynamic derivatives determining the hydrodynamic derivatives is a key procedure for simulating the towing process in this paper both theoretical and empirical methods are adopted and the procedure is described as below in detail the added mass coefficients are determined by the potential flow method 4 1 fin hydrodynamic derivatives the non dimensional derivative of the force in the y direction with respect to the transverse velocity can be expressed as 10 y v f ρ 2 a f u 0 c l β f ρ 2 l 2 u 0 a f c l β f where a f is the area of the fin a f the non dimensional fin area which defined as a f a f l 2 u 0 the resultant velocity m s l the overall length of the ship and c l β f the lift coefficient slope per radian where β stands for the attack angle of the fin it should be noted that eq 10 neglects wake and flow straightening effects the non dimensional derivative of moment about the z axis with respect to transverse velocity can be expressed as 11 n v f y v f x f where x f denotes the non dimensional position along x axis of the fin the non dimensional derivative force in the y axis with respect to angular velocity is expressed as 12 y r f y v f x f the non dimensional derivative of moment about the z axis with respect to angular velocity is 13 n r f y v f x f 2 4 2 hull hydrodynamic derivatives in this section the empirical equations are presented to determine the hydrodynamic derivatives of the bare hull which is a crucial step to determine the total coefficients including the fins indeed the bare hull of the ship can be regarded as a low aspect ratio fin with a large area because of the low aspect ratio characteristics it may be expected that a ship s hull would generate small hydrodynamic forces and moments compared to the rudder however due to the large profile area a ship s hull does in fact generate forces and moments far larger than the control forces generated by the rudder the only difference of each coefficient compared with the formula in lewis 1988 is that the variable used for the non dimensional process is different the non dimensional velocity dependent force derivative for the bare hull is written as 14 y v h y v h ρ 2 l 2 u 0 π t 2 l 2 where the subscript h denotes the bare hull and t is the draught of the vessel the non dimensional derivative of moment about z axis with respect to transverse velocity is written as 15 n v h y v h x u h x v s l y v h where x v s is the distance from the origin to the application point of the lateral force the last term is due to the viscous effect and x v s l 0 25 the non dimensional derivative of force in the y direction with respect to r for the hull is 16 y r h y r h ρ 2 l 3 u 0 t l x u h x v s l y v h similarly the non dimensional derivative of moment about z axis with respect to r is 17 n r h n r h ρ 2 l 4 u 0 t l c p 2 2 y v h where c p denotes the prismatic coefficient of the ship 4 3 prediction of hull hydrodynamics by the potential flow theory to determine the added mass of the ship at the infinite frequency the existing wave radiation diffraction code based on the boundary element method liang et al 2018 wu et al 2018 is adopted the boundary integral equation constructed on the hull surface h is written as 18 2 π ϕ j x h g x ξ n j ξ g x ξ n ξ ϕ j ξ d s with j 1 2 6 where x x y z and ξ ξ η ζ are defined as the flow field point and the source point respectively besides g denotes the green function satisfying the linear free surface boundary condition at infinite frequency i e ϕ 0 and it is expressed as 19 g 1 r 1 d with r d x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 in eq 18 n j means the generalized normal vector which is written as 20 n j n j when j 1 2 3 x x 0 n j 3 when j 4 5 6 where x 0 denotes the coordinate of the reference point by solving the linear system eq 18 ϕ j can be determined and thus the added mass of the ship at infinite frequency can be obtained 21 a i j ρ h ϕ j n i d s 5 fpso particulars and fin configuration 5 1 description of fpso the overall length and the breadth of the fpso are 240 m and 40 m the mean draught and the displacement are 11 m and 90 000 tons the body plan of the vessel is shown in fig 4 the non dimensional parameters such as hydrodynamic derivatives are summarised in table 2 it should be noted that the model is developed to account for nonlinear derivatives however in this fpso case only the linear derivatives are used based on the body plan and draught the hydrodynamic model of fpso can be established the view of the panel models is shown in fig 5 it should be pointed out that we only use linear derivatives to simulate the fpso considering the effect of the fin 5 2 the fin configuration for the fin geometry the aspect ratio ratio of span to mean chord has an important impact on its hydrodynamic behaviours typically a fin of a larger aspect ratio can generate larger lift and lower drag i e higher lift to drag ratio when the configuration of twin fins or multiple fins is deployed the lift coefficients are sensitive to the spacing distance between fins and are not identical to that of a single fin due to interactions fig 6 gives the definition of fin geometry and the angle of attack between incident flow and fin due to the temporary utilisation and cost saving purposes the fin in engineering practice is simply designed in the form of a thin plate and the chord is identical from the tip to root fins are going to be installed at the aft most part of the vessel it should be ensured that the fin and the extra supporting structure would not influence or damage the existing hull structures and appendages once the vessel is towed to the desired site the additional fin is convenient to be dismounted from the vessel and abandoned or retrieved fig 7 shows the sketch of the vessel stern part and additional fin the fin span is restricted mainly by the draught of the vessel in the transit condition and therefore the maximum span in this case is about 9 m the variation of aspect ratio discussed in this paper is roughly from 1 to 3 which is the common range of ship fin and rudder 6 results and discussions 6 1 verification of present numerical towing system the present numerical model of the towing system described in section 3 is validated by comparing to the previous study lee 1989 the vessel particulars hydrodynamic coefficients towing pattern and other parameters are listed in table 3 as shown in fig 8 a satisfactory agreement has been obtained and moreover it can be observed that starting from 0 rad the yaw angle of the towed vessel oscillates for a couple of cycles before it stabilizes at a steady angle fig 8 illustrates an example of a condition associated with a stable asymmetric towing configuration 6 2 simulation of unstable fpso without fin a bare hull fpso was simulated based on the present model and the towing speed is 4 knots in calm water fig 9 shows simulated yaw motion and lateral offset along global y basically the course stability during towing was poor as the vessel kept swaying with the increasing yaw which is clearly shown by observing the curves in the figure the course of the vessel did not stabilize along the central line initial path 6 3 fin lift coefficient the lift coefficient of the fin is predicted by the vortex lattice method which is described in detail in section 2 in general a large amount of elements are not needed however the basic convergence test is still necessary fig 10 depicts lift coefficients of a single fin against the angle of attack in different mesh density the corresponding aspect ratio is 3 i e span and chord 9 m and 3 m respectively the angle of attack is chosen from 0 to 12 as the used numerical method cannot predict stall due to the flow separation from the leading edge at a large angle of attack the lift coefficient gradually converges as an increase in the number of elements in the current case convergence can be obtained with 100 elements actually the key parameter d c l d β shown in eq 10 i e the slope of the lift coefficient plays an important role to improve the course stability it should be figured out that the lift coefficient is calculated in the free space for the purpose of validating the vortex lattice method simulated curves of d c l d β at β 0 versus aspect ratio are shown in fig 11 which is compared to existing model test results in free space katz and plotkin 2001 the comparison shows that the simulation perfectly matches the experimental measurement the vortex lattice method has provided an accurate and reliable prediction over the expected aspect ratio range and even more the figure also shows that with the increase of the aspect ratio d c l d β monotonically increases but the rate of increase gradually declines after aspect ratio equals to 2 6 4 towing stability of fpso with single and double fins for the studies from this section hereafter the aspect ratio of the fin is fixed at 3 which gives the largest lift coefficient slope considering the actual aspect range 1 3 in this case the fourth order runge kutta method is employed to solve numerically the motion eqs 6 9 of the towing system two configurations are discussed in this section i e single fin and double fins the single fin locates in the central line at the stern of the fpso whereas double fins which bear resemblance with the biplane liang et al 2013b locate symmetrically at the portside and starboard which are far enough from each other therefore the impact of lifting force due to fins interaction is negligible the towing speed remains at 4 knots in the simulation as shown in fig 12 the in line towing equilibrium configuration in the single fin is unstable and both slow and fast components of motions are clearly observed the system behaviour is totally different from the one in fig 9 it does not drift away due to the presence of the fin but oscillates around 0 which corresponds to the tow parallel to the tug see fig 3 although in line towing equilibrium configuration in single and double fins are both unstable the yaw motion in single fin exhibits irregular behaviours with fast oscillation of quite a few different frequencies the trajectory map displayed in fig 13 further corroborates the behaviour the offset fig 12 c and d basically shares similar characteristics with yaw however time series are much smoother especially for double fins configuration 6 5 twin fins and the efficiency of the lift coefficient the configuration of multiple fins is a practical solution if a single fin or double fins fail to stabilize the towed vessel when twin fins are applied the interaction among the fins should be properly taken into account because the hydrodynamic characteristics of each fin in twin fins configuration are impacted by the interaction basically the spacing between fins plays a vital role and consequently alters the pressure distribution therefore in this section the spacing and its influence on the lift coefficient is analysed firstly and the impact on the towed vessel stability is discussed later the fin size remains at 9 m span and 3 m chord which gives the aspect ratio 3 the considered range of spacing is 0 5 to 2 times of the chord using the vortex lattice method the lift coefficient of each fin is computed for different spacing and given at different angles of attack according to fig 14 for all five different spacing scenarios the lift coefficient of the fin on the portside identified as fp is different from the one on the starboard identified as fs in fig 6 this difference is magnified when the spacing is small such as 0 25 c r c r is the chord length and the difference further increases at a large angle of attack fig 14 also clearly shows that when the spacing is smaller than 2 0 c r the lift coefficient is lower than that of a single fin the total lift coefficient for the twin fin system is shown in fig 15 and the single fin case is just set twice of its lift coefficient for the comparison purposes not only the lift coefficient but its slope against the angle of attack also increases as the spacing increases which possesses positive effect to improve the course stability fig 15 shows that the hydrodynamic interaction between twin fins is strong enough to affect the effectiveness of the lift coefficient and may be omitted only when the spacing equals to or is larger than twice of the chord length in this study two sets of twin fins are arranged separately on portside and starboard of fpso to avoid the asymmetrical manoeuvring behaviour by solving the numerical model of the towing system figs 16 20 shows yaw and offset in time history of towed fpso by considering twin fins with different spacings the red curves are intentionally added to capture motion peaks as an illustration of the trajectory map in fig 21 both yaw and offset of 0 25 c r and 0 5 c r show more regular responses compared to these in previous single and double fin configurations the yaw and offset series oscillate periodically and increase gradually until a steady amplitude is achieved which shows quite a typical fishtailing characteristics the fpso fails to return to the original trajectory the amplitudes reduce as the fin spacing increases according to table 4 regarding cases of 1 c r 1 5 c r and 2 c r all results show clear decay however the difference is the time they take table 4 presents the corresponding linear damping ratios estimated by the logarithm of response amplitudes and it shows a significant increase in the damping ratio as fin spacing increases as time history demonstrates the towed fpso spent much less time in stabilizing as the fin spacing increases which provides a pretty useful reference for the pilot when conducting the operation in terms of trajectory map fig 21 the largest 2 0 c r case uses the minimum cycles to converge to the stable in line towing configuration 6 6 eigenvalue analysis the time domain solutions have been discussed in detail in the previous sections we are focused on evaluating the towing stability by using the eigenvalue approach as aforementioned the numerical towing system needs to be linearized here the taylor expansion is employed and higher order terms are neglected the expansion point is the state corresponding to the in line towing equilibrium configuration therefore the jacobian matrix of the entire towing system can be obtained the formula of each element in the matrix is derived and listed in appendix b the eigenvalues are then computed by using the qr method watkins 1982 according to the criterion the stable system requires the maximum real part of all eigenvalues to be a negative number fig 22 shows the maximum real part of eigenvalues versus the spacing for all discussed twin fins configurations in addition results of the single fin and twin fins are included as independent data regardless of the spacing the cases of the single and double fins show relatively large positive value which indicates an unstable state cases 0 25 c r and 0 5 c r correspond to unstable in line towing equilibrium configurations for the cases of 1 c r 1 5 c r and 2 c r the maximum real part of eigenvalues are almost zero but negative which means that the in line towing equilibrium configuration is stable in fact it looks like the eigenvalues do not change significantly which implies the improvement of stability is limited under current configurations according to the analysis the contribution of the fin is further verified by the eigenvalue analysis the stability analysis of the in line towing equilibrium configuration based on the determination of eigenvalues of the jacobian is capable of providing appropriate indications on whether the in line towing equilibrium is a stable configuration or not however the short term time domain analysis is still necessary for towing analysis because the output is much more fruitful such as how long does vessel take to stabilize and how much amplitude and what is the motion characteristic which is also important information or reference to the pilot we have carried out simulations for the fpso considering only linear derivatives and this may affect some of the results therefore further assessment would be necessary by introducing also nonlinear derivatives 7 conclusions an efficient method has been developed for the analysis of hydrodynamic properties of fins as well as its enhancement of the fpso s course stability during towing the method consists of the determination of fin s lift coefficient by the vortex lattice method the empirical formulation of hydrodynamic derivatives and a 3dofs numerical model of the towing system the fin s hydrodynamic characteristics and interactions have been discussed first and then followed by the time domain simulations of fpso s yaw and offset in diverse fin configurations the eigenvalue analysis is performed based on a linearised towing system model to cross check for comparison purposes the primary conclusions are summarized as follows in the case of twin fins the spacing influences obviously the lift coefficient the hydrodynamic interaction makes the fin s lift coefficient different from each other especially when the angle of attack is large besides compared with the lift coefficients for the single fin case the ones for twin fins are smaller the interaction is stronger as the spacing becomes smaller and when the spacing is the twice or above the chord length the interaction is inconsequential the slope of the total lift coefficient by twin fins increases gradually as an increase of the spacing which provides a positive contribution to improve the vessel s course stability the time domain analysis shows distinct manoeuvring behaviours the worst case shows fpso s yaw and offset kept drifting without the fin in place by introducing single fin the motions demonstrate clearly the combination of slow and fast components and can oscillate around the initial location but shows irregular characteristics however these are minimal compared to the large amplitude low frequency motion by introducing twin fins the motions oscillated periodically and increased gradually until a constant amplitude is reached which shows typical fishtailing characteristics as an increase of the spacing of twin fins the yaw and offset started to decay after the first peak and eventually returned to the original path compared to the time domain analysis the analysis of the eigenvalues based on the linearized towing system produces quick results and can indicate whether the in line towing equilibrium configuration is stable nevertheless the short term time domain study provides much more information such as how long does vessel take to stabilize and how much amplitude and what is the motion characteristic which are all useful references to the pilot during the towing operation it should be noted that we use only linear derivatives for simulating the fpso and further assessment would be necessary by introducing nonlinear derivatives from an engineering point of view the fin at stern could be a pragmatic and economical solution in case of inadequate course stability moreover as a temporary appendage it does not require any modification on the vessel s primary structure and it is easy to be dismantled credit authorship contribution statement binbin li
