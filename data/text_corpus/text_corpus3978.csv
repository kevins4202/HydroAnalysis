19890,anammox process has attracted attention due to its excellent nitrogen removal properties in nitrogen rich wastewater treatment however there were some obstacles for the application of anammox to treat high saline wastewater due to its sensitivity to salinity in this study fe iii addition strategy was developed to assist anammox to adapt high saline surroundings with the defense mechanism involved in fe iii assisted anammox emphasized nitrogen removal performance of anammox was deteriorated at 3 5 salinity with the average total nitrogen removal rate of 0 85 kg m3 d observed the continuous addition of fe iii could significantly assist anammox to resist high salinity through facilitating the enrichment of anammox species candidatus kuenenia was the main anammox species and outcompeted candidatus brocadia under high saline surrounding the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia increased with increased salinity and reached 41 04 under 3 5 salinity the synthesis of key enzymes of anammox species were improved through fe iii addition and then facilitated the energy metabolism of anammox bacteria under 3 5 salinity this study provides a new thought in fe iii assisted

nitrification denitrification process anammox can save oxygen demand nearly 60 and organic carbon consumption 100 wang et al 2021a anammox has turned out to be a friendly and cost saving alternative showing broad prospect in nitrogen rich wastewater treatment zhao et al 2022 high concentration of salinity was often encountered by industrial nitrogen rich wastewaters such as textile wastewater and coal chemical wastewater etc lin et al 2021 in biological process such as anammox salinity was a serious inhibitor for microorganisms owing to the increased osmotic pressure leading to cell dehydration and death pang et al 2021 fang et al 2018 demonstrated that anammox activity and nitrogen removal would decrease under salinity higher than 3 although anammox related species could adapt to high saline surroundings after long term acclimatization it was reported that 3 5 salinity could lead to a collapse of anammox performance even after a long period of stepwise acclimatization ya et al 2021 the long acclimatization period of anammox species to the unfavorable factors such as salinity has become one of the main obstacles for the full scale application of anammox in practical wastewater treatment thus it is essential to find a more suitable alternative to relieve salt stress on anammox bacteria iron as a necessary component of iron containing proteins plays a vital role in the metabolism and growth of anammox species wang et al 2021a erdim et al 2019 for example the iron binding enzymes such as hydrazine synthase hzs hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh and nitrite reductase nir are vital for anammox process peng et al 2022 heme c was involved in anaerobic conversion of nh4 n to n2 in anammox process van niftrik et al 2008 although fe ii showed higher bioavailability for anammox species dai et al 2022 soluble fe ii was often unstable and could be easily converted into fe iii thus fe iii was more suitable to supply anammox species for practical application it was suggested that 5 mg l fe iii significantly enhanced the nitrogen removal performance of anammox process zhang et al 2021c furthermore it was indicated that due to the decrease of fe content inside anammox granule the growth of anammox species was limited with the increased salinity jeong et al 2022 besides iron could stimulate anammox species to secret extracellular polymeric substances eps to resist adverse conditions dai et al 2022 eps is important for anammox bacteria to adapt to saline surroundings which could act as a barrier between anammox bacteria and salinity conditions zhang et al 2021b therefore the additive supply of fe iii into anammox process is crucial under high saline conditions nevertheless there was little information on the assistance of fe iii in anammox system to resist salinity the defense mechanism of fe iii assisted anammox toward salt stress deserved to be investigated therefore the effect of fe iii on anammox and defense mechanisms of fe iii assisted anammox under salt stress were revealed in this study the objectives of this work were as follows i to investigate the effect of fe iii on anammox under salt stress ii to analyze the variation of microbial community of anammox reactors under salinity exposure iii to explore the defense mechanism of fe iii assisted anammox in high saline wastewater treatment this work would support a new thought of the application of fe iii assisted anammox treating nitrogen rich saline wastewater 2 results and discussion 2 1 nitrogen removal in fe iii assisted anammox under salt stress the nitrogen removal process of fe iii assisted anammox reactors was divided to three periods according to salinity level text a in si which were low salinity 0 0 5 moderate salinity 1 2 and high salinity 2 5 3 5 respectively as depictured in fig 1 a in phase i the mean value of total nitrogen removal efficiency tnre of r0 control reactor without fe iii and r1 reactor with fe iii were 89 73 2 28 and 89 12 2 93 respectively which suggested that low salinity showed unsignificant effect on anammox process similar result was reported by zhang et al 2022 where 0 5 salinity showed slight impact on nitrogen removal in anammox in phase ii the salinity was increased to 2 to further explore the influence of moderate salinity on fe iii assisted anammox tnre of r0 and r1 were decreased to 84 56 1 57 and 84 23 2 02 respectively indicating that 2 salinity had slight influence on anammox however li et al 2018 reported that the nitrogen removal properties of anammox was significantly deteriorated at 2 salinity in both r0 and r1 the relatively good performance at salinity of 2 could be attributed to the dense and compact structure of granular anammox sludge fig s1 which could resist adverse conditions fang et al 2018 compared with the inoculated sludge with increased salinity the granular anammox sludge was divided to smaller granules due to high osmotic pressure however the anammox sludge was still granular to resist salt stress in phase iii with the increase of salinity from 2 5 to 3 5 the nitrogen removal performance of r0 and r1 began to appear different when the salinity increased to 3 tnre of r1 was well kept at 80 82 3 59 while tnre of r0 was deteriorated significantly to 71 74 7 15 the discrepancy indicated that 3 salinity could inhibit the activity of anammox species jeong et al 2020 also indicated that nre was obviously decreased to 63 8 at 2 75 salinity in anammox system correspondingly when the salinity was further increased to 3 5 the average total nitrogen removal rate tnrr was 0 85 kg m3 d in r1 which was higher than 0 77 kg m3 d in the control r0 fig 1b the granular anammox sludge was taken at 3 5 salinity to analyze specific anammox activity saa as shown in fig s2 saa value of r1 was much higher than the control probably due to the assistance of fe iii it was reported that fe iii addition significantly promoted saa wang et al 2022a overall the nitrogen removal properties of r1 was always superior to r0 indicating that fe iii was quite helpful to alleviate salt stress for anammox in addition the value of δno2 n δnh4 n in r1 was lower than 1 32 fig s3 which was also lower than the value of r0 it was reported that nh4 n could be removed through fe iii reduction under anaerobic surroundings namely feammox yang et al 2021 fe iii could combine with oh to fe oh 3 under ph neutral condition and fe ii was not detected in effluent wang et al 2023 also indicated that fe oh 3 could induce anammox bacteria to perform extracellular electron transfer to remove nh4 n via feammox pathway therefore anammox might couple with feammox to remove nh4 n in this study 2 2 characteristics of granular anammox sludge under salt stress extracellular polymeric substances eps the macromolecules secreted from microorganisms play a vital role in granular anammox sludge fang et al 2018 as depicted in fig 2 a with the increase of salinity up to 2 eps content of r0 was increased and eps content of r0 was generally higher than r1 probably because fe iii addition weakened the unfavorable effects of salinity on anammox bacteria it was found that eps played an important role in osmotic pressure resistance and could prevent cells from salinity inhibition tang et al 2021 however eps content of both reactors was decreased with the further increase of salinity to 3 0 and 3 5 at salinity of 3 0 and 3 5 eps content of r1 was higher than that of r0 which could be attributed to the fact that fe iii could stimulate granular anammox sludge to secret eps to resist the adverse effect in high saline environment it was reported that polysaccharides ps were responsible for the negative charges while proteins pn contained positively charges zhang et al 2021a with the increase of salinity ps proportion in eps was increased as indicated by the decreased pn ps ratios the increase of ps proportion could be attributed to the significant increase of ps in loosely bound eps lb eps rather than tightly bound eps tb eps fig 2b c which was beneficial for the enrich of negative charges on the anammox granules due to the negative surface charge of anammox species cells fe iii ions could reduce electrostatic repulsion to promote the granulation of anammox species wang et al 2022b fang et al 2018 indicated that the increase in ps and decrease in pn could decrease the flocculating capacity of the sludge it was reported that fe iii could reduce zeta potential through compressing the electric double layer and promote the granulation of anammox sludge dai et al 2022 besides dai et al 2022 also indicated that fe iii could combine with oh and stimulate the active flocculation groups which were beneficial for sludge sedimentation therefore fe iii could assist anammox granules to resist high salinity through promoting the granulation and eps secretion the appearance of anammox granules were analyzed to reflect the effect of fe iii on anammox under salt stress the color of anammox granules turned from typical red to orange under salt stress fig s1 in order to confirm the role of fe iii the anammox sludge was further analyzed through x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps as indicated in fig s4 the iron in anammox sludge of r1 was dominated by fe iii with two fe2p peaks centered at binding energies of 712 1 ev and 725 7 ev respectively yang et al 2021 which indicated that fe iii was involved in the formation of network structure of anammox sludge the size of inocula sludge was mainly distributed within diameter range of 1 4 2 8 mm while the size of anammox granules was decreased with the increase of salinity fig s5 however it was also observed that the size of anammox granules in r1 was bigger than that in r0 which could be attributed to fe iii addition wang et al 2022b reported that fe iii was beneficial for eps secretion and iron based particles could become micro nuclei during granular sludge formation through the formation of iron hydroxides with high flocculation ability granulation of anammox species could be induced wang et al 2021b 2 3 microbial community analysis 2 3 1 correlations analysis of microbial communities the anammox sludge samples were taken at 0 1 2 and 3 5 salinity to explore the dynamics of microbial community under salt stress as shown in table s1 as compared with inocula sludge the low shannon and high simpson indexes observed in r0 and r1 indicated the low diversity of the community under salinity stress it was reported that harsh environment such as high salinity would lead to simple community structure li et al 2020 compared with r0 shannon index of r1 was relatively low while simpson index of r1 was relatively high indicating the low community diversity in r1 probably due to the enrichment of certain species at the presence of fe iii principal component analysis pca was depicted in fig 3 a with the increase of salinity the microbial community in r0 and r1 presented clear separation with the inocula sludge under 3 5 salinity the microbial community in r1 was rather different from r0 implying the divergence of microbial structure under the action of fe iii redundancy analysis rda was used to elucidate the influence of fe iii and salinity on variation of microbial structure fig 3b it could be found that candidatus kuenenia was positive with fe iii demonstrating that fe iii played an important role in anammox reactor under salt stress candidatus brocadia and denitratisoma were susceptible to high salinity as indicated by the negative correlation with salinity 2 3 2 functionalized microbial community in fe iii assisted anammox system the anammox sludge samples were taken at 0 1 2 and 3 5 salinity to explore the dynamics of microbial community as shown in fig 4 a at the phylum level the main phyla were planctomycetes proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes compared with r0 with the increase of salinity in r1 the relative abundance of planctomycetes increased to 44 04 anammox species was reported to be a phylogenetically deep branching group in the phylum planctomycetes wang et al 2022a the relative abundance of proteobacteria which was often found in anammox system zhang et al 2021c decreased under salt stress chloroflexi were important symbiotic microbes with anammox bacteria through providing scaffolding for granular anammox sludge wang et al 2020 compared with r0 the relative abundance of chloroflexi in r1 decreased at 3 5 salinity indicating that fe iii could facilitate sludge granulation instead of chloroflexi under salt stress bacteroidetes were inhibited by salinity with the decrease in the relative abundance as depicted in fig 4b at the genus level candidatus kuenenia chloroflexi bacterium olb13 and denitratisoma were dominant species in the inoculation sludge candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia were main anammox bacteria the relative abundance of anammox bacteria varied with increased salinity fig 4c initially candidatus kuenenia out competed candidatus brocadia with the salinity increased to 1 which was consistent with previous studies it was indicated that candidatus kuenenia had a more higher salinity tolerance than candidatus brocadia lin et al 2021 when the salinity increased to 3 5 the content of candidatus kuenenia obviously decreased to 15 32 in r0 while increased to 41 04 in r1 through long term salinity acclimatization the inherit adaption of the anammox process might be one reason for the enrichment of candidatus kuenenia however the content of candidatus kuenenia in r1 was much higher than that of r0 under 3 5 salinity the results demonstrated that fe iii played a vital role in the enrichment of anammox bacteria under high saline conditions several studies had indicated that fe iii addition could stimulate the growth of anammox bacteria and promote the enrichment of anammox bacteria wang et al 2021a yin et al 2021 in addition it was reported that fe iii addition could enhance the removal of nh4 in anammox system via feammox pathway wang et al 2023 candidatus kuenenia might participate in the feammox process as a result candidatus kuenenia could survive at high saline 3 5 salinity environment through fe iii assistance denitratisoma was inhibited by high salinity which was decreased from 17 11 to 2 12 and 0 97 in r0 and r1 under 3 5 salinity respectively denitratisoma is a denitrifying bacterium which was often detected in anammox process liu et al 2021 nitrosomonas as the known genus of ammonia oxidizing bacteria could cooperate with anammox bacteria to remove nh4 n guo et al 2020 its relative abundance decreased at 1 salinity because nitrosomonas was reported to only adapt to a low salinity environment li et al 2018 chloroflexi bacterium olb13 could strengthen the structure of granules in the form of filamentous biomass xu et al 2021 the relative abundance of chloroflexi bacterium olb13 of r1 was lower than r0 under 3 5 salinity probably due to that fe iii addition accelerated the formation of anammox sludge structure under salinity exposure compared with other microbes candidatus kuenenia exhibited better resistance to salt stress by fe iii addition which was the dominant microbe to remove nitrogen compounds under saline conditions 2 3 3 microbial function prediction based on kegg database the abundance of predicted functional genes related to nitrogen and iron metabolism were also analyzed as depicted in fig 4d the gene coding for hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao was varied with increased salinity compared with r1 the genes of r0 that coding for nitrite transporter nirc nitrate reductase narg narz nitrite oxidoreductase nxra and nitrite reductase nirb were down regulated at 3 5 salinity these results showed that fe iii improved the abundance of genes associated with nitrogen metabolism under high saline surroundings the abundance of ferrous iron transport protein b feob and iron complex outermembrane recepter protein tc fev om in r0 was always lower than that of r1 the genes coding for tc fev om were down regulated with increased salinity tc fev om is the receptor enzyme for the iron complex in the outer membrane of anammox bacteria wang et al 2023 these results indicated that fe iii addition could change the iron metabolism inside anammox under high salt stress 2 4 effects of fe iii on nitrogen metabolism of anammox species under 3 5 salinity to further reveal the influence of fe iii on metabolism of anammox species the contents of key functional enzymes nir hzs hdh and heme c were analyzed at 3 5 salinity in anammox metabolism process no2 was initially catalyzed to no by nir and then no combined with nh4 to form n2h4 through hzs and finally n2h4 was catalyzed to n2 by hdh kartal et al 2011 as depicted in fig 5 the contents of nir hzs and hdh of r1 was higher than that of r0 which indicated that fe iii obviously regulated functional enzymes synthesis of anammox bacteria under 3 5 salinity it was reported that fe addition could promote the activities of fe involved enzymes wang et al 2022a dai et al 2022 also indicated that moderately increasing fe concentration of influent could enhance the activity of hdh as a result fe iii promote the functional enzymes synthesis of anammox bacteria to alleviate salt stress in r1 heme c content was higher than that of the control fig 5b which indicated that fe iii could stimulate the production of heme c of anammox bacteria under 3 5 salinity zhang et al 2021c reported that heme c content was significantly increased at 10 mg l fe iii addition jeong et al 2022 indicated that the content of fe in granular anammox sludge decreased with increased salinity and thus limited the growth of anammox species furthermore heme c is correlated positively with the relative abundance of anammox bacteria kang et al 2020 therefore fe iii addition could increase heme c content which would be helpful for candidatus kuenenia and then promote its enrichment to resist salt stress 2 5 defense mechanism of fe iii assisted anammox under high salt stress the defense mechanism of fe iii assisted anammox under high salt stress was depicted in fig 6 firstly with the addition of fe iii the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia increased with salinity which was higher than the control under 3 5 salinity yin et al 2019 also reported that fe iii addition significantly accelerated the growth of marine anammox species in high saline wastewater treatment secondly fe iii strengthened the resistance of granular anammox sludge through stimulating eps secretion and sludge granulation under high salt stress it was indicated that fe could stimulate anammox sludge to secrete eps and then improve the resistance of anammox species to inhibitors dai et al 2022 besides fe iii could combine with oh to fe oh 3 under ph neutral condition and fe oh 3 promoted anammox granulation by acting as micro nuclei wang et al 2022b the granular anammox sludge could resist salt stress through its dense and compact structure with fe iii addition thirdly fe iii addition facilitated the synthesis of key enzymes and heme c and thus alleviated the influence of salt stress on anammox bacteria it was found that the activity of key enzymes in anammox was severely inhibited under saline surroundings zhang et al 2021b several studies had reported that fe could promote heme c synthesis and increase the activity of key enzymes of anammox feng et al 2023 wang et al 2022a wang et al 2023 3 conclusions this work investigated the defense mechanism of fe iii assisted anammox under salt stress the nitrogen removal efficiency and specific anammox activity was enhanced due to the addition of fe iii under as high as 3 5 salinity compared with the control group fe iii could stimulate the eps secretion of granular anammox sludge and facilitate the synthesis of nir hzs hdh and heme c to relieve salt stress fe iii addition significantly increased the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia under 3 5 salinity exposure overall this work would give a new sight of anammox species on resisting salt stress through fe iii assistance 4 materials and methods 4 1 experiment setup and reactor operation two identical upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors were conducted with a working volume of 3 l 5 mg l fe iii was continuously added to influent in r1 while r0 was operated without fe iii as the control reactor in particular the background iron of influent was supplied for the normal growth of anammox the only difference between r0 and r1 was the exogenous fe iii addition thus the background value of iron was negligible fecl3 was applied to provide fe iii reasons for choosing 5 mg l fe iii in this study were shown in the supplementary information text b in si the operation temperature was kept at 35 1 through a circulating water bath the hydraulic retention time was set at 12 h the entire experiment period was divided into three phases based on the variation of salinity table s2 4 2 inoculation and synthetic wastewater the sludge derived from a mature granular anammox reactor was inoculated into both r1 and r0 at initial mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of 3600 mg l the synthetic wastewater was used as the influent which was consisted of kh2po4 0 029 g l mgso4 0 3 g l cacl2

concentrations varying from 0 to 3 5 calculated by nacl influent ph was controlled at 7 5 0 2 through adding 2 mol l hcl n2 was aerated to the synthetic wastewater to expel dissolved oxygen 4 3 analytical methods samples were collected and filtered through 0 22 μm filters the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 anammox sludge was

adverse effect in high saline environment it was reported that polysaccharides ps were responsible for the negative charges while proteins pn contained positively charges zhang et al 2021a with the increase of salinity ps proportion in eps was increased as indicated by the decreased pn ps ratios the increase of ps proportion could be attributed to the significant increase of ps in loosely bound eps lb eps rather than tightly bound eps tb eps fig 2b c which was beneficial for the enrich of negative charges on the anammox granules due to the negative surface charge of anammox species cells fe iii ions could reduce electrostatic repulsion to promote the granulation of anammox species wang et al 2022b fang et al 2018 indicated that the increase in ps and decrease in pn could decrease the flocculating capacity of the sludge it was reported that fe iii could reduce zeta potential through compressing the electric double layer and promote the granulation of anammox sludge dai et al 2022 besides dai et al 2022 also indicated that fe iii could combine with oh and stimulate the active flocculation groups which were beneficial for sludge sedimentation therefore fe iii could assist anammox granules to resist high salinity through promoting the granulation and eps secretion the appearance of anammox granules were analyzed to reflect the effect of fe iii on anammox under salt stress the color of anammox granules turned from typical red to orange under salt stress fig s1 in order to confirm the role of fe iii the anammox sludge was further analyzed through x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps as indicated in fig s4 the iron in anammox sludge of r1 was dominated by fe iii with two fe2p peaks centered at binding energies of 712 1 ev and 725 7 ev respectively yang et al 2021 which indicated that fe iii was involved in the formation of network structure of anammox sludge the size of inocula sludge was mainly distributed within diameter range of 1 4 2 8 mm while the size of anammox granules was decreased with the increase of salinity fig s5 however it was also observed that the size of anammox granules in r1 was bigger than that in r0 which could be attributed to fe iii addition wang et al 2022b reported that fe iii was beneficial for eps secretion and iron based particles could become micro nuclei during granular sludge formation through the formation of iron hydroxides with high flocculation ability granulation of anammox species could be induced wang et al 2021b 2 3 microbial community analysis 2 3 1 correlations analysis of microbial communities the anammox sludge samples were taken at 0 1 2 and 3 5 salinity to explore the dynamics of microbial community under salt stress as shown in table s1 as compared with inocula sludge the low shannon and high simpson indexes observed in r0 and r1 indicated the low diversity of the community under salinity stress it was reported that harsh environment such as high salinity would lead to simple community structure li et al 2020 compared with r0 shannon index of r1 was relatively low while simpson index of r1 was relatively high indicating the low community diversity in r1 probably due to the enrichment of certain species at the presence of fe iii principal component analysis pca was depicted in fig 3 a with the increase of salinity the microbial community in r0 and r1 presented clear separation with the inocula sludge under 3 5 salinity the microbial community in r1 was rather different from r0 implying the divergence of microbial structure under the action of fe iii redundancy analysis rda was used to elucidate the influence of fe iii and salinity on variation of microbial structure fig 3b it could be found that candidatus kuenenia was positive with fe iii demonstrating that fe iii played an important role in anammox reactor under salt stress candidatus brocadia and denitratisoma were susceptible to high salinity as indicated by the negative correlation with salinity 2 3 2 functionalized microbial community in fe iii assisted anammox system the anammox sludge samples were taken at 0 1 2 and 3 5 salinity to explore the dynamics of microbial community as shown in fig 4 a at the phylum level the main phyla were planctomycetes proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes compared with r0 with the increase of salinity in r1 the relative abundance of planctomycetes increased to 44 04 anammox species was reported to be a phylogenetically deep branching group in the phylum planctomycetes wang et al 2022a the relative abundance of proteobacteria which was often found in anammox system zhang et al 2021c decreased under salt stress chloroflexi were important symbiotic microbes with anammox bacteria through providing scaffolding for granular anammox sludge wang et al 2020 compared with r0 the relative abundance of chloroflexi in r1 decreased at 3 5 salinity indicating that fe iii could facilitate sludge granulation instead of chloroflexi under salt stress bacteroidetes were inhibited by salinity with the decrease in the relative abundance as depicted in fig 4b at the genus level candidatus kuenenia chloroflexi bacterium olb13 and denitratisoma were dominant species in the inoculation sludge candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia were main anammox bacteria the relative abundance of anammox bacteria varied with increased salinity fig 4c initially candidatus kuenenia out competed candidatus brocadia with the salinity increased to 1 which was consistent with previous studies it was indicated that candidatus kuenenia had a more higher salinity tolerance than candidatus brocadia lin et al 2021 when the salinity increased to 3 5 the content of candidatus kuenenia obviously decreased to 15 32 in r0 while increased to 41 04 in r1 through long term salinity acclimatization the inherit adaption of the anammox process might be one reason for the enrichment of candidatus kuenenia however the content of candidatus kuenenia in r1 was much higher than that of r0 under 3 5 salinity the results demonstrated that fe iii played a vital role in the enrichment of anammox bacteria under high saline conditions several studies had indicated that fe iii addition could stimulate the growth of anammox bacteria and promote the enrichment of anammox bacteria wang et al 2021a yin et al 2021 in addition it was reported that fe iii addition could enhance the removal of nh4 in anammox system via feammox pathway wang et al 2023 candidatus kuenenia might participate in the feammox process as a result candidatus kuenenia could survive at high saline 3 5 salinity environment through fe iii assistance denitratisoma was inhibited by high salinity which was decreased from 17 11 to 2 12 and 0 97 in r0 and r1 under 3 5 salinity respectively denitratisoma is a denitrifying bacterium which was often detected in anammox process liu et al 2021 nitrosomonas as the known genus of ammonia oxidizing bacteria could cooperate with anammox bacteria to remove nh4 n guo et al 2020 its relative abundance decreased at 1 salinity because nitrosomonas was reported to only adapt to a low salinity environment li et al 2018 chloroflexi bacterium olb13 could strengthen the structure of granules in the form of filamentous biomass xu et al 2021 the relative abundance of chloroflexi bacterium olb13 of r1 was lower than r0 under 3 5 salinity probably due to that fe iii addition accelerated the formation of anammox sludge structure under salinity exposure compared with other microbes candidatus kuenenia exhibited better resistance to salt stress by fe iii addition which was the dominant microbe to remove nitrogen compounds under saline conditions 2 3 3 microbial function prediction based on kegg database the abundance of predicted functional genes related to nitrogen and iron metabolism were also analyzed as depicted in fig 4d the gene coding for hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao was varied with increased salinity compared with r1 the genes of r0 that coding for nitrite transporter nirc nitrate reductase narg narz nitrite oxidoreductase nxra and nitrite reductase nirb were down regulated at 3 5 salinity these results showed that fe iii improved the abundance of genes associated with nitrogen metabolism under high saline surroundings the abundance of ferrous iron transport protein b feob and iron complex outermembrane recepter protein tc fev om in r0 was always lower than that of r1 the genes coding for tc fev om were down regulated with increased salinity tc fev om is the receptor enzyme for the iron complex in the outer membrane of anammox bacteria wang et al 2023 these results indicated that fe iii addition could change the iron metabolism inside anammox under high salt stress 2 4 effects of fe iii on nitrogen metabolism of anammox species under 3 5 salinity to further reveal the influence of fe iii on metabolism of anammox species the contents of key functional enzymes nir hzs hdh and heme c were analyzed at 3 5 salinity in anammox metabolism process no2 was initially catalyzed to no by nir and then no combined with nh4 to form n2h4 through hzs and finally n2h4 was catalyzed to n2 by hdh kartal et al 2011 as depicted in fig 5 the contents of nir hzs and hdh of r1 was higher than that of r0 which indicated that fe iii obviously regulated functional enzymes synthesis of anammox bacteria under 3 5 salinity it was reported that fe addition could promote the activities of fe involved enzymes wang et al 2022a dai et al 2022 also indicated that moderately increasing fe concentration of influent could enhance the activity of hdh as a result fe iii promote the functional enzymes synthesis of anammox bacteria to alleviate salt stress in r1 heme c content was higher than that of the control fig 5b which indicated that fe iii could stimulate the production of heme c of anammox bacteria under 3 5 salinity zhang et al 2021c reported that heme c content was significantly increased at 10 mg l fe iii addition jeong et al 2022 indicated that the content of fe in granular anammox sludge decreased with increased salinity and thus limited the growth of anammox species furthermore heme c is correlated positively with the relative abundance of anammox bacteria kang et al 2020 therefore fe iii addition could increase heme c content which would be helpful for candidatus kuenenia and then promote its enrichment to resist salt stress 2 5 defense mechanism of fe iii assisted anammox under high salt stress the defense mechanism of fe iii assisted anammox under high salt stress was depicted in fig 6 firstly with the addition of fe iii the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia increased with salinity which was higher than the control under 3 5 salinity yin et al 2019 also reported that fe iii addition significantly accelerated the growth of marine anammox species in high saline wastewater treatment secondly fe iii strengthened the resistance of granular anammox sludge through stimulating eps secretion and sludge granulation under high salt stress it was indicated that fe could stimulate anammox sludge to secrete eps and then improve the resistance of anammox species to inhibitors dai et al 2022 besides fe iii could combine with oh to fe oh 3 under ph neutral condition and fe oh 3 promoted anammox granulation by acting as micro nuclei wang et al 2022b the granular anammox sludge could resist salt stress through its dense and compact structure with fe iii addition thirdly fe iii addition facilitated the synthesis of key enzymes and heme c and thus alleviated the influence of salt stress on anammox bacteria it was found that the activity of key enzymes in anammox was severely inhibited under saline surroundings zhang et al 2021b several studies had reported that fe could promote heme c synthesis and increase the activity of key enzymes of anammox feng et al 2023 wang et al 2022a wang et al 2023 3 conclusions this work investigated the defense mechanism of fe iii assisted anammox under salt stress the nitrogen removal efficiency and specific anammox activity was enhanced due to the addition of fe iii under as high as 3 5 salinity compared with the control group fe iii could stimulate the eps secretion of granular anammox sludge and facilitate the synthesis of nir hzs hdh and heme c to relieve salt stress fe iii addition significantly increased the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia under 3 5 salinity exposure overall this work would give a new sight of anammox species on resisting salt stress through fe iii assistance 4 materials and methods 4 1 experiment setup and reactor operation two identical upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors were conducted with a working volume of 3 l 5 mg l fe iii was continuously added to influent in r1 while r0 was operated without fe iii as the control reactor in particular the background iron of influent was supplied for the normal growth of anammox the only difference between r0 and r1 was the exogenous fe iii addition thus the background value of iron was negligible fecl3 was applied to provide fe iii reasons for choosing 5 mg l fe iii in this study were shown in the supplementary information text b in si the operation temperature was kept at 35 1 through a circulating water bath the hydraulic retention time was set at 12 h the entire experiment period was divided into three phases based on the variation of salinity table s2 4 2 inoculation and synthetic wastewater the sludge derived from a mature granular anammox reactor was

concentrations varying from 0 to 3 5 calculated by nacl influent ph was controlled at 7 5 0 2 through adding 2 mol l hcl n2 was aerated to the synthetic wastewater to expel dissolved oxygen 4 3

19891,mainstream nitrogen removal via anammox is widely recognized as a promising wastewater treatment process however its application is challenging at large scale due to unstable suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in this study a pilot scale mainstream anammox process was implemented in an integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas configuration stable operation with robust nob suppression was maintained for over one year this was achieved through integration of three key control strategies i low dissolved oxygen do 0 4 0 2 mg o2 l ii regular free nitrous acid fna based sludge treatment and iii residual ammonium concentration control nh4 with a setpoint of 8 mg n l activity tests and fish demonstrated that nob barely survived in sludge flocs and were inhibited in biofilms despite receiving organic deficient wastewater from a pilot scale high rate activated sludge hras system as the feed the system maintained a stable effluent total nitrogen concentration mostly below 10 mg n l which was attributed to the successful retention of anammox bacteria this study successfully demonstrated large scale long term mainstream anammox application and generated new practical knowledge for nob control and anammox retention graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mainstream anammox autotrophic nitrogen removal from wastewater bioenergy recovery effluent quality nob suppression data availability data will be made available on request introduction the microbial process of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox was discovered in late 1990s mulder et al 1995 and since then researchers have proposed an innovative technology partial nitritation and anammox pn a for highly efficient nitrogen removal from wastewater as a cost effective alternative to the conventional nitrification and denitrification processes kuenen 2008 with significant efforts made water engineers successfully installed pn a in the sidestream line treating high strength wastewater lackner et al 2014 and are exploring pn a in the main line of wastewater treatment plants wwtps the extension to mainstream nitrogen removal can multiply the economic benefits as the mainstream nitrogen load is about five times greater than the sidestream wang et al 2022 the application of mainstream pn a can also maximize the capture of organic carbon for bioenergy i e methane production offsetting energy consumption in a wwtp and hence can potentially transform wwtps from energy consumers to energy exporters kartal et al 2010 mccarty et al 2011 in the path to mainstream pn a application however the critical challenge is the suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nob compete for the nitrite substrate with anammox bacteria and its suppression is essential but challenging under the conditions of low influent ammonium nh4 concentration and low operational temperature agrawal et al 2018 cao et al 2017 qiu et al 2021 wang et al 2022 the nob control strategies developed to date can be divided into two major categories in situ nob suppression and ex situ nob inactivation the in situ control comprises the use of low dissolved oxygen do blackburne et al 2008 real time controlled intermittent aeration ma et al 2017b miao et al 2022 regmi et al 2014 step feed duan et al 2022 short sludge retention time srt laureni et al 2019 residual nh4 control poot et al 2016 or creating acidic conditions meng et al 2022 wang et al 2021b the ex situ control includes the use of harsh physical chemical treatments such as free nitrous acid fna wang et al 2014 free ammonia fa wang et al 2017 sulfide seuntjens et al 2018 heat ultrasonic shock chen et al 2016 and light irradiation yang et al 2022 zheng et al 2019 among others it should be noted that most of these strategies were only tested in laboratories under well controlled conditions as the essential step prior to full scale application successful demonstration of mainstream pn a process at a pilot scale remains sparse hausherr et al 2022 trojanowicz et al 2016 wu et al 2021 the level of nob suppression is subject to the diversity of nob members across four genera nitrobacter nitrospira candidatus ca nitrotoga and nitrolancea that are commonly found in wastewater treatment systems daims et al 2016 the nob invasion from wastewater duan et al 2019b further adds to the complexity meaning that some nob genera or species can adapt to the aforementioned control strategies leading to failure of nob suppression during a long term operation duan et al 2019a liu and wang 2013 wang et al 2021a for example ca nitrotoga fabula a newly isolated nob from an activated sludge sample kitzinger et al 2018 was found to possess strong resistance to ex situ exposure of fna above one parts per million 1 mg hno2 n l zheng et al 2020 these recent studies illustrate the importance of suppressing diverse nob through the integration of multiple strategies therefore this study aims to develop a combination of operational strategies to suppress the growth of nob in a mainstream pilot system over one year of operation this system successfully demonstrated the robustness of the mainstream pn a process thus opening a path to full scale implementation results long term system operation and performance the pilot system comprised an integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas process with the classical continuous flow anoxic a and oxic o configuration and inoculation of anammox contained carriers in both the a and o zones fig s1 the system was fed with domestic wastewater pre treated with a high rate activated sludge hras process which usually captured 60 of chemical oxygen demand cod from raw sewage table s1 the designed srt of 12 d and hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 2 h in the a zone and 6 7 h in the o zone are representative parameters of the conventional activated sludge processes installed across the globe rittmann and mccarty 2001 two nob control strategies of low do at 0 4 0 2 mg o2 l in the o zone and external sludge treatment using fna at 2 mg hno2 n l which were optimized in our previous laboratory study wang et al 2016 were initially integrated in the pilot system after start up the system successfully retained anammox bacteria in both the a and o biofilms fig s2a the tn and nh4 removal efficiencies gradually increased to over 80 in two months fig s2b s2c we monitored the maximum activity of aob and nob in sludge flocs using ex situ batch tests on a weekly basis which showed that at around 100th day the nob activity unexpectedly increased and reached 3 mg no2 n g volatile suspended solids vss h in two weeks fig s2d this posed a risk of failed nob control and thus immediately the in situ do setpoint was lowered to 0 2 mg o2 l as expected the nob activity of sludge flocs decreased rapidly to below 0 2 mg no2 n g vss h following this change however this also caused a significant deterioration in the nh4 removal efficiency reaching as low as 30 indicating that the aob activity was also negatively affected by the low do concentration consequently the do setpoint was elevated back to 0 4 mg o2 l and a residual nh4 concentration control 8 mg n l was implemented maintaining a residual nh4 level was hypothesized to suppress nob activity by promoting anammox activity for nitrite competition and decreasing oxygen penetration in biofilms which will be further elaborated in section 2 4 the improved operational strategy consisted of three key controls the external fna sludge treatment in situ low do concentration 0 4 0 2 mg o2 l and a relatively high residual nh4 concentration 8 mg n l with a fluctuating tn concentration in real wastewater and seasonally varying temperature the system effluent had mostly maintained a tn concentration below 10 mg n l comprising of nh4 8 mg n l no2 1 mg n l and no3 1 mg n l fig 1 this resulted in averaged tn and nh4 removal efficiencies of 80 over a one year period and therefore demonstrated a successful and robust operation of efficient mainstream nitrogen removal process retention of anammox bacteria in the a and o biofilms the efficient nitrogen removal performance that was achieved during the pilot trial was largely attributed to anammox because the hras pretreated wastewater only supported limited nitrate and nitrite dependent heterotrophic denitrification rates measured at 0 8 and 1 5 mg n g vss h respectively these rates are comparable to the sludge denitrification rates in the absence of soluble carbon sources e g 0 7 1 4 mg no3 n g vss h zheng et al 2013 and were much lower than the denitrification rate measured in domestic wastewater with readily biodegradable organic matters e g 6 6 mg no3 n g vss h kujawa and klapwijk 1999 the low organic degradability in wastewater with hras pretreatment was also reflected by a low tn removal efficiency of only 10 4 4 6 in our laboratory control reactor that used the same influent as the pilot system wang et al 2021a the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis revealed that anammox bacteria dominated in the a and o biofilms were candidatus brocadia showing no difference at the genus level fig s3 the abundance of candidatus brocadia within the a biofilms was relatively higher at 0 74 0 21 compared to the o biofilms 0 30 0 19 suggesting a slightly higher capacity of a biofilms to retain anammox bacteria the use of ex situ batch tests and q pcr analyses also showed that the maximum activity and population of anammox bacteria within the a biofilms were 1 5 0 3 g n m2 carrier d and 6 6 1 0 105 16s gene copies per ng dna respectively which were comparable but slightly higher than those measured with the o biofilms fig 2 a 2b these differences in anammox abundance and activity may be related to differences in environmental conditions such as do nitrite concentration and shear force between the a and o zones together these results indicate the successful retention of anammox bacteria in both the anoxic and oxic tanks thus expanding the application of mainstream anammox technology some studies have recently revealed that the a biofilms are the ideal location for retaining anammox bacteria in a continuous flow nitrogen removal process as anoxic environments can promote anammox enrichment which obtain nitrite from partial denitrification li et al 2021 li et al 2019 herein we examined whether nitrate dependent denitrification with hras effluent could support the a biofilm anammox i e partial denitrification and anammox pd a the removal of nh4 and no3 without no2 supply was tested in a series of anoxic batch assays nh4 and no3 simultaneously decreased in the groups with the a biofilms while in the group without a biofilms i e sole sludge flocs only the no3 concentration decreased fig 3 a c this suggests that the nh4 removal in the anoxic tank was driven by anammox bacteria in the a biofilms which obtained no2 from partial denitrification occurring in both flocs and biofilms the molar ratios of no3 removed to nh4 removed in batch tests with a biofilms were calculated to be 2 0 2 6 on average fig 3d this suggests that more than 50 of no3 could be partially reduced to no2 and supplied to the anammox bacteria contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal we developed a kinetic method to estimate the in situ anammox activity based on the measured maximum rate multiplied by a monod equation incorporating substrates and inhibitors as described in the activated sludge models henze et al 2000 this was because no2 with measured concentrations averaging at 0 24 mg n l in the a zone and 0 53 mg n l in the o zone fig s4 were comparable to the apparent nitrite affinity constant of 0 42 mg no2 n l for the a biofilm and 0 38 mg no2 n l for the o biofilm fig s5 thus the in situ anammox activity was limited by the in situ nitrite concentration to this end short term batch tests were first carried out to measure the maximum anammox activity in the a and o biofilms in conditions with sufficient nitrite fig s5 together with the measured apparent nitrite affinity constant and the in situ nitrite concentration the in situ anammox activity of the a biofilms was estimated to be 0 48 0 16 g n m2 carrier d comparable to that of the o biofilm 0 53 0 18 g n m2 carrier d fig 2c the in situ anammox activities together with the hrt and carrier filling ratios applied to the a and o zones of the pilot system revealed that anammox in the o and a biofilms contributed 60 and 40 of total nitrogen removal via anammox respectively of note the relative contribution may be influenced by the availability of organic carbon in the hras effluent offering a certain level of flexibility to maintain the overall stable nitrogen removal i e the a biofilms should contribute more if more organic carbon is available and vice versa while the pn a process contributed to the majority of nitrogen removal a key role of the pd a process is to remove no3 generated by anammox bacteria and the o biofilm nob see details in section 2 4 this is evidenced by the extremely low residual no3 concentration 1 mg n l in the final effluent and it appeared that the denitrification process based on limited organic carbon in the hras effluent was adequate to consume almost all no3 in the pilot system therefore partial denitrification also played a critical role in achieving the high level tn removal mechanisms of stable nob suppression restricting nob activity in the o zone enabled the no2 produced by aob to be supplied to anammox bacteria which represent the typical pn a pathways for nitrogen removal nob in sludge flocs were satisfactorily washed out in the pilot system where the maximum nob activity in sludge flocs was only 0 1 0 1 mg no2 n gvss h compared to 2 3 0 8 mg nh4 n gvss h for aob fig 4 a this was corroborated by the fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis which showed that aob considerably outnumbered nob fig 4b the strong suppression of nob can be largely attributed to regular sludge treatment using fna taking the inoculated sludge flocs as an example the maximum nob activity substantially decreased from 1 2 mg no2 n gvss h to less than 0 1 mg no2 n gvss h after 24 h of fna treatment nevertheless it should be noted that some nob could adapt to the sole fna treatment duan et al 2019a ma et al 2017a zheng et al 2020 this indicated that the use of in situ low do conditions and the nitrite competition by anammox bacteria were also critical for the long term suppression of nob wang et al 2021a in contrast to flocs the o biofilms contained nob nitrospira according to the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis fig s3b the presence and abundance of nob in the o biofilms were also reflected by a maximum nob activity to maximum aob activity ratio of about 1 fig s6 which is 2 3 times higher than that for biofilms from our laboratory pn a system reported with stable nob suppression meng et al 2021 however under the in situ conditions of low do and relatively high residual nh4 the ratio of no3 production to tn removal by the o biofilms was only 20 fig 5 this ratio was slightly higher than the stoichiometry of anammox reaction i e 13 and close to the ratios observed in previous laboratory pn a systems laureni et al 2016 meng et al 2021 this result indicated the suppression of the nob activity in the o biofilms by in situ factors rather than nob elimination indeed the no3 production rate by the o biofilms was measured as 2 mg no3 n l h when do was controlled at 0 4 mg l fig 5 this was significantly lower than the maximum nob activity rate of 4 7 mg no2 n l h measured at a high do 8 mg o2 l fig s6 demonstrating the role of low do in the suppression of the in situ nob activity in pn a biofilms nob are predominantly found within deep layers of the o biofilms together with anammox bacteria zhao et al 2023 thus the nob and anammox activity should be essentially controlled by oxygen penetrating into biofilms which could be lower than the monitored do concentrations within the bulk liquid oxygen penetration in biofilms is affected by the aob activity meaning that the residual nh4 concentration which controls aob activity should be another important factor driving nob suppression and anammox activity wang et al 2022 by measuring the tn removal rates under different residual nh4 concentrations in batch tests at do of 0 4 mg o2 l we found that a residual nh4 higher than 8 mg n l was essential to achieving a high tn removal rate by the o biofilms fig 5 in contrast the decrease in residual nh4 concentrations to 2 mg n l dramatically reduced the nitrogen removal performance which highlights the sensitivity of anammox activity to the residual nh4 concentration this result provides critical evidence to support a setpoint of residual nh4 as high as 8 mg n l in suppressing o biofilm nob for achieving efficient nitrogen removal in the pilot system discussion this study successfully demonstrated stable and long term application of anammox bacteria for mainstream nitrogen removal at pilot scale efficient nitrogen removal with the effluent tn less than 10 mg n l was achieved using industrially relevant operating conditions over one year demonstrating the potential for real world application of the mainstream anammox process a high level contribution of anammox to mainstream nitrogen removal was achieved by integrating multiple control strategies which included in situ low do control together with regular fna sludge treatment for effective elimination of nob in sludge flocs and low do with residual nh4 control for suppression of nob activity in biofilms these results demonstrated that multiple strategies were essential to overcome critical issues that result in nob adaptation which has previously been documented in laboratory studies duan et al 2019a wang et al 2021a the pilot system also employed the hras process to harvest organic carbon from wastewater to maximize bioenergy recovery in support of the ongoing paradigm shift for municipal wwtps to maximize energy recovery from wastewater the pilot scale demonstration of the mainstream pn a process has been reported in a few studies table s2 but not all were successful a general challenge mentioned by most previous studies is the nob control leading to a relatively poor effluent quality despite achieving comparable nitrogen removal rates for example a nitrogen removal rate of 0 2 kg n m3 d was achieved in a pilot pn a system with granular sludge whereas the total nitrogen in the effluent was mostly above 15 mg n l lotti et al 2015 likewise another pilot trial that employed anammox carriers for mainstream wastewater treatment was also limited by high effluent total nitrogen concentration greater than 20 mg n l despite achieving a peak nitrogen removal rate of 0 13 kg n m3 d gustavsson et al 2020 a notable exemption was hausherr et al 2022 where the total nitrogen was maintained below 3 mg n l in a two stage pn a system to the best of our knowledge this is the only pilot scale trial employing a two stage configuration the researchers argued that the two stage configuration is preferable if a low effluent tn is required in comparison a relatively high nh4 concentration is usually needed in an one stage configuration to support anammox activity and inhibit nob activity wang et al 2022 which is also demonstrated in our study in comparison to previous trials the extremely low nitrate in the final effluent of our system should be highlighted which was attributed to the denitrification partial denitrification in the anoxic tank as well as the stable nob elimination in flocs and nob activity suppression in biofilms in the oxic tank despite the benefits given by the residual ammonium control strategy the effluent of the proposed mainstream anammox process needs polishing before discharging into natural water bodies as it contains nh4 of 8 mg n l the residual nh4 control was thought to be an important strategy for nob suppression in mainstream pn a processes laureni et al 2016 yang et al 2023 while a minimal nh4 set point remains elusive a model based study suggested a residual nh4 concentration of 1 mg n l for maintaining nob repression in oxygen limited pn a pérez et al 2014 yet our study indicated that a higher residual nh4 level was required conclusions this study demonstrated the robustness of mainstream anammox technology at pilot scale the main conclusions from this study were integration of three control strategies including low do fna sludge treatment and residual nh4 control was effective in the elimination of nob in sludge flocs and suppression of nob in biofilms effluent quality of the mainstream anammox process was satisfactory in maintaining tn concentration generally less than 10 mg n l while a polishing process to remove the residual nh4 of 8 mg n l would be required in practice both carriers in anoxic and oxic zones were effective in retaining anammox activity with comparable treatment capacity and contribution to nitrogen removal material and methods pilot system setup

operation carriers in the a and o zones random collection of 130 pieces and sludge flocs 0 5 l were collected and transferred to batch reactors for the analysis of maximum anammox and aob nob activities respectively in brief all assays were conducted in 1 l glass bottle initially nh4cl and nano2 stock solutions were added to increase nh4 n and no2 n concentrations to about 20 30 mg n l ensuring that these substrates were not rate limiting a magnetic stirrer was used to mix with a speed of 200 rpm each assay lasted for 3 h at room temperature 22 1 c during which ph was maintained

no3 n concentrations the maximum anammox activity was determined by dividing the volumetric tn reduction rate linear regression of tn versus time to the k5 carrier biofilm surface area 800 m2 m3 packed volume the maximum aob and nob activities were calculated to be slopes of nh4 reduction and no3 production versus time divided by the vss concentration respectively experimental design of other ex situ batch tests more ex situ batch tests were conducted in the same experimental set up as that for the measurement of maximum activity section 5 5 while the experimental conditions were designed according to the actual in situ environments in situ anammox activity of the a and o biofilms the tests were performed with the initial nh4 concentration of 10 mg n l close to that in the a and o zones tests using the o biofilms were carried out at controlled do concentration of 0 4 mg o2 l the same as that in the o zone of the pilot a o system in each test the initial no2 concentration was raised to 2 mg n l via adding a nitrite stock solution the test was carried out until the no2 concentration decreased to zero and the liquid samples were taken every 5 min for 1 2 h after that the no2 concentration was raised to 15 mg n l via re addition of the nitrite stock solution and the experiments was continued for a further 1 h with the liquor samples collected every 15 min the two tests enabled the calculation of the tn removal rate i e r under varied no2 concentrations i e s from 0 to 5 mg n l and the maximum tn removal rate i e r max separately the data was fitted into the monod equation r r max s k s through a non linear regression of r versus s the apparent k values with respect to no2 of anammox in the a and o biofilms were obtained then the in situ anammox activity was calculated with the measured maximum anammox activity see section 5 5 the apparent k value and the in situ no2 concentrations in the a zone by using the monod equation for the o biofilms the inhibition of do should also be considered for the calculation of in situ anammox activity this factor was normalized to be 0 74 in this work according to a ratio of the measured maximum anammox

to examine the anammox activity supported by partial denitrification in the a zone three batch tests were carried out with sludge flocs a biofilms and their combination initially nh4 of 10 mg n l and no3 of 3 mg n l were provided as substrates without no2 addition the hras effluent volumetric ratio of 1 3 was also added to support denitrification with the limited organic carbon the operational

19891,mainstream nitrogen removal via anammox is widely recognized as a promising wastewater treatment process however its application is challenging at large scale due to unstable suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in this study a pilot scale mainstream anammox process was implemented in an integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas configuration stable operation with robust nob suppression was maintained for over one year this was achieved through integration of three key control strategies i low dissolved oxygen do 0 4 0 2 mg o2 l ii regular free nitrous acid fna based sludge treatment and iii residual ammonium concentration control nh4 with a setpoint of 8 mg n l activity tests and fish demonstrated that nob barely survived in sludge flocs and were inhibited in biofilms despite receiving organic deficient wastewater from a pilot scale high rate activated sludge hras system as the feed the system maintained a stable effluent total nitrogen concentration mostly below 10 mg n l which was attributed to the successful retention of anammox bacteria this study successfully demonstrated large scale long term mainstream anammox application and generated new practical knowledge for nob control and anammox retention graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mainstream anammox autotrophic nitrogen removal from wastewater bioenergy recovery effluent quality nob suppression data availability data will be made available on request introduction the microbial process of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox was discovered in late 1990s mulder et al 1995 and since then researchers have proposed an innovative technology partial nitritation and anammox pn a for highly efficient nitrogen removal from wastewater as a cost effective alternative to the conventional nitrification and denitrification processes kuenen 2008 with significant efforts made water engineers successfully installed pn a in the sidestream line treating high strength wastewater lackner et al 2014 and are exploring pn a in the main line of wastewater treatment plants wwtps the extension to mainstream nitrogen removal can multiply the economic benefits as the mainstream nitrogen load is about five times greater than the sidestream wang et al 2022 the application of mainstream pn a can also maximize the capture of organic carbon for bioenergy i e methane production offsetting energy consumption in a wwtp and hence can potentially transform wwtps from energy consumers to energy exporters kartal et al 2010 mccarty et al 2011 in the path to mainstream pn a application however the critical challenge is the suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nob compete for the nitrite substrate with anammox bacteria and its suppression is essential but challenging under the conditions of low influent ammonium nh4 concentration and low operational temperature agrawal et al 2018 cao et al 2017 qiu et al 2021 wang et al 2022 the nob control strategies developed to date can be divided into two major categories in situ nob suppression and ex situ nob inactivation the in situ control comprises the use of low dissolved oxygen do blackburne et al 2008 real time controlled intermittent aeration ma et al 2017b miao et al 2022 regmi et al 2014 step feed duan et al 2022 short sludge retention time srt laureni et al 2019 residual nh4 control poot et al 2016 or creating acidic conditions meng et al 2022 wang et al 2021b the ex situ control includes the use of harsh physical chemical treatments such as free nitrous acid fna wang et al 2014 free ammonia fa wang et al 2017 sulfide seuntjens et al 2018 heat ultrasonic shock chen et al 2016 and light irradiation yang et al 2022 zheng et al 2019 among others it should be noted that most of these strategies were only tested in laboratories under well controlled conditions as the essential step prior to full scale application successful demonstration of mainstream pn a process at a pilot scale remains sparse hausherr et al 2022 trojanowicz et al 2016 wu et al 2021 the level of nob suppression is subject to the diversity of nob members across four genera nitrobacter nitrospira candidatus ca nitrotoga and nitrolancea that are commonly found in wastewater treatment systems daims et al 2016 the nob invasion from wastewater duan et al 2019b further adds to the complexity meaning that some nob genera or species can adapt to the aforementioned control strategies leading to failure of nob suppression during a long term operation duan et al 2019a liu and wang 2013 wang et al 2021a for example ca nitrotoga fabula a newly isolated nob from an activated sludge sample kitzinger et al 2018 was found to possess strong resistance to ex situ exposure of fna above one parts per million 1 mg hno2 n l zheng et al 2020 these recent studies illustrate the importance of suppressing diverse nob through the integration of multiple strategies therefore this study aims to develop a combination of operational strategies to suppress the growth of nob in a mainstream pilot system over one year of operation this system successfully demonstrated the robustness of the mainstream pn a process thus opening a path to full scale implementation results long term system operation and performance the pilot system comprised an integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas process with the classical continuous flow anoxic a and oxic o configuration and inoculation of anammox contained carriers in both the a and o zones fig s1 the system was fed with domestic wastewater pre treated with a high rate activated sludge hras process which usually captured 60 of chemical oxygen demand cod from raw sewage table s1 the designed srt of 12 d and hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 2 h in the a zone and 6 7 h in the o zone are representative parameters of the conventional activated sludge processes installed across the globe rittmann and mccarty 2001 two nob control strategies of low do at 0 4 0 2 mg o2 l in the o zone and external sludge treatment using fna at 2 mg hno2 n l which were optimized in our previous laboratory study wang et al 2016 were initially integrated in the pilot system after start up the system successfully retained anammox bacteria in both the a and o biofilms fig s2a the tn and nh4 removal efficiencies gradually increased to over 80 in two months fig s2b s2c we monitored the maximum activity of aob and nob in sludge flocs using ex situ batch tests on a weekly basis which showed that at around 100th day the nob activity unexpectedly increased and reached 3 mg no2 n g volatile suspended solids vss h in two weeks fig s2d this posed a risk of failed nob control and thus immediately the in situ do setpoint was lowered to 0 2 mg o2 l as expected the nob activity of sludge flocs decreased rapidly to below 0 2 mg no2 n g vss h following this change however this also caused a significant deterioration in the nh4 removal efficiency reaching as low as 30 indicating that the aob activity was also negatively affected by the low do concentration consequently the do setpoint was elevated back to 0 4 mg o2 l and a residual nh4 concentration control 8 mg n l was implemented maintaining a residual nh4 level was hypothesized to suppress nob activity by promoting anammox activity for nitrite competition and decreasing oxygen penetration in biofilms which will be further elaborated in section 2 4 the improved operational strategy consisted of three key controls the external fna sludge treatment in situ low do concentration 0 4 0 2 mg o2 l and a relatively high residual nh4 concentration 8 mg n l with a fluctuating tn concentration in real wastewater and seasonally varying temperature the system effluent had mostly maintained a tn concentration below 10 mg n l comprising of nh4 8 mg n l no2 1 mg n l and no3 1 mg n l fig 1 this resulted in averaged tn and nh4 removal efficiencies of 80 over a one year period and therefore demonstrated a successful and robust operation of efficient mainstream nitrogen removal process retention of anammox bacteria in the a and o biofilms the efficient nitrogen removal performance that was achieved during the pilot trial was largely attributed to anammox because the hras pretreated wastewater only supported limited nitrate and nitrite dependent heterotrophic denitrification rates measured at 0 8 and 1 5 mg n g vss h respectively these rates are comparable to the sludge denitrification rates in the absence of soluble carbon sources e g 0 7 1 4 mg no3 n g vss h zheng et al 2013 and were much lower than the denitrification rate measured in domestic wastewater with readily biodegradable organic matters e g 6 6 mg no3 n g vss h kujawa and klapwijk 1999 the low organic degradability in wastewater with hras pretreatment was also reflected by a low tn removal efficiency of only 10 4 4 6 in our laboratory control reactor that used the same influent as the pilot system wang et al 2021a the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis revealed that anammox bacteria dominated in the a and o biofilms were candidatus brocadia showing no difference at the genus level fig s3 the abundance of candidatus brocadia within the a biofilms was relatively higher at 0 74 0 21 compared to the o biofilms 0 30 0 19 suggesting a slightly higher capacity of a biofilms to retain anammox bacteria the use of ex situ batch tests and q pcr analyses also showed that the maximum activity and population of anammox bacteria within the a biofilms were 1 5 0 3 g n m2 carrier d and 6 6 1 0 105 16s gene copies per ng dna respectively which were comparable but slightly higher than those measured with the o biofilms fig 2 a 2b these differences in anammox abundance and activity may be related to differences in environmental conditions such as do nitrite concentration and shear force between the a and o zones together these results indicate the successful retention of anammox bacteria in both the anoxic and oxic tanks thus expanding the application of mainstream anammox technology some studies have recently revealed that the a biofilms are the ideal location for retaining anammox bacteria in a continuous flow nitrogen removal process as anoxic environments can promote anammox enrichment which obtain nitrite from partial denitrification li et al 2021 li et al 2019 herein we examined whether nitrate dependent denitrification with hras effluent could support the a biofilm anammox i e partial denitrification and anammox pd a the removal of nh4 and no3 without no2 supply was tested in a series of anoxic batch assays nh4 and no3 simultaneously decreased in the groups with the a biofilms while in the group without a biofilms i e sole sludge flocs only the no3 concentration decreased fig 3 a c this suggests that the nh4 removal in the anoxic tank was driven by anammox bacteria in the a biofilms which obtained no2 from partial denitrification occurring in both flocs and biofilms the molar ratios of no3 removed to nh4 removed in batch tests with a biofilms were calculated to be 2 0 2 6 on average fig 3d this suggests that more than 50 of no3 could be partially reduced to no2 and supplied to the anammox bacteria contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal we developed a kinetic method to estimate the in situ anammox activity based on the measured maximum rate multiplied by a monod equation incorporating substrates and inhibitors as described in the activated sludge models henze et al 2000 this was because no2 with measured concentrations averaging at 0 24 mg n l in the a zone and 0 53 mg n l in the o zone fig s4 were comparable to the apparent nitrite affinity constant of 0 42 mg no2 n l for the a biofilm and 0 38 mg no2 n l for the o biofilm fig s5 thus the in situ anammox activity was limited by the in situ nitrite concentration to this end short term batch tests were first carried out to measure the maximum anammox activity in the a and o biofilms in conditions with sufficient nitrite fig s5 together with the measured apparent nitrite affinity constant and the in situ nitrite concentration the in situ anammox activity of the a biofilms was estimated to be 0 48 0 16 g n m2 carrier d comparable to that of the o biofilm 0 53 0 18 g n m2 carrier d fig 2c the in situ anammox activities together with the hrt and carrier filling ratios applied to the a and o zones of the pilot system revealed that anammox in the o and a biofilms contributed 60 and 40 of total nitrogen removal via anammox respectively of note the relative contribution may be influenced by the availability of organic carbon in the hras effluent offering a certain level of flexibility to maintain the overall stable nitrogen removal i e the a biofilms should contribute more if more organic carbon is available and vice versa while the pn a process contributed to the majority of nitrogen removal a key role of the pd a process is to remove no3 generated by anammox bacteria and the o biofilm nob see details in section 2 4 this is evidenced by the extremely low residual no3 concentration 1 mg n l in the final effluent and it appeared that the denitrification process based on limited organic carbon in the hras effluent was adequate to consume almost all no3 in the pilot system therefore partial denitrification also played a critical role in achieving the high level tn removal mechanisms of stable nob suppression restricting nob activity in the o zone enabled the no2 produced by aob to be supplied to anammox bacteria which represent the typical pn a pathways for nitrogen removal nob in sludge flocs were satisfactorily washed out in the pilot system where the maximum nob activity in sludge flocs was only 0 1 0 1 mg no2 n gvss h compared to 2 3 0 8 mg nh4 n gvss h for aob fig 4 a this was corroborated by the fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis which showed that aob considerably outnumbered nob fig 4b the strong suppression of nob can be largely attributed to regular sludge treatment using fna taking the inoculated sludge flocs as an example the maximum nob activity substantially decreased from 1 2 mg no2 n gvss h to less than 0 1 mg no2 n gvss h after 24 h of fna treatment nevertheless it should be noted that some nob could adapt to the sole fna treatment duan et al 2019a ma et al 2017a zheng et al 2020 this indicated that the use of in situ low do conditions and the nitrite competition by anammox bacteria were also critical for the long term suppression of nob wang et al 2021a in contrast to flocs the o biofilms contained nob nitrospira according to the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis fig s3b the presence and abundance of nob in the o biofilms were also reflected by a maximum nob activity to maximum aob activity ratio of about 1 fig s6 which is 2 3 times higher than that for biofilms from our laboratory pn a system reported with stable nob suppression meng et al 2021 however under the in situ conditions of low do and relatively high residual nh4 the ratio of no3 production to tn removal by the o biofilms was only 20 fig 5 this ratio was slightly higher than the stoichiometry of anammox reaction i e 13 and close to the ratios observed in previous laboratory pn a systems laureni et al 2016 meng et al 2021 this result indicated the suppression of the nob activity in the o biofilms by in situ factors rather than nob elimination indeed the no3 production rate by the o biofilms was measured as 2 mg no3 n l h when do was controlled at 0 4 mg l fig 5 this was significantly lower than the maximum nob activity rate of 4 7 mg no2 n l h measured at a high do 8 mg o2 l fig s6 demonstrating the role of low do in the suppression of the in situ nob activity in pn a biofilms nob are predominantly found within deep layers of the o biofilms together with anammox bacteria zhao et al 2023 thus the nob and anammox activity should be essentially controlled by oxygen penetrating into biofilms which could be lower than the monitored do concentrations within the bulk liquid oxygen penetration in biofilms is affected by the aob activity meaning that the residual nh4 concentration which controls aob activity should be another important factor driving nob suppression and anammox activity wang et al 2022 by measuring the tn removal rates under different residual nh4 concentrations in batch tests at do of 0 4 mg o2 l we found that a residual nh4 higher than 8 mg n l was essential to achieving a high tn removal rate by the o biofilms fig 5 in contrast the decrease in residual nh4 concentrations to 2 mg n l dramatically reduced the nitrogen removal performance which highlights the sensitivity of anammox activity to the residual nh4 concentration this result provides critical evidence to support a setpoint of residual nh4 as high as 8 mg n l in suppressing o biofilm nob for achieving efficient nitrogen removal in the pilot system discussion this study successfully demonstrated stable and long term application of anammox bacteria for mainstream nitrogen removal at pilot scale efficient nitrogen removal with the effluent tn less than 10 mg n l was achieved using industrially relevant operating conditions over one year demonstrating the potential for real world application of the mainstream anammox process a high level contribution of anammox to mainstream nitrogen removal was achieved by integrating multiple control strategies which included in situ low do control together with regular fna sludge treatment for effective elimination of nob in sludge flocs and low do with residual nh4 control for suppression of nob activity in biofilms these results demonstrated that multiple strategies were essential to overcome critical issues that result in nob adaptation which has previously been documented in laboratory studies duan et al 2019a wang et al 2021a the pilot system also employed the hras process to harvest organic carbon from wastewater to maximize bioenergy recovery in support of the ongoing paradigm shift for municipal wwtps to maximize energy recovery from wastewater the pilot scale demonstration of the mainstream pn a process has been reported in a few studies table s2 but not all were successful a general challenge mentioned by most previous studies is the nob control leading to a relatively poor effluent quality despite achieving comparable nitrogen removal rates for example a nitrogen removal rate of 0 2 kg n m3 d was achieved in a pilot pn a system with granular sludge whereas the total nitrogen in the effluent was mostly above 15 mg n l lotti et al 2015 likewise another pilot trial that employed anammox carriers for mainstream wastewater treatment was also limited by high effluent total nitrogen concentration greater than 20 mg n l despite achieving a peak nitrogen removal rate of 0 13 kg n m3 d gustavsson et al 2020 a notable exemption was hausherr et al 2022 where the total nitrogen was maintained below 3 mg n l in a two stage pn a system to the best of our knowledge this is the only pilot scale trial employing a two stage configuration the researchers argued that the two stage configuration is preferable if a low effluent tn is required in comparison a relatively high nh4 concentration is usually needed in an one stage configuration to support anammox activity and inhibit nob activity wang et al 2022 which is also demonstrated in our study in comparison to previous trials the extremely low nitrate in the final effluent of our system should be highlighted which was attributed to the denitrification partial denitrification in the anoxic tank as well as the stable nob elimination in flocs and nob activity suppression in biofilms in the oxic tank despite the benefits given by the residual ammonium control strategy the effluent of the proposed mainstream anammox process needs polishing before discharging into natural water bodies as it contains nh4 of 8 mg n l the residual nh4 control was thought to be an important strategy for nob suppression in mainstream pn a processes laureni et al 2016 yang et al 2023 while a minimal nh4 set point remains elusive a model based study suggested a residual nh4 concentration of 1 mg n l for maintaining nob repression in oxygen limited pn a pérez et al 2014 yet our study indicated that a higher residual nh4 level was required conclusions this study demonstrated the robustness of mainstream anammox technology at pilot scale the main conclusions from this study were integration of three

operation carriers in the a and o zones random collection of 130 pieces and sludge flocs 0 5 l were collected and transferred to batch reactors for the analysis of maximum anammox and aob nob activities respectively in brief all assays were conducted in 1 l glass bottle initially nh4cl and nano2 stock solutions were added to increase nh4 n and no2 n concentrations to about 20 30 mg n l ensuring that these substrates were not rate limiting a magnetic stirrer was used to mix with a speed of 200 rpm each assay lasted for 3 h at room temperature 22 1 c during which ph was maintained between 7 0 and 7 5 by manually adding 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh to measure the maximum anammox activity compressed pure dinitrogen n2 gas was continually flushed at 1 0 l min to estimate the maximum aob and nob activities air was supplied at 1 0 l min liquid samples were taken every 0 5 h and filtered with 0 45 μm disposable sterile millipore filters merck for the measurement of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations the maximum anammox activity was determined by dividing the volumetric tn reduction rate linear regression of tn versus time to the k5 carrier biofilm surface area 800 m2 m3 packed volume the maximum aob and nob activities were calculated to be slopes of nh4 reduction and no3 production versus time divided by the vss concentration respectively experimental design of other ex situ batch tests more ex situ batch tests were conducted in the same experimental set up as that for the measurement of maximum activity section 5 5 while the experimental conditions were designed according to the actual in situ environments in situ anammox activity of the a and o biofilms the tests were performed with the initial nh4 concentration of 10 mg n l close to that in the a and o zones tests using the o biofilms were carried out at controlled do concentration of 0 4 mg o2 l the same as that in the o zone of the pilot a o system in each test the initial no2 concentration was raised to 2 mg n l via adding a nitrite stock solution the test was carried out until the no2 concentration decreased to zero and the liquid samples were taken every 5 min for 1 2 h after that the no2 concentration was raised to 15 mg n l via re addition of the nitrite stock solution and the experiments was continued for a further 1 h with the liquor samples collected every 15 min the two tests enabled the calculation of the tn removal rate i e r under varied no2 concentrations i e s from 0 to 5 mg n l and the maximum tn removal rate i e r max separately the data was fitted into the monod equation r r max s k s through a non linear regression of r versus s the apparent k values with respect to no2 of anammox in the a and o biofilms were obtained then the in situ anammox activity was calculated with the measured maximum anammox activity see section 5 5 the apparent k value and the in situ no2 concentrations in the a zone by using the monod equation for the o biofilms the inhibition of do should also be considered for the calculation of in situ anammox activity this factor was normalized to be 0 74 in this work according to a ratio of the measured maximum anammox activity at do of 0 4 mg o2 l to that at do of 0 mg o2 l effect of residual nh4 concentration on tn removal and no3 production rates of the o biofilms this group of tests were carried out at do of 0 4 mg o2 l under different residual nh4 concentrations using the o biofilms initially 25 mg n l of no2 was added to ensure the non limited no2 condition simultaneous removal of nh4 and no3 in the a zone to examine the anammox activity supported by partial denitrification in the a zone three batch tests were carried out with sludge flocs a biofilms and their combination initially nh4 of 10 mg n l and no3 of 3 mg n l were provided as substrates without no2 addition the hras effluent volumetric ratio of 1 3 was also added to support denitrification with the limited organic carbon the operational

associated with organic matter froelich 1988 river and richardson 2018 venkiteshwaran et al 2018 in soils phosphorus cycling in soils is a complex phenomenon that is strongly influenced by the nature of the inorganic and organic solid phases forms and extent of biological activity chemistry of the soil solution e g ph ionic strength redox potential and other environmental factors such as soil moisture and temperature because soil solution p concentrations are relatively low the amount of p in soil solution at any given time is generally on the order of 1 kg ha 1 or 1 of the total quantity

water or soil samples alam et al 2021 there is a critical need for portable technologies that improve in situ p analysis emerging mobile sensor technologies that directly quantify p in complex

rta triad fig 1 top row when signals are digitized and combined with feedback control systems fig 1 bottom row this is then denoted a cyber physical system cps in general the intent of portable techniques such as cps is not to replace a gold standard method but rather to augment monitoring efforts by expanding spatiotemporal resolution via in situ ground truthing combination of real time ground truth with analytical laboratory techniques allows spatiotemporal p dynamics to be quantified to extend this concept in situ mobile p sensors and cps if combined appropriately with social needs

these selecting coating materials are integrated with various transduction approaches in the development of p sensors electrochemical photonic etc compared to gold standard analytical techniques portable p sensors suffer from poor specificity in complex matrices such as wastewater soil surface waters or food processing environments to circumvent the lack of accuracy sample pre treatment may be used lu et al 2021 however this approach requires considerable exogenous reagents acids complex equipment and or significant human intervention thus limiting automation and sample throughput and applications in near real time decision support to be applicable to emerging cps monitoring next generation p sensors must at a minimum quantify at least one form of p in near real time with no dependence on external reagents cps for phosphate are beginning to appear in the peer reviewed literature most cps are soft sensor systems which are input output in silico models real time data on surrogates non phosphorus targets are analyzed using techniques such as principal component analysis or machine learning techniques p concentration is inferred via correlation of the model and data is used for process control for example hong et al 2007 developed one of the first soft sensor systems for monitoring a bench scale sequencing batch reactor for biological nutrient removal more recently nair et al 2020 and zhang et al 2022 developed soft sensor cps for predicting p concentration in wastewater bioreactors based on real time surrogate sensors see supplemental table s1 other examples of soft sensor cps have been demonstrated in urine monitoring and control saetta et al 2019 and in pipe robotic systems for water quality kazeminasab and banks 2022 among cps for p monitoring the few examples in the literature that propose smart systems with embedded data analytics either demonstrate poor selectivity or a lack of validation against gold standard analytical testing akhter et al 2022 harnsoongnoen et al 2019 nag et al 2019 table s1 to date all cps have focused on ortho p in the peer reviewed literature or more accurately soluble molybdate reactive phosphorus there is currently no literature demonstrating direct continuous quantitative sensing for any of the mass flows identified by cordell and others organic or inorganic brownlie et al 2021 chen and graedel 2016 cordell and white 2014 p sensors and associated cps have the unique ability to fill data gaps empowering end users and policymakers via data informed decision support mclamore et al 2019 in line with duffy and regan 2017 we call for the development of in situ cps for p that can shed light on the fate and form of p in water and soil systems however we raise caution regarding the widespread deployment of p sensors that are not developed with sustainability as a guiding principle this caution aligns with the recent report by the national academies of science in debunking infeasible technologies nasem national academies of science engineering and medicine 2021 which is important for long term technology translation and establishment of trust networks 3 sustainability frameworks to guide emerging p monitoring systems sustainability is rooted in the triple bottom line tbl built on environmental social and economic pillars fig 2 orange boxes translation of scientific discovery is driven by adoption appropriation and implementation all of which have both technological and non technological aspects at the most granular level tbl and similar frameworks must drive emerging technology development for example selection of sustainable materials for device fabrication spans both affinity coatings in sensors as well as transduction systems for signal acquisition fig 2 blue

behavior change fig 2 yellow boxes 3 1 technological solutions will benefit from tbl frameworks weidenkaff et al 2021 note that sustainable economies require mass production of electronics chemical batteries motors etc using recycled materials as the source input for manufacturing if sensors are to play a role in future systems at large scale sensor and cps developers must follow suit recent studies have demonstrated development of electrochemical or plasmonic sensors using recycled metals abdelbasir et al 2018 2020 polymers mohanty et al 2022 and obsolete solid waste such as compact discs brown et al 2022 earth abundant transition metals and metal oxides are increasing in popularity for electrochemical sensor development maduraiveeran et al 2019 which may pave the way toward limiting use of noble metals organic semiconductors have been synthesized from used rubber tires for electronic platform fabrication zhu et al 2019 in another example reagent free sensors based on paper devices have been developed for applications in the water and food supply chains arduini et al 2020 sustainable development of sensors and cps does not end with physical device fabrication raw data from monitoring technologies has no direct value rather the data must evolve to the information domain where it is accessible to social knowledge networks data analytics for cps depend on physical centers capable of supporting storage analysis and dissemination of structured unstructured data on demand development of sustainable data centers has been a global concern for decades and is a component of the un sustainable development goals united nations 2019 sovacool et al 2022 critically reviewed the current status of massive data centers nordic region and the associated complexities related to environmental costs and the health of local biological systems in the region in addition to issues of displacement and regional ecosystem damage resulting from new centers energy use is a major concern predictions of global energy consumption by data centers vary from 300 to 3000 billion kwh per year hintemann and hinterholzer 2019 the metric for energy efficiency power use effectiveness pue is highly variable amongst data centers but in general is decreasing as infrastructure improvements chen et al 2020 data one of the hidden layers of cps is receiving more attention in the last decade we anticipate this increased attention will illuminate emergent opportunities and challenges in cps development key questions for cps developers may be are we asking the right questions prior to development of our technologies does every problem require a cps solution in the next section we summarize how cps may inform non technological solutions for p management across the waste water soil and food cycles 3 2 non technological solutions will benefit from tbl informed cps cps informed by sustainability frameworks are well positioned to integrate with stakeholders users key actors in the non technological solution space include regulatory bodies and associated practices as well as various stakeholders for regulators effective in situ cps may provide more accurate and plentiful data on p flows in the environment for stakeholders in industry cps development may represent a new product that can be marketed or improvements to an existing product data on the spatiotemporal concentration of p may empower farmers to make faster informed decisions about land management and thus improve crop yield without additional inputs the environment itself represents another stakeholder we may not be able to ask the environment its opinion about sensors but we are nevertheless accountable to the interests of environmental protection for future generations accounting for many and varied stakeholder perspectives presents challenges to traditional methods of technology design for example while regulators may welcome more accurate sensors more accurate and plentiful data may result in policy that requires farmers to change practices and incur more costs to comply with changes in the regulatory regime moreover stakeholders vary in the power and influence they can wield in the design process the pursuit of commodification may be salient for industry over other stakeholder interests finally to encourage more widespread adoption sensors should be included in existing familiar technologies to overcome the risk of information overload for those who use them while balancing these demands presents a challenge that challenge must be met to promote wider adoption and meaningful use 4 challenges and opportunities information on the concentration and speciation of p in agroecosystems and associated subsystems is critical for implementation of circular resource systems understanding the forms and the flows of p in water and soil systems is critical to recovery and reuse efforts the next generation of p monitoring systems must be rooted in sustainability frameworks with the tbl acting as a minimum for success emerging systems must account for complex interactions and consider adaptive dynamics oriented to informing action integration of coupled interactions particularly those involving societal factors has been a major weakness of other systems level approaches that involve analytical detection selin 2022 there is an opportunity to learn from previous global monitoring efforts and also to integrate existing approaches that have been largely ignored regarding the latter frameworks rooted in citizen science are becoming a popular approach for pollution monitoring hsu et al 2014 mahajan 2022 if applied for p monitoring citizen science and other open science pathways have the potential to connect people with data these connections are critical for interoperability of sensors and decision support systems the necessary transformations for sustainable p sensing hardware and software must be accompanied by a wide ranging stakeholder engagement process that collects analyzes synthesizes and circulates diverse even conflicting perspectives that inform research agenda designing and engineering sensor technologies

cordell and white 2014 p sensors and associated cps have the unique ability to fill data gaps empowering end users and policymakers via data informed decision support mclamore et al 2019 in line with duffy and regan 2017 we call for the development of in situ cps for p that can shed light on the fate and form of p in water and soil systems however we raise caution regarding the widespread deployment of p sensors that are not developed with sustainability as a guiding principle this caution aligns with the recent report by the national academies of science in debunking infeasible technologies nasem national academies of science engineering and medicine 2021 which is important for long term technology translation and establishment of trust networks 3 sustainability frameworks to guide emerging p monitoring systems sustainability is rooted in the triple bottom line tbl built on environmental social and economic pillars fig 2 orange boxes translation of scientific discovery is driven by adoption appropriation and implementation all of which have both technological and non technological aspects at the most granular level tbl and similar frameworks must drive emerging technology development for example selection of sustainable materials for device fabrication spans both affinity coatings in sensors as well as transduction systems for signal acquisition fig 2 blue boxes sustainability frameworks also inform cyber system infrastructure e g data centers fig 2 purple boxes in the non technological space production and consumption practices in general are facing environmental and social constraints olivetti and cullen 2018 selin 2022 stakeholder perceptions whether tangible or otherwise fig 2 green boxes drive practices including knowledge gains and attitude behavior change fig 2 yellow boxes 3 1 technological solutions will benefit from tbl frameworks weidenkaff et al 2021 note that sustainable economies require mass production of electronics chemical batteries motors etc using recycled materials as the source input for manufacturing if sensors are to play a role in future systems at large scale sensor and cps developers must follow suit recent studies have demonstrated development of electrochemical or plasmonic sensors using recycled metals abdelbasir et al 2018 2020 polymers mohanty et al 2022 and obsolete solid waste such as compact discs brown et al 2022 earth abundant transition metals and metal oxides are increasing in popularity for electrochemical sensor development maduraiveeran et al 2019 which may pave the way toward limiting use of noble metals organic semiconductors have been synthesized from used rubber tires for electronic platform fabrication zhu et al 2019 in another example reagent free sensors based on paper devices have been developed for applications in the water and food supply chains arduini et al 2020 sustainable development of sensors and cps does not end with physical device fabrication raw data from monitoring technologies has no direct value rather the data must evolve to the information domain where it is accessible to social knowledge networks data analytics for cps depend on physical centers capable of supporting storage analysis and dissemination of structured unstructured data on demand development of sustainable data centers has been a global concern for decades and is a component of the un sustainable development goals united nations 2019 sovacool et al 2022 critically reviewed the current status of massive data centers nordic region and the associated complexities related to environmental costs and the health of local biological systems in the region in addition to issues of displacement and regional ecosystem damage resulting from new centers energy use is a major concern predictions of global energy consumption by data centers vary from 300 to 3000 billion kwh per year hintemann and hinterholzer 2019 the metric for energy efficiency power use effectiveness pue is highly variable amongst data centers but in general is decreasing as infrastructure improvements chen et al 2020 data one of the hidden layers of cps is receiving more attention in the last decade we anticipate this increased attention will illuminate emergent opportunities and challenges in cps development key questions for cps developers may be are we asking the right questions prior to development of our technologies does every problem require a cps solution in the next section we summarize how cps may inform non technological solutions for p management across the waste water soil and food cycles 3 2 non technological solutions will benefit from tbl informed cps cps informed by sustainability frameworks are well positioned to integrate with stakeholders users key actors in the non technological solution space include regulatory bodies and associated practices as well as various stakeholders for regulators effective in situ cps may provide more accurate and plentiful data on p flows in the environment for stakeholders in industry cps development may represent a new product that can be marketed or improvements to an existing product data on the spatiotemporal concentration of p may empower farmers to make faster informed decisions about land management and thus improve crop yield without additional inputs the environment itself represents another stakeholder we may not be able to ask the environment its opinion about sensors but we are nevertheless accountable to the interests of environmental protection for future generations accounting for many and varied stakeholder perspectives presents challenges to traditional methods of technology design for example while regulators may welcome more accurate sensors more accurate and plentiful data may result in policy that requires farmers to change practices and incur more costs to comply with changes in the regulatory regime moreover stakeholders vary in the power and influence they can wield in the design process the pursuit of commodification may be salient for industry over other stakeholder interests finally to encourage more widespread adoption sensors should be included in existing familiar technologies to overcome the risk of information overload for those who use them while balancing these demands presents a challenge that challenge must be met to promote wider adoption and meaningful use 4 challenges and opportunities information on the concentration and speciation of p in agroecosystems and associated subsystems is critical for implementation of circular resource systems understanding the forms and the flows of p in water and soil systems is critical to recovery and reuse efforts the next generation of p monitoring systems must be rooted in sustainability frameworks with the tbl acting as a minimum for success emerging systems must account for complex interactions and consider adaptive dynamics oriented to informing action integration of coupled interactions particularly those involving societal factors has been a major weakness of other systems level approaches that involve analytical detection selin 2022 there is an opportunity to learn from previous global monitoring efforts and also to integrate existing approaches that have been largely ignored regarding the latter frameworks rooted in citizen science are becoming a popular approach for pollution monitoring hsu et al 2014 mahajan 2022 if applied for p monitoring citizen science and other open science pathways have the potential to connect people with data these connections are critical for interoperability of sensors and decision support systems the necessary transformations for sustainable p sensing hardware and software must be accompanied by a wide ranging stakeholder engagement process that collects analyzes synthesizes and circulates diverse even conflicting perspectives that inform research agenda designing and engineering sensor technologies for providing meaningful use blumenthal and tavenner 2010 thurston 2014 to stakeholders avoids the pitfalls of technology over promise that plague the field of sustainability research and development

19893,microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps are ubiquitous and intractable in urban waters compared with mps the smaller nps have shown distinct physicochemical features such as brownian motion higher specific surface area and stronger interaction with other pollutants therefore the qualitative and quantitative analysis of nps is more challenging than that of mps moreover these characteristics endow nps with significantly different environmental fate interactions with pollutants and eco impacts from those of mps in urban waters herein we critically analyze the current advances in the difference between mps and nps in urban waters analytical challenges fate interactions with surrounding pollutants and eco impacts of mps and nps are comparably discussed the characterizations and fate studies of nps are more challenging compared to mps furthermore nps in most cases exhibit stronger interactions with other pollutants and more adverse eco impacts on living things than mps subsequently perspective in this field is proposed to stimulate further size dependent studies on mps and nps this review would benefit the understanding of the role of nps in the urban water ecosystem and guide future studies on plastic pollution management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics plastic pollution eco impacts urban water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the wide application of plastics in our lives has resulted in a huge amount of waste plastic debris in the environment and it was estimated that about 400 mt of plastic wastes were generated globally in 2019 liu et al 2023 yuan et al 2021 worse still the recent covid 19 pandemic has largely exacerbated global plastic pollution due to a sharp increase in the use of single use plastic products adyel 2020 currently plastic wastes have been identified in various environmental matrixes including water ambient air soil sediment and biota lai et al 2021 among these plastic wastes in urban waters e g drinking water freshwater receiving water stormwater sludges and wastewater are of growing concern as they are closely linked with human quality of life small plastic debris in urban waters especially microplastics mps 100 nm 5 mm and nanoplastics nps 100 nm are considered as troublesome pollutants due to their difficult removal and accumulation in human bodies through the food chain luo et al 2023 xu et al 2021 the management of mps and nps in urban waters is thus an urgent and challenging environmental problem and a good understanding of the formation occurrence fate interactions with other pollutants and eco impacts of mps and nps in urban waters is a prerequisite naturally mps and nps are generated from large plastic debris through various processes such as mechanical wear weathering aging photolysis hydrolysis heat and biological fragmentation arpia et al 2021 shi et al 2022 mps and nps can also originate directly from plastic products e g industrial abrasives exfoliants in personal care products and accidental spills chen et al 2022c in earlier studies nps have largely been treated as an extension of mps and have not been analyzed separately the main reason for this is their similar origin and composition however an avalanche of investigations shows that nps in urban waters differ from mps in terms of their analytical challenges transport properties interactions with pollutants bio effects and removal behavior gigault et al 2021 theoretically a 2 mm polyvinyl chloride pvc a density of 1 4 g cm3 bead is determined to settle in water at a rate of about 87 cm s according to stokes law for ideal conditions while the settling rate of a 100 nm pvc bead would be 6 9 cm year thus nps and mps would show distinct transport and fate behavior in urban waters due to their different physicochemical properties fig 1 nps appear to remain homogeneously dispersed in water systems for quite a long time which would lead to analytical and removal difficulties also the higher toxicity of nps compared to mps to eco systems has been identified ma et al 2016 and reviewed yin et al 2021a to this end clarifying the differences in the analysis fate interactions with pollutants and eco impacts of nps and mps is vital for gaining a full picture of pressing plastic pollution in urban water systems currently a handful of informative reviews have analyzed the mps and or nps pollution in terms of their origin analysis removal transport and eco impacts chen et al 2022a dong et al 2023 gaylarde et al 2021 huang et al 2022 2021a ivleva 2021 larue et al 2021 roy et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 in most cases mps and nps are discussed as a whole pollutant and the differential features have not been thoroughly analyzed therefore a comprehensive review on the different analytical challenges fate interactions with pollutants and eco impacts of mps and nps is still highly needed to guide guiding further precise plastic pollution control in terms of developing advanced analytical techniques understanding fate designing efficient removal strategies etc in this review we examine the current understanding of the differential characteristics of mps and nps in urban waters analytical challenges fate interactions with pollutants and eco impacts of mps and nps are discussed with these analyses we aim to provide a clear cognitive profile of mps and nps in urban waters finally perspective in this field is proposed to stimulate further studies on mps and nps especially the more challenging nps 2 analysis of nps is more challenging than mps the accurate characterization chemical identification and quantification of mps and nps in urban waters is critical for assessing actual risks associated with these tiny plastics to date various mass based and particle based qualitative and quantitative analyses of mps and nps have been developed prior to quantification chemical identification of polymer types is suggested to ensure the reliability of analytical results especially when analyzing complex samples cai et al 2021 2 1 mass based methods some sophisticated mass based methods allow effective analysis of mps such as thermal degradation gc ms gas chromatography mass spectrometry el hayany et al 2020 hendrickson et al 2018 td ptr ms thermal desorption proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry materić et al 2020 tga ms thermogravimetric analysis mass spectrometry david et al 2018 tga dsc thermogravimetric analysis differential scanning calorimetry majewsky et al 2016 and inductively coupled plasma icp based methods klöckner et al 2019 wang et al 2017 among these methods thermal related methods focus on analyzing mps conversion products generated under typical temperatures and atmospheres while icp based methods are performed to detect and quantify mps typical chemical components e g trace elements wang et al 2017 overall these mass based methods can also be used for nps characterization owing to the common analytical mechanism blancho et al 2021 sullivan et al 2020 while fewer attempts have been reported however the sampling pretreatment processes for nps are more complex than the dead end filtration process for mps generally digestion acid hydrogen peroxide alkali treatment schwaferts et al 2019 preconcentration ultrafiltration continuous flow centrifugation cloud point extraction and ultracentrifugation shi et al 2023 zhou et al 2018 and separation treatments asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation size exclusion chromatography correia and loeschner 2018 of nps are required to ensure the quality of subsequent analytical methods 2 2 particle based methods particle based methods mainly microscopic and spectroscopic techniques have been widely used for the characterization of organic polymers based on the interaction of plastics molecular vibrations with typical radiation raman spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared ftir are widely used to determine the type number size distribution and shape of polymers in plastics ivleva 2021 for mps analysis ftir and raman spectroscopy as well as optical microscopy can provide meaningful identification and quantification information however the smaller size of nps makes the far field geometric optics based chemical analysis and imaging inaccurate specifically when the size of particles nps is smaller than the wavelength of infrared 700 1000 nm or visible 400 700 nm lights the optical diffraction would be significant leading to an abbe diffraction resolution limit approximately 200 nm for analytical techniques that depend on transmitted reflected light bright field microscopy and micro ftir or laser spot sizes micro raman spectroscopy gigault et al 2021 accordingly diffraction unlimited optical microscopy e g stimulated emission depletion microscopy nonlinear structured illumination microscopy dedecker et al 2008 or electron microscopy wang et al 2020 is demanded to precisely image nps compared to far field light techniques which are incompatible with the full characterization of nps near field techniques can evade the diffraction resolution limitation by confining the light to an evanescent field bouloumis and nic chormaic 2020 jakubowicz et al 2021 2 3 integrated methods the development of integrated techniques that combine the advantages of different methods is becoming a trend in the analysis of nps and mps the scanning electron microscopy sem raman spectroscopy combination has been demonstrated for the identification and visualization of 100 nm polystyrene ps particles fang et al 2020 atomic force microscopy afm spectroscopy techniques afm ir afm raman can achieve a better spatial resolution at the nanoscale approximately 20 50 nm dazzi and prater 2017 by online coupling of raman microspectroscopy and field flow fractionation enabled by optical tweezers schwaferts et al realized tiny particle separation and characterization in the size range of 5 to 0 2 μm schwaferts et al 2020 these demonstrations highlight the cooperation of diverse methods in the analysis of nps and mps and the optimal technique depends on the properties of plastics e g size concentration shape and the associated water matrix e g in organic pollutants ph for real sample analysis 3 fate of nps is more complex than that of mps the different physicochemical characteristics of mps and nps influence their fate in urban waters the colloidal nature and dominant brownian motion of small and light nps would severely limit their buoyancy sedimentation driven vertical transport compared to mps made from the same material therefore nps tend to remain homogeneously dispersed in urban waters while mps will sink or float such differences lead to different environmental fates of mps and nps 3 1 transport urban waters are important sources and sinks of mps and nps when mps and nps enter the urban water system they can transport with the water flow or deposit in the sediment plastic size density shape surface chemical properties surrounding substances e g clay natural organic matter nom and hydrodynamic and hydrometeorological factors largely govern the transport of mps and nps huang et al 2022 notably although we have mentioned that nps will be in a highly dispersed state in urban waters aggregation of nps would result in larger particles that are likely to deposit in the sediment gigault et al 2021 nps can homo aggregate with nps and hetero aggregate with colloids clays algae anthropogenic materials and dissolved organic matter dom in urban waters alimi et al 2018 the aggregation of nps is controlled by their size surface chemical properties ionic strength of water and surrounding chemicals colloids according to the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory particles with larger sizes are less likely to aggregate with surrounding substances leading to higher stability and mobility in urban waters as evidenced by song et al mps with a size of 200 nm size were more stable and did not form aggregates while the 50 nm nps could efficiently aggregate with organic matter and metal ions in the same aqueous condition song et al 2019 this study also highlighted the importance of surface functional groups in the hetero aggregation of nps in addition the concentration valence and hydration ability of cations e g ca2 mg2 na jointly affect the aggregation rate and aggregate structure of nps mao et al 2020 sun et al 2021 and high salinity and high valence of cations promote the aggregation of nps hou et al 2022 interestingly extracellular polymeric substances eps have been shown to negatively affect nps aggregation due to steric effects mao et al 2020 such environmental factors have a disproportionate effect on the aggregate attachment efficiency of nps compared to mps because of the leading role of plastic particles surface properties in addition the collision rate for np aggregation is controlled by brownian diffusion and structural layer force sun et al 2021 rather than by fluid motion settling and sedimentation therefore the fate of nps in urban waters could not be directly deduced from that of mps and is more complex than that of nps 3 2 aging and decomposition in urban waters the natural aging and decomposition of mps and nps regulate their physicochemical properties and thus their fate for mps degradation aging through natural abiotic and or biotic processes such as biodegradation photodegradation photolysis mechanical chemical and thermal routes leads to the destruction of structural and mechanical characteristics da costa et al 2016 thus the specific surface area of aged mps is increased and the surface of aged mps has a high proportion of organic molecules functional groups especially oh and cooh which enhances plastic surface interactions with microbial and other contaminants ali et al 2021a at present the natural aging and decomposition of nps in urban waters is less explored as mps and nps are in most cases co occurring however it is reasonable to assume that aging could influence the colloidal stability and transport of nps by regulating the surface chemistry surface functional groups surface charge which is an important factor in controlling aggregation in addition compared to mps nps with smaller size and weight are less likely to be destroyed by a mechanical process also nps dispersed in the water body and deposited in the sediment are less likely to be affected by light induced oxidation processes 3 3 removal in urban water systems wastewater treatment plants wwtps play a critical role in the removal of mps and nps it is suggested that the overall removal efficiency of mps reaches 94 99 with the primary secondary and tertiary units ali et al 2021a sun et al 2019 for the removal of nps the tertiary unit can make a large contribution mohana et al 2021 nevertheless it should be noted that none of the current studies provides a definitive removal efficiency of nps in wwtps as most of the detected plastic debris has a size larger than 1 μm and the detection of nps remains a major challenge ali et al 2021a therefore the fate of nps in wwtps needs further investigation based on precise quantification 4 interactions of nps with other pollutants are stronger than mps in real urban water conditions mps and nps coexist with different substances compared to mps the high surface to volume ratio and rich surface functional groups of nps allow more contact with other pollutants in urban waters including inorganic metal ions and clays organics microbes etc the interaction of mps and nps with surrounding pollutants leads to the formation of composite pollutants which can affect the analysis fate toxicity and removal of plastics ali et al 2021a yu et al 2021 4 1 abiotic pollutants the interaction of mps and nps with abiotic pollutants is mainly driven by van der waals force hydrophobic hydrophilic interaction pore filling interaction hydrogen bonding surface complexation electrostatic interaction and π π interaction chen et al 2022b yu et al 2021 thus plastics size surface area and surface chemistry functional groups are principal factors influencing the interaction between surrounding abiotic pollutants and plastic particles theoretically reducing the particle size can increase the interaction strength and frequency due to the increased surface area to volume ratio specific surface area and exposed functional groups yu et al 2021 for example velzeboer and co workers studied the adsorption behavior of typical organic contaminants polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs on polyethylene pe mps 10 180 μm and ps nps 70 nm and unveiled that the adsorption capacity of ps nps was 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of pe mps velzeboer et al 2014 this study also suggested that the interaction of mps and nps with pollutants was influenced by nom ph value metal ions etc similarly wang et al suggested that the aggregation of nps would reduce the adsorption capacity wang et al 2019 aside from artificial organic contaminants the interaction of metal ions with mps and nps should also be investigated the oxygen containing functional groups on mps and nps lead to an affinity between metal ions and plastic debris for mps the metal ions will adsorb on the surface and settle or flow with the mps and mps porosity surface area and morphology are key factors affecting the sorption capacity ali et al 2021a differently the interaction of metal ions with nps results in the aggregation of nps by compressing the electric double layer on the particle surface xiong et al 2020 and high valence metal ions e g fe3 are more likely to induce nps aggregation than low valence counterparts e g na cai et al 2018 the interaction between metal ions and nps can be regulated by aging the ultraviolet irradiation aging process can inhibit the aggregation of ps nps in a nacl solution by increasing the negative charge on the surface of ps nps and the organic matter content in the solution while it can promote ps nps aggregation in cacl2 solutions due to the interactions between ca2 and carboxyl groups formed on the surface of ps nps liu et al 2019 nom which is ubiquitous in natural waters with different chemical groups e g oh cooh and phenolic groups is expected to adsorb onto the plastic surface and further regulate the surface properties of plastic particles chen et al 2018 wei et al 2022 current studies suggest that the adsorption of nom on mps and nps will form a protein layer ali et al 2022 several reports indicated that the adsorption of humic acid ha and sodium alginate could improve the aggregation of pe mps li et al 2019 and ps mps pradel et al 2021 respectively however li and co authors found that nom had a negligible effect on mps and coexisting clay at low ionic strength li et al 2021a for the study of nps nom e g ha showed an insignificant effect on the heteroaggregation of ps nps because of the steric hindrance according to the dlvo theory li et al 2019 however the addition of nacl could regulate the interaction among ha ps nps and suspended sediment thereby facilitating the heteroaggregation and co settling of nps suspended sediment and ha mixture fig 2 a by reducing the electrostatic repulsion between ps nps and large suspended sediment in general the interaction of nom with nps has little effect on dispersed nps by boosting particles steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion however nom could increase or decrease the aggregation of ps nps in fe3 solutions at different ion concentrations cai et al 2018 to this end the interaction of nps with nom is greatly affected by other coexisting substances in urban waters and it is necessary to include nps nom ions ionic strength and suspended matter when discussing the interaction between nps and abiotic pollutants song et al 2019 in 2018 oriekhova et al examined the interaction of nps with fe2o3 particles ions and alginate mixtures at different concentration ratios as depicted in fig 2b the electrostatic effect was found to play a critical role and the maximum heteroaggregation was observed at the isoelectric point of heteroaggregate furthermore the addition of alginate caused the shift of the maximum heteroaggregation to higher np concentrations because of the neutralization of excess negative charges oriekhova and stoll 2018 naturally the components and concentrations of nom mps nps suspended colloids and ions ionic strengths in urban water vary regionally and seasonally which would make it quite challenging to understand their interaction hence it is too early to conclude and differentiate the interaction of mps and nps with abiotic pollutants 4 2 biotic pollutants compared to most microbes nps have a smaller size indicating potential differences in microbial interaction with mps and nps mps are large enough to serve as a substrate for microbial colonization and the development of biofilms miri et al 2022 the involved microbes form a large part of the microbe mps heteroaggregates and would influence the distribution and fate of mps by changing the effective density but the whole heteroaggregate particle remains primarily mps he et al 2022 differently nps may be a minor portion of the large np microbe complex and represent a small proportion of the mass of the formed microbes nps heteroaggregates gigault et al 2021 in this case the properties of nps would have a relatively small effect on the fate of the microbes nps complex and some coexisting pollutants e g nom heavy metals may have a large effect apart from the composition of plastic microbe heteroaggregates another issue related to the plastic microbe interaction is the biodegradation of mps and nps the biodegradation process generally involves the attachment of microbes on mps and nps biofilm formation exoenzymes driven biodeterioration depolymerization fragmentation assimilation and final mineralization ali et al 2021b although the difference in the biodegradation between mps and nps remains unclear recent results have provided some interesting information wu et al found that ps mps with a smaller particle size 75 μm were more easily colonized by biofilms than the 4 mm counterparts on the 4 mm mps surface a thin layer of biofilm was noticed while the 75 μm mps formed heteroaggregates with biofilms wu et al 2022 accordingly when the size is further reduced to 100 nm the interaction between biofilms and nps would further intensify the colonization process and modify nps properties in another study ps nps 100 nm showed a more significant negative effect on the nitrogen and carbon cycling of freshwater biofilms than mps 0 5 μm 1 μm and 9 μm miao et al 2019 5 eco impacts of nps are higher than those of mps mps and nps together with their associated chemical additives heavy metals and organic pollutants form a complex pollutant system in urban waters these pollutants have shown ecotoxicological effects on aquatic organisms and even humans lehner et al 2019 compared to mps a remarkably higher proportion of the additives molecules adsorbed pollutants on nps surface leads to much higher surface reactivity and bioavailability more importantly the size of nps is closer to that of natural proteins making it easier for nps to cross biological membranes via passive diffusion and endocytosis pathways huang et al 2021b liu et al 2021 this section discusses the current understanding of the different eco impacts of mps and nps in urban water systems 5 1 biological wastewater treatment processes in biological wastewater treatment systems mps and nps can have an impact on microbes and regulate the associated water treatment processes generally nps play a more prominent role than mps zhou et al found that nitrogen removal by activated sludge was limited by ps nps 100 nm but not influenced by mps 100 μm this was because nps could cause acute toxicity to activated sludge via induced reactive oxygen species ros production and lactate dehydrogenase ldh release decrease nitrifiers and denitrifiers and suppress nitrification and denitrification genes fig 3 zhou et al 2022 the more significant inhibitory effect of ps nps 50 nm on nitrification was also reported by lee et al who found that the observed effects of ps nps on nitrification should be owing to the disruption of the membrane potential of the cells lee et al 2022 similar results also suggested the more significant effect of nps than mps on the production of fuels e g hydrogen methane in anaerobic digestion processes wang et al 2022 2023 zhang et al 2020 5 2 aquatic plants nps and mps have different effects on plants plankton macrophytes in urban water systems as reported nearly 90 of studies investigating the effects of nps on phytoplankton suggested nps had toxic effects while 90 of concerned studies indicated that mps 1 10 µm had no toxicity larue et al 2021 in general mps only influence plants by clogging the nutrient transport channel li et al 2021b differently nps which can be absorbed and migrated through plants show more complicated phytotoxicity furthermore nps can internalize into plant tissues and cause damage to plant tissues via the regulation of cell membranes endomolecules and ros induced genotoxicity and cytotoxicity maity and pramanick 2020 yin et al 2021b germination elongation growth biomass and photosynthesis are the most frequently studied parameters of plant stress responses to mps and nps mateos cárdenas et al 2021 compared to ps mps 100 μm ps nps 100 nm show more significant adverse effects on algal chlamydomonas reinhardtii growth and reproduction over a wide concentration range of 50 500 mg l yan et al 2021 weert and co authors studied the influence of ps mps and nps on the growth of two macrophytes myriophyllum spicatum and elodea sp the negative effect of nps on the two types of macrophytes was more prominent than that of mps in terms of the relative growth rate root and shoot dry weight shoot root ratio and shoot length interestingly a dose dependent negative effect was witnessed in all tests related to nps nevertheless for the mps this dose dependent phenomenon was only observed in the main shoot length of myriophyllum spicatum van weert et al 2019 notably although most studies suggest that nps are more toxic to plants than mps there are some exceptions jiang and co authors examined the effect of 5 μm ps mps and 100 nm ps nps on vicia faba the ps mps entered the root tissue of vicia faba and exhibited higher toxicity than the smaller nps on plant weight jiang et al 2019 in another study the vascular plant lepidium sativum exposed to 4 8 μm 500 nm and 50 nm plastics for 8 h showed germination rates of 21 46 and 56 respectively the reason for this was that larger mps led to a more severe blocking effect and thus a more significant delay in germination bosker et al 2019 in this context the effects of mps and mps on plants need to be studied in detail and the plastic dose exposure time and plant type should receive more attention agathokleous et al 2021 5 3 aquatic animals the size dependent effects of plastic debris on aquatic animals e g zooplankton fish are also significant nps enter body tissues and cells more easily and it is extremely challenging to remove these tiny particles from animal bodies therefore nps exhibit increased exposure period bioavailability and risks to aquatic animals compared to mps jeong et al 2016 shen et al 2019 shin and jeong 2022 when investigating the effect of ps on the brackish water flea diaphanosoma celebensis a size dependent oxidative stress response was found the smaller ps nps had a longer retention time and higher acute toxicity than micro sized ones yoo et al 2021 ma et al found that 50 nm nps caused physical damage and significant toxicity to d magna while 10 μm mps did not the presence of nps largely improved the bioaccumulation of phenanthrene derived residues in the daphnid body and hindered the dissipation transformation of phenanthrene while 10 μm mps showed insignificant effects on the bioaccumulation and dissipation transformation of phenanthrene ma et al 2016 in general exposure to mps and nps would lead to obvious size dependent effects on zooplankton with smaller nps being more hazardous than mps nps could cause reduced growth rate increased mortality longer reproduction time and reduced fecundity etc besseling et al 2014 apart from zooplankton fish are an important part of aquatic ecosystems and the food chain and some studies have examined the negative effects of mps and nps on fish in the study of plastics effect on zebrafish larvae locomotor activity mps 45 μm exhibited insignificant effects except for the upregulated zfrho visual gene expression however nps 50 nm showed more pronounced harmful effects including inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity 40 reduction of larvae body length 6 inhibition of larval locomotion 22 and significant upregulation of zfrho gfap zfblue and α1 tubulin gene expression chen et al 2017 in another study both ps mps 8 μm and nps 80 nm induced microbiota dysbiosis in the gut of zebrafish whereas only nps increased the mrna levels of tnfα il8 il10 and il1β in the gut xie et al 2021 hence nps had a more negative effect on the zebrafish gut than mps causing inflammation and microbiota dysbiosis interestingly kang et al uncovered distinct toxicity pathways of nps and mps on oryzias melastigma they found that nps induced oxidative stress mediated responses while mps regulated microbiota composition and resulted in dysbiosis fig 4 kang et al 2021 qin et al also found that ps nps could induce high oxidative stress in the cd treated zebrafish larvae which promoted taurine metabolism and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis qin et al 2021 these studies highlight the importance of separately examining the eco impact of mps and nps 5 4 human the omnipresent nps and mps in urban waters especially drinking water bottled water and aquatic fish render human exposure to tiny plastic particles inevitable and recent reports have indicated the accumulation of different mps and nps particles in human bodies amato lourenço et al 2021 jenner et al 2022 kannan and vimalkumar 2021 in vitro investigations have also revealed diverse toxicological effects of highly permeable mps and nps particles on human cells e g oxidative stress necrosis genotoxicity neurotoxicity cytotoxicity reproductive toxicity and inflammation huang et al 2021a rahman et al 2021 schwabl et al 2019 for instance exposure to ps nps 60 nm induced oxidative destruction of the epithelial cells inkielewicz stepniak et al 2018 recently grodzicki and coworkers summarized the effects of nps on the gut brain axis as shown in fig 5 grodzicki et al 2021 generally the persistence of mps and nps together with their chemical additives and adsorbed toxic pollutants would pose serious health risks to human bodies compared to mps nps can more easily cross the gastrointestinal barrier in human bodies and enter the capillary blood system and be further transported throughout the whole body lehner et al 2019 nps can also accumulate in tissues and cells leading to local inflammation and metabolic disorders as suggested by forte et al smaller ps nps 44 nm accumulated more efficiently in the cytoplasm of gastric adenocarcinoma cells compared to the larger counterpart 100 nm in addition the smaller nps strongly induced the upregulation of il 6 and il 8 genes two critical cytokines involved in gastric pathologies forte et al 2016 a previous study also suggested that the smaller 40 nm nps could penetrate cells through the follicular epithelium but the larger mps 750 and 1500 nm were blocked by the skin vogt et al 2006 current studies are mainly based on model mps and nps and real environmental samples are rarely investigated and the study of the size dependent toxicological effect of environmental mps and nps on human health is still in its infancy 6 conclusions and perspective due to their smaller size nps differ significantly from mps in terms of analytical challenges fate interactions with pollutants and eco impacts compared to mps the analysis of nps with sizes below the geometric optical resolution requires more complicated techniques and equipment in addition nps tend to remain homogeneously dispersed in urban waters whereas mps mainly undergo vertical transport driven by buoyancy and sedimentation the higher surface area and surface functional group content of nps makes them easier to aggregate and regulate their fate and also gives them high adsorption capacities towards surrounding pollutants such characteristics further provide nps with higher hazardous effects on microbes plants animals and even humans in the urban water systems than mps although some exceptions do not follow the size dependent effect further studies should focus on the following points 1 accurate analysis analytical challenges have substantially impeded the acquisition of accurate data on the fate interaction with surrounding pollutants and eco impacts of mps and nps since the size of nps is below the geometric optical resolution many existing analytical techniques for mps fail to detect nps accordingly the establishment of new analytical theories methods and facilities for the analysis of nps is an important research direction it should be noted that organic pollutants that are attached to the mps and nps would interfere with the identification of mps and nps in this context it is necessary to separate plastic particles from the associated organics during the sampling process in addition a standard procedure protocol for mps and nps analysis should be established to make results from different studies more reliable and comparable 2 real environmental samples in real urban waters mps and nps samples generally show high inhomogeneity in size shape and type and experience long term aging therefore it is necessary to perform the size dependent study with real environmental samples instead of the purchased plastic debris with similar size density and shape another issue of concern is the concentration of mps nps current studies generally use high concentrations of mps and nps to investigate their effect within a short exposure period which will not occur in the real urban water system further research is needed to explore the behavior long term effects of mps and nps at environmental doses 3 efficient removal strategies current strategies applied in wwtps can deal well with the problem of mps but the removal of nps is still in its infancy and membrane based techniques may hold the promise for efficient removal of nps in addition to the extraction of nps from water the development of efficient degradation methods is also highly recommended catalytic degradation photocatalysis electrocatalysis and biodegradation could mineralize these polymers in water or valorize plastics into value added chemicals and fuels 4 mps nps combined environmental contaminants in urban waters mps nps are associated with various pollutants such as heavy metal ions persistent organic pollutants pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes mps nps act as vectors for these contaminants and alter the overall toxicity to ecosystems current studies on the combined toxic effects of mps nps and other environmental contaminants remain mainly at the phenomenological level while the underlying molecular mechanisms causing the regulated toxicity remain unclear the transport of mps nps and combined pollutants in organisms the interaction between mps nps and the combined pollutants and the in depth analysis of the biological effects of mps nps and combined pollutants need to be further

19893,microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps are ubiquitous and intractable in urban waters compared with mps the smaller nps have shown distinct physicochemical features such as brownian motion higher specific surface area and stronger interaction with other pollutants therefore the qualitative and quantitative analysis of nps is more challenging than that of mps moreover these characteristics endow nps with significantly different environmental fate interactions with pollutants and eco impacts from those of mps in urban waters herein we critically analyze the current advances in the difference between mps and nps in urban waters analytical challenges fate interactions with surrounding pollutants and eco impacts of mps and nps are comparably discussed the characterizations and fate studies of nps are more challenging compared to mps furthermore nps in most cases exhibit stronger interactions with other pollutants and more adverse eco impacts on living things than mps subsequently perspective in this field is proposed to stimulate further size dependent studies on mps and nps this review would benefit the understanding of the role of nps in the urban water ecosystem and guide future studies on plastic pollution management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics plastic pollution eco impacts urban water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the wide application of plastics in our lives has resulted in a huge amount of waste plastic debris in the environment and it was estimated that about 400 mt of plastic wastes were generated globally in 2019 liu et al 2023 yuan et al 2021 worse still the recent covid 19 pandemic has largely exacerbated global plastic pollution due to a sharp increase in the use of single use plastic products adyel 2020 currently plastic wastes have been identified in various environmental matrixes including water ambient air soil sediment and biota lai et al 2021 among these plastic wastes in urban waters e g drinking water freshwater receiving water stormwater sludges and wastewater are of growing concern as they are closely linked with human quality of life small plastic debris in urban waters especially microplastics mps 100 nm 5 mm and nanoplastics nps 100 nm are considered as troublesome pollutants due to their difficult removal and accumulation in human bodies through the food chain luo et al 2023 xu et al 2021 the management of mps and nps in urban waters is thus an urgent and challenging environmental problem and a good understanding of the formation occurrence fate interactions with other pollutants and eco impacts of mps and nps in urban waters is a prerequisite naturally mps and nps are generated from large plastic debris through various processes such as mechanical wear weathering aging photolysis hydrolysis heat and biological fragmentation arpia et al 2021 shi et al 2022 mps and nps can also originate directly from plastic products e g industrial abrasives exfoliants in personal care products and accidental spills chen et al 2022c in earlier studies nps have largely been treated as an extension of mps and have not been analyzed separately the main reason for this is their similar origin and composition however an avalanche of investigations shows that nps in urban waters differ from mps in terms of their analytical challenges transport properties interactions with pollutants bio effects and removal behavior gigault et al 2021 theoretically a 2 mm polyvinyl chloride pvc a density of 1 4 g cm3 bead is determined to settle in water at a rate of about 87 cm s according to stokes law for ideal conditions while the settling rate of a 100 nm pvc bead would be 6 9 cm year thus nps and mps would show distinct transport and fate behavior in urban waters due to their different physicochemical properties fig 1 nps appear to remain homogeneously dispersed in water systems for quite a long time which would lead to analytical and removal difficulties also the higher toxicity of nps compared to mps to eco systems has been identified ma et al 2016 and reviewed yin et al 2021a to this end clarifying the differences in the analysis fate interactions with pollutants and eco impacts of nps and mps is vital for gaining a full picture of pressing plastic pollution in urban water systems currently a handful of informative reviews have analyzed the mps and or nps pollution in terms of their origin analysis removal transport and eco impacts chen et al 2022a dong et al 2023 gaylarde et al 2021 huang et al 2022 2021a ivleva 2021 larue et al 2021 roy et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 in most cases mps and nps are discussed as a whole pollutant and the differential features have not been thoroughly analyzed therefore a comprehensive review on the different analytical challenges fate interactions with pollutants and eco impacts of mps and nps is still highly needed to guide guiding further precise plastic pollution control in terms of developing advanced analytical techniques understanding fate designing efficient removal strategies etc in this review we examine the current understanding of the differential characteristics of mps and nps in urban waters analytical challenges fate interactions with pollutants and eco impacts of mps and nps are discussed with these analyses we aim to provide a clear cognitive profile of mps and nps in urban waters finally perspective in this field is proposed to stimulate further studies on mps and nps especially the more challenging nps 2 analysis of nps is more challenging than mps the accurate characterization chemical identification and quantification of mps and nps in urban waters is critical for assessing actual risks associated with these tiny plastics to date various mass based and particle based qualitative and quantitative analyses of mps and nps have been developed prior to quantification chemical identification of polymer types is suggested to ensure the reliability of analytical results especially when analyzing complex samples cai et al 2021 2 1 mass based methods some sophisticated mass based methods allow effective analysis of mps such as thermal degradation gc ms gas chromatography mass spectrometry el hayany et al 2020 hendrickson et al 2018 td ptr ms thermal desorption proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry materić et al 2020 tga ms thermogravimetric analysis mass spectrometry david et al 2018 tga dsc thermogravimetric analysis differential scanning calorimetry majewsky et al 2016 and inductively coupled plasma icp based methods klöckner et al 2019 wang et al 2017 among these methods thermal related methods focus on analyzing mps conversion products generated under typical temperatures and atmospheres while icp based methods are performed to detect and quantify mps typical chemical components e g trace elements wang et al 2017 overall these mass based methods can also be used for nps characterization owing to the common analytical mechanism blancho et al 2021 sullivan et al 2020 while fewer attempts have been reported however the sampling pretreatment processes for nps are more complex than the dead end filtration process for mps generally digestion acid hydrogen peroxide alkali treatment schwaferts et al 2019 preconcentration ultrafiltration continuous flow centrifugation cloud point extraction and ultracentrifugation shi et al 2023 zhou et al 2018 and separation treatments asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation size exclusion chromatography correia and loeschner 2018 of nps are required to ensure the quality of subsequent analytical methods 2 2 particle based methods particle based methods mainly microscopic and spectroscopic techniques have been widely used for the characterization of organic polymers based on the interaction of plastics molecular vibrations with typical radiation raman spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared ftir are widely used to determine the type number size distribution and shape of polymers in plastics ivleva 2021 for mps analysis ftir and raman spectroscopy as well as optical microscopy can provide meaningful identification and quantification information however the smaller size of nps makes the far field geometric optics based chemical analysis and imaging inaccurate specifically when the size of particles nps is smaller than the wavelength of infrared 700 1000 nm or visible 400 700 nm lights the optical diffraction would be significant leading to an abbe diffraction resolution limit approximately 200 nm for analytical techniques that depend on transmitted reflected light bright field microscopy and micro ftir or laser spot sizes micro raman spectroscopy gigault et al 2021 accordingly diffraction unlimited optical microscopy e g stimulated emission depletion microscopy nonlinear structured illumination microscopy dedecker et al 2008 or electron microscopy wang et al 2020 is demanded to precisely image nps compared to far field light techniques which are incompatible with the full characterization of nps near field techniques can evade the diffraction resolution limitation by confining the light to an evanescent field bouloumis and nic chormaic 2020 jakubowicz et al 2021 2 3 integrated methods the development of integrated techniques that combine the advantages of different methods is becoming a trend in the analysis of nps and mps the scanning electron microscopy sem raman spectroscopy combination has been demonstrated for the identification and visualization of 100 nm polystyrene ps particles fang et al 2020 atomic force microscopy afm spectroscopy techniques afm ir afm raman can achieve a better spatial resolution at the nanoscale approximately 20 50 nm dazzi and prater 2017 by online coupling of raman microspectroscopy and field flow fractionation enabled by optical tweezers schwaferts et al realized tiny particle separation and characterization in the size range of 5 to 0 2 μm schwaferts et al 2020 these demonstrations highlight the cooperation of diverse methods in the analysis of nps and mps and the optimal technique depends on the properties of plastics e g size concentration shape and the associated water matrix e g in organic pollutants ph for real sample analysis 3 fate of nps is more complex than that of mps the different physicochemical characteristics of mps and nps influence their fate in urban waters the colloidal nature and dominant brownian motion of small and light nps would severely limit their buoyancy sedimentation driven vertical transport compared to mps made from the same material therefore nps tend to remain homogeneously dispersed in urban waters while mps will sink or float such differences lead to different environmental fates of mps and nps 3 1 transport urban waters are important sources and sinks of mps and nps when mps and nps enter the urban water system they can transport with the water flow or deposit in the sediment plastic size density shape surface chemical properties surrounding substances e g clay natural organic matter nom and hydrodynamic and hydrometeorological factors largely govern the transport of mps and nps huang et al 2022 notably although we have mentioned that nps will be in a highly dispersed state in urban waters aggregation of nps would result in larger particles that are likely to deposit in the sediment gigault et al 2021 nps can homo aggregate with nps and hetero aggregate with colloids clays algae anthropogenic materials and dissolved organic matter dom in urban waters alimi et al 2018 the aggregation of nps is controlled by their size surface chemical properties ionic strength of water and surrounding chemicals colloids according to the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory particles with larger sizes are less likely to aggregate with surrounding substances leading to higher stability and mobility in urban waters as evidenced by song et al mps with a size of 200 nm size were more stable and did not form aggregates while the 50 nm nps could efficiently aggregate with organic matter and metal ions in the same aqueous condition song et al 2019 this study also highlighted the importance of surface functional groups in the hetero aggregation of nps in addition the concentration valence and hydration ability of cations e g ca2 mg2 na jointly affect the aggregation rate and aggregate structure of nps mao et al 2020 sun et al 2021 and high salinity and high valence of cations promote the aggregation of nps hou et al 2022 interestingly extracellular polymeric substances eps have been shown to negatively affect nps aggregation due to steric effects mao et al 2020 such environmental factors have a disproportionate effect on the aggregate attachment efficiency of nps compared to mps because of the leading role of plastic particles surface properties in addition the collision rate for np aggregation is controlled by brownian diffusion and structural layer force sun et al 2021 rather than by fluid motion settling and sedimentation therefore the fate of nps in urban waters could not be directly deduced from that of mps and is more complex than that of nps 3 2 aging and decomposition in urban waters the natural aging and decomposition of mps and nps regulate their physicochemical properties and thus their fate for mps degradation aging through natural abiotic and or biotic processes such as biodegradation photodegradation photolysis mechanical chemical and thermal routes leads to the destruction of structural and mechanical characteristics da costa et al 2016 thus the specific surface area of aged mps is increased and the surface of aged mps has a high proportion of organic molecules functional groups especially oh and cooh which enhances plastic surface interactions with microbial and other contaminants ali et al 2021a at present the natural aging and decomposition of nps in urban waters is less explored as mps and nps are in most cases co occurring however it is reasonable to assume that aging could influence the colloidal stability and transport of nps by regulating the surface chemistry surface functional groups surface charge which is an important factor in controlling aggregation in addition compared to mps nps with smaller size and weight are less likely to be destroyed by a mechanical process also nps dispersed in the water body and deposited in the sediment are less likely to be affected by light induced oxidation processes 3 3 removal in urban water systems wastewater treatment plants wwtps play a critical role in the removal of mps and nps it is suggested that the overall removal efficiency of mps reaches 94 99 with the primary secondary and tertiary units ali et al 2021a sun et al 2019 for the removal of nps the tertiary unit can make a large contribution mohana et al 2021 nevertheless it should be noted that none of the current studies provides a definitive removal efficiency of nps in wwtps as most of the detected plastic debris has a size larger than 1 μm and the detection of nps remains a major challenge ali et al 2021a therefore the fate of nps in wwtps needs further investigation based on precise quantification 4 interactions of nps with other pollutants are stronger than mps in real urban water conditions mps and nps coexist with different substances compared to mps the high surface to volume ratio and rich surface functional groups of nps allow more contact with other pollutants in urban waters including inorganic metal ions and clays organics microbes etc the interaction of mps and nps with surrounding pollutants leads to the formation of composite pollutants which can affect the analysis fate toxicity and removal of plastics ali et al 2021a yu et al 2021 4 1 abiotic pollutants the interaction of mps and nps with abiotic pollutants is mainly driven by van der waals force hydrophobic hydrophilic interaction pore filling interaction hydrogen bonding surface complexation electrostatic interaction and π π interaction chen et al 2022b yu et al 2021 thus plastics size surface area and surface chemistry functional groups are principal factors influencing the interaction between surrounding abiotic pollutants and plastic particles theoretically reducing the particle size can increase the interaction strength and frequency due to the increased surface area to volume ratio specific surface area and exposed functional groups yu et al 2021 for example velzeboer and co workers studied the adsorption behavior of typical organic contaminants polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs on polyethylene pe mps 10 180 μm and ps nps 70 nm and unveiled that the adsorption capacity of ps nps was 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of pe mps velzeboer et al 2014 this study also suggested that the interaction of mps and nps with pollutants was influenced by nom ph value metal ions etc similarly wang et al suggested that the aggregation of nps would reduce the adsorption capacity wang et al 2019 aside from artificial organic contaminants the interaction of metal ions with mps and nps should also be investigated the oxygen containing functional groups on mps and nps lead to an affinity between metal ions and plastic debris for mps the metal ions will adsorb on the surface and settle or flow with the mps and mps porosity surface area and morphology are key factors affecting the sorption capacity ali et al 2021a differently the interaction of metal ions with nps results in the aggregation of nps by compressing the electric double layer on the particle surface xiong et al 2020 and high valence metal ions e g fe3 are more likely to induce nps aggregation than low valence counterparts e g na cai et al 2018 the interaction between metal ions and nps can be regulated by aging the ultraviolet irradiation aging process can inhibit the aggregation of ps nps in a nacl solution by increasing the negative charge on the surface of ps nps and the organic matter content in the solution while it can promote ps nps aggregation in cacl2 solutions due to the interactions between ca2 and carboxyl groups formed on the surface of ps nps liu et al 2019 nom which is ubiquitous in natural waters with different chemical groups e g oh cooh and phenolic groups is expected to adsorb onto the plastic surface and further regulate the surface properties of plastic particles chen et al 2018 wei et al 2022 current studies suggest that the adsorption of nom on mps and nps will form a protein layer ali et al 2022 several reports indicated that the adsorption of humic acid ha and sodium alginate could improve the aggregation of pe mps li et al 2019 and ps mps pradel et al 2021 respectively however li and co authors found that nom had a negligible effect on mps and coexisting clay at low ionic strength li et al 2021a for the study of nps nom e g ha showed an insignificant effect on the heteroaggregation of ps nps because of the steric hindrance according to the dlvo theory li et al 2019 however the addition of nacl could regulate the interaction among ha ps nps and suspended sediment thereby facilitating the heteroaggregation and co settling of nps suspended sediment and ha mixture fig 2 a by reducing the electrostatic repulsion between ps nps and large suspended sediment in general the interaction of nom with nps has little effect on dispersed nps by boosting particles steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion however nom could increase or decrease the aggregation of ps nps in fe3 solutions at different ion concentrations cai et al 2018 to this end the interaction of nps with nom is greatly affected by other coexisting substances in urban waters and it is necessary to include nps nom ions ionic strength and suspended matter when discussing the interaction between nps and abiotic pollutants song et al 2019 in 2018 oriekhova et al examined the interaction of nps with fe2o3 particles ions and alginate mixtures at different concentration ratios as depicted in fig 2b the electrostatic effect was found to play a critical role and the maximum heteroaggregation was observed at the isoelectric point of heteroaggregate furthermore the addition of alginate caused the shift of the maximum heteroaggregation to higher np concentrations because of the neutralization of excess negative charges oriekhova and stoll 2018 naturally the components and concentrations of nom mps nps suspended colloids and ions ionic strengths in urban water vary regionally and seasonally which would make it quite challenging to understand their interaction hence it is too early to conclude and differentiate the interaction of mps and nps with abiotic pollutants 4 2 biotic pollutants compared to most microbes nps have a smaller size indicating potential differences in microbial interaction with mps and nps mps are large enough to serve as a substrate for microbial colonization and the development of biofilms miri et al 2022 the involved microbes form a large part of the microbe mps heteroaggregates and would influence the distribution and fate of mps by changing the effective density but the whole heteroaggregate particle remains primarily mps he et al 2022 differently nps may be a minor portion of the large np microbe complex and represent a small proportion of the mass of the formed microbes nps heteroaggregates gigault et al 2021 in this case the properties of nps would have a relatively small effect on the fate of the microbes nps complex and some coexisting pollutants e g nom heavy metals may have a large effect apart from the composition of plastic microbe heteroaggregates another issue related to the plastic microbe interaction is the biodegradation of mps and nps the biodegradation process generally involves the attachment of microbes on mps and nps biofilm formation exoenzymes driven biodeterioration depolymerization fragmentation assimilation and final mineralization ali et al 2021b although the difference in the biodegradation between mps and nps remains unclear recent results have provided some interesting information wu et al found that ps mps with a smaller particle size 75 μm were more easily colonized by biofilms than the 4 mm counterparts on the 4 mm mps surface a thin layer of biofilm was noticed while the 75 μm mps formed heteroaggregates with biofilms wu et al 2022 accordingly when the size is further reduced to 100 nm the interaction between biofilms and nps would further intensify the colonization process and modify nps properties in another study ps nps 100 nm showed a more significant negative effect on the nitrogen and carbon cycling of freshwater biofilms than mps 0 5 μm 1 μm and 9 μm miao et al 2019 5 eco impacts of nps are higher than those of mps mps and nps together with their associated chemical additives heavy metals and organic pollutants form a complex pollutant system in urban waters these pollutants have shown ecotoxicological effects on aquatic organisms and even humans lehner et al 2019 compared to mps a remarkably higher proportion of the additives molecules adsorbed pollutants on nps surface leads to much higher surface reactivity and bioavailability more importantly the size of nps is closer to that of natural proteins making it easier for nps to cross biological membranes via passive diffusion and endocytosis pathways huang et al 2021b liu et al 2021 this section discusses the current understanding of the different eco impacts of mps and nps in urban water systems 5 1 biological wastewater treatment processes in biological wastewater treatment systems mps and nps can have an impact on microbes and regulate the associated water treatment processes generally nps play a more prominent role than mps zhou et al found that nitrogen removal by activated sludge was limited by ps nps 100 nm but not influenced by mps 100 μm this was because nps could cause acute toxicity to activated sludge via induced reactive oxygen species ros production and lactate dehydrogenase ldh release decrease nitrifiers and denitrifiers and suppress nitrification and denitrification genes fig 3 zhou et al 2022 the more significant inhibitory effect of ps nps 50 nm on nitrification was also reported by lee et al who found that the observed effects of ps nps on nitrification should be owing to the disruption of the membrane potential of the cells lee et al 2022 similar results also suggested the more significant effect of nps than mps on the production of fuels e g hydrogen methane in anaerobic digestion processes wang et al 2022 2023 zhang et al 2020 5 2 aquatic plants nps and mps have different effects on plants plankton macrophytes in urban water systems as reported nearly 90 of studies investigating the effects of nps on phytoplankton suggested nps had toxic effects while 90 of concerned studies indicated that mps 1 10 µm had no toxicity larue et al 2021 in general mps only influence plants by clogging the nutrient transport channel li et al 2021b differently nps which can be absorbed and migrated through plants show more complicated phytotoxicity furthermore nps can internalize into plant tissues and cause damage to plant tissues via the regulation of cell membranes endomolecules and ros induced genotoxicity and cytotoxicity maity and pramanick 2020 yin et al 2021b germination elongation growth biomass and photosynthesis are the most frequently studied parameters of plant stress responses to mps and nps mateos cárdenas et al 2021 compared to ps mps 100 μm ps nps 100 nm show more significant adverse effects on algal chlamydomonas reinhardtii growth and reproduction over a wide concentration range of 50 500 mg l yan et al 2021 weert and co authors studied the influence of ps mps and nps on the growth of two macrophytes myriophyllum spicatum and elodea sp the negative effect of nps on the two types of macrophytes was more prominent than that of mps in terms of the relative growth rate root and shoot dry weight shoot root ratio and shoot length interestingly a dose dependent negative effect was witnessed in all tests related to nps nevertheless for the mps this dose dependent phenomenon was only observed in the main shoot length of myriophyllum spicatum van weert et al 2019 notably although most studies suggest that nps are more toxic to plants than mps there are some exceptions jiang and co authors examined the effect of 5 μm ps mps and 100 nm ps nps on vicia faba the ps mps entered the root tissue of vicia faba and exhibited higher toxicity than the smaller nps on plant weight jiang et al 2019 in another study the vascular plant lepidium sativum exposed to 4 8 μm 500 nm and 50 nm plastics for 8 h showed germination rates of 21 46 and 56 respectively the reason for this was that larger mps led to a more severe blocking effect and thus a more significant delay in germination bosker et al 2019 in this context the effects of mps and mps on plants need to be studied in detail and the plastic dose exposure time and plant type should receive more attention agathokleous et al 2021 5 3 aquatic animals the size dependent effects of plastic debris on aquatic animals e g zooplankton fish are also significant nps enter body tissues and cells more easily and it is extremely challenging to remove these tiny particles from animal bodies therefore nps exhibit increased exposure period bioavailability and risks to aquatic animals compared to mps jeong et al 2016 shen et al 2019 shin and jeong 2022 when investigating the effect of ps on the brackish water flea diaphanosoma celebensis a size dependent oxidative stress response was found the smaller ps nps had a longer retention time and higher acute toxicity than micro sized ones yoo et al 2021 ma et al found that 50 nm nps caused physical damage and significant toxicity to d magna while 10 μm mps did not the presence of nps largely improved the bioaccumulation of phenanthrene derived residues in the daphnid body and hindered the dissipation transformation of phenanthrene while 10 μm mps showed insignificant effects on the bioaccumulation and dissipation transformation of phenanthrene ma et al 2016 in general exposure to mps and nps would lead to obvious size dependent effects on zooplankton with smaller nps being more hazardous than mps nps could cause reduced growth rate increased mortality longer reproduction time and reduced fecundity etc besseling et al 2014 apart from zooplankton fish are an important part of aquatic ecosystems and the food chain and some studies have examined the negative effects of mps and nps on fish in the study of plastics effect on zebrafish larvae locomotor activity mps 45 μm exhibited insignificant effects except for the upregulated zfrho visual gene expression however nps 50 nm showed more pronounced harmful effects including inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity 40 reduction of larvae body length 6 inhibition of larval locomotion 22 and significant upregulation of zfrho gfap zfblue and α1 tubulin gene expression chen et al 2017 in another study both ps mps 8 μm and nps 80 nm induced microbiota dysbiosis in the gut of zebrafish whereas only nps increased the mrna levels of tnfα il8 il10 and il1β in the gut xie et al 2021 hence nps had a more negative effect on the zebrafish gut than mps causing inflammation and microbiota dysbiosis interestingly kang et al uncovered distinct toxicity pathways of nps and mps on oryzias melastigma they found that nps induced oxidative stress mediated responses while mps regulated microbiota composition and resulted in dysbiosis fig 4 kang et al 2021 qin et al also found that ps nps could induce high oxidative stress in the cd treated zebrafish larvae which promoted taurine metabolism and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis qin et al 2021 these studies highlight the importance of separately examining the eco impact of mps and nps 5 4 human the omnipresent nps and mps in urban waters especially drinking water bottled water and aquatic fish render human exposure to tiny plastic particles inevitable and recent reports have indicated the accumulation of different mps and nps particles in human bodies amato lourenço et al 2021 jenner et al 2022 kannan and vimalkumar 2021 in vitro investigations have also revealed diverse toxicological effects of highly permeable mps and nps particles on human cells e g oxidative stress necrosis genotoxicity neurotoxicity cytotoxicity reproductive toxicity and inflammation huang et al 2021a rahman et al 2021 schwabl et al 2019 for instance exposure to ps nps 60 nm induced oxidative destruction of the epithelial cells inkielewicz stepniak et al 2018 recently grodzicki and coworkers summarized the effects of nps on the gut brain axis as shown in fig 5 grodzicki et al 2021 generally the persistence of mps and nps together with their chemical additives and adsorbed toxic pollutants would pose serious health risks to human bodies compared to mps nps can more easily cross the gastrointestinal barrier in human bodies and enter the capillary blood system and be further transported throughout the whole body lehner et al 2019 nps can also accumulate in tissues and cells leading to local inflammation and metabolic disorders as suggested by forte et al smaller ps nps 44 nm accumulated more efficiently in the cytoplasm of gastric adenocarcinoma cells compared to the larger counterpart 100 nm in addition the smaller nps strongly induced the upregulation of il 6 and il 8 genes two critical cytokines involved in gastric pathologies forte et al 2016 a previous study also suggested that the smaller 40 nm nps could penetrate cells through the follicular epithelium but the larger mps 750 and 1500 nm were blocked by the skin vogt et al 2006 current studies are mainly based on model mps and nps and real environmental samples are rarely investigated and the study of the size dependent toxicological effect of environmental mps and nps on human health is still in its infancy 6 conclusions and perspective due to their smaller size nps differ significantly from mps in terms of analytical challenges fate interactions with pollutants and eco impacts compared to mps the analysis of nps with sizes below the geometric optical resolution requires more complicated techniques and equipment in addition nps tend to remain homogeneously dispersed in urban waters whereas mps mainly undergo vertical transport driven by buoyancy and sedimentation the higher surface area and surface functional group content of nps makes them easier to aggregate and regulate their fate and also gives them high adsorption capacities towards surrounding pollutants such characteristics further provide nps with higher hazardous effects on microbes plants animals and even humans in the urban water systems than mps although some exceptions do not follow the size dependent effect further studies should focus on the following points 1 accurate analysis analytical challenges have substantially impeded the acquisition of accurate data on the fate interaction with surrounding pollutants and eco impacts of mps and nps since the size of nps is below the geometric optical resolution many existing analytical techniques for mps fail to detect nps accordingly the establishment of new analytical theories methods and facilities for the analysis of nps is an important research direction it should be noted that organic pollutants that are attached to the mps and nps would interfere with the identification of mps and nps in this context it is necessary to separate plastic particles from the associated organics during the sampling process in addition a standard procedure protocol for mps and nps analysis should be established to make results from different studies more reliable and comparable 2 real environmental samples in real urban waters mps and nps samples generally show high inhomogeneity in size shape and type and experience long term aging therefore it is necessary to perform the size dependent study with real environmental samples instead of the purchased plastic debris with similar size density and shape another issue of concern is the concentration of mps nps current studies generally use high concentrations of mps and nps to investigate their effect within a short exposure period which will not occur in the real urban water system further research is needed to explore the behavior long term effects of mps and nps at environmental doses 3 efficient removal strategies current strategies applied in wwtps can deal well with the problem of mps but the removal of nps is still in its infancy and membrane based techniques may hold the promise for efficient removal of nps in addition to the extraction of nps from water the development of efficient degradation methods is also highly recommended catalytic degradation photocatalysis electrocatalysis and biodegradation could mineralize these polymers in water or valorize plastics into value added chemicals and fuels 4 mps nps combined environmental contaminants in urban waters mps nps are associated with various pollutants such as heavy metal ions persistent organic pollutants pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes mps nps act as vectors for these contaminants and alter the overall toxicity to ecosystems current studies on the combined toxic effects of mps nps and other environmental contaminants remain mainly at the phenomenological level while the underlying molecular mechanisms causing the regulated toxicity remain unclear the transport of mps nps and combined pollutants in organisms the interaction between mps nps and the combined pollutants and the in depth analysis of the biological effects of mps nps and combined pollutants need to be further
