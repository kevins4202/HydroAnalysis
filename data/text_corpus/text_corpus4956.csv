24780,understanding the drivers of movement migration and distribution of individuals is important for insight into how species will respond to changing environmental conditions both abiotic and biotic factors are thought to influence migratory behavior but their relative roles are difficult to disentangle for migratory marine predators both temperature and prey availability have been shown to be significant predictors of space use though often researchers rely on physical proxies due to the lack of data on dynamic prey fields we generated spatially explicit individual based movement models to evaluate the relative roles of abiotic sea surface temperature sst and biotic prey availability factors in driving blue whale balaenoptera musculus movement decisions and migratory behavior in the eastern north pacific using output from a lower trophic ecosystem model coupled with a regional ocean circulation model we parameterized a blue whale movement model that explicitly incorporates prey fields in addition to physical proxies a model using both sst and prey data reproduced blue whale foraging behavior including realistic timing of latitudinal migrations sst and prey only population models demonstrated important independent effects of each variable in particular the sst only model revealed that warm temperatures limited krill foraging opportunities but failed to drive seasonal foraging patterns whereas the prey only model revealed more realistic seasonal and interannual differences in foraging behavior our individual based movement model helps elucidate the mechanisms underlying migration and demonstrates how fine scale individual decision making can lead to emergent migratory behavior at the population level moreover determining the relative effects of the physical environment and prey availability on the movement decisions of threatened species is critical to understand how they may respond to changing ocean conditions keywords animal migration behavioral mechanisms blue whale individual based model movement ecology 1 introduction animal migration is at once a critically important and a globally threatened ecological process bauer and hoye 2014 wilcove and wikelski 2008 migration increases survival by enabling animals to exploit seasonally available resources transports nutrients propagules and pathogens between ecosystems and facilitates trophic interactions by moving large numbers of predators or prey over wide ranges bauer and hoye 2014 migratory species are also among those most at risk from human induced rapid environmental change horns and şekercioğlu 2018 wilcove and wikelski 2008 necessitating an understanding of the ecological and environmental underpinnings of this behavioral phenomenon though migration for many species is often understood to be a means for reaching distinct breeding and foraging ranges to enhance survival and reproduction dingle and drake 2007 a range of drivers can influence finer scale foraging patterns within a larger scale seasonal migratory behavior on a daily scale migratory animals have to decide whether to remain in a foraging hotspot or move to a new foraging ground based on present and past conditions abrahms et al 2019a palacios et al 2019 mechanisms influencing migratory behavior and space use range from endogenous factors such as memory abrahms et al 2019a bracis and mueller 2017 scott et al 2014 and navigational capacity lohmann et al 2008 to exogenous factors such as social information guttal and couzin 2010 jesmer et al 2018 mueller et al 2013 or predation pressure fryxell and sinclair 1988 bottom up processes including responses to environmental cues and tracking of resource availability have also been shown to profoundly affect an animal s movement decisions during migration merkle et al 2016 thorup et al 2017 these environmental drivers can be either biotic such as forage availability or abiotic such as temperature snowfall or water availability and importantly can differ in their importance by the spatial scale of inquiry for instance forage quality biotic and water availability abiotic were shown to drive broad scale spatial distribution patterns in wildebeest migrations though biotic factors alone drove distributions at finer spatial scales holdo et al 2009 similarly primary production and water temperature have been shown to be significant predictors of broad scale distribution patterns for many migratory marine predators block et al 2011 hazen et al 2013 but prey availability is hypothesized to dominate space use over abiotic factors at local scales benoit bird et al 2013 hazen et al 2009 kenney et al 2001 given the challenges in monitoring migratory species and their environments over large spatial extents and timeframes the relative roles of biotic and abiotic factors in driving the fine scale movements and timing of migratory megafauna are difficult to disentangle in many systems this is especially true for marine migrants for which habitats can shift at daily to weekly timescales steele and henderson 1994 and physical proxies are often used in absence of dynamic prey fields abrahms et al 2018 croll et al 2005 owen et al 2018 scales et al 2014 nevertheless identifying the dominant bottom up processes and thresholds for decisions driving foraging migration is key to adequately capture seasonal movement patterns interannual variability in migration timing interaction with anthropogenic threats and anticipating the responses of migratory species to environmental change we developed a spatially explicit individual based model ibm to tease apart the biotic and abiotic drivers of fine scale movements leading to emergent migratory behavior for a marine predator the blue whale balaenoptera musculus blue whales are the largest animal to have lived on the planet and their large energetic demands and requirement for dense patches of krill have spurred the evolution of their physiology and foraging behavior goldbogen et al 2011 goldbogen et al 2015 slater et al 2017 in order to maximize their energetic gain and reproductive success blue whales like many baleen whales migrate from tropical breeding grounds to temperate or arctic feeding grounds annually timing their migration to reliable peaks in their prey krill abrahms et al 2019a fossette et al 2017 in the eastern north pacific blue whales perform latitudinal migrations between winter breeding grounds off the coast of central america and in the gulf of california and summer feeding grounds that extend from baja california to washington state in the california current system bailey et al 2009 irvine et al 2014 previous models aimed at understanding blue whale movements have focused on species habitat relationships using environmental proxies for prey to explore where and when the whales occupy the california current these have included static models based on shipboard sightings becker et al 2016 redfern et al 2019 photo id work calambokidis et al 2015 global models based on sea surface height alone pardo et al 2015 foraging models palacios et al 2019 and dynamic models based on changing oceanography abrahms et al 2019b hazen et al 2017 many of these models have found that sea surface temperature mixed layer depth and chlorophyll a were most correlated with blue whale habitat often tracking the seasonality of upwelling dynamics chlorophyll a represents a direct proxy for productivity and krill aggregations abrahms et al 2019a bailey et al 2012 suryan et al 2012 whereas temperature may indicate aggregative features that can concentrate prey palacios et al 2019 scales et al 2014 mixed layer depth is often an ocean model derived variable that is used instead of chlorophyll a with similar predictive capacity becker et al 2016 in addition stochastic dynamic programming techniques have been used to develop models that integrate habitat patch quality and energy demands of lactating females to identify optimal movement decisions pirotta et al 2019 pirotta et al 2018 however these studies lack explicit information on the distribution of prey aggregations which are known to significantly shape blue whale space use and foraging decisions hazen et al 2015 individual based models ibms provide an alternative framework that treat individuals as autonomous agents each individual is prescribed a set of deterministic or stochastic rules that inform and update the behavior movement or interaction of agents ensembles are created by the simulation of many agents allowing for inference of population statistics geographic locations and emergent behaviors while still retaining the discreteness and variability of individuals and small populations a strength of ibms is the ability to test individual decision processes and mechanisms underlying emergent behaviors and self organization examples include flocking of starlings hildenbrandt et al 2010 stripe formation in zebra fish volkening and sandstede 2015 and aggregation of locusts into destructive hopper bands bernoff et al 2020 from a population modeling standpoint ibms have successfully been used to explore the distributions and behaviors of marine and terrestrial animals including sea lions fiechter et al 2016 juvenile chinook salmon fiechter et al 2015 sardine and anchovy fiechter et al 2015 rose et al 2015 icelandic capelin barbaro et al 2009 and caribou latombe et al 2014 in the context of blue whale populations emergent processes are a result of individual decisions and include both behavioral and spatiotemporal aspects such foraging rates and the timing of migrations the objective of this paper is two fold first we introduce an ibm framework that reproduces observed behaviors of blue whales in the california current system and then explore model ensembles to examine contributions from abiotic temperature and biotic krill availability factors on migratory behavior including explicit realistic movement of individuals adds information about the temporal accessibility of habitats by considering transit speeds and foraging opportunities details ignored by species distribution models other correlative techniques and the stochastic dynamic programming models specifically we compare the independent and combined effects of sea surface temperature and krill availability on 1 foraging behaviors and latitudinal distributions of the blue whales during their northward migration and 2 transition to southward migrations this comparative approach allows us to evaluate the relative importance of biotic and abiotic fields on population level behaviors moreover this is one of the first studies to use direct prey fields in place of environmental proxies on a broad scale to examine the drivers of blue whale migration 2 methods 2 1 environmental and prey data environmental and prey data are simulated using an implementation of the regional ocean modeling system roms coupled with the biogeochemical nemuro model fiechter et al 2016 fiechter et al 2015 kishi et al 2007 rose et al 2015 for years 2000 2010 nemuro describes nutrient phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics in each grid cell which are advected and diffused in space with roms the roms nemuro output is generated prior to the ibm calculations and provides environmental conditions including daily sea surface temperature sst and relative krill density ρ at 3 km horizontal resolution over a domain ranging from 116 to 128 w and 32 44 n fiechter et al 2018 krill relative density is a near surface unitless quantity and is a real number between 0 low and 1 high the roms nemuro domain serves our primary focus and study area as blue whales are known to exhibit extensive foraging in this region from may october and the model provides physical and prey fields at sufficiently fine spatial and temporal resolution to inform behavior in the ibm fig 1 shows quarterly averages for sst and krill density over the full computational domain for the year 2008 a year with enso neutral conditions in the california current region and relatively high krill abundance in the coastal upwelling zone in april september the upwelling along the coast is evidenced by cooler nearshore waters and locally enhanced krill concentrations 2 2 model description spatially explicit individual based models ibms used in population dynamics seek to capture the motion of individuals in a heterogeneous landscape through a series of discrete updates here the ibm is formulated as a semi markov state switching model with n states each state s n is correlated with a behavior and characteristic state movements are described by step length and turning angle distributions locations and states for all individuals are updated at each time step states are selected probabilistically with elements p j k of an n n state transition matrix τ define the probability of transitioning from state j to k ensembles are created by the simulation of many agents allowing for inference of population statistics and behaviors while still retaining the discreteness of individuals ibms allow us to program behavior and see which aspects most closely reproduce observed migration patterns and the probabilistic updates naturally incorporate variations in each decision to explore how environmental and prey influences impact whale movements throughout one seasonal migration period may december we define and analyze ensembles from the two ibms described below 2 2 1 transit forage model we used published movement parameters in our model to test the hypotheses of what drives blue whale foraging migrations previous studies of blue whale tagging data bailey et al 2009 have identified two distinct behavioral states corresponding to transit and foraging in transit whales tend to move in a straight line whereas slower speeds and higher turning angles are observed in foraging as such we employed a two state model with states s 1 transit and s 2 forage used to evaluate how sst and prey availability drive whale movements behaviors and distributions 2 2 2 north south model previous correlative models have shown higher success rates of seasonal versus annual models when predicting blue whale migration patterns abrahms et al 2019b hazen et al 2017 blue whales likely rely on different biological and physical processes during their northward migration to feeding grounds versus southward migrations to breeding grounds with the transition likely triggered by bioenergetic or breeding demands additionally a higher percentage of transit is reported during the southward migration with individuals only stopping to forage if the prey conditions are sufficiently dense bailey et al 2009 northward and southward states are therefore split for the migration study to account for the stricter foraging requirements while returning to southern breeding grounds mechanisms for transition to southward migrations are therefore studied with a four state model states s 1 and s 2 describing transit and forage during northward migration and states s 3 and s 4 for southward migration we use a migration strategy based on the individual foraging rate averaged over the previous 10 days which is implemented in the transition probabilities from s 1 and s 2 north to s 3 south low foraging rates increase the probability of transitioning to southward migration and the time average provided sufficient opportunity for agents to travel between and seek out new krill patches again we test the effect of sst and prey density on this transition additional migration strategies including a krill satiation threshold in which southward transitions are initiated when whales consume sufficient levels of krill and natal breeding homing were tested for transitioning to southward migration and are described in the supplement 2 2 3 state transition functions and movement distributions behavioral states are selected probabilistically and are a function of current environmental covariates x sst krill density ρ and model parameters θ the probabilities encode how environmental and prey conditions influence the state transitions the 2 2 state transition matrix for the transit forage model is shown in eq 1 as an example with the 4 4 matrix for the north south model given in the supplement 1 τ x ρ θ s 1 s 1 s 1 s 2 s 2 s 1 s 2 s 2 p s t 1 s t 1 1 x θ ρ p s t 2 s t 1 1 x θ ρ p s t 1 s t 1 2 x θ ρ p s t 2 s t 1 2 x θ ρ 1 p t p t 1 p t p t here p t p s t 2 s t 1 1 2 x θ ρ is defined as the probability of foraging and st is the behavioral state at time t the probability of foraging is a weighted sum of environmental and krill transition functions and is given by p t 1 z w 1 p e s t 2 s t 1 1 2 x θ w 2 p k s t 2 s t 1 1 2 θ ρ with the weights w 1 and w 2 controlling the relative importance of sst and krill and z w 1 w 2 to normalize probabilities to 1 the environmental transition probability is the simple linear response function p e s t 2 s t 1 1 2 x θ logit 1 α 1 α 2 x x that selects for colder temperatures krill transition probabilities are set by the logistic selection function p k s t 2 s t 1 1 2 θ ρ logit 1 β ρ ρ where probability of foraging increases with krill density model parameters are provided in table 1 we assume future states depend only on current conditions and are independent of the past and current state so that τ is constant on the columns and rows sum to 1 in the model behavioral states are updated every 6 h fig 3 shows the probability of foraging computed for the full domain using monthly sst and krill inputs figures of daily probabilities are provided in the supplement across both the transit forage and north south models the forage and transit states have the same movement distributions regardless of north or southward migration step lengths are positive real numbers in units of meters and follow gamma distributions with probability density function bailey et al 2009 scales et al 2016 f s l x x a 1 s a γ a exp x s x 0 where γ a is the gamma function turning angles are sampled from a von mises distribution with probability density function given by f t a x 1 2 π i 0 κ exp κ cos x μ 0 x 2 π where i 0 κ is the bessel function of order 0 a 0 turning angle corresponds to straight movement in all states except southward transit s 3 where 0 is set to south parameters used in step length and turning angle distributions for transit and forage states are given in table 1 and movement distributions are shown in fig 2 the gamma distribution shape and scale parameters yield average step lengths of 22 2 12 9 km transit and 6 3 5 8 km forage for a 6 h time period consistent with bailey et al 2009 scales et al 2016 2 3 model implementation for its implementation in the ibm the semi markov model formalism is combined with an area restricted search ars the ars adds intelligence by allowing individuals to locally sense areas of high foraging potential the algorithm is as follows and is further outlined in fig 2 let y w t be the geographic location of whale w on time step t individual locations are initialized on a given day uniformly at random within a pre defined region of the domain the probability of foraging p w t is calculated for each location y w t and used to select the next behavioral state s w t 1 an area restricted search is conducted on the perimeter of a box of radius r to find the location yw with highest probability of foraging if such a location exists the turning angle is centered around the direction from y w t to yw step lengths and turning angles are sampled from the state distributions and used to update the locations to y w t 1 positions and states are updated at 6 h intervals using daily roms output ensembles of 2000 whales for years 2000 2010 were generated using the transit forage and north south models to understand the independent roles of sst and krill in driving the observed movement patterns of the northward migration in the transit forage model we additionally generated model ensembles using only sst or krill as inputs these one input ensembles can be thought of from a modeling perspective as probing the independent effects of each variable or from a biological perspective as populations with distinct strategies that base their fine scale decisions on only one of the two variables we analyzed the effects of these strategies on broad scale migration patterns seasonal and interannual differences in prey consumption and transitions to southward migration the same environmental and krill transition functions were used in all cases and turning a driver off or on is equivalent to adjusting the weights in the state transition matrix results are additionally measured against a correlated random walk crw with no environmental or prey preferences the crw has the same behavioral states and movement distributions with the probability of foraging fixed at 0 4 in alignment with published foraging rates for may november bailey et al 2009 krill densities and sst are recorded in the crw model at whale locations for comparison purposes to measure and compare the foraging success between population ensembles we introduce a foraging potential metric ω the value of ω for each individual w provides a sum of the krill density encountered while in a foraging state and is given by ω w t 1 n ρ y w t 1 s w t 2 s w t here ρ y w t is the krill density at the location of whale w 1 s w t 2 s w t is an indicator function that takes the value one if whale w is foraging in state 2 and zero otherwise and the summation is over all time steps t 2 4 modeling assumptions we summarize the model assumptions that were made in the development of these individual based models to study how daily to monthly sst and prey variability contribute to seasonal whale movements and foraging migrations model whales based their fine scale decision only on sst and or krill availability while other environmental factors may contribute to the process sst is often highly correlated with whale presence gill et al 2011 hazen et al 2017 palacios et al 2019 and is one of the most accessible variables for use in models the direct importance of prey in constraining distributions and migrations of marine megafauna has not yet been evaluated future behavioral states only depend on current prey and environmental conditions and are independent of current and past states model runs are initiated at the start of the migration season and whales are not allowed to learn from prior migrations our model represents the average whale the age sex and life history of individuals are not factored in the model since these variables are unknown in the available tagging data and movement parameters bailey et al 2009 individuals are not tracked upon leaving the roms domain and are not permitted to re enter the domain position updates that end on land are resampled to obtain a location in the ocean individuals enter the southern border of the domain uniformly at random between may 1 and june 1 start locations are drawn uniformly at random from the box bounded by latitudes 32 45 33 35 n and longitudes 118 5 124 2 w off the coast of southern california upon entering the domain all agents are in transit state s 1 with the turning angle 0 aligned with due north in the north south model the transition probability from s 1 and s 2 to s 4 is 0 that is whales only transition from north transit forage states to the south transit state s 3 transition to state s 3 was restricted until day of year 150 to allow the agents to explore the domain and find foraging grounds 2 5 parameter selection and sensitivity analysis when possible model parameters were determined from previously published resources to reduce the number of free variables the environmental transition probability function is parameterized to select for colder temperatures associated with upwelling the step length and turning angle distributions for the transit and forage states are derived from the speeds and turning angles of the transit and area restricted search behavioral states in bailey et al 2009 and scaled to a 6 h time step the 6 hour time steps were selected to best correspond with the 3 km spatial resolution of the roms data the average step lengths associated with a 6 hour interval allow the whales to transit and forage within the local domain without stepping over and missing potential foraging opportunities area restricted search is designed as a local search algorithm thus the search radius was set to match this average step length thus the free parameters and model variables are reduced to β and ρ used in the krill transition probability the day of year individuals enter the domain start date and starting location a sensitivity analysis indicates that ensemble spatiotemporal distributions and population level transit forage behaviors are robust to reasonable changes in the free parameters results of the sensitivity analysis and additional justification for parameter selection are provided in the supplement the start date and starting locations of individuals were identified as the most influential parameters on the population s northward migration and foraging success whereas changes to the parameters β and ρ have minimal impact the model sensitivity to start date aligns with recent studies of blue whale call patterns which reveal variability in the timing and success of the northward migration szesciorka et al 2020 to account for the increased sensitivity these variables add the start date is uniformly distributed from may 1 june 1 and the starting location is selected uniformly at random from a wide box in the southern part of the domain 3 results we aggregated population ensembles for all years to analyze broadscale patterns further we considered specific years to highlight transient and interannual trends 3 1 northward migration using only fine scale decisions the transit forage model produced realistic broad scale northward migration patterns timings and distributions fig 4 shows the aggregated results for all years 2000 2010 specifically the ensembles reach a northernmost mean latitude by early october fig 4a and peak abundance of blue whales in the monterey bay region defined by latitudes 36 6 370n between july and october fig 4b these distributions align with previous reports on migration characteristics estimates based on satellite tagging data fig 4a abrahms et al 2019a irvine et al 2014 and surveys of shipboard sightings croll et al 2005 fossette et al 2017 in addition the ensembles show a higher level of foraging during may october consistent with empirical observations bailey et al 2009 irvine et al 2014 with a sharp decrease in foraging rates fig 4c as krill abundance begins to decrease october in the domain in concordance with the end of upwelling the first panel in fig 3 displays july 2008 aggregates for the probability of foraging and foraging locations from the transit forage model and emphasizes that these two variables are not directly correlated in the ibm foraging locations depend on the probabilities but also explicitly on the current location of each agent and the travel times to productive habitats in july the majority of the population remains in southern regions of high foraging potential and has yet to reach the rich northern foraging grounds despite the high probability of foraging above latitude 40 n 3 2 contributions of environment and prey on the northward migration to understand the independent contributions of sst and krill to the observed northward migrations we generate and analyze model ensembles that use only sst or krill as inputs strategies based only on krill or sst lead to populations with distinct domain use patterns figs 3 5 first the july 2008 foraging location aggregates fig 3 demonstrate that the influences of sst or krill drive the populations to feed in spatially distinct regions in our model the temperature cues lead to dispersed habitats with small foraging hotspots only localized at the coast the influence of krill promoted increased offshore habitats and foraging hotspots furthermore when only sst is used as a driver the proportion of the whale population in the foraging state remains relatively constant between 30 40 throughout the year with the remaining individuals in the transiting state fig 4c longer step lengths from the transit distribution allow the sst only population to explore the domain quickly resulting in a fast migration reaching the northernmost mean latitudes earlier in the summer and overall a higher northernmost mean latitude in contrast the krill only strategy mimicked the full model in the latitudinal distributions fig 4a and arrival of whales in monterey bay fig 4d suggesting that the influence of krill is responsible for the timing of the northward migration in the combined model daily and seasonal foraging patterns are also remarkably more distinct in prey driven populations both models with krill have at least a 3 times higher variance in daily foraging rates when compared to the sst model the full and krill only models additionally show a transition to lower foraging rates between day of year 275 300 beginning late october in concordance with the end of the upwelling season bograd et al 2009 higher foraging rates from krill inputs naturally correspond to a higher foraging potential normalized distributions of ω for each of the three strategies are shown in fig 4d the krill only ensemble shows higher average foraging potential than the sst only and combined populations thus the influence of krill drives the foraging success of the combined population however the sst only model still had a higher mean foraging than the crw model indicating that the influence of favorable sst drives individuals to forage in locations with higher krill densities than they would find by random chance 3 3 interannual differences in prey consumption and foraging the years 2003 and 2008 have lower and higher than average modeled krill densities respectively and higher 2003 and lower 2008 than average sst fig 5a supplementary table 2 results from the full model show significant interannual differences in agreement with the increased levels of krill from the roms data 2008 has a 4 average higher foraging rate averaged over all simulation days than 2003 fig 5c with up to 20 differences depending on the time of year prior to day of year 260 the 2008 population shows an 8 8 higher average foraging than 2003 with daily differences reaching as high as 20 after this date 2003 temporarily has a higher foraging rate before both populations reach equal foraging a comparison of the population ensembles for 2003 and 2008 provided understanding of how sst and prey factors contributed to the observed interannual differences both sst and krill populations have a 3 4 higher average foraging rate for 2008 than in 2003 thus the lower average sst in 2008 alters the population behavior and increases the overall foraging but the addition of krill again provides more detailed temporal information the sst population shows no significant differences in the foraging rates before and after day of year 260 whereas in the spring and summer months the 2008 krill population has a 10 7 higher rate than 2003 furthermore the foraging rates for 2008 are lower than 2003 just after day of year 260 despite the higher krill density in 2008 average foraging potential ω is higher in 2008 across all strategies with krill driven populations showing a secondary peak at higher levels independent of the yearly variances in prey density the krill driven populations exhibited the sharp transition to lower foraging rates in october thus our results suggest the influence of prey provides the fine scale daily seasonal and interannual details observed in the full model 3 4 implications on southward migration the addition of the southward migration states results in a southward shift in the latitudinal distributions for all strategies fig 6 a all cases show similar timing with the latitudes peaking around day 300 however the addition of krill influences transitions to southward migrations in realistic ways specifically all models show a large early migration at days 150 200 as whales unsuccessful at finding and remaining within rich foraging grounds migrate south however models that include krill continue to transition throughout october and november with a secondary peak around day 300 corresponding to the seasonal reductions in population foraging rates that are observed in the transit forage model fig 6b using only sst the proportion of whales foraging remains relatively constant and low through the spring and fall figs 4b 5 c which leads to time independent and early transitions furthermore the cumulative percentage of whales transitioning into a southward migration plateaus around day 300 in the sst only model figure 6 c whereas the krill and sst krill models display continuing transitions to southward migration later in the season with all strategies not all whales transition to southward migrating states as individuals may leave the study area prior to the start of migration or remain in areas with high foraging potential 4 discussion understanding the bottom up drivers of spatiotemporal distributions of highly migratory species is important for predicting changes in future habitat use and for implementing effective dynamic conservation policies here we introduced an ibm which reproduced realistic foraging and migratory behaviors at both individual and population levels suggesting that fine scale individual decisions lead to emergent properties of the population mueller and fagan 2008 furthermore we used model populations driven by only sst or krill to help uncover the direct impact of each variable on whale behavior and migrations our findings indicate that abiotic sst and biotic krill abundance factors both play key roles in individual movement decisions during round trip blue whale migrations abiotic factors such as sst are commonly used as proxies for prey in blue whale models abrahms et al 2019a becker et al 2019 pirotta et al 2019 pirotta et al 2018 while we found that sst indeed leads whales to forage in areas with higher prey availability at broad spatial scales compared to a simple crw important spatial and temporal patterns are missed by using sst without including krill contributions explicitly figs 4 6 notably the proportion of whales foraging remained nearly constant throughout may december thus missing important seasonal fluctuations in foraging behavior bailey et al 2009 additionally driving populations only with sst led to more northerly average latitudes fig 4a inaccurate arrival times to monterey bay fig 4d and could not realistically reproduce the seasonal southward return migration fig 6 in contrast populations influenced only by krill retained realistic seasonal behaviors such as increased foraging during the upwelling season and denser krill years as well as an appropriate timing of southward migrations abrahms et al 2019a bailey et al 2009 furthermore the influence of krill resulted in increased offshore habitats and foraging hotspots however these ensembles expressed unrealistically high levels of seasonal foraging figs 4 5 when compared to published estimates of monthly foraging behavior bailey et al 2009 when combined krill acted to inform biologically feasible seasonal and yearly variations in foraging behavior and sst reduced excessively high foraging rates plausibly by accounting for the impact of unfavorable environmental conditions on movement and foraging decisions while the results presented here represent statistics from large population ensembles run with a fixed set of parameters and using simulated sst and prey fields we found general population distributions and migratory behaviors were robust to reasonable changes in model parameters supplement the growing use of ibms has opened new avenues to test mechanistic questions of animal movement and make predictions for future scenarios bauer and klaassen 2013 deangelis and mooij 2005 stillman et al 2014 tang and bennett 2010 examples range from terrestrial to marine communities and include the role of memory in zebra bracis and mueller 2017 and elk bennett and tang 2006 migrations environmental and bioenergetics factors influencing decision processes during bird migrations duriez et al 2009 consequences of conservation and harvesting practices on fisheries ayllón et al 2018 jørgensen et al 2008 o callaghan and gordon 2008 and how generic habitat characteristics can lead to migratory behavior shaw and couzin 2013 our results here contribute to the wealth of spatiotemporal and mechanisitic information that can be learned from ibm ensembles as fig 3 shows a high probability of foraging does not directly correspond to foraging whales correlative species distribution models provide information on available habitat yet have little consideration of behavioral factors that could limit use in other words a species realized niche is not necessarily its fundamental niche these models can result in high predictions in areas that are unavailable to migratory predators and falsely link animal presence with preferred habitats fig 3 garshelis 2000 railsback et al 2003 for example hazen et al 2017 abrahms et al 2019b predict high habitat likelihood in the northern part of the domain but these ranges are less likely to be accessed by migrating whales due to movement limitations the dynamic state model approaches in pirotta et al 2019 pirotta et al 2018 seek to answer mechanistic factors driving the migration strategies for lactating female blue whales locations and energetic needs of the individuals are included but movement is limited to stepping along a one dimensional line of 100km boxes adjacent to the coast the presented ibm overcomes these limitations by explicitly linking fully two dimensional discrete movement processes and behavioral states to the available environmental and prey conditions which revealed broad scale migration patterns and mechanistic information about habitat use and foraging behaviors our results reveal the relative roles of the physical environment and prey availability in the movement decisions of a migratory marine predator and shed light on environmental processes influencing foraging and migratory behavior on daily to seasonal scales such information can help relate future changes in biotic and abiotic environmental conditions to a species anticipated behavioral responses migratory species continue to face an expanding number of threats from changing environmental conditions and interactions with humans horns and şekercioğlu 2018 maxwell et al 2013 wilcove and wikelski 2008 our findings also have important ecological and conservation implications as ocean temperatures are warming globally and climate change is expected to redistribute species richness in lower trophic levels woodworth jefcoats et al 2016 previous work has predicted how ocean conditions may influence the distributions of top predators over the next century hazen et al 2013 however changes in habitat quality may have disproportionate effects depending on the distance from normal migration routes for example increased habitat quality far from shore may not be discovered or may not be energetically feasible to exploit here we show how year to year differences in conditions are clearly captured in the model ensembles fig 5 by using climate change projections as input the model could generate more realistic predictions for the responses of blue whales to future scenarios increased water stratification from ocean warming is likely to affect the vertical distribution of krill and krill populations may shift poleward or decline in response to predicted changes in coastal upwelling systems di lorenzo et al 2005 palacios et al 2004 roemmich and mcgowan 1995 rykaczewski et al 2015 sydeman et al 2014 given we found sst and krill were both important in determining multiple aspects of blue whale space use and foraging behavior concurrent climate change impacts to both water temperatures and krill may influence blue whale distributions and prey consumption in synergistic ways our work highlights the value of including multiple forage based drivers of animal movements and distributions to not only elucidate the mechanisms underlying migratory behavior but also to help quantify the effects of anthropogenic risks on a threatened and highly migratory species finally the models presented here provide insight into the dynamic behavior of a highly migratory marine species thereby laying the foundation to explore other aspects of the ecology and distributions of marine megafauna additionally an individual based model framework allows for testing the roles of other variables or processes on emergent migratory behavior for example animal culture and social interactions have been shown to influence the migratory capacity of other species including ungulates jesmer et al 2018 and birds mueller et al 2013 blue whales have been shown to communicate over large distances roughly 500 1 000 km watkins et al 2000 but the impacts of such communication on migrations have not been explored the role of sociality in whale migrations could readily be tested in our modeling framework by allowing agents in sufficiently dense krill patches to signal their location and attract others optimal group sizes could also be evaluated by modeling trade offs associated with density dependent foraging opportunities markham et al 2015 finally memory effects are believed to play a role in migratory behaviors abrahms et al 2019a and their role could be tested through the use of climatological inputs thus the flexibility of a spatially explicit individual based movement model such as that presented here provides the opportunity to test a wide range of hypotheses in animal behavioral ecology

24780,understanding the drivers of movement migration and distribution of individuals is important for insight into how species will respond to changing environmental conditions both abiotic and biotic factors are thought to influence migratory behavior but their relative roles are difficult to disentangle for migratory marine predators both temperature and prey availability have been shown to be significant predictors of space use though often researchers rely on physical proxies due to the lack of data on dynamic prey fields we generated spatially explicit individual based movement models to evaluate the relative roles of abiotic sea surface temperature sst and biotic prey availability factors in driving blue whale balaenoptera musculus movement decisions and migratory behavior in the eastern north pacific using output from a lower trophic ecosystem model coupled with a regional ocean circulation model we parameterized a blue whale movement model that explicitly incorporates prey fields in addition to physical proxies a model using both sst and prey data reproduced blue whale foraging behavior including realistic timing of latitudinal migrations sst and prey only population models demonstrated important independent effects of each variable in particular the sst only model revealed that warm temperatures limited krill foraging opportunities but failed to drive seasonal foraging patterns whereas the prey only model revealed more realistic seasonal and interannual differences in foraging behavior our individual based movement model helps elucidate the mechanisms underlying migration and demonstrates how fine scale individual decision making can lead to emergent migratory behavior at the population level moreover determining the relative effects of the physical environment and prey availability on the movement decisions of threatened species is critical to understand how they may respond to changing ocean conditions keywords animal migration behavioral mechanisms blue whale individual based model movement ecology 1 introduction animal migration is at once a critically important and a globally threatened ecological process bauer and hoye 2014 wilcove and wikelski 2008 migration increases survival by enabling animals to exploit seasonally available resources transports nutrients propagules and pathogens between ecosystems and facilitates trophic interactions by moving large numbers of predators or prey over wide ranges bauer and hoye 2014 migratory species are also among those most at risk from human induced rapid environmental change horns and şekercioğlu 2018 wilcove and wikelski 2008 necessitating an understanding of the ecological and environmental underpinnings of this behavioral phenomenon though migration for many species is often understood to be a means for reaching distinct breeding and foraging ranges to enhance survival and reproduction dingle and drake 2007 a range of drivers can influence finer scale foraging patterns within a larger scale seasonal migratory behavior on a daily scale migratory animals have to decide whether to remain in a foraging hotspot or move to a new foraging ground based on present and past conditions abrahms et al 2019a palacios et al 2019 mechanisms influencing migratory behavior and space use range from endogenous factors such as memory abrahms et al 2019a bracis and mueller 2017 scott et al 2014 and navigational capacity lohmann et al 2008 to exogenous factors such as social information guttal and couzin 2010 jesmer et al 2018 mueller et al 2013 or predation pressure fryxell and sinclair 1988 bottom up processes including responses to environmental cues and tracking of resource availability have also been shown to profoundly affect an animal s movement decisions during migration merkle et al 2016 thorup et al 2017 these environmental drivers can be either biotic such as forage availability or abiotic such as temperature snowfall or water availability and importantly can differ in their importance by the spatial scale of inquiry for instance forage quality biotic and water availability abiotic were shown to drive broad scale spatial distribution patterns in wildebeest migrations though biotic factors alone drove distributions at finer spatial scales holdo et al 2009 similarly primary production and water temperature have been shown to be significant predictors of broad scale distribution patterns for many migratory marine predators block et al 2011 hazen et al 2013 but prey availability is hypothesized to dominate space use over abiotic factors at local scales benoit bird et al 2013 hazen et al 2009 kenney et al 2001 given the challenges in monitoring migratory species and their environments over large spatial extents and timeframes the relative roles of biotic and abiotic factors in driving the fine scale movements and timing of migratory megafauna are difficult to disentangle in many systems this is especially true for marine migrants for which habitats can shift at daily to weekly timescales steele and henderson 1994 and physical proxies are often used in absence of dynamic prey fields abrahms et al 2018 croll et al 2005 owen et al 2018 scales et al 2014 nevertheless identifying the dominant bottom up processes and thresholds for decisions driving foraging migration is key to adequately capture seasonal movement patterns interannual variability in migration timing interaction with anthropogenic threats and anticipating the responses of migratory species to environmental change we developed a spatially explicit individual based model ibm to tease apart the biotic and abiotic drivers of fine scale movements leading to emergent migratory behavior for a marine predator the blue whale balaenoptera musculus blue whales are the largest animal to have lived on the planet and their large energetic demands and requirement for dense patches of krill have spurred the evolution of their physiology and foraging behavior goldbogen et al 2011 goldbogen et al 2015 slater et al 2017 in order to maximize their energetic gain and reproductive success blue whales like many baleen whales migrate from tropical breeding grounds to temperate or arctic feeding grounds annually timing their migration to reliable peaks in their prey krill abrahms et al 2019a fossette et al 2017 in the eastern north pacific blue whales perform latitudinal migrations between winter breeding grounds off the coast of central america and in the gulf of california and summer feeding grounds that extend from baja california to washington state in the california current system bailey et al 2009 irvine et al 2014 previous models aimed at understanding blue whale movements have focused on species habitat relationships using environmental proxies for prey to explore where and when the whales occupy the california current these have included static models based on shipboard sightings becker et al 2016 redfern et al 2019 photo id work calambokidis et al 2015 global models based on sea surface height alone pardo et al 2015 foraging models palacios et al 2019 and dynamic models based on changing oceanography abrahms et al 2019b hazen et al 2017 many of these models have found that sea surface temperature mixed layer depth and chlorophyll a were most correlated with blue whale habitat often tracking the seasonality of upwelling dynamics chlorophyll a represents a direct proxy for productivity and krill aggregations abrahms et al 2019a bailey et al 2012 suryan et al 2012 whereas temperature may indicate aggregative features that can concentrate prey palacios et al 2019 scales et al 2014 mixed layer depth is often an ocean model derived variable that is used instead of chlorophyll a with similar predictive capacity becker et al 2016 in addition stochastic dynamic programming techniques have been used to develop models that integrate habitat patch quality and energy demands of lactating females to identify optimal movement decisions pirotta et al 2019 pirotta et al 2018 however these studies lack explicit information on the distribution of prey aggregations which are known to significantly shape blue whale space use and foraging decisions hazen et al 2015 individual based models ibms provide an alternative framework that treat individuals as autonomous agents each individual is prescribed a set of deterministic or stochastic rules that inform and update the behavior movement or interaction of agents ensembles are created by the simulation of many agents allowing for inference of population statistics geographic locations and emergent behaviors while still retaining the discreteness and variability of individuals and small populations a strength of ibms is the ability to test individual decision processes and mechanisms underlying emergent behaviors and self organization examples include flocking of starlings hildenbrandt et al 2010 stripe formation in zebra fish volkening and sandstede 2015 and aggregation of locusts into destructive hopper bands bernoff et al 2020 from a population modeling standpoint ibms have successfully been used to explore the distributions and behaviors of marine and terrestrial animals including sea lions fiechter et al 2016 juvenile chinook salmon fiechter et al 2015 sardine and anchovy fiechter et al 2015 rose et al 2015 icelandic capelin barbaro et al 2009 and caribou latombe et al 2014 in the context of blue whale populations emergent processes are a result of individual decisions and include both behavioral and spatiotemporal aspects such foraging rates and the timing of migrations the objective of this paper is two fold first we introduce an ibm framework that reproduces observed behaviors of blue whales in the california current system and then explore model ensembles to examine contributions from abiotic temperature and biotic krill availability factors on migratory behavior including explicit realistic movement of individuals adds information about the temporal accessibility of habitats by considering transit speeds and foraging opportunities details ignored by species distribution models other correlative techniques and the stochastic dynamic programming models specifically we compare the independent and combined effects of sea surface temperature and krill availability on 1 foraging behaviors and latitudinal distributions of the blue whales during their northward migration and 2 transition to southward migrations this comparative approach allows us to evaluate the relative importance of biotic and abiotic fields on population level behaviors moreover this is one of the first studies to use direct prey fields in place of environmental proxies on a broad scale to examine the drivers of blue whale migration 2 methods 2 1 environmental and prey data environmental and prey data are simulated using an implementation of the regional ocean modeling system roms coupled with the biogeochemical nemuro model fiechter et al 2016 fiechter et al 2015 kishi et al 2007 rose et al 2015 for years 2000 2010 nemuro describes nutrient phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics in each grid cell which are advected and diffused in space with roms the roms nemuro output is generated prior to the ibm calculations and provides environmental conditions including daily sea surface temperature sst and relative krill density ρ at 3 km horizontal resolution over a domain ranging from 116 to 128 w and 32 44 n fiechter et al 2018 krill relative density is a near surface unitless quantity and is a real number between 0 low and 1 high the roms nemuro domain serves our primary focus and study area as blue whales are known to exhibit extensive foraging in this region from may october and the model provides physical and prey fields at sufficiently fine spatial and temporal resolution to inform behavior in the ibm fig 1 shows quarterly averages for sst and krill density over the full computational domain for the year 2008 a year with enso neutral conditions in the california current region and relatively high krill abundance in the coastal upwelling zone in april september the upwelling along the coast is evidenced by cooler nearshore waters and locally enhanced krill concentrations 2 2 model description spatially explicit individual based models ibms used in population dynamics seek to capture the motion of individuals in a heterogeneous landscape through a series of discrete updates here the ibm is formulated as a semi markov state switching model with n states each state s n is correlated with a behavior and characteristic state movements are described by step length and turning angle distributions locations and states for all individuals are updated at each time step states are selected probabilistically with elements p j k of an n n state transition matrix τ define the probability of transitioning from state j to k ensembles are created by the simulation of many agents allowing for inference of population statistics and behaviors while still retaining the discreteness of individuals ibms allow us to program behavior and see which aspects most closely reproduce observed migration patterns and the probabilistic updates naturally incorporate variations in each decision to explore how environmental and prey influences impact whale movements throughout one seasonal migration period may december we define and analyze ensembles from the two ibms described below 2 2 1 transit forage model we used published movement parameters in our model to test the hypotheses of what drives blue whale foraging migrations previous studies of blue whale tagging data bailey et al 2009 have identified two distinct behavioral states corresponding to transit and foraging in transit whales tend to move in a straight line whereas slower speeds and higher turning angles are observed in foraging as such we employed a two state model with states s 1 transit and s 2 forage used to evaluate how sst and prey availability drive whale movements behaviors and distributions 2 2 2 north south model previous correlative models have shown higher success rates of seasonal versus annual models when predicting blue whale migration patterns abrahms et al 2019b hazen et al 2017 blue whales likely rely on different biological and physical processes during their northward migration to feeding grounds versus southward migrations to breeding grounds with the transition likely triggered by bioenergetic or breeding demands additionally a higher percentage of transit is reported during the southward migration with individuals only stopping to forage if the prey conditions are sufficiently dense bailey et al 2009 northward and southward states are therefore split for the migration study to account for the stricter foraging requirements while returning to southern breeding grounds mechanisms for transition to southward migrations are therefore studied with a four state model states s 1 and s 2 describing transit and forage during northward migration and states s 3 and s 4 for southward migration we use a migration strategy based on the individual foraging rate averaged over the previous 10 days which is implemented in the transition probabilities from s 1 and s 2 north to s 3 south low foraging rates increase the probability of transitioning to southward migration and the time average provided sufficient opportunity for agents to travel between and seek out new krill patches again we test the effect of sst and prey density on this transition additional migration strategies including a krill satiation threshold in which southward transitions are initiated when whales consume sufficient levels of krill and natal breeding homing were tested for transitioning to southward migration and are described in the supplement 2 2 3 state transition functions and movement distributions behavioral states are selected probabilistically and are a function of current environmental covariates x sst krill density ρ and model parameters θ the probabilities encode how environmental and prey conditions influence the state transitions the 2 2 state transition matrix for the transit forage model is shown in eq 1 as an example with the 4 4 matrix for the north south model given in the supplement 1 τ x ρ θ s 1 s 1 s 1 s 2 s 2 s 1 s 2 s 2 p s t 1 s t 1 1 x θ ρ p s t 2 s t 1 1 x θ ρ p s t 1 s t 1 2 x θ ρ p s t 2 s t 1 2 x θ ρ 1 p t p t 1 p t p t here p t p s t 2 s t 1 1 2 x θ ρ is defined as the probability of foraging and st is the behavioral state at time t the probability of foraging is a weighted sum of environmental and krill transition functions and is given by p t 1 z w 1 p e s t 2 s t 1 1 2 x θ w 2 p k s t 2 s t 1 1 2 θ ρ with the weights w 1 and w 2 controlling the relative importance of sst and krill and z w 1 w 2 to normalize probabilities to 1 the environmental transition probability is the simple linear response function p e s t 2 s t 1 1 2 x θ logit 1 α 1 α 2 x x that selects for colder temperatures krill transition probabilities are set by the logistic selection function p k s t 2 s t 1 1 2 θ ρ logit 1 β ρ ρ where probability of foraging increases with krill density model parameters are provided in table 1 we assume future states depend only on current conditions and are independent of the past and current state so that τ is constant on the columns and rows sum to 1 in the model behavioral states are updated every 6 h fig 3 shows the probability of foraging computed for the full domain using monthly sst and krill inputs figures of daily probabilities are provided in the supplement across both the transit forage and north south models the forage and transit states have the same movement distributions regardless of north or southward migration step lengths are positive real numbers in units of meters and follow gamma distributions with probability density function bailey et al 2009 scales et al 2016 f s l x x a 1 s a γ a exp x s x 0 where γ a is the gamma function turning angles are sampled from a von mises distribution with probability density function given by f t a x 1 2 π i 0 κ exp κ cos x μ 0 x 2 π where i 0 κ is the bessel function of order 0 a 0 turning angle corresponds to straight movement in all states except southward transit s 3 where 0 is set to south parameters used in step length and turning angle distributions for transit and forage states are given in table 1 and movement distributions are shown in fig 2 the gamma distribution shape and scale parameters yield average step lengths of 22 2 12 9 km transit and 6 3 5 8 km forage for a 6 h time period consistent with bailey et al 2009 scales et al 2016 2 3 model implementation for its implementation in the ibm the semi markov model formalism is combined with an area restricted search ars the ars adds intelligence by allowing individuals to locally sense areas of high foraging potential the algorithm is as follows and is further outlined in fig 2 let y w t be the geographic location of whale w on time step t individual locations are initialized on a given day uniformly at random within a pre defined region of the domain the probability of foraging p w t is calculated for each location y w t and used to select the next behavioral state s w t 1 an area restricted search is conducted on the perimeter of a box of radius r to find the location yw with highest probability of foraging if such a location exists the turning angle is centered around the direction from y w t to yw step lengths and turning angles are sampled from the state distributions and used to update the locations to y w t 1 positions and states are updated at 6 h intervals using daily roms output ensembles of 2000 whales for years 2000 2010 were generated using the transit forage and north south models to understand the independent roles of sst and krill in driving the observed movement patterns of the northward migration in the transit forage model we additionally generated model ensembles using only sst or krill as inputs these one input ensembles can be thought of from a modeling perspective as probing the independent effects of each variable or from a biological perspective as populations with distinct strategies that base their fine scale decisions on only one of the two variables we analyzed the effects of these strategies on broad scale migration patterns seasonal and interannual differences in prey consumption and transitions to southward migration the same environmental and krill transition functions were used in all cases and turning a driver off or on is equivalent to adjusting the weights in the state transition matrix results are additionally measured against a correlated random walk crw with no environmental or prey preferences the crw has the same behavioral states and movement distributions with the probability of foraging fixed at 0 4 in alignment with published foraging rates for may november bailey et al 2009 krill densities and sst are recorded in the crw model at whale locations for comparison purposes to measure and compare the foraging success between population ensembles we introduce a foraging potential metric ω the value of ω for each individual w provides a sum of the krill density encountered while in a foraging state and is given by ω w t 1 n ρ y w t 1 s w t 2 s w t here ρ y w t is the krill density at the location of whale w 1 s w t 2 s w t is an indicator function that takes the value one if whale w is foraging in state 2 and zero otherwise and the summation is over all time steps t 2 4 modeling assumptions we summarize the model assumptions that were made in the development of these individual based models to study how daily to monthly sst and prey variability contribute to seasonal whale movements and foraging migrations model whales based their fine scale decision only on sst and or krill availability while other environmental factors may contribute to the process sst is often highly correlated with whale presence gill et al 2011 hazen et al 2017 palacios et al 2019 and is one of the most accessible variables for use in models the direct importance of prey in constraining distributions and migrations of marine megafauna has not yet been evaluated future behavioral states only depend on current prey and environmental conditions and are independent of current and past states model runs are initiated at the start of the migration season and whales are not allowed to learn from prior migrations our model represents the average whale the age sex and life history of individuals are not factored in the model since these variables are unknown in the available tagging data and movement parameters bailey et al 2009 individuals are not tracked upon leaving the roms domain and are not permitted to re enter the domain position updates that end on land are resampled to obtain a location in the ocean individuals enter the southern border of the domain uniformly at random between may 1 and june 1 start locations are drawn uniformly at random from the box bounded by latitudes 32 45 33 35 n and longitudes 118 5 124 2 w off the coast of southern california upon entering the domain all agents are in transit state s 1 with the turning angle 0 aligned with due north in the north south model the transition probability from s 1 and s 2 to s 4 is 0 that is whales only transition from north transit forage states to the south transit state s 3 transition to state s 3 was restricted until day of year 150 to allow the agents to explore the domain and find foraging grounds 2 5 parameter selection and sensitivity analysis when possible model parameters were determined from previously published resources to reduce the number of free variables the environmental transition probability function is parameterized to select for colder temperatures associated with upwelling the step length and turning angle distributions for the transit and forage states are derived from the speeds and turning angles of the transit and area restricted search behavioral states in bailey et al 2009 and scaled to a 6 h time step the 6 hour time steps were selected to best correspond with the 3 km spatial resolution of the roms data the average step lengths associated with a 6 hour interval allow the whales to transit and forage within the local domain without stepping over and missing potential foraging opportunities area restricted search is designed as a local search algorithm thus the search radius was set to match this average step length thus the free parameters and model variables are reduced to β and ρ used in the krill transition probability the day of year individuals enter the domain start date and starting location a sensitivity analysis indicates that ensemble spatiotemporal distributions and population level transit forage behaviors are robust to reasonable changes in the free parameters results of the sensitivity analysis and additional justification for parameter selection are provided in the supplement the start date and starting locations of individuals were identified as the most influential parameters on the population s northward migration and foraging success whereas changes to the parameters β and ρ have minimal impact the model sensitivity to start date aligns with recent studies of blue whale call patterns which reveal variability in the timing and success of the northward migration szesciorka et al 2020 to account for the increased sensitivity these variables add the start date is uniformly distributed from may 1 june 1 and the starting location is selected uniformly at random from a wide box in the southern part of the domain 3 results we aggregated population ensembles for all years to analyze broadscale patterns further we considered specific years to highlight transient and interannual trends 3 1 northward migration using only fine scale decisions the transit forage model produced realistic broad scale northward migration patterns timings and distributions fig 4 shows the aggregated results for all years 2000 2010 specifically the ensembles reach a northernmost mean latitude by early october fig 4a and peak abundance of blue whales in the monterey bay region defined by latitudes 36 6 370n between july and october fig 4b these distributions align with previous reports on migration characteristics estimates based on satellite tagging data fig 4a abrahms et al 2019a irvine et al 2014 and surveys of shipboard sightings croll et al 2005 fossette et al 2017 in addition the ensembles show a higher level of foraging during may october consistent with empirical observations bailey et al 2009 irvine et al 2014 with a sharp decrease in foraging rates fig 4c as krill abundance begins to decrease october in the domain in concordance with the end of upwelling the first panel in fig 3 displays july 2008 aggregates for the probability of foraging and foraging locations from the transit forage model and emphasizes that these two variables are not directly correlated in the ibm foraging locations depend on the probabilities but also explicitly on the current location of each agent and the travel times to productive habitats in july the majority of the population remains in southern regions of high foraging potential and has yet to reach the rich northern foraging grounds despite the high probability of foraging above latitude 40 n 3 2 contributions of environment and prey on the northward migration to understand the independent contributions of sst and krill to the observed northward migrations we generate and analyze model ensembles that use only sst or krill as inputs strategies based only on krill or sst lead to populations with distinct domain use patterns figs 3 5 first the july 2008 foraging location aggregates fig 3 demonstrate that the influences of sst or krill drive the populations to feed in spatially distinct regions in our model the temperature cues lead to dispersed habitats with small foraging hotspots only localized at the coast the influence of krill promoted increased offshore habitats and foraging hotspots furthermore when only sst is used as a driver the proportion of the whale population in the foraging state remains relatively constant between 30 40 throughout the year with the remaining individuals in the transiting state fig 4c longer step lengths from the transit distribution allow the sst only population to explore the domain quickly resulting in a fast migration reaching the northernmost mean latitudes earlier in the summer and overall a higher northernmost mean latitude in contrast the krill only strategy mimicked the full model in the latitudinal distributions fig 4a and arrival of whales in monterey bay fig 4d suggesting that the influence of krill is responsible for the timing of the northward migration in the combined model daily and seasonal foraging patterns are also remarkably more distinct in prey driven populations both models with krill have at least a 3 times higher variance in daily foraging rates when compared to the sst model the full and krill only models additionally show a transition to lower foraging rates between day of year 275 300 beginning late october in concordance with the end of the upwelling season bograd et al 2009 higher foraging rates from krill inputs naturally correspond to a higher foraging potential normalized distributions of ω for each of the three strategies are shown in fig 4d the krill only ensemble shows higher average foraging potential than the sst only and combined populations thus the influence of krill drives the foraging success of the combined population however the sst only model still had a higher mean foraging than the crw model indicating that the influence of favorable sst drives individuals to forage in locations with higher krill densities than they would find by random chance 3 3 interannual differences in prey consumption and foraging the years 2003 and 2008 have lower and higher than average modeled krill densities respectively and higher 2003 and lower 2008 than average sst fig 5a supplementary table 2 results from the full model show significant interannual differences in agreement with the increased levels of krill from the roms data 2008 has a 4 average higher foraging rate averaged over all simulation days than 2003 fig 5c with up to 20 differences depending on the time of year prior to day of year 260 the 2008 population shows an 8 8 higher average foraging than 2003 with daily differences reaching as high as 20 after this date 2003 temporarily has a higher foraging rate before both populations reach equal foraging a comparison of the population ensembles for 2003 and 2008 provided understanding of how sst and prey factors contributed to the observed interannual differences both sst and krill populations have a 3 4 higher average foraging rate for 2008 than in 2003 thus the lower average sst in 2008 alters the population behavior and increases the overall foraging but the addition of krill again provides more detailed temporal information the sst population shows no significant differences in the foraging rates before and after day of year 260 whereas in the spring and summer months the 2008 krill population has a 10 7 higher rate than 2003 furthermore the foraging rates for 2008 are lower than 2003 just after day of year 260 despite the higher krill density in 2008 average foraging potential ω is higher in 2008 across all strategies with krill driven populations showing a secondary peak at higher levels independent of the yearly variances in prey density the krill driven populations exhibited the sharp transition to lower foraging rates in october thus our results suggest the influence of prey provides the fine scale daily seasonal and interannual details observed in the full model 3 4 implications on southward migration the addition of the southward migration states results in a southward shift in the latitudinal distributions for all strategies fig 6 a all cases show similar timing with the latitudes peaking around day 300 however the addition of krill influences transitions to southward migrations in realistic ways specifically all models show a large early migration at days 150 200 as whales unsuccessful at finding and remaining within rich foraging grounds migrate south however models that include krill continue to transition throughout october and november with a secondary peak around day 300 corresponding to the seasonal reductions in population foraging rates that are observed in the transit forage model fig 6b using only sst the proportion of whales foraging remains relatively constant and low through the spring and fall figs 4b 5 c which leads to time independent and early transitions furthermore the cumulative percentage of whales transitioning into a southward migration plateaus around day 300 in the sst only model figure 6 c whereas the krill and sst krill models display continuing transitions to southward migration later in the season with all strategies not all whales transition to southward migrating states as individuals may leave the study area prior to the start of migration or remain in areas with high foraging potential 4 discussion understanding the bottom up drivers of spatiotemporal distributions of highly migratory species is important for predicting changes in future habitat use and for implementing effective dynamic conservation policies here we introduced an ibm which reproduced realistic foraging and migratory behaviors at both individual and population levels suggesting that fine scale individual decisions lead to emergent properties of the population mueller and fagan 2008 furthermore we used model populations driven by only sst or krill to help uncover the direct impact of each variable on whale behavior and migrations our findings indicate that abiotic sst and biotic krill abundance factors both play key roles in individual movement decisions during round trip blue whale migrations abiotic factors such as sst are commonly used as proxies for prey in blue whale models abrahms et al 2019a becker et al 2019 pirotta et al 2019 pirotta et al 2018 while we found that sst indeed leads whales to forage in areas with higher prey availability at broad spatial scales compared to a simple crw important spatial and temporal patterns are missed by using sst without including krill contributions explicitly figs 4 6 notably the proportion of whales foraging remained nearly constant throughout may december thus missing important seasonal fluctuations in foraging behavior bailey et al 2009 additionally driving populations only with sst led to more northerly average latitudes fig 4a inaccurate arrival times to monterey bay fig 4d and could not realistically reproduce the seasonal southward return migration fig 6 in contrast populations influenced only by krill retained realistic seasonal behaviors such as increased foraging during the upwelling season and denser krill years as well as an appropriate timing of southward migrations abrahms et al 2019a bailey et al 2009 furthermore the influence of krill resulted in increased offshore habitats and foraging hotspots however these ensembles expressed unrealistically high levels of seasonal foraging figs 4 5 when compared to published estimates of monthly foraging behavior bailey et al 2009 when combined krill acted to inform biologically feasible seasonal and yearly variations in foraging behavior and sst reduced excessively high foraging rates plausibly by accounting for the impact of unfavorable environmental conditions on movement and foraging decisions while the results presented here represent statistics from large population ensembles run with a fixed set of parameters and using simulated sst and prey fields we found general population distributions and migratory behaviors were robust to reasonable changes in model parameters supplement the growing use of ibms has opened new avenues to test mechanistic questions of animal movement and make predictions for future scenarios bauer and klaassen 2013 deangelis and mooij 2005 stillman et al 2014 tang and bennett 2010 examples range from terrestrial to marine communities and include the role of memory in

conservation and harvesting practices on fisheries ayllón et al 2018 jørgensen et al 2008 o callaghan and gordon 2008 and how generic habitat characteristics can lead to migratory behavior shaw and couzin 2013 our results here contribute to the wealth of spatiotemporal and mechanisitic information that can be learned from ibm ensembles as fig 3 shows a high probability of foraging does not directly correspond to foraging whales correlative species distribution models provide information on available habitat yet have little consideration of behavioral factors that could limit use in other words a species realized niche is not necessarily its fundamental niche these models can result in high predictions in areas that are unavailable to migratory predators and falsely link animal presence with preferred habitats fig 3 garshelis 2000 railsback et al 2003 for example hazen et al 2017 abrahms et al 2019b predict high habitat likelihood in the northern part of the domain but these ranges are less likely to be accessed by migrating whales due to movement limitations the dynamic state model approaches in pirotta et al 2019 pirotta et al 2018 seek to answer mechanistic factors driving the migration strategies for lactating female blue whales locations and energetic needs of the individuals are included but movement is limited to stepping along a one dimensional line of 100km boxes adjacent to the coast the presented ibm overcomes these limitations by explicitly linking fully two dimensional discrete movement processes and behavioral states to the available environmental and prey conditions which revealed broad scale migration patterns and mechanistic information about habitat use and foraging behaviors our results reveal the relative roles of the physical environment and prey availability in the movement decisions of a migratory marine predator and shed light on environmental processes influencing foraging and migratory behavior on daily to seasonal scales such information can help relate future changes in biotic and abiotic environmental conditions to a species anticipated behavioral responses migratory species continue to face an expanding number of threats from changing environmental conditions and interactions with humans horns and şekercioğlu 2018 maxwell et al 2013 wilcove and wikelski 2008 our findings also have important ecological and conservation implications as ocean temperatures are warming globally and climate change is expected to redistribute species richness in lower trophic levels woodworth jefcoats et al 2016 previous work has predicted how ocean conditions may influence the distributions of top predators over the next century hazen et al 2013 however changes in habitat quality may have disproportionate effects depending on the distance from normal migration routes for example increased habitat quality far from shore may not be discovered or may not be energetically feasible to exploit here we show how year to year differences in conditions are clearly captured in the model ensembles fig 5 by using climate change projections as input the model could generate more realistic predictions for the responses of blue whales to future scenarios increased water stratification from ocean warming is likely to affect the vertical distribution of krill and krill populations may shift poleward or decline in response to predicted changes in coastal upwelling systems di lorenzo et al 2005 palacios et al 2004 roemmich and mcgowan 1995 rykaczewski et al 2015 sydeman et al 2014 given we found sst and krill were both important in determining multiple aspects of blue whale space use and foraging behavior concurrent climate change impacts to both water temperatures and krill may influence blue whale distributions and prey consumption in synergistic ways our work highlights the value of including multiple forage based drivers of animal movements and distributions to not only elucidate the mechanisms underlying migratory behavior but also to help quantify the effects of anthropogenic risks on a threatened and highly migratory species finally the models presented here provide insight into the dynamic behavior of a highly migratory marine species thereby laying the foundation to explore other aspects of the ecology and distributions of marine megafauna additionally an individual based model framework allows for testing the roles of other variables or processes on emergent migratory behavior for example animal culture and social interactions have been shown to influence the migratory capacity of other species including ungulates jesmer et al 2018 and birds mueller et al 2013 blue whales have been shown to communicate over large distances roughly 500 1 000 km watkins et al 2000 but the impacts of such communication on migrations have not been explored the role of sociality in whale migrations could readily be tested in our modeling framework by allowing agents in sufficiently dense krill patches to signal their location and attract others optimal group sizes could also be evaluated by modeling trade offs associated with density dependent foraging opportunities markham et al 2015 finally memory effects are believed to play a role in migratory behaviors abrahms et al 2019a and their role could be tested through the use of climatological inputs thus the flexibility of a spatially explicit individual based movement model such as that presented here provides the opportunity to test a wide range of hypotheses in animal behavioral ecology

gergs et al 2011 ibrahim et al 2013 brock 2013 gergs et al 2016b earthworms have been shown to be sensitive to alterations in environmental quality fraser et al 1996 and chemical exposure klok et al

decomposition nutrient cycling soil pore creation and soil aggregate formation robinson et al 2012 blouin et al 2013 bertrand et al 2015 due to their species specific feeding and burrowing behaviour earthworms can serve as bioindicators of soil pollution suthar and surindra 2008 paoletti 1999 based on principles of physiological ecology and the methodology of sibly et al 2013 johnston et al 2014a 2014b 2015 suggested an energy budget model for earthworms and demonstrated its applicability for field populations and in the study of the effects of chemicals besides more general terms johnston et al 2014a argued that due to the kappa rule see details below the standard deb model kooijman et al 2008 is not applicable to earthworm life cycles based on two observations and their interpretations 1 neuhauser et al 1980a observed that eisenia fetida specimens grow to higher wet weights in the absence of conspecifics compared with their maximum body weights in experiments with groups of worms johnston et al 2014a interpreted this as a necessity of the presence of sexual partners for reproduction and that in terms of energy allocation within the organism reproduction takes priority over growth 2 reinecke and viljoen 1990 reported that e fetida specimens continue reproduction to some extent during periods of weight loss under limiting feeding conditions johnston et al 2014a interpreted the weight loss as shrinking during starvation however as long as the energy reserves are above a threshold of 50 of their maximum an individual continues reproduction a few of their model assumptions are key to understanding the implicit interpretation of the above observations energy assimilated from ingested food is allocated first to maintenance and thereafter in order of priority to reproduction in adults only growth and energy reserves changes in mass may be due to growth increase in mass if sufficient energy is assimilated from the environment or the catabolism of tissue decrease in mass during starvation here we test whether the standard deb model is able to adequately reproduce earthworm growth and reproduction by following two alternative assumptions regarding the observations by neuhauser et al 1980a and reinecke and viljoen 1990 that would not lead to a violation of the kappa rule 1 reduced growth in the presence of conspecifics is a matter of competition for food and crowding stress rather than due to a physiological change in the energy allocation strategy in the absence of sexual partners 2 weight loss under limited feeding conditions or the absence of food is initially due to the utilisation of reserve which explicitly contributes to weight a process that has been appreciated in the deb community since the work on pond snails published by zonneveld and kooijman 1989 and in turn the reserve allows continued reproduction for a limited period until starvation becomes effective for testing we first parameterised the standard deb model for e fetida secondly we simulated earthworm growth and reproduction under variable food availability by maintaining the kappa rule of the standard deb model and compared the model predictions with data derived from experiments with individual worms and in e fetida populations where individuals potentially compete for food 2 materials and methods we used an individual based population model that has previously been developed and tested for the water flea daphnia magna gergs et al 2014 2016a a comprehensive description of the model processes and the source code is available in gergs et al 2014 here we only describe the individual level life history processes used in the model as population dynamics are not considered the model is based on the standard scaled deb model as published by kooijman et al 2008 where the reserve and maturity are scaled with the maximum assimilation rate per unit surface area individuals are characterised by five primary state variables 1 the structural length l relates to the physical length and determines actual feeding rates and costs for maintaining body functions 2 the scaled reserve ue serves as a measure of energy storage and provides a link between food assimilation and allocation of energy within the organism 3 the scaled maturity uh cm2 d measures individual development and reflects how stage transitions are initiated by fixed maturity levels at birth and at puberty 4 the scaled reproduction buffer ur represents the energy that is available for reproduction and which during reproduction events will be converted into eggs 5 the vital state of the individual is based on a probability of survival s in addition to these primary state variables a number of intermediate outputs or states are necessary to update the primary states for each individual a central assumption of the standard deb model is that fixed fractions of assimilated reserve are allocated to somatic maintenance and structure κ on the one hand and maturity maintenance maturation and reproduction 1 κ on the other this assumption is referred to as the kappa rule the model equations for the uptake of food from the environment as well as for the use of energy for growth and the reproductive system through allocation via a reserve compartment are listed in table 1 an overview of the corresponding state variables and outputs is provided in table 2 the parameters are given in table 3 in the model the acquisition of resources from the environment depends on the environmental food density x we used a functional response of type ii for modelling the ingestion rate jx based on a maximum ingestion rate in turn determined by the squared individual length l multiplied by the surface area specific maximum ingestion rate jxm eq 1 the ingested food is taken up into the body with an efficiency κx which is usually assumed to be constant for a particular type of resource and is independent of body size allowing the assimilation rate ja to be derived eq 2 the deb scheme makes use of a scaled functional response f that can exhibit values between 0 and 1 therefore the assimilation rate is scaled by the maximum assimilation rate per unit of surface area jam which removes the units of energy and mass from the system eq 3 the assimilated energy is subsequently allocated to the reserve compartment the scaled amount of the reserve ue depends on the mobilisation flux sc and with the onset of feeding at birth additionally on the scaled assimilation f l 2 for embryos f 0 eq 4 under growth conditions the mobilisation flux sc eq 5 depends on the length l and the scaled reserve density e as given by eq 6 growth conditions are defined as e l where l is the scaled length eq 7 under conditions of low resource supply the scaled reserve density may drop below the non growth boundary e l and the animal is considered to be starving there are several deb starvation options available however it is reasonable to assume that upon starvation the reserve is used to pay somatic maintenance costs only and the mobilisation flux is thus given by eq 8 where κ is the reserve fraction that is allocated to soma the net result of reserve allocation to soma κ minus the somatic maintenance costs is used for growth whereas the remaining fraction 1 κ is used for maturation and reproduction the increase in structural length l is given by eq 9 alternatively if e l the structural length of the organism may optionally shrink the change in scaled maturity uh depends on the 1 κ fraction of the mobilisation flux minus the maturity maintenance costs eq 10 fixed maturity levels mark the onset of feeding u h b and the investment in reproduction u h p after reaching puberty uh u h p maturation stops and the mobilised reserve is allocated to the reproduction buffer eq 11 the reproduction buffer is converted into reproduction at a rate r with a fixed reproduction efficiency depending on the energetic costs for producing a single egg eq 12 the structural length l is linked with the actual body length measure lw by a shape correction coefficient δm eq 13 the structural length or rather the structural volume l3 to wet weight conversion is based on a density factor w multiplied by the scaled reserve density basically assuming a structural density of 1 g cm 3 in addition we assume that during the depletion of the reserve the vacant volume is partly replaced by water i e reserve and water utilize the same volume and multiply the one minus the scaled reserve density by a density factor wv eq 14 this is an extension of the original deb ibm model as published in gergs et al 2014 we moreover assume that the contribution of the reproduction buffer to the total weight is negligibly small and is thus ignored at the population level the simulated individuals compete for food and additionally we assume that crowding will interfere with an individual s food ingestion we use a stress function sd eq 15 that indicates the stress level imposed by population density dp on the maximum ingestion rate eq 16 above the no effect population density d0 the stress level increases proportionally to the tolerance density dt to account for different ambient temperatures we apply the arrhenius function to the rate constants of the model eq 17 model parameterization is done using debtool https github com add my pet debtool m following the

were carried out to mimic published experiments that had been carried out with individual worms and worm populations i e groups of worms cultivated in a test vessel neuhauser et al 1980 published a series of experiments that were used for model parametrization the authors studied e fetida growth in terms of wet weight for three different food types activated sludge cow manure and horse manure for each of the food types 250 g was provided initially in the experiments second individual growth in terms of wet weight was measured for worm populations of four different densities 250 g activated sludge was provided initially third individual growth in terms of wet weight was recorded during a 16 week experiment and different amounts 5 10 15 and 20 g of activated sludge were initially added to a 78 cm2 arena data on individual weight loss and on paper pulp mill sludge as substrate was available from elvira et al 1996 presley et al 1990 measured growth in terms of wet weight and cumulative cocoon production in individual worms ad libitum rations of cornmeal were provided weekly the reproduction data was not included in the model parametrization growth and reproduction data obtained from interval feeding experiments as published by reinecke and viljoen 1990 were used for model testing worms were kept in populations of 10 individuals and cow manure was provided as a food source either periodically 20 g every 20 days or sporadically 10 g on day 10 50 g on day 50 and 25 g on day 140 and 25 g were removed on day 100 to account for different growth rates under ad libitum conditions we changed the maximum ingestion rate according to the food source provided in the original studies while assuming that the maximum assimilation rate and the assimilation efficiency remains unchanged ibm simulations have been initialized by replicating the ambient temperature food density size of the environment earthworm numbers and start body masses following the experimental setups of the original studies the earthworm life cycle prior to the start of the experiment was simulated until the worms reached the initial body sizes for the experiments based on the information on culture conditions if culture conditions were not described we assumed that the experimental food type was provided ad libitum prior to testing during the ibm simulations the food density as well as the population sizes are dynamically updated based on individual feeding rates and survival probabilities for a detailed description of population level processes see gergs et al 2014 besides the simulation of individual worm life histories and similar to martin et al 2013 and beaudouin et al 2015 individual growth and reproduction obtained from population simulations were subsequently compared with empirical data 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter estimation a number of zero variate data table 4 as well as growth and reproduction trajectories fig 1 were used for model parameterisation the resulting model parameters are given in table 3 the parameterised model fits the weight data particularly well but the reproduction survival and length data are also generally well fitted there is however some deviation between the model and the measurements for some of the growth and reproduction data fig 1 there is also some deviation between the model fit and the data for age at birth and time since birth at puberty in general information on development times varies across studies smaller values have for instance been reported for e fetida by domínguez 2004 and these are closer to the estimated values for age at birth in the present study as data on temperature dependency of individual performance was scarce the value for the arrhenius temperature was set to default to estimate the deb parameters we assumed that environmental conditions most importantly food availability and temperature are constant over time in experiments with e fetida sieved soil is frequently used as a medium and food such as cow manure horse manure or activated sludge is provided initially and its supply is reduced during the course of the experiments due to feeding activity depending on the amount and quality of food this can result in food limitation differences in quality can be modelled by assuming a constant scaled functional response f calibrated in such a way that allows the experiment to be captured as long as there is an excess of food availability for zero variate data in particular constant conditions of unlimited food i e f 1 are generally assumed however changes in food density over time might explain the reductions in measured body weights compared with the modelled weights at later time points in the experiments conducted by neuhauser et al 1980a particularly observed in activated sludge treatments and at lower population densities fig 1a b although the model fits the growth data of presley et al 1996 well fig 1c the cumulative number of cocoons produced during this experiment is either under or over predicted depending on the assumption made about the number of offspring one or two borne by a single cocoon fig 1d only whole individuals can be produced in general cocoon production as well as the number of offspring per cocoon can vary considerably amongst studies depending on food conditions and temperature for an overview see domínguez 2004 using activated sludge as a food source loehr et al 1985 demonstrated that e fetida may produce on average around two cocoons per week at 20 c while hartenstein et al 1979 reported the production of up to five cocoons per week at 25 c assuming that each cocoon may bear up to six juvenile worms hartenstein et al 1979 the maximum reproductive rates would be 1 71 20 c and 4 29 25 c per day at lower food levels the number can be as low as one individual per cocoon but higher numbers have also been observed venter and reinecke 1988 in addition reproductive output can vary during the life time of an individual hartenstein et al 1979 however an average number of 1 5 individuals per cocoon would fit well with the reproduction data from presley et al 1996 in their study neuhauser et al 1980a observed that individual growth rates and maximum wet weights decreased with increasing constant population sizes used in the experimental setups as food was initially abundant in this experiment only considering competition for food in our model would not account for the initial slower growth of worms at higher population densities compared with lower ones rather an assumption of lower ingestion rates as a result of crowding could explain the observed growth patterns fig 1b a similar crowding effect has previously been suggested for aquatic systems gergs et al 2014 the predictions for feeding rates in this experiment suggest that depending on the population density the food that was initially provided became depleted between days 100 and 150 for a verification of the feeding module see fig 1e the late individual weight gain in the population density experiment fig 1b may suggest that some resources become available or are produced later in the experiment neuhauser et al 1980b as well as flack and hartenstein 1984 demonstrated that e fetida is able to gain weight using a range of microorganisms including bacteria fungi and protozoa offered experimentally as food sources however this observation as well as the late weight loss for the small population setup fig 1b black dots was not considered in this model fitting exercise the growth data by presley et al 1996 and neuhauser et al 1980a is generally well fitted by the van bertalanffy growth curve of the standard deb model which is based on a constant value for the parameter kappa the kappa rule has its origin in the maturation concept and the continued growth at the onset of reproduction if value of kappa and the food conditions are constant for a detailed discussion of the concept see kooijman 2010 in contrast assuming that beyond puberty kappa is decreased or reproduction is prioritised over growth would lead to a decline in growth at limiting food conditions this behaviour is not observed in these studies e g fig 1 c and d but follows the van bertalanffy trajectory in our model we assumed that in the absence of food the worms lose weight due to the depletion of their reserve which is considered to contribute to the body weight if shrinking in structural length below the non growth boundary eq 7 is not allowed in the model weight loss upon starvation will continue until the structural mass is reached fig 1f dashed line as revealed by this simulation the model parameterisation suggests that in e fetida the reserve contributes considerably to the total mass presumably to an extent that is not realistic however the weight loss modelled in this way is too fast and we thus assumed that during the course of reserve depletion the reserve volume is partially replaced by water a model that describes the measured data well fig 1f solid line this reserve replacement assumption might generally be supported by the observation that loss in wet weight is slower at high moisture levels compared with low moisture conditions reinecke and venter 1987 further evidence for this hypothesis may come from future trials that measure dry weights under starvation conditions 3 2 model predictions the parameterised model reasonably predicts individual growth and reproduction for experiments with populations of worms and periodic and sporadic food additions fig 2 in particular the growth in the periodic food scenario fig 2a and the difference in the reproductive rates between the two food scenarios is well captured fig 2b d however the accuracy of the model predictions depends on a number of assumptions the small modelled increase in body weight initially in the experiment fig 2 a and c is due to the reserve density carried over from the culture conditions which is probably too high as discussed above the reproductive rates in the experiments are either under predicted or over predicted depending on the assumed cocoon occupancy fig 2 b d in the sporadic food experiment by reinecke and viljoen 1990 measured individual wet weights declined over time and increased again after food was added to the system while the modelled growth patterns are generally in line with the data for this scenario the predicted body weights are too high when it is assumed that shrinking below the non growth boundary is not possible fig 2c dashed line in contrast if negative growth is allowed eq 9 which means that the animal will sacrifice structure to maintain bodily functions the initial rate of weight loss is too high when compared to the data but captures the second phase of weight loss well however the implicit assumption of this strategy that the energy needed to build a unit of structure is fully recouped when it is used to pay maintenance costs is unrealistic as it stands the two metabolic strategies tested here probably represent two extreme cases of possible adaptations to starvation conditions also sequential combinations of different options are conceivable e g after the reserve is depleted energy is obtained from bodily structures with a certain efficiency to cover maintenance costs further starvation options may include the possibility of decreasing somatic maintenance costs changing energy mobilisation to fulfil somatic maintenance by changing the value of kappa or taking energy from the reproduction buffer which is only possible in adults augustine et al 2012 gergs and jager 2014 testing these different starvation rules would however in addition to reproduction data require the measurement of dry weights through starvation periods or information on moisture conditions when recording wet weights when assuming that the reserve replacement assumption is realistic see discussion above as well as more detailed information on the culture conditions are needed that trigger individual performance during the initial experimental phases for the periodic food scenario examined by reinecke and viljoen 1990 the simulated growth of an individually cultured worm fig 2a grey dashed line is close to the growth trajectory observed for conditions where cow manure was provided ad libitum fig 1a white dots the lower modelled individual growth of worms in a population of ten compared to individually kept worms suggests that the reduced growth 2a and reproduction 2b were the result of food competition and crowding as these are the only population level interactions implemented in the model the extended applicability of the model to the population level would require data of multi generations which was not tested in this study as our model is largely parameterised based on data derived from experiments with individual worms a change in the energy allocation that prioritises reproduction over growth by changing the parameter к as suggested by johnston et al 2014a would lead to greater reproduction compared with the simulation results shown in fig 2b the opposite strategy i e increased growth and reduced reproduction in response to food shortage has previously been suggested for daphnids gergs et al 2014 in contrast here maintaining the kappa rule of the standard deb model describes the data well which supports the first of our alternative assumptions i e reduced growth in the presence of conspecifics is a matter of competition and crowding one of the criticisms of johnston et al 2014a regarding the validity of the deb model or more specifically the kappa rule was that the deb model would wrongly predict no reproduction during phases of weight loss which the authors interpreted as shrinking due to starvation in contrast we here explicitly consider the organism s reserve as part of its weight as a consequence after food depletion the organism initially loses weight as a result of reserve utilisation to continue growth in terms of structure and reproduction in prolonged periods without any food availability and after the reserve has dropped below the non growth boundary the organism is considered to be starving and may shrink in structural length based on these assumptions the parameterised standard deb model predicts that e fetida individuals will continue to reproduce during periods of weight loss although the reproductive rate declines over time fig 2c and d which is in line with empirical observations by reinecke and viljoen 1990 the modelled rates are somewhat higher in the model compared to data though this pattern in both data and model simulations supports our second alternative assumption that weight loss under limited feeding conditions might to some extent be due to the utilisation of the reserve which contributes to the mass and that use of the reserve allows continued reproduction in the absence of food 3 3 conclusion the standard deb model is able to reproduce e fetida observed growth and reproduction under variable feeding regimes more specifically it predicts the initial continuation of reproduction during periods of weight loss when the reserve is being depleted which follows from the concurrence of mass and energy integrating the deb model with an ibm framework allows the simulation of population level interactions and of the individual level consequences our ibm simulations suggest that the kappa rule of the standard deb model which states that a fixed fraction of the assimilated reserve is allocated to structure can be maintained by the worms in the presence of conspecifics the reduced individual growth rate might be the result of competition which is a fundamental principle of ecology rather than due to changes in energy allocation the quantitative predictions for situations of food limitation however depend on specific assumptions for the starvation rules which require further investigation and tailored experimental test designs the applicability of this approach for other earthworm species could be tested in future credit authorship contribution statement kim j rakel writing original draft writing review editing thomas g preuss

gergs et al 2011 ibrahim et al 2013 brock 2013 gergs et al 2016b earthworms have been shown to be sensitive to alterations in environmental quality fraser et al 1996 and chemical exposure klok et al 2005 consequently they are focal species for the ecological risk assessment of chemicals oecd 1984 spurgeon et al 2003 moreover earthworms significantly contribute to soil processes including decomposition nutrient cycling soil pore creation and soil aggregate formation robinson et al 2012 blouin et al 2013 bertrand et al 2015 due to their species specific feeding and burrowing behaviour earthworms can serve as bioindicators of soil pollution suthar and surindra 2008 paoletti 1999 based on principles of physiological ecology and the methodology of sibly et al 2013 johnston et al 2014a 2014b 2015 suggested an energy budget model for earthworms and demonstrated its applicability for field populations and in the study of the effects of chemicals besides more general terms johnston et al 2014a argued that due to the kappa rule see details below the standard deb model kooijman et al 2008 is not applicable to earthworm life cycles based on two observations and their interpretations 1 neuhauser et al 1980a observed that eisenia fetida specimens grow to higher wet weights in the absence of conspecifics compared with their maximum body weights in experiments with groups of worms johnston et al 2014a interpreted this as a necessity of the presence of sexual partners for reproduction and that in terms of energy allocation within the organism reproduction takes priority over growth 2 reinecke and viljoen 1990 reported that e fetida specimens continue reproduction to some extent during periods of weight loss under limiting feeding conditions johnston et al 2014a interpreted the weight loss as shrinking during starvation however as long as the energy reserves are above a threshold of 50 of their maximum an individual continues reproduction a few of their model assumptions are key to understanding the implicit interpretation of the above observations energy assimilated from ingested food is allocated first to maintenance and thereafter in order of priority to reproduction in adults only growth and energy reserves changes in mass may be due to growth increase in mass if sufficient energy is assimilated from the environment or the catabolism of tissue decrease in mass during starvation here we test whether the standard deb model is able to adequately reproduce earthworm growth and reproduction by following two alternative assumptions regarding the observations by neuhauser et al 1980a and reinecke and viljoen 1990 that would not lead to a violation of the kappa rule 1 reduced growth in the presence of conspecifics is a matter of competition for food and crowding stress rather than due to a physiological change in the energy allocation strategy in the absence of sexual partners 2 weight loss under limited feeding conditions or the absence of food is initially due to the utilisation of reserve which explicitly contributes to weight a process that has been appreciated in the deb community since the work on pond snails published by zonneveld and kooijman 1989 and in turn the reserve allows continued reproduction for a limited period until starvation becomes effective for testing we first parameterised the standard deb model for e fetida secondly we simulated earthworm growth and reproduction under variable food availability by maintaining the kappa rule of the standard deb model and compared the model predictions with data derived from experiments with individual worms and in e fetida populations where individuals potentially compete for food 2 materials and methods we used an individual based population model that has previously been developed and tested for the water flea daphnia magna gergs et al 2014 2016a a comprehensive description of the model processes and the source code is available in gergs et al 2014 here we only describe the individual level life history processes used in the model as population dynamics are not considered the model is based on the standard scaled deb model as published by kooijman et al 2008 where the reserve and maturity are scaled with the maximum assimilation rate per unit surface area individuals are characterised by five primary state variables 1 the structural length l relates to the physical length and determines actual feeding rates and costs for maintaining body functions 2 the scaled reserve ue serves as a measure of energy storage and provides a link between food assimilation and allocation of energy within the organism 3 the scaled maturity uh cm2 d measures individual development and reflects how stage transitions are initiated by fixed maturity levels at birth and at puberty 4 the scaled reproduction buffer ur represents the energy that is available for reproduction and which during reproduction events will be converted into eggs 5 the vital state of the individual is based on a probability of survival s in addition to these primary state variables a number of intermediate outputs or states are necessary to update the primary states for each individual a central assumption of the standard deb model is that fixed fractions of assimilated reserve are allocated to somatic maintenance and structure κ on the one hand and maturity maintenance maturation and reproduction 1 κ on the other this assumption is referred to as the kappa rule the model equations for the uptake of food from the environment as well as for the use of energy for growth and the reproductive system through allocation via a reserve compartment are listed in table 1 an overview of the corresponding state variables and outputs is provided in table 2 the parameters are given in table 3 in the model the acquisition of resources from the environment depends on the environmental food density x we used a functional response of type ii for modelling the ingestion rate jx based on a maximum ingestion rate in turn determined by the squared individual length l multiplied by the surface area specific maximum ingestion rate jxm eq 1 the ingested food is taken up into the body with an efficiency κx which is usually assumed to be constant for a particular type of resource and is independent of body size allowing the assimilation rate ja to be derived eq 2 the deb scheme makes use of a scaled functional response f that can exhibit values between 0 and 1 therefore the assimilation rate is scaled by the maximum assimilation rate per unit of surface area jam which removes the units of energy and mass from the system eq 3 the assimilated energy is subsequently allocated to the reserve compartment the scaled amount of the reserve ue depends on the mobilisation flux sc and with the onset of feeding at birth additionally on the scaled assimilation f l 2 for embryos f 0 eq 4 under growth conditions the mobilisation flux sc eq 5 depends on the length l and the scaled reserve density e as given by eq 6 growth conditions are defined as e l where l is the scaled length eq 7 under conditions of low resource supply the scaled reserve density may drop below the non growth boundary e l and the animal is considered to be starving there are several deb starvation options available however it is reasonable to assume that upon starvation the reserve is used to pay somatic maintenance costs only and the mobilisation flux is thus given by eq 8 where κ is the reserve fraction that is allocated to soma the net result of reserve allocation to soma κ minus the somatic maintenance costs is used for growth whereas the remaining fraction 1 κ is used for maturation and reproduction the increase in structural length l is given by eq 9 alternatively if e l the structural length of the organism may optionally shrink the change in scaled maturity uh depends on the 1 κ fraction of the mobilisation flux minus the maturity maintenance costs eq 10 fixed maturity levels mark the onset of feeding u h b and the investment in reproduction u h p after reaching puberty uh u h p maturation stops and the mobilised reserve is allocated to the reproduction buffer eq 11 the reproduction buffer is converted into reproduction at a rate r with a fixed reproduction efficiency depending on the energetic costs for producing a single egg eq 12 the structural length l is linked with the actual body length measure lw by a shape correction coefficient δm eq 13 the structural length or rather the structural volume l3 to wet weight conversion is based on a density factor w multiplied by the scaled reserve density basically assuming a structural density of 1 g cm 3 in addition we assume that during the depletion of the reserve the vacant volume is partly replaced by water i e reserve and water utilize the same volume and multiply the one minus the scaled reserve density by a density factor wv eq 14 this is an extension of the original deb ibm model as published in gergs et al 2014 we moreover assume that the contribution of the reproduction buffer to the total weight is negligibly small and is thus ignored at the population level the simulated individuals compete for food and additionally we assume that crowding will interfere with an individual s food ingestion we use a stress function sd eq 15 that indicates the stress level imposed by population density dp on the maximum ingestion rate eq 16 above the no effect population density d0 the stress level increases proportionally to the tolerance density dt to account for different ambient temperatures we apply the arrhenius function to the rate constants of the model eq 17 model parameterization is done using debtool https github com add my pet debtool m following the

were carried out to mimic published experiments that had been carried out with individual worms and worm populations i e groups of worms cultivated in a test vessel neuhauser et al 1980 published a series of experiments that were used for model parametrization the authors studied e fetida growth in terms of wet weight for three different food types activated sludge cow manure and horse manure for each of the food types 250 g was provided initially in the experiments second individual growth in terms of wet weight was measured for worm populations of four different densities 250 g activated sludge was provided initially third individual growth in terms of wet weight was recorded during a 16 week experiment and different amounts 5 10 15 and 20 g of activated sludge were initially added to a 78 cm2 arena data on individual weight loss and on paper pulp mill sludge as substrate was available from elvira et al 1996 presley et al 1990 measured growth in terms of wet weight and cumulative cocoon production in individual worms ad libitum rations of cornmeal were provided weekly the reproduction data was not included in the model parametrization growth and reproduction data obtained from interval feeding experiments as published by reinecke and viljoen 1990 were used for model testing worms were kept in populations of 10 individuals and cow manure was provided as a food source either periodically 20 g every 20 days or sporadically 10 g on day 10 50 g on day 50 and 25 g on day 140 and 25 g were removed on day 100 to account for different growth rates under ad libitum conditions we changed the maximum ingestion rate according to the food source provided in the original studies while assuming that the maximum assimilation rate and the assimilation efficiency remains unchanged ibm simulations have been initialized by replicating the ambient temperature food density size of the environment earthworm numbers and start body masses following the experimental setups of the original studies the earthworm life cycle prior to the start of the experiment was simulated until the worms reached the initial body sizes for the experiments based on the information on culture conditions if culture conditions were not described we assumed that the experimental food type was provided ad libitum prior to testing during the ibm simulations the food density as well as the population sizes are dynamically updated based on individual feeding rates and survival probabilities for a detailed description of population level processes see gergs et al 2014 besides the simulation of individual worm life histories and similar to martin et al 2013 and beaudouin et al 2015 individual growth and reproduction obtained from population simulations were subsequently compared with empirical data 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter estimation a number of zero variate data table 4 as well as growth and reproduction trajectories fig 1 were used for model parameterisation the resulting model parameters are given in table 3 the parameterised model fits the weight data particularly well but the reproduction survival and length data are also generally well fitted there is however some deviation between the model and the measurements for some of the growth and reproduction data fig 1 there is also some deviation between the model fit and the data for age at birth and time since birth at puberty in general information on development times varies across studies smaller values have for instance been reported for e fetida by domínguez 2004 and these are closer to the estimated values for age at birth in the present study as data on temperature dependency of individual performance was scarce the value for the arrhenius temperature was set to default to estimate the deb parameters we assumed that environmental conditions most importantly food availability and temperature are constant over time in experiments with e fetida sieved soil is frequently used as a medium and food such as cow manure horse manure or activated sludge is provided initially and its supply is reduced during the course of the experiments due to feeding activity depending on the amount and quality of food this can result in food limitation differences in quality can be modelled by assuming a constant scaled functional response f calibrated in such a way that allows the experiment to be captured as long as there is an excess of food availability for zero variate data in particular constant conditions of unlimited food i e f 1 are generally assumed however changes in food density over time might explain the reductions in measured body weights compared with the modelled weights at later time points in the experiments conducted by neuhauser et al 1980a particularly observed in activated sludge treatments and at lower population densities fig 1a b although the model fits the growth data of presley et al 1996 well fig 1c the cumulative number of cocoons produced during this experiment is either under or over predicted depending on the assumption made about the number of offspring one or two borne by a single cocoon fig 1d only whole individuals can be produced in general cocoon production as well as the number of offspring per cocoon can vary considerably amongst studies depending on food conditions and temperature for an overview see domínguez 2004 using activated sludge as a food source loehr et al 1985 demonstrated that e fetida may produce on average around two cocoons per week at 20 c while hartenstein et al 1979 reported the production of up to five cocoons per week at 25 c assuming that each cocoon may bear up to six juvenile worms hartenstein et al 1979 the maximum reproductive rates would be 1 71 20 c and 4 29 25 c per day at lower food levels the number can be as low as one individual per cocoon but higher numbers have also been observed venter and reinecke 1988 in addition reproductive output can vary during the life time of an individual hartenstein et al 1979 however an average number of 1 5 individuals per cocoon would fit well with the reproduction data from presley et al 1996 in their study neuhauser et al 1980a observed that individual growth rates and maximum wet weights decreased with increasing constant population sizes used in the experimental setups as food was initially abundant in this experiment only considering competition for food in our model would not account for the initial slower growth of worms at higher population densities compared with lower ones rather an assumption of lower ingestion rates as a result of crowding could explain the observed growth patterns fig 1b a similar crowding effect has previously been suggested for aquatic systems gergs et al 2014 the predictions for feeding rates in this experiment suggest that depending on the population density the food that was initially provided became depleted between days 100 and 150 for a verification of the feeding module see fig 1e the late individual weight gain in the population density experiment fig 1b may suggest that some resources become available or are produced later in the experiment neuhauser et al 1980b as well as flack and hartenstein 1984 demonstrated that e fetida is able to gain weight using a range of microorganisms including bacteria fungi and protozoa offered experimentally as food sources however this observation as well as the late weight loss for the small population setup fig 1b black dots was not considered in this model fitting exercise the growth data by presley et al 1996 and neuhauser et al 1980a is generally well fitted by the van bertalanffy growth curve of the standard deb model which is based on a constant value for the parameter kappa the kappa rule has its origin in the maturation concept and the continued growth at the onset of reproduction if value of kappa and the food conditions are constant for a detailed discussion of the concept see kooijman 2010 in contrast assuming that beyond puberty kappa is decreased or reproduction is prioritised over growth would lead to a decline in growth at limiting food conditions this behaviour is not observed in these studies e g fig 1 c and d but follows the van bertalanffy trajectory in our model we assumed that in the absence of food the worms lose weight due to the depletion of their reserve which is considered to contribute to the body weight if shrinking in structural length below the non growth boundary eq 7 is not allowed in the model weight loss upon starvation will continue until the structural mass is reached fig 1f dashed line as revealed by this simulation the model parameterisation suggests that in e fetida the reserve contributes considerably to the total mass presumably to an extent that is not realistic however the weight loss modelled in this way is too fast and we thus assumed that during the course of reserve depletion the reserve volume is partially replaced by water a model that describes the measured data well fig 1f solid line this reserve replacement assumption might generally be supported by the observation that loss in wet weight is slower at high moisture levels compared with low moisture conditions reinecke and venter 1987 further evidence for this hypothesis may come from future trials that measure dry weights under starvation conditions 3 2 model predictions the parameterised model reasonably predicts individual growth and reproduction for experiments with populations of worms and periodic and sporadic food additions fig 2 in particular the growth in the periodic food scenario fig 2a and the difference in the reproductive rates between the two food scenarios is well captured fig 2b d however the accuracy of the model predictions depends on a number of assumptions the small modelled increase in body weight initially in the experiment fig 2 a and c is due to the reserve density carried over from the culture conditions which is probably too high as discussed above the reproductive rates in the experiments are either under predicted or over predicted depending on the assumed cocoon occupancy fig 2 b d in the sporadic food experiment by reinecke and viljoen 1990 measured individual wet weights declined over time and increased again after food was added to the system while the modelled growth patterns are generally in line with the data for this scenario the predicted body weights are too high when it is assumed that shrinking below the non growth boundary is not possible fig 2c dashed line in contrast if negative growth is allowed eq 9 which means that the animal will sacrifice structure to maintain bodily functions the initial rate of weight loss is too high when compared to the data but captures the second phase of weight loss well however the implicit assumption of this strategy that the energy needed to build a unit of structure is fully recouped when it is used to pay maintenance costs is unrealistic as it stands the two metabolic strategies tested here probably represent two extreme cases of possible adaptations to starvation conditions also sequential combinations of different options are conceivable e g after the reserve is depleted energy is obtained from bodily structures with a certain efficiency to cover maintenance costs further starvation options may include the possibility of decreasing somatic maintenance costs changing energy mobilisation to fulfil somatic maintenance by changing the value of kappa or taking energy from the reproduction buffer which is only possible in adults augustine et al 2012 gergs and jager 2014 testing these different starvation rules would however in addition to reproduction data require the measurement of dry weights through starvation periods or information on moisture conditions when recording wet weights when assuming that the reserve replacement assumption is realistic see discussion above as well as more detailed information on the culture conditions are needed that trigger individual performance during the initial experimental phases for the periodic food scenario examined by reinecke and viljoen 1990 the simulated growth of an individually cultured worm fig 2a grey dashed line is close to the growth trajectory observed for conditions where cow manure was provided ad libitum fig 1a white dots the lower modelled individual growth of worms in a population of ten compared to individually kept worms suggests that the reduced growth 2a and reproduction 2b were the result of food competition and crowding as these are the only population level interactions implemented in the model the extended applicability of the model to the population level would require data of multi generations which was not tested in this study as our model is largely parameterised based on data derived from experiments with individual worms a change in the energy allocation that prioritises reproduction over growth by changing the parameter к as suggested by johnston et al 2014a would lead to greater reproduction compared with the simulation results shown in fig 2b the opposite strategy i e increased growth and reduced reproduction in response to food shortage has previously been suggested for daphnids gergs et al 2014 in contrast here maintaining the kappa rule of the standard deb model describes the data well which supports the first of our alternative assumptions i e reduced growth in the presence of conspecifics is a matter of competition and crowding one of the criticisms of johnston et al 2014a regarding the validity of the deb model or more specifically the kappa rule was that the deb model would wrongly predict no reproduction during phases of weight loss which the authors interpreted as shrinking due to starvation in contrast we here explicitly consider the organism s reserve as part of its weight as a consequence after food depletion the organism initially loses weight as a result of reserve utilisation to continue growth in terms of structure and reproduction in prolonged periods without any food availability and after the reserve has dropped below the non growth boundary the organism is considered to be starving and may shrink in structural length based on these assumptions the parameterised standard deb model predicts that e fetida individuals will continue to reproduce during periods of weight loss although the reproductive rate declines over time fig 2c and d which is in line with empirical observations by reinecke and viljoen 1990 the modelled rates are somewhat higher in the model compared to data though this pattern in both data and model simulations supports our second alternative assumption that weight loss under limited feeding conditions might to some extent be due to the utilisation of the reserve which contributes to the mass and that use of the reserve allows continued reproduction in the absence of food 3 3 conclusion the standard deb model is able to reproduce e fetida observed growth and reproduction under variable feeding regimes more specifically it predicts the initial continuation of reproduction during periods of weight loss when the reserve is being depleted which follows from the concurrence of mass and energy integrating the deb model with an ibm framework allows the simulation of population level interactions and of the individual level consequences our ibm simulations suggest that the kappa rule of the standard deb model which states that a fixed fraction of the assimilated reserve is allocated to structure can be maintained by the worms in the presence of conspecifics the reduced individual growth rate might be the result of competition which is a fundamental principle of ecology rather than due to changes in energy allocation the quantitative predictions for situations of food limitation however depend on specific assumptions for the starvation rules which require further investigation and tailored experimental test designs the applicability of this approach for other earthworm species could be tested in future credit authorship contribution statement kim j rakel writing original draft writing review editing thomas g preuss

24782,since they were listed under the u s endangered species act of 1973 snake river spring summer chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha have been the subject of numerous population viability analyses pvas in all of the previous pvas that we are aware of management actions to improve the species status have focused on increasing survival rates of juveniles and adults these pvas did not explicitly treat carry capacity instead they assumed that survival rate improvements increased intrinsic productivity and implicitly assumed that this would also increase carrying capacity in a novel alternative approach we instead examined how carrying capacity itself was related to extinction risk we estimated three alternative multi population pvas using maximum likelihood estimation and chose the model with the best fit to the spawner recruit data from 26 populations in the snake river spring summer chinook salmon evolutionarily significant unit we then estimated carrying capacity and 24 year extinction probability for each of these populations using alternative quasi extinction thresholds we found that carrying capacities estimates were low in several of the populations and that extinction probability increases sharply with decreasing carrying capacity a sensitivity analysis with fixed carrying capacities and increasing intrinsic productivity illustrated that unless actions increase carrying capacity little change in extinction risk can occur keywords fish population model pacific salmon stochastic simulation model population viability analysis carrying capacity 1 introduction snake river basin spring summer srss chinook salmon populations were listed under the u s endangered species act of 1973 esa in the early 1990s noaa 1992 they have since been the focus of both esa related litigation and numerous management actions designed to increase life stage survival rates and adult abundance bpa 2017 these populations fig 1 face a wide variety of problems harvest rates from the 1950s to the late 1960s were often greater than 50 percent but this has been substantially reduced in recent years wdfw 1996 as dams were constructed on the columbia and snake rivers in the 1960s and 1970s the abundance of the spawning population declined fig 2 in part due to dam construction and operation concurrent with poor ocean survival nrc 1996 major efforts have been made since the 1970s to increase juvenile downstream passage and adult upstream passage survival rate spawning and rearing habitat has been degraded by logging mining and grazing isab 2015 but tributary habitat restoration has been shown to increase juvenile parr to smolt survival rate paulsen and fisher 2005 common to most of these actions to aid the populations decreasing harvest increasing adult and juvenile hydrosystem survival rates and increasing juvenile survival rate during tributary rearing is the emphasis on increasing survival rates as opposed to increasing carrying capacity we define carrying capacity as the equilibrium spawners which is equal to the number of spawners at which recruitment of adult spawners in the next generation equals spawners hilborn and walters 1992 this definition is the classical ecological concept of carrying capacity vandermeer 1969 others define carrying capacity as an environment s maximum load which is equal to the population size that a particular habitat can support without being permanently damaged odum 1989 hui 2006 in salmon modeling efforts dating to the early 2000s analysts such as karieva et al 2000 explicitly assumed that carrying capacity did not constrain population growth rates this same assumption has been carried forward in more recent analyses noaa 2013 in fact growth rate is unconstrained by carrying capacity whenever the underlying dynamic model is linear while this assumption may have been plausible when spawning numbers were low it has become more tenuous as numbers have increased over the past two decades fig 2 linear models have also been used for salmon populations outside of the columbia basin as well e g botsford and brittnacher 1998 see sweka and wainwright 2014 for a review of models used for population viability analysis pva for salmon in analyses since 2000 others have noted that density dependence is likely to constrain srss chinook salmon abundance achord et al 2003 crozier et al 2008 for example zabel et al 2006 noted that t he density dependent parameter associated with freshwater recruitment was consistently the most important suggesting that increasing juvenile carrying capacity is important for recovery the regional independent scientific advisory board in isab 2015 concluded that m any salmon populations throughout the interior of the columbia river basin are experiencing reduced productivity associated with recent increases in natural spawning abundance even though current abundance remains far below historical levels density dependence is now evident in most of the esa listed populations examined and appears strong enough to constrain their recovery in zabel et al 2006 and isab 2015 strength of density dependence is a measure of the size of the density dependent parameter in the spawner recruit models an exception to recent studies that show density dependence in the ssrs chinook salmon is bal et al 2018 which concluded that there was a linear relationship between parents and offspring carrying capacity is inherent in any population model that includes density dependence e g ricker or beverton holt furthermore extinction risk is closely related to carrying capacity hakoyama et al 2000 hilderbrand 2003 lande et al 2003 this occurs because as carrying capacity declines population numbers also decline making it more likely that a population will fall below a quasi extinction threshold by chance using a simple density dependent model density independent growth to a ceiling carrying capacity lande 1993 shows how time to extinction increases with carrying capacity under various assumptions about the population growth rate and forms stochasticity thus when modeling extinction risk it is important to estimate carrying capacity as a corollary it is useful to evaluate how alternative management actions influence carrying capacity fig 3 linear and nonlinear density dependent dynamical models of extinction probability are also seen outside of the salmon literature decades ago several authors discovered that stochastic linear models could be well approximated by a diffusion process lande and orzack 1988 dennis et al 1991 took advantage of this finding to estimate extinction probabilities for whooping crane grus americana grizzly bear ursus arctos horribilis in yellowstone kirtland s warbler setophaga kirtlandii california condor gymnogyps californianus puerto rican parrot amazona vittata palila loxioides balleui and laysan finch telespyza cantans extinction probability using the diffusion approximation model is attractive because it depends on two estimated model parameters and detailed age structure information is not needed dennis et al 1991 henle et al 2004 provided a review of the role of density dependent models in extinction processes and population viability analysis they identified 32 different approaches to modeling density dependence and 68 of the 247 studies they examined included density dependence for example density dependent models were applied to the helmeted honeyeater lichenostomus melanops cassidix akçakaya et al 1995 and sage grouse centrocercus spp lamontagne et al 2002 the aim of this study is to understand how carrying capacity influences extinction risk of srss chinook salmon populations we demonstrate how to model survival rate changes in life cycle model predictions with alternative assumptions about how these survival rate changes influence carrying capacity allowing alternative assumptions for carrying capacity versus survival rate represents a novel modeling approach for estimating the influence of survival rate increases on the population dynamics of endangered populations several past modeling efforts including our own have failed to take into account that survival rate changes may have no influence on carrying capacity and it is important to understand why this has occurred and how to correct it 2 materials and methods 2 1 population data population data for 26 srss chinook salmon populations in the snake river were retrieved from the salmon population summary database at http www webapps nwfsc noaa gov sps accessed 5 march 2020 the data we used spanned 1978 2014 consisting of estimates of adult spawner abundance including hatchery strays if any age at return for the spawning population and recruits adult progeny of the spawners back to the spawning grounds for each population although estimates were available for earlier years the 1978 starting point was used to represent current conditions after dam construction on the snake was completed in the mid 1970s 2 2 population models we evaluated the use of three different forms of density dependent population growth gompertz beverton holt and ricker models hilborn and walters 1992 dennis et al 2006 the gompertz model which is not as commonly used to model fish populations as the beverton holt and ricker was employed in a study of california coastal steelhead boughton et al 2007 we chose the model with the best fit in terms of the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 for simplicity we present the methods using the gompertz population growth model but we explain below how to modify the equations to use either the ricker or the beverton holt models instead our multi population model takes the mathematical form 1a r i t s i t exp a i b i log s i t α t ε i t gompertz where r i t is recruitment natural origin adult progeny of fish from population i spawning in year t s i t represents the number of spawners from population i in brood year t ai is the intrinsic productivity for population i which is the maximum log recruits per spawner bi is the parameter that describes density dependent growth for population i α t is a common year effect for all populations in year t and ɛ i t is a normally distributed error term with mean zero and variance σ 2 the estimated parameters are ai bi α t one for each brood year and σ 2 the ricker model and the beverton holt models are given by 1b r i t s i t exp a i b i s i t α t ε i t ricker and 1c r i t s i t exp a i log 1 b i s i t α t ε i t beverton holt with similar definitions for the parameters and error terms parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood mood et al 1974 2 3 carrying capacity estimation carrying capacity is defined as equilibrium spawner abundance the spawner abundance at which the number of spawners is equal to the number of recruits for the life cycle models presented estimates of carrying capacity for population i are given by 2a k i exp a i b i gompertz 2b k i a i b i ricker and 2c k i exp a i 1 b i beverton holt where a i and b i are the maximum likelihood estimates of parameters ai and bi for population i confidence intervals were developed for carrying capacity estimates by using the delta method seber 1982 2 4 extinction probability estimation once the maximum likelihood estimates were obtained they were then used to estimate probabilities of extinction by setting the estimated parameters equal to their maximum likelihood estimates then projecting forward each population in each n 5 000 population simulations a 24 year sequence of future spawners was generated to do this the spawner series was initialized then the stochastic production function was used to build a series of future spawners by allocating recruits to the appropriate spawners in the projections age structure was set to the average age structure from 1978 to the most recently available the extinction probability was estimated as the fraction of the 5 000 sequences in which spawners fell below the quasi extinction threshold qet for four consecutive years extinction probability estimates were obtained using alternative values of qet 1 10 30 and 50 and with a time horizon of 24 years we also incorporated reproductive failure thresholds rfts developed by the interior columbia river technical recovery team ictrt interior columbia technical recovery team 2007 if during a population projection the total number of spawners fell below rft 10 then number of recruits was set to zero whenever qet 1 a reproductive failure threshold of 2 spawners was used instead of 10 spawners we used a range of qet values because uncertainty in the effective population size can influence the appropriate choice of qet waples 2002 it is well known that populations with low numbers have increased risk of extinction due to genetic effects and increased demographic stochasticity lande 1993 akçakaya 2000 that is why we consider values of qet and rft above their theoretical minimums of 1 and 2 respectively extinction probability is known to be influenced by autocorrelation in the noise of a population model wichmann et al 2005 the noise in the population models above is the common year effects the residual error autocorrelation in the noise is preserved by using a block bootstrap procedure with fixed block size 4 applied to the time series of estimated common year

projections were initialized by setting the first maxage spawner numbers in the sequence equal to the most recently available maxage spawner observations age distributions for the projections are the average age at return from historical estimates parametric bootstrapping was used to construct confidence intervals for extinction probabilities efron and tibshirani 1993 bootstrapping proceeded by building an empirical distribution of b 1 000 bootstrap replications of an extinction probability estimate then using the 0 025 and 0 975 quantiles of the distribution as confidence limits bootstrap replications of the maximum likelihood parameter estimates were obtained by sampling from a multivariate normal distribution with mean equal to the mles and covariance matrix equal to the inverse of the observed fisher information matrix this approach preserves the covariance among parameter estimates a draw from the residual errors was obtained by drawing from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance equal to the bootstrap sample of σ 2 populations were projected forward by using these bootstrap draws of the parameters in eqs 3 4 extinction probability was then evaluated at each of these bootstrapped parameter draws thus yielding a set of b 1 000 bootstrap replications of extinction probability the procedures for estimating extinction probabilities using ricker and beverton holt models are similar to that of using the gompertz model the only difference being the model function employed in eq 3 2 5 extinction probability vs model parameters to gauge the influence of model parameters ai bi and ki on extinction risk we plot estimated extinction risk against the estimates of each of these parameters this allowed us to determine which of these parameters was most important in determining extinction risk 2 6 survival rate increase sensitivity analysis in this model exercise we allow an increase in survival rate to increase the density independent parameter ai to a i log 1 25 representing a survival rate increase of 25 with this increase in survival rate carrying capacity is modeled in two different ways 1 bi remains constant and carrying capacity increases with ai according to eqs 2a c and 2 carrying capacity remains constant to gauge the influence of these alternative carrying capacity assumptions on extinction probability we plot the new population specific extinction probabilities against the original extinction probabilities with no hypothetical increase in survival rate to show the influence of carrying capacity on extinction probability for each population we plot its extinction probability estimate against its carrying capacity estimate 3 results 3 1 model fits to data the gompertz model had the lowest aic of the three models explored table 1 the beverton holt model had the second best aic value and the ricker model the worst therefore the subsequent model results are primarily based on the gompertz model we also compare selected gompertz model results to their ricker and beverton holt analogs 3 2 model specific extinction probabilities the extinction probability estimates were highly correlated between the three alternative lifecycle models gompertz beverton holt and ricker table 2 the gompertz and beverton holt extinction probability estimates showed the greatest correlation r 0 99 with n 26 populations 3 3 extinction probability vs model parameters extinction probability estimates varied strongly with carrying capacity estimates but there was poor correspondence between extinction risk estimates and the other model parameter estimates a i and b i fig 4 predicted extinction risk declines sharply with increasing carrying capacity and levels off near zero when carrying capacity approaches 200 spawners a graph of the ranks of extinction probability estimates and carrying capacity estimates shows a close correspondence with a coefficient of determination equal to 94 fig 5 table 3 displays details of the estimated extinction risk for each of the 26 populations note that for two populations middle fork salmon lower mainstem and the tucannon river the lower 95th percentile of carrying capacity is very small and includes zero for the tucannon the middle fork data was often missing in years when no spawning surveys were done and the tucannon has a high proportion of hatchery spawners which may influence the estimates low estimates of carrying capacity are clearly associated with higher extinction risk table 3 fig 4 3 4 survival rate increase sensitivity analysis extinction probability estimates decreased when both the a parameter and carrying capacity were allowed to change as survival rate increased by 25 however when the a parameter increased and carrying capacity was held fixed no decrease in extinction probability was evident fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 past focus on intrinsic productivity given the findings of isab 2015 and others that density dependence limits population recovery one might expect both models and management actions to focus on increasing carrying capacity and associated models to capture such population dynamics however the majority of actions and simulations have instead targeted survival rates such as harvest reductions increasing survival rates for juveniles and adults in the hydrosystem noaa 2013 our own paper paulsen and hinrichsen 2002 is an example of focusing on survival rate increases while ignoring carrying capacity in paulsen and hinrichsen 2002 we used a ricker model for a subset of the populations used in the current analysis to illustrate how population dynamics might change as a result of deliberate management experiments in that analysis we analyzed actions that increased survival rate and hence the a parameter in the model log r s a bs where r denoted adult recruits s adult spawners and a and b were the density independent and density dependent parameters respectively that was also the approach used in peters and marmorek 2001 for the same populations in these earlier approaches which used the a and b parameterization instead of the a and k parameterization increasing a also increased carrying capacity as in eq 2b thus any hypothetical action that increased the a parameter also increased carrying capacity even for actions like increasing downstream migrant survival that could not possibly alter for example the number of juveniles that the tributary habitat could support perhaps a better parameterization would have been log r s a 1 s k in which a would be allowed to increase with increases in survival rate but carrying capacity k would stay fixed another benefit to this alternative parameterization is that a parameters a and k are known to be less correlated than the parameters a and b 4 2 thought experiment we demonstrate with a simple thought experiment why increases in survival rates do not guarantee an increase in carrying capacity imagine that a pond holds 100 m3 of water and that each adult fish in the pond requires 1 m3 of space and that there are exactly 100 adults in the pond carrying capacity suppose also that the juvenile to adult survival rate is 10 at 100 adults and this survival rate is increased to 20 this increase in survival rate will be nullified because the pond can only hold 100 adults and it is already at 100 the maximum number of adults which is also the equilibrium carrying capacity thus there really is no guarantee that an increase in survival rate will result in a change in equilibrium carrying capacity this demonstrates what happens whenever a population s equilibrium carrying capacity coincides with its habitat s maximum load increasing a survival rate from an earlier stage will leave carrying capacity unchanged 4 3 what is limiting carrying capacity while the overall levels of spawner abundance are perhaps half what they were in the 1960s fig 2 roughly two thirds of the populations have low predicted probability of extinction table 3 given that all of these populations are thought to have similar patterns of downstream ocean and upstream migration and survival zabel et al 2006 what differentiates the tributary habitat the only remaining candidate of the populations with high extinction risk from the rest in isolation single stage life cycle models like those we employed cannot pinpoint the life stage s where density dependence occurs however a recent study suggests that density dependence bottle necks occur between tributary spawning and emigration as juveniles walters et al 2013 using juvenile data from a subset of the same populations in idaho concluded that t he ubiquity of density dependence for these threatened populations is alarming as stability at present low abundance levels suggests recovery may be difficult without major changes if this conclusion is correct then efforts to increase survival rates outside the tributaries are unlikely to substantially affect the probability of extinction for depleted populations 4 4 sources of stochasticity extinction probability is known to depend on different sources of stochasticity lande 1993 this paper has focused on environmental stochasticity which arises from a series of small or moderate random environmental perturbation that similarly influence the birth and death rates of individuals may 1974 demographic stochasticity is caused by chance realizations of individual probabilities of death and reproduction in a population because demographic stochasticity is only important for very low population numbers we use qet as a way of incorporating its effects on extinction risk morris and doak 2003 parentage based tagging studies of salmon populations may make it possible to track the individual contributions to future spawners thus allowing direct modeling of demographic stochasticity steele et al 2019 catastrophes or bonanzas are large environmental perturbations that cause large sudden changes in population size similar to environmental stochasticity catastrophes and bonanzas are important for populations of all sizes however because they are rare random events catastrophes and bonanzas are difficult to include in a population viability analysis in a defensible way even though they may be cause of concern for many species morris and doak 2003 4 5 future work future work on carrying capacity should consider carrying capacity as a function of environmental covariates a previous modeling effort for another subset of the same populations described juvenile rearing survival rate as a function of temperature and flow crozier and zabel 2006 crozier et al 2008 this allowed the researchers to predict extinction risk and abundance under different climate change scenarios formulating carrying capacity as a function of past climate indicators is also possible kaeriyama et al 2009 found a significant positive correlation between the carrying capacity k of three species sockeye chum and pink salmon defined as the equilibrium of ricker s recruitment curve and the aleutian low pressure index they concluded that carrying capacity was synchronous with long term trends in climate change there are multiple factors in different salmon habitats that influence survival rates and reproduction in different ways nrc 1996 these factors are at work on the entire salmon life cycle spawning grounds rearing areas migration corridors and ocean the goal of future work is to identify where the important population bottlenecks occur actions that do not address these bottlenecks will fail because they will deliver more fish into a habitat that does not support the increase in fish numbers use of extinction risk estimates has received much criticism mainly because of its poor statistical properties ludwig 1999 fieberg and ellner 2000 sweka and wainwright 2014 the main statistical defect is that length of abundance time series required for precise and accurate estimation of extinction risk is almost always much greater than what is available fieberg and ellner 2000 and much longer than what is available for the srss chinook salmon populations used here since we found carrying capacity to be closely associated with extinction risk and it does not suffer from poor precision except in the case of the tucannon river population it may turn out that carrying capacity is a better gauge of risk than extinction probability 5 conclusions there are two main conclusions from our work first extinction risk corresponds closely with carrying capacity and second one cannot expect management actions to decrease extinction risk if they do not increase carrying capacity carrying capacity and its relationship to extinction risk have been overlooked for columbia basin salmonids earlier modeling efforts which focused on increasing survival rate sometimes inadvertently incorporated increased carrying capacity in their predictions combined with management strategies aimed at survival rate increases e g harvest reduction hydrosystem management and tributary actions both modelers and managers have assumed that carrying capacity was sufficiently high that changing it would not influence extinction predictions however as we have shown here this assumption does not hold for about a third of the populations we analyzed table 3 fig 6 actions that increase carrying capacity will be needed to reduce extinction risk and they may be very different from those that have been pursued since the srss esu was listed under the esa over 25 years ago credit author statement richard hinrichsen

24782,since they were listed under the u s endangered species act of 1973 snake river spring summer chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha have been the subject of numerous population viability analyses pvas in all of the previous pvas that we are aware of management actions to improve the species status have focused on increasing survival rates of juveniles and adults these pvas did not explicitly treat carry capacity instead they assumed that survival rate improvements increased intrinsic productivity and implicitly assumed that this would also increase carrying capacity in a novel alternative approach we instead examined how carrying capacity itself was related to extinction risk we estimated three alternative multi population pvas using maximum likelihood estimation and chose the model with the best fit to the spawner recruit data from 26 populations in the snake river spring summer chinook salmon evolutionarily significant unit we then estimated carrying capacity and 24 year extinction probability for each of these populations using alternative quasi extinction thresholds we found that carrying capacities estimates were low in several of the populations and that extinction probability increases sharply with decreasing carrying capacity a sensitivity analysis with fixed carrying capacities and increasing intrinsic productivity illustrated that unless actions increase carrying capacity little change in extinction risk can occur keywords fish population model pacific salmon stochastic simulation model population viability analysis carrying capacity 1 introduction snake river basin spring summer srss chinook salmon populations were listed under the u s endangered species act of 1973 esa in the early 1990s noaa 1992 they have since been the focus of both esa related litigation and numerous management actions designed to increase life stage survival rates and adult abundance bpa 2017 these populations fig 1 face a wide variety of problems harvest rates from the 1950s to the late 1960s were often greater than 50 percent but this has been substantially reduced in recent years wdfw 1996 as dams were constructed on the columbia and snake rivers in the 1960s and 1970s the abundance of the spawning population declined fig 2 in part due to dam construction and operation concurrent with poor ocean survival nrc 1996 major efforts have been made since the 1970s to increase juvenile downstream passage and adult upstream passage survival rate spawning and rearing habitat has been degraded by logging mining and grazing isab 2015 but tributary habitat restoration has been shown to increase juvenile parr to smolt survival rate paulsen and fisher 2005 common to most of these actions to aid the populations decreasing harvest increasing adult and juvenile hydrosystem survival rates and increasing juvenile survival rate during tributary rearing is the emphasis on increasing survival rates as opposed to increasing carrying capacity we define carrying capacity as the equilibrium spawners which is equal to the number of spawners at which recruitment of adult spawners in the next generation equals spawners hilborn and walters 1992 this definition is the classical ecological concept of carrying capacity vandermeer 1969 others define carrying capacity as an environment s maximum load which is equal to the population size that a particular habitat can support without being permanently damaged odum 1989 hui 2006 in salmon modeling efforts dating to the early 2000s analysts such as karieva et al 2000 explicitly assumed that carrying capacity did not constrain population growth rates this same assumption has been carried forward in more recent analyses noaa 2013 in fact growth rate is unconstrained by carrying capacity whenever the underlying dynamic model is linear while this assumption may have been plausible when spawning numbers were low it has become more tenuous as numbers have increased over the past two decades fig 2 linear models have also been used for salmon populations outside of the columbia basin as well e g botsford and brittnacher 1998 see sweka and wainwright 2014 for a review of models used for population viability analysis pva for salmon in analyses since 2000 others have noted that density dependence is likely to constrain srss chinook salmon abundance achord et al 2003 crozier et al 2008 for example zabel et al 2006 noted that t he density dependent parameter associated with freshwater recruitment was consistently the most important suggesting that increasing juvenile carrying capacity is important for recovery the regional independent scientific advisory board in isab 2015 concluded that m any salmon populations throughout the interior of the columbia river basin are experiencing reduced productivity associated with recent increases in natural spawning abundance even though current abundance remains far below historical levels density dependence is now evident in most of the esa listed populations examined and appears strong enough to constrain their recovery in zabel et al 2006 and isab 2015 strength of density dependence is a measure of the size of the density dependent parameter in the spawner recruit models an exception to recent studies that show density dependence in the ssrs chinook salmon is bal et al 2018 which concluded that there was a linear relationship between parents and offspring carrying capacity is inherent in any population model that includes density dependence e g ricker or beverton holt furthermore extinction risk is closely related to carrying capacity hakoyama et al 2000 hilderbrand 2003 lande et al 2003 this occurs because as carrying capacity declines population numbers also decline making it more likely that a population will fall below a quasi extinction threshold by chance using a simple density dependent model density independent growth to a ceiling carrying capacity lande 1993 shows how time to extinction increases with carrying capacity under various assumptions about the population growth rate and forms stochasticity thus when modeling extinction risk it is important to estimate carrying capacity as a corollary it is useful to evaluate how alternative management actions influence carrying capacity fig 3 linear and nonlinear density dependent dynamical models of extinction probability are also seen outside of the salmon literature decades ago several authors discovered that stochastic linear models could be well approximated by a diffusion process lande and orzack 1988 dennis et al 1991 took advantage of this finding to estimate extinction probabilities for whooping crane grus americana grizzly bear ursus arctos horribilis in yellowstone kirtland s warbler setophaga kirtlandii california condor gymnogyps californianus puerto rican parrot amazona vittata palila loxioides balleui and laysan finch telespyza cantans extinction probability using the diffusion approximation model is attractive because it depends on two estimated model parameters and detailed age structure information is not needed dennis et al 1991 henle et al 2004 provided a review of the role of density dependent models in extinction processes and population viability analysis they identified 32 different approaches to modeling density dependence and 68 of the 247 studies they examined included density dependence for example density dependent models were applied to the helmeted honeyeater lichenostomus melanops cassidix akçakaya et al 1995 and sage grouse centrocercus spp lamontagne et al 2002 the aim of this study is to understand how carrying capacity influences extinction risk of srss chinook salmon populations we demonstrate how to model survival rate changes in life cycle model predictions with alternative assumptions about how these survival rate changes influence carrying capacity allowing alternative assumptions for carrying capacity versus survival rate represents a novel modeling approach for estimating the influence of survival rate increases on the population dynamics of endangered populations several past modeling efforts including our own have failed to take into account that survival rate changes may have no influence on carrying capacity and it is important to understand why this has occurred and how to correct it 2 materials and methods 2 1 population data population data for 26 srss chinook salmon populations in the snake river were retrieved from the salmon population summary database at http www webapps nwfsc noaa gov sps accessed 5 march 2020 the data we used spanned 1978 2014 consisting of estimates of adult spawner abundance including hatchery strays if any age at return for the spawning population and recruits adult progeny of the spawners back to the spawning grounds for each population although estimates were available for earlier years the 1978 starting point was used to represent current conditions after dam construction on the snake was completed in the mid 1970s 2 2 population models we evaluated the use of three different forms of density dependent population growth gompertz beverton holt and ricker models hilborn and walters 1992 dennis et al 2006 the gompertz model which is not as commonly used to model fish populations as the beverton holt and ricker was employed in a study of california coastal steelhead boughton et al 2007 we chose the model with the best fit in terms of the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 for simplicity we present the methods using the gompertz population growth model but we explain below how to modify the equations to use either the ricker or the beverton holt models instead our multi population model takes the mathematical form 1a r i t s i t exp a i b i log s i t α t ε i t gompertz where r i t is recruitment natural origin adult progeny of fish from population i spawning in year t s i t represents the number of spawners from population i in brood year t ai is the intrinsic productivity for population i which is the maximum log recruits per spawner bi is the parameter that describes density dependent growth for population i α t is a common year effect for all populations in year t and ɛ i t is a normally distributed error term with mean zero and variance σ 2 the estimated parameters are ai bi α t one for each brood year and σ 2 the ricker model and the beverton holt models are given by 1b r i t s i t exp a i b i s i t α t ε i t ricker and 1c r i t s i t exp a i log 1 b i s i t α t ε i t beverton holt with similar definitions for the parameters and error terms parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood mood et al 1974 2 3 carrying capacity estimation carrying capacity is defined as equilibrium spawner abundance the spawner abundance at which the number of spawners is equal to the number of recruits for the life cycle models presented estimates of carrying capacity for population i are given by 2a k i exp a i b i gompertz 2b k i a i b i ricker and 2c k i exp a i 1 b i beverton holt where a i and b i are the maximum likelihood estimates of parameters ai and bi for population i confidence intervals were developed for carrying capacity estimates by using the delta method seber 1982 2 4 extinction probability estimation once the maximum likelihood estimates were obtained they were then used to estimate probabilities of extinction by setting the estimated parameters equal to their maximum likelihood estimates then projecting forward each population in each n 5 000 population simulations a 24 year sequence of future spawners was generated to do this the spawner series was initialized then the stochastic production function was used to build a series of future spawners by allocating recruits to the appropriate spawners in the projections age structure was set to the average age structure from 1978 to the most recently available the extinction probability was estimated as the fraction of the 5 000 sequences in which spawners fell below the quasi extinction threshold qet for four consecutive years extinction probability estimates were obtained using alternative values of qet 1 10 30 and 50 and with a time horizon of 24 years we also incorporated reproductive failure thresholds rfts developed by the interior columbia river technical recovery team ictrt interior columbia technical recovery team 2007 if during a population projection the total number of spawners fell below rft 10 then number of recruits was set to zero whenever qet 1 a reproductive failure threshold of 2 spawners was used instead of 10 spawners we used a range of qet values because uncertainty in the effective population size can influence the appropriate choice of qet waples 2002 it is well known that populations with low numbers have increased risk of extinction due to genetic effects and increased demographic stochasticity lande 1993 akçakaya 2000 that is why we consider values of qet and rft above their theoretical minimums of 1 and 2 respectively extinction probability is known to be influenced by autocorrelation in the noise of a population model wichmann et al 2005 the noise in the population models above is the common year effects the residual error autocorrelation in the noise is preserved by using a block bootstrap procedure with fixed block size 4 applied to the time series of estimated common year

represented a random draw from a gaussian white noise process with variance σ 2 τ represented age of returning adults and p τ represented the average fraction of adults returning at age τ the projections were initialized by setting the first maxage spawner numbers in the sequence equal to the most recently available maxage spawner observations age distributions for the projections are the average age at return from historical estimates parametric bootstrapping was used to construct confidence intervals for extinction probabilities efron and tibshirani 1993 bootstrapping proceeded by building an empirical distribution of b 1 000 bootstrap replications of an extinction probability estimate then using the 0 025 and 0 975 quantiles of the distribution as confidence limits bootstrap replications of the maximum likelihood parameter estimates were obtained by sampling from a multivariate normal distribution with mean equal to the mles and covariance matrix equal to the inverse of the observed fisher information matrix this approach preserves the covariance among parameter estimates a draw from the residual errors was obtained by drawing from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance equal to the bootstrap sample of σ 2 populations were projected forward by using these bootstrap draws of the parameters in eqs 3 4 extinction probability was then evaluated at each of these bootstrapped parameter draws thus yielding a set of b 1 000 bootstrap replications of extinction probability the procedures for estimating extinction probabilities using ricker and beverton

more fish into a habitat that does not support the increase in fish numbers use of extinction risk estimates has received much criticism mainly because of its poor statistical properties ludwig 1999 fieberg and ellner 2000 sweka and wainwright 2014 the main statistical defect is that length of abundance time series required for precise and accurate estimation of extinction risk is almost always much greater than what is available fieberg and ellner 2000 and much longer than what is available for the srss chinook salmon populations used here since we found carrying capacity to be closely associated with extinction risk and it does not suffer from poor precision except in the case of the tucannon river population it may turn out that carrying capacity is a better gauge of risk than extinction probability 5 conclusions there are two main conclusions from our work first extinction risk corresponds closely with carrying capacity and second one cannot expect management actions to decrease extinction risk if they do not increase carrying capacity carrying capacity and its relationship to extinction risk have been overlooked for columbia basin salmonids earlier modeling efforts which focused on increasing survival rate sometimes inadvertently incorporated increased carrying capacity in their predictions combined with management strategies aimed at survival rate increases e g harvest reduction hydrosystem management and tributary actions both modelers and managers have assumed that carrying capacity was sufficiently high that changing it would not influence extinction predictions however as we have shown here this assumption does not hold for about a third of the populations we analyzed table 3 fig 6 actions that increase carrying capacity will be needed to reduce extinction risk and they may be very different from those that have been pursued since the srss esu was listed under the esa over 25 years ago credit author statement richard hinrichsen

24783,the box tree moth cydalima perspectalis is an invasive insect that has rapidly colonised europe damaging to natural and ornamental box trees in its native habitat in china the number of generations per year is variable but the number of generations observed in european climates remained unclear this is a key issue for understanding the rapid increase in population size and range and for optimising control we developed a temperature and photoperiod driven model to simulate the life cycle of this insect and development rates for each life stage the model was calibrated on published data and validated with observations obtained in france and switzerland model stability analysis showed that minimal temperature for larval development to be the most important parameter to estimate diapause parameters had little effect we then explored the effects of temperature increases of 1 and 2 c the number of generations ranged from two to four at the various study sites climate warming will accelerate the insect life cycle making it possible for the occurrence of one more generation per year the key finding of this study was the complexity of population dynamics for this species some generations overlapped making it difficult to identify the adult flight period clearly for each generation furthermore various stages were potentially able to overwinter not just diapausing larvae climate warming may also enhance this phenomenon in the future further explorations of the complex dynamics of this species are required notably it remains unclear how successfully the various life stages survive winter temperatures further model refinements are also required to obtain more accurate estimates of box tree moth phenology however this is the first phenology model for box tree moth to be published and our findings provide useful information for improving control of this pest keywords climate change cydalima perspectalis phenology diapause modelling 1 introduction the number of biological invasions worldwide has steadily increased since 1800 but has not yet reached saturation point seebens et al 2017 the number of exotic arthropod invasions in particular has increased spectacularly since the 16th century with a clear acceleration in the second half of the 20th century roques 2010 this increase in the number of invasions is partly attributable to the introduction of phytophagous species with the intensification of the international ornamental plant trade dehnen schmutz et al 2010 roques 2010 increases in the number of entries and the spread of exotic species within a new territory account for the surge in biological invasions following their arrival in new territories exotic insect species spread at various rates depending on the time since their introduction and their feeding guild for example species discovered since the 1990s tend to spread three to four times more rapidly than those arriving before this time point roques et al 2016 exceptionally high dispersal capabilities generally drive this rapid range expansion some species can naturally disperse over very long distances e g the invasive yellow legged hornet robinet et al 2017 can rapidly evolve the capacity for fast dispersal e g the bean beetle ochocki and miller 2017 or may be transported over long distances by human activities thanks to the free circulation of goods within the european union for example roques et al 2016 however high dispersal capabilities alone cannot account for the rapid spread observed population growth is another key factor to be taken into account as it might explain how possible allee effects are overcome at low population density taylor and hastings 2005 together with dispersal capacity and population carrying capacity population growth could drive the rate at which the invasion wave spreads shigesada and kawasaki 1997 haond et al 2018 thus insects that produce several generations per year are likely to spread more rapidly fahrner and aukema 2018 population phenology modelling can be used to estimate the number of generations and the time window associated with each life stage the phenology model classically used to describe the development of plants and poikilothermic organisms such as insects is the degree day model this model has proved accurate for many species over the years bonhomme 2000 damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 rebaudo and rabhi 2018 it is based on the principle that a number of thermal units above a given temperature threshold must be accumulated to complete the development of a given life stage leading to definition of the heat accumulation required for development in this model we assume a linear relationship between temperature and development rate non linear models have been developed to refine this modelling framework and to provide more subtle performance curves than linear relationships rebaudo and rabhi 2018 however these models require data for the fitting of these non linear functions e g experimental data for development rates as a function of temperature which is feasible for only a set of well documented species these models based on temperature driven processes can also be improved by considering 1 photoperiod thresholds particularly for organisms that have a dormancy or diapause period pollard et al 2020 and 2 population growth fecundity and mortality factors e g the agent based model developed for the invasive brown marmorated stink bug halyomorpha halys model nielsen et al 2016 a good knowledge of the biology of the species concerned is required for the parameterisation of such models and for the development of effective control measures limiting the spread of invasive species however the biology of invasive species is generally poorly understood as most of these species cause no significant damage in their native area and some are even unknown to science seebens et al 2017 in addition the build up of the population in the invaded area is subject to founder effects and genetic bottlenecks dlugosch and parker 2008 and may not therefore be entirely representative of the characteristics of individuals in their native area careful study of the invasive population is therefore required to assess its potential growth and spread the box tree moth cydalima perspectalis walker 1859 lepidoptera crambidae is emblematic of a rapid invasion roques et al 2016 it is native to asia and it develops on box trees it was first detected in europe in germany in 2007 and has since invaded a large area extending from france to iran bras et al 2019 and causing significant damage to european buxus trees it has a rate of spread in europe of up to 155 km year this rapid spread probably reflects multiple introductions from china on imported box trees bras et al 2019 in addition to other factors such as human mediated dispersal through the box tree trade within the european union bras 2018 and its own potential for population growth the box tree moth has three to five generations per year in china wan et al 2014 but only two generations per year have been recorded in switzerland nacambo et al 2014 it remains unclear how many generations this moth could potentially produce in the various climates found in europe this species overwinters at the larval stage from the 2nd to the 5th larval instar in china depending on the precise geographic area wan et al 2014 and mostly at the 3rd 4th larval instar stages in europe nacambo et al 2014 bras 2018 the conditions required for diapause induction are relatively well known day length of 13 30 h in europe nacambo et al 2014 and day length of between 12 50 and 13 36 h in china xiao et al 2011 but those for the end of diapause remain unclear making it difficult to predict when insects will resume their development in the spring in this study we aimed to develop a temperature and photoperiod driven model based mostly on a phenology model to explore box tree moth phenology in detail and to determine how many generations this species can produce in europe the results of this study will ultimately improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of this invasive species and will also facilitate the temporal optimisation of pest management methods targeting particular stages in the life cycle 2 materials and methods 2 1 biology of the study species in its invaded range the box tree moth is a multivoltine species fig 1 throughout most of the invaded range this insect is active from late march to late october two to three generations per year have been recorded in several parts of europe nacambo et al 2014 matošević et al 2017 but it is thought that up to four generations per year may occur in georgia gninenko et al 2014 the moth overwinters at the larval stage in cocoons stuck to the leaves of box trees the overwintering cocoons can be observed from september when day length falls below about 13 h until the spring the factors involved in diapause termination remain unclear but exposure to cold temperatures for at least one and a half months may be required for the insect to resume its development nacambo et al 2014 the overwintering larvae usually complete their development in spring when temperatures start to increase the first adults are observed in june and the second and third generations are produced during the summer 2 2 description of the phenology model for each life stage from eggs to pupae we consider a degree day model fig 2 we considered the accumulation of temperature above a given lower developmental threshold tl and below a given upper developmental threshold tu and assumed that the development of the stage was complete when the number of degree days required for the stage development dd was reached we used the double sine wave method to calculate the number of degree days accumulated zalom et al 1983 in this method temperatures are interpolated from the daily minimal and maximal temperatures by half days with a sinusoidal curve and the area under the curve between tl and tu is calculated for larvae we did not consider each of the individual larval stages from l1 to l7 because too few data were available to parameterise the model instead we considered three groups of larval stages g1 corresponding to l1 l2 g2 corresponding to l3 l4 and g3 corresponding to l4 l7 because only g2 is likely to enter diapause for winter and therefore to experience an interruption of larval development the dates of diapause induction and termination were calculated from the photoperiod and temperature datasets daily minimal and maximal temperatures diapause can begin when photoperiod falls below a day length of di for any day after this date and before november after november we considered the temperature to be too low cold was accumulated and we determined the date by which sufficient exposure to cold had been accumulated dlcold days at which the minimal temperature was below tlcold after this date heat began to accumulate and we calculated the date at which sufficient heat accumulation had been achieved duwarm consecutive days during which the maximal temperature was above tuwarm once sufficient heat has been accumulated overwintering ends and the larvae can continue their development we also calculated a mortality rate for the diapause period based on cold accumulation see model parameterisation the model was initiated with a flight curve providing the number of individuals flying each day to represent the number of adults emerging each day we assumed that the males and females emerged at the same time göttig 2017 and that the sex ratio was 0 5 tabone et al 2015 göttig 2017 we then needed to know the number of fertilised females to calculate the number of eggs assuming that males and females are randomly distributed in space the probability of mating success follows a poisson probability distribution boukal and berec 2002 the number of fertilised females is therefore n f 1 exp n m where nf and nm are the number of adult females emerging ona given day and the number of adult males present on that day respectively robinet et al 2007 this quantity rapidly tends toward nf as nm increases and is therefore weakly constrained by the number of males we simulated egg laying according to this flight curve by distributing the number of eggs laid by each female fec over a period of time after emergence dayegg we then applied the degree day model for eggs with tl tleggs and dd ddeggs for larva groups g1 g2 and g3 with tl tllarvae1 tllarvae2 tllarvae3 and dd ddlarvae1 ddlarvae2 ddlarvae3 respectively and for pupae with tl tlpupae and dd ddpupae for each stage we applied a mortality rate meggs mlarvae1 mlarvae2 mlarvae3 mpupae madult before simulating the development of the next stage once pupae complete their development the adults emerge and are assumed to live for a certain period longevity the females then lay eggs and the algorithm moves on to the next loop fig 2 in addition for g2 l3 l4 we also tested whether the date considered incrementally day after day could be considered a date on which they could enter diapause for each day of their development larvae entering diapause were considered to stop developing with development beginning again after the end of diapause in total 24 input parameters must be provided to simulate the phenology of the box tree moth table 1 the model was coded in r language r core team 2019 robinet and suppo 2020 2 3 model parameterisation 2 3 1 development thresholds the estimates of tl and dd for each stage were mostly obtained from the work of nacambo et al 2014 who studied an invasive population in switzerland europe we thus considered tleggs 10 91 c and ddeggs 48 54 degree days and tlpupae 11 5 c and ddpupae 133 33 degree days for larval stage nacambo et al 2014 showed that the lower temperature threshold was 8 38 c and that 322 58 degree days were required for development since we considered three groups of larval stages l1 2 l3 4 and l5 7 we assumed that tllarvae1 tllarvae2 tllarvae3 8 38 c in a study conducted in asia maruyama shinkaji 1991 found that stages l1 to l5 each completed development within three days and that stage l6 completed development within eight days at 25 c since we have observed that l1 individuals originating from the invasive population develop much more rapidly than l2 l5 larvae we considered only one day of development to be required for l1 we also assumed that l7 larvae developed at the same rate as l6 larvae i e within 8 days thus at 25 c the total duration of larval development from l1 to l7 would be 29 days according to tabone et al 2015 the duration of the larval stage is between 29 and 33 days for a population sampled within the invaded range in europe the two estimates are thus consistent we then derived the number of degree days above 8 38 c required from the number of days of development at 25 c and we found that ddlarvae1 44 5 degree days ddlarvae2 66 7 degree days and ddlarvae3 211 3 degree days as no information was available about the upper developmental threshold we assumed that tueggs tularvae1 tularvae2 tularvae3 tupupae infinity this is a conservative assumption for the sites considered here since individuals can probably develop at temperatures of up to 35 c nacambo et al 2014 and the model was applied to regions in which maximal temperatures in summer are generally around this threshold more rigorous testing of the effects of heatwaves during which temperatures may reach 40 c would require improvements in the assessment of this parameter in this study we focus on average temperatures ignoring extreme climate events 2 3 2 diapause conditions photoperiod is an important factor for diapause induction taking into account the work of nacambo et al 2014 and xiao et al 2010 we assumed that diapause was induced as soon as the photoperiod fell below 13 h of daylight di 13 h the conditions for the end of diapause still remained uncertain diapausing larvae must first accumulate a certain amount of cold in accordance with the findings of nacambo et al 2014 we considered that minimal temperatures had to be below tlcold 2 c for a period dlcold 45 days after accumulating cold the larvae have to accumulate heat to end diapause based on the results of laboratory experiments on l4 under a photoperiod of 10 12 h bras 2018 poitou 2018 we assumed that a maximal temperature of at least 5 10 15 or 20 c tuwarm for 28 9 7 or 3 consecutive days duwarm respectively was required the larvae can continue their development if one of these conditions is fulfilled 2 3 3 mortality rates except for eggs no data were available for the accurate estimation of mortality at each stage based on observations and extrapolations from field data we considered meggs 10 lepilleur et al 2017 mlarvae1 20 mlarvae2 5 mlarvae3 5 mpupae 2 madult 5 elisabeth tabone pers com these estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty but this uncertainty affects the population level rather than the time window for each stage and generation in addition to these mortality rates we considered mortality during the winter diapause nacambo et al 2014 showed that mortality rate during diapause depends on the duration for which larvae were exposed to a temperature of 2 c or lower during the overwintering period we used the following function to estimate this mortality rate in which ranged from 90 when cold accumulation was very short 1 month to 10 when it lasted 3 5 months f m o r t x 90 i f x 30 d a y s 100 2 67 x 45 50 i f 30 x 45 d a y s 100 0 67 x 60 60 i f 45 x 60 d a y s 100 0 67 x 75 70 i f 60 x 75 d a y s 100 0 67 x 90 80 i f 75 x 90 d a y s 100 0 67 x 105 90 i f 90 x 105 d a y s 100 0 67 x 120 80 i f 105 x 120 d a y s 100 1 33 x 180 i f x 120 d a y s with x the number of days at which the daily minimal temperature was below 2 c during the diapause period 2 3 4 other biological parameters according to tabone et al 2015 female adults can live for 12 days and male adults can live for 15 days under laboratory conditions 25 c we therefore assumed that adults of both sexes could live for l 14 days in the field each female lays a mean of 800 eggs 300 eggs tabone et al 2015 as we aimed to study the phenology of the insects rather than their abundance we used a fecundity f 2 in subsequent simulations to avoid a surge in the size of the population and problems visualising the number of individuals we also needed to enter the number of females initially present nf to initiate the model we chose an arbitrary value for this nf 1000 2 4 model validation the model was validated in four ways a preliminary check and three validations on independent datasets 1 for four sites at which adult flights were recorded with pheromone traps in two consecutive years 2 for one site at which adult flights were recorded in four consecutive years and 3 for one site at which all life stages were followed for a whole year pineau et al 2020 preliminary check we compared the predicted phenology duration of each life stage at a constant temperature of 25 c with the laboratory observations reported by tabone et al 2015 validation 1 we compared the predicted time window of adult occurrence according to simulations with trap captures at several locations we considered trap captures in 2017 and 2018 at orléans 47 83 n 1 91 e 105 m asl contrevoz 45 80 n 5 63 e 370 m asl and caen 49 18 n 0 37 w 10 m asl in france we also considered the data of nacambo et al 2014 for basel and riehen switzerland in 2011 and 2012 basel and riehen are only 5 km apart we therefore considered them to constitute a single site referred to hereafter simply as basel we initiated the model on the first flight of the first year and validation was performed in the second year we calculated the correctness rate of presences and absences between observations and simulation results temperature data were retrieved from the nearest weather station at orléans belley about 6 km from contrevoz caen and basel the temperature data for french sites were provided by météo france and those for the swiss site were retrieved from http www ecad eu klein tank et al 2002 photoperiod data were retrieved from http www soda pro com soda team 2019 validation 2 we explored the cumulative error of the model over the years using the data from nacambo et al 2014 for basel in 2009 first flight to initiate the model and simulating insect phenology until 2012 we calculated the correctness rate of presences and absences between observations and simulation results for 2010 2011 and 2012 validation 3 finally we validated the model with a more comprehensive dataset from eggs to adults collected in orléans from 2018 to 2019 pineau et al 2020 trap captures were checked over a longer period i e from april 28th to november 6th 2018 and from april 24th 2019 to november 29th 2019 to ensure that both the earliest and latest flights were recorded two pheromone traps were frequently checked two to seven times per week following the flight season at the inrae nursery in orléans 30 box trees 1 50 m high were checked for three minutes each the numbers of eggs small larvae g1 l1 l2 medium sized larvae g2 l3 l4 large larvae g3 l5 l7 pupae and diapausing larvae were counted life cycle stages were observed weekly from june 21st 2018 to october 31st 2018 monthly during the cold season from november 2018 to may 2019 and then weekly again until june 21st 2019 the larvae found in the dense silk cocoons on the box tree leaves were assumed to be diapausing larvae to our knowledge this dataset providing phenological data for all stages of the life cycle of this moth in the field is the only one of its kind to date the model was initiated with the first adult flight in 2018 before julian day 200 and phenology was simulated until june 2019 for each life stage and for all observation dates we calculated the correctness rate of presences and absences between observations and simulations 2 5 model stability given the uncertainty on the values of the parameters we performed a model stability analysis we focused exclusively on parameters involved in the phenology of this species disregarding the others e g fecundity or mortality rates we considered either a range of likely values according to our knowledge uncertainty analysis or a standard range e g degree days 20 and temperature threshold 2 c sensitivity analysis when it was not possible to determine the likely range of values the stability analysis was performed on the temperature data for orléans in 2016 and 2017 the output variables for this analysis were the date at which diapause ended and the peak date of adult flights for each generation when analysing the effects of each parameter we calculated the elasticity coefficient y 1 y 0 y 0 x 1 x 0 x 0 with x 0 as the default value of the parameter x 1 as the new value of the parameter y 0 as the output variable corresponding to x 0 and y 1 as the output variable corresponding to x 1 we then took the absolute value of the elasticity coefficient and calculated the maximal absolute value over the range of values of the input parameter and the output variables it was not possible to calculate this value for all parameters tested deggs and duwarm so we also calculated the rate of variation y 1 y 0 y 0 and the maximum of these absolute values 2 6 model simulations in a context of climate warming we explored the possible effects of climate warming by considering temperature increases of 1 c and 2 c relative to the daily minimal and maximal temperatures recorded at orléans caen contrevoz and basel we compared the number of generations and calculated the percentage of days on which adult flights occurred simulated under a climate warming scenario for the periods of adult flight simulated for the current climate hereafter referred to a similarity for all generations in the second year we also compared the dates of the simulated peak numbers of adults in the current climate and in conditions of climate warming we calculated the advance in days of the peaks for temperature increases of 1 c and 2 c relative to current climate conditions then we calculated the mean and the maximum advances of the generations for the two climate warming scenarios 3 results 3 1 model validation preliminary check each generation from laying of the first egg to death of the last adult took 48 days in simulations of phenology at 25 c excluding the diapause submodel and 51 63 days in the laboratory according to tabone et al 2015 the life cycle from laying of the first egg of one generation to laying of the first egg of the following generation was completed within 38 days in the simulation assuming that females began to lay eggs four days after emergence against mean of 45 days and range of 40 50 days in the laboratory egg development took four days in the simulation against 1 5 days in the laboratory development of the larval of groups g1 g2 and g3 took 3 4 and 13 days respectively corresponding to a total of 20 days for complete larval development against 29 33 days in the laboratory pupal development took 10 day in the simulation against 9 10 days in the laboratory the simulated life cycle at 25 c was completed slightly faster in the simulation than under laboratory conditions tabone et al 2015 this was mostly due to the shorter time required for larval development in the simulations following activation of the diapause submodel in the simulation the population was unable to survive because it never met diapause conditions the conditions for diapause induction and cold accumulation validation 1 correctness rates exceeded 60 at orléans and contrevoz and 80 at caen and basel validation in the following year 2010 table 2 and fig 3 however the model simulated a third flight for orléans at the end of 2018 that was not actually observed fig 3 validation 2 the model did not accumulate much error over the years the fitting success of the model for basel exceeded 80 in 2010 and 2012 table 2 however the simulated time window for the presence of adults was relatively large in 2011 and the model predicted earlier and later flights than were actually observed for this particular year fig 3 validation 3 a comparison of the periods corresponding to each life stage at orléans in 2018 2019 yielded the following results fig 4 table 3 1 the second adult flight was correctly estimated but the simulations predicted a third adult flight at the end of 2018 at around day 300 end of october 2018 which was not observed in the field despite the presence of two pheromone traps until early november fig 4 2 egg occurrence was not correctly estimated table 3 3 the occurrence of larvae of g1 was correctly estimated the model even predicted the first time of occurrence in early 2019 4 the occurrence of g2 larvae was also correctly estimated 5 the occurrence of g3 larvae was correctly estimated and 6 the occurrence of pupae was relatively well estimated most correctness rates exceeded 90 table 3 according to these simulations fig 4 the second adult flight provides individuals that overwinter as g2 larvae whereas the third adult flight provides individuals that could overwinter as eggs producing larvae in early 2019 this implies that the generations overlap which was confirmed by representations of the time windows corresponding to the development of each generation fig 5 according to the model diapause could be induced between day 248 september 5th 2018 and day 304 october 31st 2018 in the field diapausing larvae were observed from day 228 august 16th 2018 onwards and more than half the population 50 was already in diapause by day 278 october 5th 2018 according to the model diapause was predicted to end on day 417 february 21st 2019 regardless of when individuals entered diapause observations showed that the number of diapausing larvae decreased to 0 between day 453 march 29th 2019 and day 488 may 5th 2019 the simulations therefore appear to predict too early an end to diapause given that the larvae in cocoons observed in the field are effectively still in diapause 3 2 model stability the parameter with the greatest effect was clearly tllarvae the minimal threshold above which the heat accumulation occurs in the description of larval development table 4 sm1 this parameter should therefore be carefully assessed to ensure a good estimate of the species phenology parameters relating to diapause di tlcold dlcold and duwarm had surprisingly little effect 3 3 model simulations under climate warming insect phenology changed considerably in simulations of climate warming but the predicted changes differed between sites most adult flights would be observed within the same time window as under current climatic conditions at orléans and contrevoz table 5 the predicted changes were largest for caen and basel at which flight similarity was lower than at other sites table 5 on average at all four sites the peak of adult flights would generally occur earlier for an increase of 1 c mean of 9 5 days and still more for an increase of 2 c mean of 25 days the number of generations could reach three at orléans caen and basel and even four at contrevoz for an increase in temperature of 2 c fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 what do the model simulations and discrepancies tell us this study provides the first version of a phenology model for the invasive box tree moth the model provided rough estimates of the time window for each life stage and did not accumulate much error over the years it predicted two or three generations per year which is consistent with the available observations this model revealed a complex dynamics of invasive populations of box tree moth 1 several generations overlap making it difficult to distinguish between flight periods and 2 the insect may potentially overwinter not only as a larva but also at other life stages and 3 climate warming may enhance this phenomenon in the future however these model simulation outputs require confirmation in the field in cases of discrepancy between simulations and observations it was not possible to provide a clear explanation for the differences which may result from an error in the model simulations or from a bias in the observations two main discrepancies require further investigation 1 the presence of eggs and young larvae in the winter and 2 diapause duration 1 the simulations suggested that eggs might be present in the winter whereas they are not observed in the field during this period nevertheless it is very difficult to detect eggs which are tiny and transparent and generally located on the underside of box tree leaves the model suggested that eggs could overwinter and provide first instar larvae l1 in the spring which was an unexpected result it will therefore be important to address the following question are eggs and young larvae able to survive the cold temperatures in winter or to survive to a very low development during this cold period the collection of more field data will be required to answer this question meanwhile for exploration of the effects of cold temperatures we modified the model to include an additional mortality parameter related to low temperatures during the winter data not shown however the modified model was unable to simulate the occurrence of young larvae in early spring as observed in the field the presence of young larvae in early spring is consistent with the presence and survival of eggs during the winter which could then develop into l1 during the spring furthermore our simulations suggest that with climate warming we will probably observe more eggs and young larvae in winter data not shown this issue of the possible survival of both eggs and young larvae in winter is therefore extremely important in the context of climate warming laboratory experiments could be performed to address this question 2 the time window for diapause duration was underestimated by the model in validation 3 however the larvae observed in cocoons in the field may not necessarily actually be in diapause i e interrupted development if they build their cocoon before entering diapause and remain within the cocoon for a short period after the end of diapause this would bias the observation dataset relating to diapause in the field accurate validation of the diapause period on the basis of field data is complex another issue concerning diapause emerged from the preliminary check at a constant temperature of 25 c in simulations without the diapause submodel the development rates obtained for each life stage were very similar to those observed in laboratory conditions indeed no diapause is observed in the constant conditions of the laboratory temperature 25 c photoperiod 16l 8d the photoperiod is constant and longer than the threshold period of 13 h preventing the induction of diapause when we simulated phenology at 25 c with the diapause submodel the simulations showed a population crash in the winter data not shown the model should be refined further to determine whether larvae fail to enter diapause under some temperature conditions according to our findings the box tree moth can have more than two generations in europe and may even produce four generations in conditions of climate warming with an increase in temperature of 2 c at the sites studied climate warming may therefore accelerate the already very rapid spread of this invasive species in addition we set female fecundity to a very low value f 2 to avoid a population explosion population growth is a key factor in the rapid spread of this pest and high population abundance will clearly have a major effect on box trees some of which may be heavily or even completely defoliated leading to their death kenis et al 2013 mitchell et al 2018 at this point low resource availability might lead to a decrease in the abundance of box tree moths 4 2 limitations of the model the current model is not spatially explicit however it could be used to explore the spatial impact of different temperature conditions and climate in the long term on temporal dynamics it could be applied to sites in different countries provided that the box tree moth populations at these sites originate from the same source population as the population studied in switzerland development thresholds from nacambo et al 2014 and thus present similar thermal development thresholds in europe the invasion pathway followed by this moth appears to be complex probably involving several genetic processes bras et al 2019 nevertheless an eastern chinese origin has been proposed for all invasive populations across europe and asia minor studied to date bras et al 2019 suggesting that all these populations may have similar development thresholds making it possible to use our model at a larger scale in addition we did not consider an upper temperature threshold for development if the model is applied to a site in an area warmer than those studied here e g southern europe where temperatures frequently exceed 35 c an upper threshold should be considered without such a threshold the model may be subject to limitations at high temperatures resulting in a possible overestimation of development rates in this study we considered the maximum and minimum daily temperatures recorded by weather stations we assumed these temperatures to be representative of the temperatures actually experienced by the box tree moth individuals however microclimate conditions are known to display considerable spatial variation and to have a large impact on insects kearney and porter 2009 pincebourde et al 2016 eggs and larvae are generally found on box tree leaves only diapausing larvae and pupae are likely to be protected within their cocoon wrapped in a leaf the outputs of simulations could therefore be refined by considering temperature at a local scale rather than the temperatures recorded by weather stations 4 3 usefulness of the model in terms of pest management box trees do not have a particularly high economic value but the decline of ornamental box trees and natural box tree stands would nevertheless have a major ecological cultural and social impact mitchell et al 2018 the development of effective control measures against box tree moth has therefore received considerable attention our model provides an appropriate framework for improving the management of this multivoltine species in the near future indeed several environmentally friendly control measures could be applied targeting particular life stages of the moth hereafter we shortly review three of them 1 pheromone traps capture adult males and can therefore be installed during adult flight periods which may be quite long if the traps are in place unnecessarily for several months the pheromone baits should be regularly replaced to ensure that the traps remain effective precise assessments of the time window for adult flights with the model presented here would be useful for optimising this method ensuring that traps were installed only when necessary either for population monitoring or for a tentative of mass trapping the catching of adult females would also be of great interest and a female targeting lure should become available in the near future molnár et al 2019 2 bacillus thuringiensis sprays can be used against young larvae göttig 2017 if applied at the wrong time i e too early on eggs or too late on older larval instars this method may not efficiently protect ornamental box trees against feeding larvae for this control method our model can estimate the timing of larval emergence and provide an indication of the time window during which first larval instars are present making it possible to optimise treatment efficacy 3 classical biological control involves releasing a specific natural enemy targeting the egg stage to control the population before the larvae have an opportunity to feed on and defoliate box trees e g using trichogramma sp as biological agents göttig 2017 enriquez et al 2015 the model can predict the time window for egg occurrence corresponding to the period in which the parasitoids should be released identifying the appropriate time window for each control method would increase control efficacy furthermore in newly invaded regions such as north america where this insect was first detected in august 2018 frank 2019 our model is of major potential interest to stakeholders to facilitate the implementation of efficient management strategies at early stages of box tree moth invasion this model could also feed into platforms such as the degree days risk and phenological event mapping ddrp platform barker et al 2020 4 4 key message the model developed here goes far beyond a simple degree day model as it accounts for photoperiod diapause processes and population growth parameters models of this type appear to be particularly useful for identifying knowledge gaps and disentangling overlaps between the life stages of invasive species nielsen et al 2016 this model is also a potentially useful tool for assessing potential population growth including the number of generations in invaded areas and thus for fine tuning estimates of the risk of rapid invasions due to the potential growth rate of the pest in addition in the context of climate warming population phenology may become more erratic and models of this type can provide an important cornerstone in efforts to improve control methods targeting

24783,the box tree moth cydalima perspectalis is an invasive insect that has rapidly colonised europe damaging to natural and ornamental box trees in its native habitat in china the number of generations per year is variable but the number of generations observed in european climates remained unclear this is a key issue for understanding the rapid increase in population size and range and for optimising control we developed a temperature and photoperiod driven model to simulate the life cycle of this insect and development rates for each life stage the model was calibrated on published data and validated with observations obtained in france and switzerland model stability analysis showed that minimal temperature for larval development to be the most important parameter to estimate diapause parameters had little effect we then explored the effects of temperature increases of 1 and 2 c the number of generations ranged from two to four at the various study sites climate warming will accelerate the insect life cycle making it possible for the occurrence of one more generation per year the key finding of this study was the complexity of population dynamics for this species some generations overlapped making it difficult to identify the adult flight period clearly for each generation furthermore various stages were potentially able to overwinter not just diapausing larvae climate warming may also enhance this phenomenon in the future further explorations of the complex dynamics of this species are required notably it remains unclear how successfully the various life stages survive winter temperatures further model refinements are also required to obtain more accurate estimates of box tree moth phenology however this is the first phenology model for box tree moth to be published and our findings provide useful information for improving control of this pest keywords climate change cydalima perspectalis phenology diapause modelling 1 introduction the number of biological invasions worldwide has steadily increased since 1800 but has not yet reached saturation point seebens et al 2017 the number of exotic arthropod invasions in particular has increased spectacularly since the 16th century with a clear acceleration in the second half of the 20th century roques 2010 this increase in the number of invasions is partly attributable to the introduction of phytophagous species with the intensification of the international ornamental plant trade dehnen schmutz et al 2010 roques 2010 increases in the number of entries and the spread of exotic species within a new territory account for the surge in biological invasions following their arrival in new territories exotic insect species spread at various rates depending on the time since their introduction and their feeding guild for example species discovered since the 1990s tend to spread three to four times more rapidly than those arriving before this time point roques et al 2016 exceptionally high dispersal capabilities generally drive this rapid range expansion some species can naturally disperse over very long distances e g the invasive yellow legged hornet robinet et al 2017 can rapidly evolve the capacity for fast dispersal e g the bean beetle ochocki and miller 2017 or may be transported over long distances by human activities thanks to the free circulation of goods within the european union for example roques et al 2016 however high dispersal capabilities alone cannot account for the rapid spread observed population growth is another key factor to be taken into account as it might explain how possible allee effects are overcome at low population density taylor and hastings 2005 together with dispersal capacity and population carrying capacity population growth could drive the rate at which the invasion wave spreads shigesada and kawasaki 1997 haond et al 2018 thus insects that produce several generations per year are likely to spread more rapidly fahrner and aukema 2018 population phenology modelling can be used to estimate the number of generations and the time window associated with each life stage the phenology model classically used to describe the development of plants and poikilothermic organisms such as insects is the degree day model this model has proved accurate for many species over the years bonhomme 2000 damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 rebaudo and rabhi 2018 it is based on the principle that a number of thermal units above a given temperature threshold must be accumulated to complete the development of a given life stage leading to definition of the heat accumulation required for development in this model we assume a linear relationship between temperature and development rate non linear models have been developed to refine this modelling framework and to provide more subtle performance curves than linear relationships rebaudo and rabhi 2018 however these models require data for the fitting of these non linear functions e g experimental data for development rates as a function of temperature which is feasible for only a set of well documented species these models based on temperature driven processes can also be improved by considering 1 photoperiod thresholds particularly for organisms that have a dormancy or diapause period pollard et al 2020 and 2 population growth fecundity and mortality factors e g the agent based model developed for the invasive brown marmorated stink bug halyomorpha halys model nielsen et al 2016 a good knowledge of the biology of the species concerned is required for the parameterisation of such models and for the development of effective control measures limiting the spread of invasive species however the biology of invasive species is generally poorly understood as most of these species cause no significant damage in their native area and some are even unknown to science seebens et al 2017 in addition the build up of the population in the invaded area is subject to founder effects and genetic bottlenecks dlugosch and parker 2008 and may not therefore be entirely representative of the characteristics of individuals in their native area careful study of the invasive population is therefore required to assess its potential growth and spread the box tree moth cydalima perspectalis walker 1859 lepidoptera crambidae is emblematic of a rapid invasion roques et al 2016 it is native to asia and it develops on box trees it was first detected in europe in germany in 2007 and has since invaded a large area extending from france to iran bras et al 2019 and causing significant damage to european buxus trees it has a rate of spread in europe of up to 155 km year this rapid spread probably reflects multiple introductions from china on imported box trees bras et al 2019 in addition to other factors such as human mediated dispersal through the box tree trade within the european union bras 2018 and its own potential for population growth the box tree moth has three to five generations per year in china wan et al 2014 but only two generations per year have been recorded in switzerland nacambo et al 2014 it remains unclear how many generations this moth could potentially produce in the various climates found in europe this species overwinters at the larval stage from the 2nd to the 5th larval instar in china depending on the precise geographic area wan et al 2014 and mostly at the 3rd 4th larval instar stages in europe nacambo et al 2014 bras 2018 the conditions required for diapause induction are relatively well known day length of 13 30 h in europe nacambo et al 2014 and day length of between 12 50 and 13 36 h in china xiao et al 2011 but those for the end of diapause remain unclear making it difficult to predict when insects will resume their development in the spring in this study we aimed to develop a temperature and photoperiod driven model based mostly on a phenology model to explore box tree moth phenology in detail and to determine how many generations this species can produce in europe the results of this study will ultimately improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of this invasive species and will also facilitate the temporal optimisation of pest management methods targeting particular stages in the life cycle 2 materials and methods 2 1 biology of the study species in its invaded range the box tree moth is a multivoltine species fig 1 throughout most of the invaded range this insect is active from late march to late october two to three generations per year have been recorded in several parts of europe nacambo et al 2014 matošević et al 2017 but it is thought that up to four generations per year may occur in georgia gninenko et al 2014 the moth overwinters at the larval stage in cocoons stuck to the leaves of box trees the overwintering cocoons can be observed from september when day length falls below about 13 h until the spring the factors involved in diapause termination remain unclear but exposure to cold temperatures for at least one and a half months may be required for the insect to resume its development nacambo et al 2014 the overwintering larvae usually complete their development in spring when temperatures start to increase the first adults are observed in june and the second and third generations are produced during the summer 2 2 description of the phenology model for each life stage from eggs to pupae we consider a degree day model fig 2 we considered the accumulation of temperature above a given lower developmental threshold tl and below a given upper developmental threshold tu and assumed that the development of the stage was complete when the number of degree days required for the stage development dd was reached we used the double sine wave method to calculate the number of degree days accumulated zalom et al 1983 in this method temperatures are interpolated from the daily minimal and maximal temperatures by half days with a sinusoidal curve and the area under the curve between tl and tu is calculated for larvae we did not consider each of the individual larval stages from l1 to l7 because too few data were available to parameterise the model instead we considered three groups of larval stages g1 corresponding to l1 l2 g2 corresponding to l3 l4 and g3 corresponding to l4 l7 because only g2 is likely to enter diapause for winter and therefore to experience an interruption of larval development the dates of diapause induction and termination were calculated from the photoperiod and temperature datasets daily minimal and maximal temperatures diapause can begin when photoperiod falls below a day length of di for any day after this date and before november after november we considered the temperature to be too low cold was accumulated and we determined the date by which sufficient exposure to cold had been accumulated dlcold days at which the minimal temperature was below tlcold after this date heat began to accumulate and we calculated the date at which sufficient heat accumulation had been achieved duwarm consecutive days during which the maximal temperature was above tuwarm once sufficient heat has been accumulated overwintering ends and the larvae can continue their development we also calculated a mortality rate for the diapause period based on cold accumulation see model parameterisation the model was initiated with a flight curve providing the number of individuals flying each day to represent the number of adults emerging each day we assumed that the males and females emerged at the same time göttig 2017 and that the sex ratio was 0 5 tabone et al 2015 göttig 2017 we then needed to know the number of fertilised females to calculate the number of eggs assuming that males and females are randomly distributed in space the probability of mating success follows a poisson probability distribution boukal and berec 2002 the number of fertilised females is therefore n f 1 exp n m where nf and nm are the number of adult females emerging ona given day and the number of adult males present on that day respectively robinet et al 2007 this quantity rapidly tends toward nf as nm increases and is therefore weakly constrained by the number of males we simulated egg laying according to this flight curve by distributing the number of eggs laid by each female fec over a period of time after emergence dayegg we then applied the degree day model for eggs with tl tleggs and dd ddeggs for larva groups g1 g2 and g3 with tl tllarvae1 tllarvae2 tllarvae3 and dd ddlarvae1 ddlarvae2 ddlarvae3 respectively and for pupae with tl tlpupae and dd ddpupae for each stage we applied a mortality rate meggs mlarvae1 mlarvae2 mlarvae3 mpupae madult before simulating the development of the next stage once pupae complete their development the adults emerge and are assumed to live for a certain period longevity the females then lay eggs and the algorithm moves on to the next loop fig 2 in addition for g2 l3 l4 we also tested whether the date considered incrementally day after day could be considered a date on which they could enter diapause for each day of their development larvae entering diapause were considered to stop developing with development beginning again after the end of diapause in total 24 input parameters must be provided to simulate the phenology of the box tree moth table 1 the model was coded in r language r core team 2019 robinet and suppo 2020 2 3 model parameterisation 2 3 1 development thresholds the estimates of tl and dd for each stage were mostly obtained from the work of nacambo et al 2014 who studied an invasive population in switzerland europe we thus considered tleggs 10 91 c and ddeggs 48 54 degree days and tlpupae 11 5 c and ddpupae 133 33 degree days for larval stage nacambo et al 2014 showed that the lower temperature threshold was 8 38 c and that 322 58 degree days were required for development since we considered three groups of larval stages l1 2 l3 4 and l5 7 we assumed that tllarvae1 tllarvae2 tllarvae3 8 38 c in a study conducted in asia maruyama shinkaji 1991 found that stages l1 to l5 each completed development within three days and that stage l6 completed development within eight days at 25 c since we have observed that l1 individuals originating from the invasive population develop much more rapidly than l2 l5 larvae we considered only one day of development to be required for l1 we also assumed that l7 larvae developed at the same rate as l6 larvae i e within 8 days thus at 25 c the total duration of larval development from l1 to l7 would be 29 days according to tabone et al 2015 the duration of the larval stage is between 29 and 33 days for a population sampled within the invaded range in europe the two estimates are thus consistent we then derived the number of degree days above 8 38 c required from the number of days of development at 25 c and we found that ddlarvae1 44 5 degree days ddlarvae2 66 7 degree days and ddlarvae3 211 3 degree days as no information was available about the upper developmental threshold we assumed that tueggs tularvae1 tularvae2 tularvae3 tupupae infinity this is a conservative assumption for the sites considered here since individuals can probably develop at temperatures of up to 35 c nacambo et al 2014 and the model was applied to regions in which maximal temperatures in summer are generally around this threshold more rigorous testing of the effects of heatwaves during which temperatures may reach 40 c would require improvements in the assessment of this parameter in this study we focus on average temperatures ignoring extreme climate events 2 3 2 diapause conditions photoperiod is an important factor for diapause induction taking into account the work of nacambo et al 2014 and xiao et al 2010 we assumed that diapause was induced as soon as the photoperiod fell below 13 h of daylight di 13 h the conditions for the end of diapause still remained uncertain diapausing larvae must first accumulate a certain amount of cold in accordance with the findings of nacambo et al 2014 we considered that minimal temperatures had to be below tlcold 2 c for a period dlcold 45 days after accumulating cold the larvae have to accumulate heat to end diapause based on the results of laboratory experiments on l4 under a photoperiod of 10 12 h bras 2018 poitou 2018 we assumed that a maximal temperature of at least 5 10 15 or 20 c tuwarm for 28 9 7 or 3 consecutive days duwarm respectively was required the larvae can continue their development if one of these conditions is fulfilled 2 3 3 mortality rates except for eggs no data were available for the accurate estimation of mortality at each stage based on observations and extrapolations from field data we considered meggs 10 lepilleur et al 2017 mlarvae1 20 mlarvae2 5 mlarvae3 5 mpupae 2 madult 5 elisabeth tabone pers com these estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty but this uncertainty affects the population level rather than the time window for each stage and generation in addition to these mortality rates we considered mortality during the winter diapause nacambo et al 2014 showed that mortality rate during diapause depends on the duration for which larvae were exposed to a temperature of 2 c or lower during the overwintering period we used the following function to estimate this mortality rate in which ranged from 90 when cold accumulation was very short 1 month to 10 when it lasted 3 5 months f m o r t x 90 i f x 30 d a y s 100 2 67 x 45 50 i f 30 x 45 d a y s 100 0 67 x 60 60 i f 45 x 60 d a y s 100 0 67 x 75 70 i f 60 x 75 d a y s 100 0 67 x 90 80 i f 75 x 90 d a y s 100 0 67 x 105 90 i f 90 x 105 d a y s 100 0 67 x 120 80 i f 105 x 120 d a y s 100 1 33 x 180 i f x 120 d a y s with x the number of days at which the daily minimal temperature was below 2 c during the diapause period 2 3 4 other biological parameters according to tabone et al 2015 female adults can live for 12 days and male adults can live for 15 days under laboratory conditions 25 c we therefore assumed that adults of both sexes could live for l 14 days in the field each female lays a mean of 800 eggs 300 eggs tabone et al 2015 as we aimed to study the phenology of the insects rather than their abundance we used a fecundity f 2 in subsequent simulations to avoid a surge in the size of the population and problems visualising the number of individuals we also needed to enter the number of females initially present nf to initiate the model we chose an arbitrary value for this nf 1000 2 4 model validation the model was validated in four ways a preliminary check and three validations on independent datasets 1 for four sites at which adult flights were recorded with pheromone traps in two consecutive years 2 for one site at which adult flights were recorded in four consecutive years and 3 for one site at which all life stages were followed for a whole year pineau et al 2020 preliminary check we compared the predicted phenology duration of each life stage at a constant temperature of 25 c with the laboratory observations reported by tabone et al 2015 validation 1 we compared the predicted time window of adult occurrence according to simulations with trap captures at several locations we considered trap captures in 2017 and 2018 at orléans 47 83 n 1 91 e 105 m asl contrevoz 45 80 n 5 63 e 370 m asl and caen 49 18 n 0 37 w 10 m asl in france we also considered the data of nacambo et al 2014 for basel and riehen switzerland in 2011 and 2012 basel and riehen are only 5 km apart we therefore considered them to constitute a single site referred to hereafter simply as basel we initiated the model on the first flight of the first year and validation was performed in the second year we calculated the correctness rate of presences and absences between observations and simulation results temperature data were retrieved from the nearest weather station at orléans belley about 6 km from contrevoz caen and basel the temperature data for french sites were provided by météo france and those for the swiss site were retrieved from http www ecad eu klein tank et al 2002 photoperiod data were retrieved from http www soda pro com soda team 2019 validation 2 we explored the cumulative error of the model over the years using the data from nacambo et al 2014 for basel in 2009 first flight to initiate the model and simulating insect phenology until 2012 we calculated the correctness rate of presences and absences between observations and simulation results for 2010 2011 and 2012 validation 3 finally we validated the model with a more comprehensive dataset from eggs to adults collected in orléans from 2018 to 2019 pineau et al 2020 trap captures were checked over a longer period i e from april 28th to november 6th 2018 and from april 24th 2019 to november 29th 2019 to ensure that both the earliest and latest flights were recorded two pheromone traps were frequently checked two to seven times per week following the flight season at the inrae nursery in orléans 30 box trees 1 50 m high were checked for three minutes each the numbers of eggs small larvae g1 l1 l2 medium sized larvae g2 l3 l4 large larvae g3 l5 l7 pupae and diapausing larvae were counted life cycle stages were observed weekly from june 21st 2018 to october 31st 2018 monthly during the cold season from november 2018 to may 2019 and then weekly again until june 21st 2019 the larvae found in the dense silk cocoons on the box tree leaves were assumed to be diapausing larvae to our knowledge this dataset providing phenological data for all stages of the life cycle of this moth in the field is the only one of its kind to date the model was initiated with the first adult flight in 2018 before julian day 200 and phenology was simulated until june 2019 for each life stage and for all observation dates we calculated the correctness rate of presences and absences between observations and simulations 2 5 model stability given the uncertainty on the values of the parameters we performed a model stability analysis we focused exclusively on parameters involved in the phenology of this species disregarding the others e g fecundity or mortality rates we considered either a range of likely values according to our knowledge uncertainty analysis or a standard range e g degree days 20 and temperature threshold 2 c sensitivity analysis when it was not possible to determine the likely range of values the stability analysis was performed on the temperature data for orléans in 2016 and 2017 the output variables for this analysis were the date at which diapause ended and the peak date of adult flights for each generation when analysing the effects of each parameter we calculated the elasticity coefficient y 1 y 0 y 0 x 1 x 0 x 0 with x 0 as the default value of the parameter x 1 as the new value of the parameter y 0 as the output variable corresponding to x 0 and y 1 as the output variable corresponding to x 1 we then took the absolute value of the elasticity coefficient and calculated the maximal absolute value over the range of values of the input parameter and the output variables it was not possible to calculate this value for all parameters tested deggs and duwarm so we also calculated the rate of variation y 1 y 0 y 0 and the maximum of these absolute values 2 6 model simulations in a context of climate warming we explored the possible effects of climate warming by considering temperature increases of 1 c and 2 c relative to the daily minimal and maximal temperatures recorded at orléans caen contrevoz and basel we compared the number of generations and calculated the percentage of days on which adult flights occurred simulated under a climate warming scenario for the periods of adult flight simulated for the current climate hereafter referred to a similarity for all generations in the second year we also compared the dates of the simulated peak numbers of adults in the current climate and in conditions of climate warming we calculated the advance in days of the peaks for temperature increases of 1 c and 2 c relative to current climate conditions then we calculated the mean and the maximum advances of the generations for the two climate warming scenarios 3 results 3 1 model validation preliminary check each generation from laying of the first egg to death of the last adult took 48 days in simulations of phenology at 25 c excluding the diapause submodel and 51 63 days in the laboratory according to tabone et al 2015 the life cycle from laying of the first egg of one generation to laying of the first egg of the following generation was completed within 38 days in the simulation assuming that females began to lay eggs four days after emergence against mean of 45 days and range of 40 50 days in the laboratory egg development took four days in the simulation against 1 5 days in the laboratory development of the larval of groups g1 g2 and g3 took 3 4 and 13 days respectively corresponding to a total of 20 days for complete larval development against 29 33 days in the laboratory pupal development took 10 day in the simulation against 9 10 days in the laboratory the simulated life cycle at 25 c was completed slightly faster in the simulation than under laboratory conditions tabone et al 2015 this was mostly due to the shorter time required for larval development in the simulations following activation of the diapause submodel in the simulation the population was unable to survive because it never met diapause conditions the conditions for diapause induction and cold accumulation validation 1 correctness rates exceeded 60 at orléans and contrevoz and 80 at caen and basel validation in the following year 2010 table 2 and fig 3 however the model simulated a third flight for orléans at the end of 2018 that was not actually observed fig 3 validation 2 the model did not accumulate much error over the years the fitting success of the model for basel exceeded 80 in 2010 and 2012 table 2 however the simulated time window for the presence of adults was relatively large in 2011 and the model predicted earlier and later flights than were actually observed for this particular year fig 3 validation 3 a comparison of the periods corresponding to each life stage at orléans in 2018 2019 yielded the following results fig 4 table 3 1 the second adult flight was correctly estimated but the simulations predicted a third adult flight at the end of 2018 at around day 300 end of october 2018 which was not observed in the field despite the presence of two pheromone traps until early november fig 4 2 egg occurrence was not correctly estimated table 3 3 the occurrence of larvae of g1 was correctly estimated the model even predicted the first time of occurrence in early 2019 4 the occurrence of g2 larvae was also correctly estimated 5 the occurrence of g3 larvae was correctly estimated and 6 the occurrence of pupae was relatively well estimated most correctness rates exceeded 90 table 3 according to these simulations fig 4 the second adult flight provides individuals that overwinter as g2 larvae whereas the third adult flight provides individuals that could overwinter as eggs producing larvae in early 2019 this implies that the generations overlap which was confirmed by representations of the time windows corresponding to the development of each generation fig 5 according to the model diapause could be induced between day 248 september 5th 2018 and day 304 october 31st 2018 in the field diapausing larvae were observed from day 228 august 16th 2018 onwards and more than half the population 50 was already in diapause by day 278 october 5th 2018 according to the model diapause was predicted to end on day 417 february 21st 2019 regardless of when individuals entered diapause observations showed that the number of diapausing larvae decreased to 0 between day 453 march 29th 2019 and day 488 may 5th 2019 the simulations therefore appear to predict too early an end to diapause given that the larvae in cocoons observed in the field are effectively still in diapause 3 2 model stability the parameter with the greatest effect was clearly tllarvae the minimal threshold above which the heat accumulation occurs in the description of larval development table 4 sm1 this parameter should therefore be carefully assessed to ensure a good estimate of the species phenology parameters relating to diapause di tlcold dlcold and duwarm had surprisingly little effect 3 3 model simulations under climate warming insect phenology changed considerably in simulations of climate warming but the predicted changes differed between sites most adult flights would be observed within the same time window as under current climatic conditions at orléans and contrevoz table 5 the predicted changes were largest for caen and basel at which flight similarity was lower than at other sites table 5 on average at all four sites the peak of adult flights would generally occur earlier for an increase of 1 c mean of 9 5 days and still more for an increase of 2 c mean of 25 days the number of generations could reach three at orléans caen and basel and even four at contrevoz for an increase in temperature of 2 c fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 what do the model simulations and discrepancies tell us this study provides the first version of a phenology model for the invasive box tree moth the model provided rough estimates of the time window for each life stage and did not accumulate much error over the years it predicted two or three generations per year which is consistent with the available observations this model revealed a complex dynamics of invasive populations of box tree moth 1 several generations overlap making it difficult to distinguish between flight periods and 2 the insect may potentially overwinter not only as a larva but also at other life stages and 3 climate warming may enhance this phenomenon in the future however these model simulation outputs require confirmation in the field in cases of discrepancy between simulations and observations it was not possible to provide a clear explanation for the differences which may result from an error in the model simulations or from a bias in the observations two main discrepancies require further investigation 1 the presence of eggs and young larvae in the winter and 2 diapause duration 1 the simulations suggested that eggs might be present in the winter whereas they are not observed in the field during this period nevertheless it is very difficult to detect eggs which are tiny and transparent and generally located on the underside of box tree leaves the model suggested that eggs could overwinter and provide first instar larvae l1 in the spring which was an unexpected result it will therefore be important to address the following question are eggs and young larvae able to survive the cold temperatures in winter or to survive to a very low development during this cold period the collection of more field data will be required to answer this question meanwhile for exploration of the effects of cold temperatures we modified the model to include an additional mortality parameter related to low temperatures during the winter data not shown however the modified model was unable to simulate the occurrence of young larvae in early spring as observed in the field the presence of young larvae in early spring is consistent with the presence and survival of eggs during the winter which could then develop into l1 during the spring furthermore our simulations suggest that with climate warming we will probably observe more eggs and young larvae in winter data not shown this issue of the possible survival of both eggs and young larvae in winter is therefore extremely important in the context of climate warming laboratory experiments could be performed to address this question 2 the time window for diapause duration was underestimated by the model in validation 3 however the larvae observed in cocoons in the field may not necessarily actually be in diapause i e interrupted development if they build their cocoon before entering diapause and remain within the cocoon for a short period after the end of diapause this would bias the observation dataset relating to diapause in the field accurate validation of the diapause period on the basis of field data is complex another issue concerning diapause emerged from the preliminary check at a constant temperature of 25 c in simulations without the diapause submodel the development rates obtained for each life stage were very similar to those observed in laboratory conditions indeed no diapause is observed in the constant conditions of the laboratory temperature 25 c photoperiod 16l 8d the photoperiod is constant and longer than the threshold period of 13 h preventing the induction of diapause when we simulated phenology at 25 c with the diapause submodel the simulations showed a population crash in the winter data not shown the model should be refined further to determine whether larvae fail to enter diapause under some temperature conditions according to our findings the box tree moth can have more than two generations in europe and may even produce four generations in conditions of climate warming with an increase in temperature of 2 c at the sites studied climate warming may therefore accelerate the already very rapid spread of this invasive species in addition we set female fecundity to a very low value f 2 to avoid a population explosion population growth is a key factor in the rapid spread of this pest and high population abundance will clearly have a major effect on box trees some of which may be heavily or even completely defoliated leading to their death kenis et al 2013 mitchell et al 2018 at this point low resource availability might lead to a decrease in the abundance of box tree moths 4 2 limitations of the model the current model is not spatially explicit however it could be used to explore the spatial impact of different temperature conditions and climate in the long term on temporal dynamics it could be applied to sites in different countries provided that the box tree moth populations at these sites originate from the same source population as the population studied in switzerland development thresholds from nacambo et al 2014 and thus present similar thermal development thresholds in europe the invasion pathway followed by this moth appears to be complex probably involving several genetic processes bras et al 2019 nevertheless an eastern chinese origin has been proposed for all invasive populations across europe and asia minor studied to date bras et al 2019 suggesting that all these populations may have similar development thresholds making it possible to use our model at a larger scale in addition we did not consider an upper temperature threshold for development if the model is applied to a site in an area warmer than those studied here e g southern europe where temperatures frequently exceed 35 c an upper threshold should be considered without such a threshold the model may be subject to limitations at high temperatures resulting in a possible overestimation of development rates in this study we considered the maximum and minimum daily temperatures recorded by weather stations we assumed these temperatures to be representative of the temperatures actually experienced by the box tree moth individuals however microclimate conditions are known to display considerable spatial variation and to have a large impact on insects kearney and porter 2009 pincebourde et al 2016 eggs and larvae are generally found on box tree leaves only diapausing larvae and pupae are likely to be protected within their cocoon wrapped in a leaf the outputs of simulations could therefore be refined by considering temperature at a local scale rather than the temperatures recorded by weather stations 4 3 usefulness of the model in terms of pest management box trees do not have a particularly high economic value but the decline of ornamental box trees and natural box tree stands would nevertheless have a major ecological cultural and social impact mitchell et al 2018 the development of effective control measures against box tree moth has therefore received considerable attention our model provides an appropriate framework for improving the management of this multivoltine species in the near future indeed several environmentally friendly control measures could be applied targeting particular life stages of the moth hereafter we shortly review three of them 1 pheromone traps capture adult males and can therefore be installed during adult flight periods which may be quite long if the traps are in place unnecessarily for several months the pheromone baits should be regularly replaced to ensure that the traps remain effective precise assessments of the time window for adult flights with the model presented here would be useful for optimising this method ensuring that traps were installed only when necessary either for population monitoring or for a tentative of mass trapping the catching of adult females would also be of great interest and a female targeting lure should become available in the near future molnár et al 2019 2 bacillus thuringiensis sprays can be used against young larvae göttig 2017 if applied at the wrong time i e too early on eggs or too late on older larval instars this method may not efficiently protect ornamental box trees against feeding larvae for this control method our model can estimate the timing of larval emergence and provide an indication of the time window during which first larval instars are present making it possible to optimise treatment efficacy 3 classical biological control involves releasing a specific natural enemy targeting the egg stage to control the population before the larvae have an opportunity to feed on and defoliate box trees e g using trichogramma sp as biological agents göttig 2017 enriquez et al 2015 the model can predict the time window for egg occurrence corresponding to the period in which the parasitoids should be released identifying the appropriate time window for each control method would increase control efficacy furthermore in newly invaded regions such as north america where this insect was first detected in august 2018 frank 2019 our model is of major potential interest to stakeholders to facilitate the implementation of efficient management strategies at early stages of box tree moth invasion this model could also feed into platforms such as the degree days risk and phenological event mapping ddrp platform barker et al 2020 4 4 key message the model developed here goes far beyond a simple degree day model as it accounts for photoperiod diapause processes and population growth parameters models of this type appear to be particularly useful for identifying knowledge gaps and disentangling overlaps between the life stages of invasive species nielsen et al 2016 this model is also a potentially useful tool for assessing potential population growth including the number of generations in invaded areas and thus for fine tuning estimates of the risk of rapid invasions due to the potential growth rate of the pest in addition in the context of climate warming population phenology may become more erratic and models of this type can provide an important cornerstone in efforts to improve control methods targeting

24784,the knowledge gap on the early life history of sea turtles during the lost years continues to hinder research and conservation of this critical life stage when mortality rates are the highest an oceanic model was used in combination with a lagrangian particle tracking framework to simulate and identify potential post hatchling dispersal trajectories of loggerhead and leatherback turtles in the south western indian ocean the study aimed to investigate the effect of hatchling swimming behaviour on hatchling dispersal and survival probability to our knowledge this study provides the first estimate of neonate sea turtle dispersal in the swio by combining a particle tracking model with in situ hatchling behavioural data the model revealed that most virtual hatchlings are transported south westward in the agulhas current with three distinct final locations after a year long simulation each zone comprising on average 20 of the total amount of particles the agulhas return the se atlantic and the southern ocean zones however because loggerhead hatchlings are less strong swimmers compared to leatherbacks they can be advected northward in the near shore coastal current simulations revealed that initial active swimming frenzy as well as variability in oceanic conditions strongly influenced dispersal of virtual hatchlings furthermore variability in oceanic conditions dispersed virtual hatchlings into different areas where threats like fisheries bycatch might also influence their survival lastly the results of this study have potentially broad implications for climate change if turtles adapt by nesting earlier later during the nesting season or further south which may influence hatchling locomotor performance and ultimately survival at early life stages graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sea turtle hatchlings oceanic dispersal particle tracking ocean currents swimming behaviour south africa 1 introduction ocean currents play a major role in shaping animal movements and migrations fossette et al 2012 putman 2018 marine turtles for example perform some of the longest migrations often travelling thousands of kilometres with currents from beaches they hatched from to developmental areas lost years or to and from foraging and nesting grounds by adult turtles these movements of subadults and adult turtles have been well studied mostly using satellite tracking godley et al 2008 schofield et al 2013 but the cryptic phase is the least understood life stage of sea turtles with a general paucity of information regarding their at sea ecology and spatial distribution carr 1980 1986 1987 musick and limpus 1997 only a few studies have managed satellite tracking of hatchlings or post hatchlings scott et al 2014 but they are generally short in duration lasting days to weeks this is useful to describe nearshore distribution and behaviour but long distance dispersal of neonate over months or years need to be modelled to infer their ecology a few studies indicated that post hatchlings swim offshore and remain in pelagic habitats are passive drifters within oceanic currents and occupying sea surface habitats mostly feeding on neustonic prey items mansfield et al 2014 it has also been assumed that neonate turtles have limited swimming and diving abilities due to their small size and positive buoyancy and so remain in the upper 5 m of the water column for the first few months depending on the species davenport and clough 1986 salmon et al 2004 howell et al 2010 and thus drift passively within ocean currents luschi et al 2003 hays et al 2010 even though large scale post hatchling dispersion is driven by oceanic currents recent evidence shows that they actively swim which influences their dispersal trajectories hamann et al 2011 putman et al 2012a putman and mansfield 2015 research also demonstrated that neonate turtles engage in orientated swimming using the earth s magnetic field lohman et al 2012 putman et al 2012b remain in productive waters scott et al 2012 christiansen et al 2016 and are driven by their physiological need to remain in suitable water temperatures gaspar et al 2012 varo cruz et al 2016 indeed as ectotherms sea turtles do not regulate their body temperature and sea surface temperature sst drives post hatchling habitat selection davenport 1997 p gaspar and lalire 2017 marine turtles select temperatures where growth is maximised without compromising their swimming ability swimming activity decreases in 30 c and locomotor coordination is lost above 33 c o hara 1980 while cold water temperature induces hypothermic stunning in water less than 10 c hughes 1974 morreale et al 1992 however neonate thermal tolerance might vary depending on how abrupt the changes in temperature are as well as the animal s thermal history and body condition increased computational power and advances in numerical models of ocean circulation have facilitated the prediction of the distribution of the early life of marine organisms oceans models have thus become a valuable tool for predicting the movement of fish larvae vikebø et al 2010 lobster larvae singh et al 2018 and can also provide insights into the cryptic lost years of oceanic neonate turtles fossette et al 2012 2014 haman et al 2011 by combining high resolution ocean models with particle tracking tools it is possible to simulate their dispersal and estimate the spatio temporal distribution of post hatchling turtles during their oceanic phase putman et al 2012a 2014 putman and naro maciel 2013 furthermore satellite derived ocean products and numerical ocean models have been validated in a number of studies and have shown to reproduce ocean currents with a very high temporal and spatial resolution chassignet et al 2007 sudre and morrow 2008 tonani et al 2015 hart davis et al 2018 cancet et al 2019 while using oceanographic models to simulate hatchling dispersal can appear to simplify biological and ecological aspects different scenarios simulations can be generated and parameters current speed sea surface temperature wind speed swimming activity duration and direction etc changed as our knowledge of hatchling behaviour increases hamann et al 2011 gaspar and lalire 2017 the critically endangered south western indian ocean swio leatherback and vulnerable loggerhead turtle populations nest in one of the most complex and dynamic areas of the world s oceans connecting two contrasting ocean basins the warm indian ocean on the east coast and the cold atlantic ocean on the west coast of southern africa where strong and highly variable currents occur potentially influencing post hatchling dispersal and survival lutjeharms et al 2010 in south africa it is assumed that hatchlings are carried south westward from the rookery along the east and south coasts in the agulhas current hughes 1974 with some potentially entrained into the south east atlantic where sea surface temperature gradually decreases below 15 c and localised upwelling are permanently present smit et al 2010 generating a high resolution dispersion model for neonate turtles might help elucidate why the swio leatherback population is not increasing while having received the same protection as the swio loggerhead population that is growing exponentially nel et al 2013 this study is thus the first attempt to identify potential dispersal pathways of loggerhead and leatherback turtles from the south african component of the swio populations by combining a high resolution ocean model with a particle tracking framework and in situ observations of hatchling swimming behaviour we hypothesised that 1 dispersal is controlled by oceanic currents and will thus transport post hatchlings in the two ocean basins the south west indian ocean and the south east atlantic ocean basins and 2 neonate dispersal is independent of swimming behaviour and species 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study took place on the north eastern coast of south africa in isimangaliso wetland park kwa zulu natal isimangaliso is a unesco world heritage site ramsar site and comprises contiguous terrestrial and marine protected areas mpas the shoreline is predominantly made up of intermediate beaches with some coarse grained steep reflective beaches interspersed with mixed shores and rocky outcrops harris et al 2011 the beaches form the southernmost nesting grounds of loggerhead caretta caretta cc and leatherback dermochelys coriacea dc sea turtles in the world 27 s the rookery is approximately 200 km long and supports nesting of approximately 1000 loggerhead females and less than 100 leatherback females each year nel et al 2013 the majority of nests are laid north of sodwana and particularly for 5 km north of bhanga nek in the loggerhead nesting hotspot while leatherback nests are distributed over the entire rookery south africa is surrounded by two main boundary currents the agulhas current ac and the benguela current bc the ac forms part of the south west indian ocean sub gyre and flows southwestward along the east coast of south africa following the continental shelf edge eventually retroflecting and flowing eastward back into the south indian ocean fig 1 lutjeharms 2006 the ac has been described as one the strongest western boundary currents in the world and is a highly dynamic current with intense mesoscale 100 km radius variability lutjeharms 2006 casal et al 2009 and is characterised by warm tropical water core temperature is 26 5 c ranging from 24 to 28 c lutjeharms et al 2000 the current is 60 to 100 km wide at the sea surface and speeds in its core can exceed 7 2 km h 1 lambardi et al 2008 cyclonic meanders known as natal pulses forming between 29 s and 30 s where the continental slope and wider shelf present favourable conditions for instabilities and upwelling lutjeharms et al 2000 at the western end of the ac between 39 s and 40 s the current retroflects turning eastward to the indian ocean along the subtropical convergence creating the agulhas return current where the shelf edge separates from the coast at the agulhas bank near 33 s the current is steered away increasing its meandering nature and instability and creating large ring shedding events at the retroflection with warm saline water drifting into the south atlantic ocean boebel et al 2003 the benguela current on the western coast of south africa has distinctly different characteristics compared to the ac it is one of the world s four major eastern boundary upwelling systems that is strongly influenced by rings eddies and filaments spawning from the agulhas retroflection holton et al 2017 veitch and penven 2017 it is a weak eastern boundary current of the se atlantic ocean with drift rate estimates of 5 to 15 km d 1 and characterised by an adjacent wind driven coastal upwelling system the benguella upwelling system comprised of cold nutrient rich water spreading offshore shannon and nelson 1996 wedepohl et al 2000 the near shore located 1 from the coast 13 c permanently upwelled water from the namibian and west coast of south africa 18 s to 35 s is cooler than the offshore boundary water located 15 seaward 18 c santos et al 2012 this complex assemblage of a warm intense and highly dynamic western boundary current and a cold weak eastern boundary current represents the oceanic domain that neonate turtles are exposed to during the first few months of their cryptic oceanic life stage 2 2 in situ hatchling data collection hatchling trials were undertaken with ethical clearance from the nelson mandela metropolitan university animal ethics committee a16 sci zoo 014 and hatchling collection was allowed with permission from the isimangaliso wetland park authority ezemvelo kwazulu natal wildlife and department of environmental affairs oceans and coasts permit numbers res2016 67 res2017 73 res 2018 68 in situ field experiments were conducted at night at the site of hatching hatchlings used for the experiments were collected from marked nests that were monitored to relate to female size or selected opportunistically from random nests at bhanga nek high loggerhead nest density beach 26 53 40 17 s 32 52 50 31 e and manzengwenya high leatherback nest density beach 27 26 72 6 s 32 77 28 0 e following hatching a subset of 25 hatchlings per nest when possible was randomly selected brushed free of sand and used for swimming trials to investigate the effect of size on hatchling swimming ability each hatchling was placed at the landward end of a 2 m raceway made from plastic roof guttering 12 cm high 15 cm wide 2 m long and painted black and filled with fresh seawater approximately 28 c a dim light was placed at the end of the raceway to ensure directional movement each hatchling was timed swimming along the gutter with a stopwatch and the value converted to m s 1 speed distance time m s 1 in total 287 hatchlings were sampled in 2016 loggerhead cc 263 from 11 nests leatherback dc 24 from 1 nest and 425 cc 376 from 17 nests dc 49 from 2 nests in 2017 and 33 in 2018 cc 33 from 5 nests dc 0 2 3 oceanographic model particle tracking we simulated the dispersal of virtual hatchling particles referred to as virtual hatchlings onward throughout the southwest indian and southeast atlantic oceans within hindcast outputs from the copernicus marine environment monitoring service copernicus http marine copernicus eu the copernicus product is based on the modelling framework known as nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo madec 2008 the copernicus outputs used here global analysis forecast phy 001 024 has a spatial resolution of 0 08 approximately 6 9 km grid spacing and the model is forced with atmospheric conditions that combine 6 hourly air temperature humidity and wind fields from the era40 reanalysis with climatological radiation and freshwater fluxes from the core dataset see scott et al 2012 2017 for this study the surface layer current velocities 0 493 m were used to advect the virtual hatchlings thus nemo hindcasts resolve mesoscale processes such as oceanic eddies and meanders and has successfully been used to track post hatchling dispersal putman et al 2012a scott et al 2012 2014a 2017 hatchling dispersal scenarios were simulated using the lagrangian particle tracking framework parcels probably a really computationally efficient lagrangian simulator delandmeter 2019 parcels is a virtual particle tracking tool that computes the lagrangian trajectories of virtual particles trajectories and final locations of virtual hatchling particles were plotted and divided into distinct geographical zones to identify hot spot areas and calculate the percentage of virtual hatchlings located in each zone the oceanic regions zones for this study included the mozambique channel the agulhas current together with the retroflection region the agulhas return current the benguela current se atlantic and the southern ocean fig 2 once all the simulations were completed the final positions of the virtual particles were determined the final positions were then extracted to calculate the number of particles that ended up in each of the defined regions 2 4 oceanic variability virtual hatchling dispersal was simulated from two different beaches representing the high and low loggerhead and leatherback turtle nest density beaches bhanga nek being the high density beach for loggerheads and manzengwenya the high density beach for leatherbacks approximately 30 km apart the virtual particles were deployed in the model grid cell adjacent to the model land boundary of the nesting beaches given the marked seasonal variability of the regional surface currents at the nesting grounds the timing of hatchling release is important thus to account for variability in oceanographic conditions virtual hatchlings were released at two different times each coinciding with the peak hatching season for each species 15th february for loggerhead and 15th march for leatherbacks a total of 10 000 particles were released for each scenario in 2017 and 2018 in 2017 a strong eddy was situated offshore of the nesting area while in 2018 a weaker eddy was observed offshore of the nesting beaches hence the experiments provide a suitable example of different offshore oceanic conditions occurring at the nesting grounds to identify if dispersal varies between species and with different swimming behaviours outputs for each scenario included three simulations the first 48 h and 365 days trajectories as well as density plots after one year thus for each year and species we have a total of 14 dispersal scenarios in which different locations dates and swimming behaviours were simulated table 1 we further used a pearson chi squared test with the function chisq test package stats version 3 7 0 in r agresti 2007 to determine if there were significant associations between scenarios and zones a cramer v test was then used to measure the strength of associations between groups mchugh 2013 2 5 hatchling swimming behaviour although post hatchlings were believed to be passive drifters within oceanic currents recent evidence shows that they are in fact active swimmers which influence their dispersal trajectories wyneken et al 2008 putman et al 2012a b 2014 after entering the sea post hatchlings start to swim offshore continuously for about 24 48 h called the frenzy period to reach the main oceanic current salmon and wyneken 1987 wyneken and salmon 1992 to replicate this frenzy period we simulated dispersal for virtual hatchlings to either have or lack an initial swim at different velocities to assess if swimming behaviour influences their final dispersal trajectory particles of virtual hatchlings were programmed to swim offshore for the first 48 h of the simulations to replicate the frenzy behaviour and allow hatchlings to reach the offshore agulhas current swimming speeds that have been simulated for neonate turtles vary widely ranging from 0 15 to 1 07 m s 1 depending on the species and age davenport 1987 hamann et al 2011 gaspar et al 2012 gaspar and lalire 2017 in this study we used our hatchling swimming trial data with a mean se of 0 11 0 06 m s range 0 07 0 40 m s 1 n 412 for loggerhead and 0 15 0 07 m s 1 range 0 06 0 33 m s 1 n 48 for leatherback turtle hatchlings fig s1 we combined these with values from the literature and selected simulated swimming speed of 0 15 m s 1 or 0 54 km h 1 for loggerhead and 0 30 m s 1 or 1 08 km h 1 for leatherback hatchlings these swimming speeds are in accordance with previous studies that found that average swimming velocities were under 1 km h 1 for juvenile loggerheads and around 1 km h 1 for leatherbacks polovina et al 2006 abecassis et al 2013 gaspar and lalire 2017 conservative estimates of swimming speed were chosen as a precautionary approach to avoid overestimating the influence of post hatchling behaviour on their dispersal putman et al 2012a virtual hatchlings were simulated to swim offshore for the first 48 h of the simulation initial swim in accordance with the frenzy behaviour observed in hatchling sea turtles wyneken and salmon 1992 and then to travel with the current and swim for 2 h of active swimming per day for 365 days 2 6 thermal environment and potential hatchling mortality to estimate potential mortality of post hatchlings we assumed that their body temperature closely matches that of the sea temperature and thus use sst as a proxy of hatchling body temperature neonate turtles are known to decrease feeding rate in temperature lower than 20 c have reduced swimming activity in temperature lower than 15 c and die in temperature lower than 10 c for prolonged duration hughes 1974 schwartz 1978 davenport 1997 we therefore assumed that post hatchlings encountering a mean sst 15 c for more than 14 days had a 50 chance of dying and that post hatchlings experiencing a mean sst 10 c for more than 3 days died of cold stunning low survival rates are expected if they are transported into cold water which might be the case in the swio if neonates are entrained in the cold southeast atlantic ocean and southern ocean sst data were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa ghrsst at a spatial resolution of 0 25 with daily values covering the entire study area and tracking period 3 results 3 1 main dispersal pathways of virtual hatchlings in the swio a total of 560 000 virtual hatchling particles were released in the simulations and the two species had very similar broad dispersal patterns most virtual hatchlings initiate their dispersal by being entrained south westward with a core area of dispersal within the agulhas current fig 3 few virtual hatchlings however are advected north from the nesting beaches towards mozambique and this took place only in 2017 table 2 as virtual hatchlings move further offshore and initiate their oceanic journey three main dispersal pathways emerged with hatchlings reaching very different oceanic areas the first two pathways continue in a south westerly direction towards the southern edge of the continent and then split in two most virtual hatchlings remain under the influence of the ac and are carried eastwards via the agulhas retroflection and return current to remain in the south west indian ocean swio this is referred to as the south indian ocean pathway virtual hatchlings following the second pathway are entrained into strong eddies and leaked into the south east atlantic ocean this atlantic pathway leads virtual hatchlings into two possible sub trajectories a northern route adjacent to the west african coast and the benguela current and a southern route further west into the se atlantic lastly the few virtual hatchlings that are advected north into mozambique can be dispersed south of madagascar or into the mozambique channel and will be referred to as the mozambique pathway particle counts after a year of simulated dispersal for each scenario also indicated that there were three main dispersal pathways table 2 the agulhas return zone the southern ocean zone and the se atlantic zone overall these three zones hosted the greatest proportion of virtual hatchlings across scenarios years and for both species the two zones with the least consistent amount of virtual hatchlings were the mozambique channel and the benguela current zones 3 2 oceanic variability although the long term dispersal trajectories of virtual hatchlings under different scenarios follow similar broad patterns the 48 h zoom fig s3 and particle counts indicated some differences between the seven scenarios dispersal scenarios differed within and between years for both species as was expected due to the dynamic nature of the agulhas current table 2 in 2017 virtual hatchlings were retained in the vicinity of the nesting beach or pushed north due to the inshore current except for those that had stronger swimming speed during the frenzy or were released further south these were entrained in the current flowing in a south westerly direction virtual hatchling trajectories that lacked an initial swim or were completely passive had high retention rates at the release site in 2017 scenario 3 fig s3m c the 2018 cohort experienced lower variability in oceanic conditions and the three dominant pathways remained the same for both species with more than 70 of loggerhead and 80 of leatherback particles accounted for in these three pathways table 2 however the majority of virtual loggerhead hatchlings ended in the se atlantic while most leatherback particles ended in the southern ocean 3 3 hatchling swimming behaviour the particle counts revealed that the oceanographic conditions of 2017 resulted in disparate results amongst the scenarios with a high percentage of virtual hatchlings being advected north into the mozambique channel zone for scenarios with either no frenzy scenario4 or no swimming at all scenario 5 for both loggerhead 64 8 and 64 9 and leatherback 76 4 and 76 2 virtual hatchlings tables 2 and 3 furthermore higher variability was found in 2017 for loggerhead virtual hatchlings than leatherbacks with the highest number of particles having an end trajectory in the agulhas current retained in the vicinity of the release site for scenarios with slower swimming speed scenarios 2 with 25 2 and 3 with 26 8 respectively compared to leatherbacks with highest numbers in the southern ocean zone for the same scenarios 32 7 and 33 5 the dominant end trajectory for loggerhead virtual hatchlings in 2018 was the se atlantic zone except for scenario 1 with a stronger swimming speed that took virtual hatchlings in the agulhas return zone 37 6 and for scenario 6 with a change in release date that advected hatchlings in the southern ocean zone 33 5 this variability was also noticeable for leatherbacks but particles only deviated from the dominant zone southern ocean in scenario 6 with a later release date 32 6 additionally the scenario with the stronger swimming speed during the frenzy swim took loggerhead virtual hatchlings further offshore fig s2a compared to any other scenario but this was not observed in 2018 fig s2b these findings are supported by the correlation tests that indicated the strongest positive associations between scenarios 1 6 and 7 i e fastest initial offshore swim later release in march or further south in low density area release with the majority of particles ending in the ar sea and so fig s8 however the cramer v test indicated a moderate association among these scenarios in 2017 cramer v test 0 30 and a weak association in 2018 cramer v test 0 11 3 4 thermal environment and potential hatchling mortality we assumed that virtual hatchlings encountering a mean sst of less than 15 c for more than 14 days had a 50 chance of dying and that those experiencing a mean sst equal or less than 10 c for more than 3 days died of cold stunning by overlaying the sst encountered by virtual hatchlings throughout their first year of dispersal we estimated the potential cold induced mortality the sst values indicated that only the southern ocean and benguela current zones had temperatures low enough to impact post hatchling survival only a very small fraction of virtual hatchings ended in the benguela current tables 2 and 3 and of these no loggerheads or leatherbacks encountered sst values to equal or less than 10 c for three days or more in 2017 or 2018 which could have induced hypothermia or mortality table 3 however loggerhead virtual hatchlings encountered sst values equal or less to 15 c for more than 14 days in decreasing order for 15 1 of scenario 1 12 2 of scenario 11 7 for scenario 1 7 8 for scenarios 2 and 3 and lowest percentage for scenarios 4 and 5 1 9 and 1 8 respectively had 50 chance of mortality in the southern ocean and overall very low numbers equal or less than 2 of encountering 10 c sst across all scenarios in 2017 the fraction of virtual hatchlings that encountered cold temperatures 50 chance of hypothermia and experiencing 15 c sst for more than 14 days in the southern ocean were higher in 2018 the highest percentage for scenario 1 25 5 followed by scenario 6 22 8 scenario 4 19 9 scenario 5 19 3 with the lowest being scenario 7 15 7 interestingly the lowest mortalities for both temperatures in the southern ocean were found for the scenarios with no frenzy swim scenario 4 or completely passive scenario 5 but only in 2017 3 5 comparison of loggerhead and leatherback dispersal patterns despite broad apparent similarities a closer examination of our results revealed important differences in dispersal patterns of loggerhead and leatherback virtual hatchlings almost no virtual leatherback hatchlings were advected north into the mozambique channel zone for the scenarios with no frenzy swim scenario 4 0 3 or where they were completely passive scenario 5 0 4 compared to 60 for loggerhead particles from the same scenarios table 2 and figs 3 and 4 this is also evident on the 48 h maps figs s3e i c g additionally the dominant end zone changed with a change in release location scenario 6 2017 being the southern ocean but the agulhas return current with a change in date of release scenario 7 2018 fig s3 highlighting the impact of ocean variability near the nesting sites similar to loggerheads no virtual leatherback hatchlings encountered 10 c sst s in the benguela current zone in either years however some particles in the southern ocean zone encountered 10 c water for more than three days in both years 2017 having lower mortalities 2 for each scenario and 2018 yielding higher potential mortalities for scenarios 3 with 4 8 and 4 5 for scenario 2 table 3 more leatherback particles had a 50 chance of mortality by experiencing 15 c sst s than loggerheads furthermore percentages were more than double in the southern ocean in 2018 compared to 2017 with scenario 3 having the highest number 52 4 followed by scenario 7 52 2 scenario 2 49 8 scenario 1 34 1 and scenarios 5 4 6 in descending order 4 discussion the simulations of the present study provided insight into a significant knowledge gap regarding the spatial distribution of post hatchling sea turtles and present the first estimate of neonate dispersal in the swio the south african component of the swio turtle rookery is unique because hatchlings dispersing from these nesting beaches enter very complex and dynamic oceanic conditions linking two extremely contrasting ocean basins in this study we simulated the potential dispersal pathways of loggerhead and leatherback sea turtle hatchlings in the two ocean basins and assessed the effect of swimming behaviour on their dispersal trajectories as well as compare the effect of varying coastal and oceanic conditions on these trajectories similar to other research our model suggests that post hatchling dispersal is influenced by a combination of oceanic variability and hatchling initial swimming behaviour gaspar et al 2012 putman and he 2013 4 1 post hatchling dispersal pathways in the swio dispersal trajectories of virtual hatchling of both species in the swio are under the direct influence of the ac during the first month at sea moving rapidly south eastward along the coast within the current after reaching the southern tip of africa they can then follow two main pathways the first and main pathway remains under the influence of the ac and leads virtual hatchlings into the agulhas retroflection and then into the eastward flowing agulhas return current returning virtual hatchlings to the warm waters of the south indian ocean the second pathway entrains virtual hatchlings into the agulhas rings and forces them to cross ocean basins to be transported into the se atlantic ocean this is in accordance with oceanographic and modelling research that found that 60 of modelled agulhas current flow follows the retroflection and 40 flows into the se atlantic hermes et al 2007 the results suggested that the simulated active and passive dispersal trajectories of virtual hatchlings are broadly similar and mostly influenced by ocean currents during their first year of dispersal validating our first hypothesis that post hatchling dispersal would mainly be controlled by water circulation this finding is in accordance with other studies for several sea turtle populations and species gaspar et al 2012 putman and mansfield 2015 the similarity between the passive and active dispersal simulations in this study indicates that the simulated swimming speeds of virtual hatchlings are very weak compared to the current velocities of the study region this is not surprising as the ac is a fast flowing western boundary current and evidence suggests that even bigger juvenile turtles under 30 cm have average swimming speeds under 1 km h 1 abecassis et al 2013 which is much less than the ac mean surface velocity exceeding 3 4 km h lutjeharms 2006 this finding is similar to other dispersal studies where strong western boundary currents are present such as the kurushio current in the western pacific which controls leatherback and loggerhead hatchlings dispersal for the first two years of their lives ascani et al 2016 gaspar and lalire 2017 as hatchlings grow and reach 3 to 4 years their swimming abilities improve enabling them to actively target favourable habitats 4 2 oceanic variability oceanic conditions vary considerably between years demonstrated by the comparison between 2017 and 2018 these conditions resulted in different endpoints of virtual hatchlings after one year of simulation in 2017 a landward current pushes particles towards the continent whereas the dominant current in 2018 is parallel to the coast with the presence of an eddy taking particles away from the nesting beach southward oceanic circulation at the nesting site is strongly influenced by eddies which develop in the mozambique channel and move along the eastern coast of south africa due to these strong mesoscale features there is a high level of variability in oceanic conditions offshore of the nesting beaches but also along the entire length of the ac and south african coast lutjeharms et al 2007 braby et al 2016 the high variability in ocean currents within or adjacent to the ac provide strong evidence that virtual hatchlings can become trapped and retained in eddies near or downstream of their release locations or entrained into the inshore northward current this is supported by stranding data showing that most strandings of sea turtle hatchlings occur along the south coast of south africa with very little on the east coast close to the release site de wet 2012 this highlights the dynamic nature of the environment in that two consecutive years are that much different although long term variability in ocean currents might affect the outcome of hatchling dispersal which ultimately remain unpredictable depending on the oceanic conditions of a given year we therefore recommend caution when extrapolating from these results due to the low number of releases replicates at different days or locations 4 3 hatchling swimming behaviour our second hypothesis which proposed that hatchling swimming behaviour will have little effect on their trajectory was poorly supported in this study we tested a variety of hypothetical swimming scenarios and concluded that the dispersal of post hatchlings is affected by active swimming especially during the swimming frenzy period first 48 h this finding agrees with growing evidence showing that hatchling swimming behaviour can influence dispersal estimates hamann et al 2011 briscoe et al 2017 fewest hatchlings will strand with the fastest offshore swimming speed during the frenzy period scenario 1 which seems supported by standing data de wet 2012 the density plots and the particle count of our passive and active simulations also indicate that passive virtual hatchlings have higher retention rates at the nesting site hatchling strandings close to the nesting beaches is rarely observed de wet 2012 consequently virtual hatchlings with faster swimming speeds are less likely to be trapped in the inshore northward current and demonstrates that post hatchlings do engage in active swimming 4 4 thermal environment and potential mortality low temperatures are known to negatively affect sea turtles whose internal temperature follow that of the ambient temperature closely mansfield and putman 2013 christiansen et al 2016 a decline in sst can cause a similar decrease in circulation oxygen uptake and metabolic processes causing marked physiological changes potentially leading to decreased growth and cold stunning hochscheid et al 2004 the analysis of sst conditions in our study revealed that survival rates and thus fitness of virtual hatchlings varied depending on the location of the particles end trajectory in the different marine zones of the two zones where hypothermia could occur the southern ocean zone had much higher potential mortality at 15 c for more than 14 days than the benguela current zone surprisingly no virtual hatchlings encountered sst of 10 c or less for more than three days however due to the strong variability in oceanic conditions validating this finding should be an important priority for future research and the model should be run for several years and for longer periods to assess if this finding represents real conditions and whether seasonal and interannual signals can be quantified favourable conditions of greater food availability are expected to be correlated with greater primary productivity and chlorophyll concentrations which are generally associated with features such as eddies and fronts polovina et al 2000 this is because upwellings occur at the centre of eddies and convergence at the edge where forage and preys concentrate polovina et al 2006 this suggests that post hatchling sea turtles would be able to reach more favourable developmental habitats through directional swimming and consequently increasing their fitness although feeding and growth rates of turtles generally decrease at colder temperatures hochscheid et al 2004 the higher food availability might compensate for this and be beneficial to young turtles as would be the case for virtual hatchling entering the se atlantic this zone is highly productive shannon and nelson 1996 hutchings et al 2009 and might be favoured due to increased foraging opportunities thus it appears that there is a trade off between a suitable thermal environment and food availability usually found in colder waters and the survival of neonate turtles might depend on their ability to reach and remain in habitats offering both warm water and food resources p gaspar and lalire 2017 the availability of thermally beneficial habitat sst and food resources are potentially the two most important factors affecting the fitness and survival of neonate sea turtles as was found by other studies abecassis et al 2013 mansfield et al 2014 varo cruz et al 2016 unfortunately we cannot relate the simulated mortality to our virtual hatchlings energetics because our particles do not have a behaviour such as in an individual based model where each particle has a specific behaviour and thus do not exhibit the same behaviour as real hatchlings do in terms of energy depletion hence our virtual hatchlings do not swim towards favourable conditions where food availability and water temperatures might be optimal we only overlapped our simulated dispersal trajectories to the temperature of the region the particles find themselves in giving each virtual particles its own behaviour would be the next step forward to improve our model 4 5 dissimilarities between species the subsequent part of the second hypothesis stating that post hatchling dispersal is independent of species was partially supported in this paper both species follow similar pathways in 2018 during the initial phase of their dispersal being under the influenced of the ac flowing south westward however detailed observations revealed that there were interspecies differences a large proportion 60 of loggerhead virtual hatchlings were advected northward in the near shore coastal current into the mozambique channel in 2017 while this was not observed for leatherbacks suggesting that their stronger swimming abilities carries them further offshore however it is important to note that our model does not resolve well small scale near shore processes taking place near the nesting beaches which are likely to influence the trajectory of virtual particles especially in the initial phase furthermore the simulation outputs of our one year models show that virtual hatchling emerging from south african beaches reach two main different oceanic areas that in turn affect their fitness and potential survival the highly dynamic and complex oceanic conditions of the region present hatchlings with diverse marine habitats that confer varying levels of fitness to neonate turtles virtual loggerhead particles appear to follow ring shedding events off the agulhas retroflection and then are transported into the se atlantic zone with on average less lethal temperatures than the southern ocean zone where more leatherbacks particles occur this dominant loggerhead dispersal pathway might be a result of their weaker swimming speed that carry them on the inshore of the ac as oppose to leatherbacks that could be entrained further offshore on the outer edge of the ac leading them further south this is supported by the annual stranding data with only occasional leatherback strandings around south africa while several dozens of loggerheads are stranded each year after the hatching season along the south and eastern coastline of south africa de wet 2012 consequently it appears that of the two dominant zones the se atlantic confers higher fitness benefits to neonate turtles compared to the southern ocean the higher potential mortality of leatherback virtual hatchlings in the southern ocean is consistent with the lack of recovery of the species compare to loggerheads exponential increase in the south african rookery nel et al 2013 although different threats might apply at different life stages cold induced mortality for post hatchlings and fisheries bycatch for adults this is surprising as leatherback turtles are able to maintain higher body temperatures than the surrounding water james and mrosovsky 2004 bostrom et al 2010 and we assumed that they would have a survival advantage if dispersed into colder waters however their thermal ability might only be effective at older age classes which could explain why they have higher mortality than loggerheads in this study interestingly our findings coupled with satellite data from south africa demonstrate that adult female post nesting migrations luschi et al 2006 lambardi et al 2008 harris et al 2017 robinson et al 2018 may be similar to our virtual hatchling dispersal found in this study and provides further support for the hypothesis that adult foraging migrations reflect their previous experiences as hatchlings hays et al 2010 scott et al 2014a however more satellite data on both adults and juveniles are needed to verify this hypothesis 4 6 implications for sea turtle fitness and conservation water temperatures experienced by neonates are not the only temperature related threats climate change can also potentially affect hatchling fitness and survival as a result of increased global temperature incubation temperature is expected to rise with skewed sex ratios hawkes et al 2009 incubation periods shorten and produce smaller hatchlings with decreased crawling and swimming speed ischer et al 2009 sim et al 2015 sea turtles have may mitigate these negative effects by altering their nesting phenology nesting earlier or later or by expanding their range poleward expansion hawkes et al 2009 rees et al 2016 butler 2019 a change in the timing of nesting has already been reported in some turtle populations selecting for cooler portion of the nesting season to maintain favourable thermal conditions mazaris et al 2008 saba et al 2012 pike 2013a butt et al 2016 carreras et al 2019 however even if nesting and incubation are successful it does not guarantee successful recruitment if the subsequent dispersal thermal environment does not ensure post hatchling survival our simulation results suggest that nesting earlier later in the season or further south would result in higher potential mortality of post hatchlings during their oceanic dispersal due to hypothermia thus even if they incubate and hatch successfully by nesting earlier later or further south the majority of hatchlings may not survive hence although sea turtles have the ability to adapt to climate change population viability is dependent on survival across all life stages these adaptations may only partially offset the impacts of climate change and may lead sea turtles to nest in suboptimal habitats resulting in ecological traps pike 2013b patel et al 2016 the validation of model outputs remains challenging due to the paucity of direct observations of hatchling spatial distribution at sea hamann et al 2011 gaspar et al 2012 despite these limitations lagrangian analyses and oceanographic models provide a first estimate of post hatchling dispersal which can be enhanced and simulations re run as our understanding of hatchling behavioural ecology improves a shortcoming of our post hatchling dispersal simulations is that our model does not incorporate detailed information about the local inshore currents present in the coastal waters adjacent to the nesting beaches and thus might not represent the oceanic conditions of the frenzy accurately godley et al 2010 future research could assess the inshore currents off the rookery and add the subsequent data into the simulations to enhance our model resolution this would allow to accurately represent the northward movement of loggerhead hatchlings that are entrained in the inshore counter current into mozambican waters secondly the model could be improved and validated by using nano satellite and acoustic tags on post hatchlings leaving the nesting beaches to obtain information on their initial frenzy behaviour direction duration etc mansfield et al 2014 scott et al 2014b this would allow to get a better estimate of leatherback swimming speed as we may have overestimated our modelled swim speed in comparison to our field experiments and a bigger sample size might have corrected for this and other literature values davenport 1987 that only had such high values for subsurface swim it would also be beneficial to identify optimal habitat temperature and abundance of prey for neonate turtles by adding primary production data to the model as a proxy for optimal foraging areas and identify hot spots of higher probability of turtle presence abecassis et al 2013 it would be equally beneficial to also include growth data under different temperature regimes and run simulations for longer time period gaspar and lalire 2017 as turtle hatchlings occupy sea surface habitats they are bound to be impacted by wind as observed by increased stranding numbers during storm events de wet 2012 and shown by monzon arguello et al 2012 and future simulations should incorporate a wind factor in the model lastly high resolution ocean velocity fields from nemo are only available from 2007 to present and it could also be advantageous to run simulations further back in the past and for longer durations for different years and would allow identifying dispersal origin and connections from other rookeries such as australia for loggerheads and gabon for leatherbacks putman et al 2014 this back tracking approach has been successfully used to predict genetic connectivity in sea turtles naro maciel et al 2017 shamblin et al 2017 jensen et al 2020 thus further simulations incorporating the data mentioned above would be valuable to confirm the results described in this study and improve our knowledge of this cryptic stage of sea turtle life cycle 4 7 summary our simulations provide a first estimate of loggerhead and leatherback post hatchling dispersal in the swio the model combined an individual based particle tracking model with empirical data of hatchling swimming behaviour to identify dispersal pathways of two species of sea turtles nesting in south africa the post hatchling dispersal of both loggerhead and leatherback turtle populations in the swio is unique because it encompasses two very contrasting ocean basins the warm swio and the cold se atlantic ocean basins the ac is one of the strongest western boundary currents in the world which forms a conduit for inter ocean exchange beal et al 2011 and provides sea turtle hatchlings in the southwestern indian ocean with a unique habitat and suite of challenges although oceanic currents appear to be the main factor influencing the oceanic dispersal of neonate turtles our results show that hatchling initial swimming behaviour also shape their dispersal pathway simulation outputs from this research provide a better understanding of the at sea distribution of sea turtles during their early life stages by identifying developmental areas and thus could inform management and generate effective conservation measures for threatened species casale and mariani 2014 gaspar and lalire 2017 putman et al 2020 notwithstanding that we still do not know where south african juvenile turtles are distributed and only then could we conserve them effectively since static protected areas may be inadequate for highly migratory species such as sea turtles dynamic protected areas as well as temporary spatial closures may be more suitable and allow connectivity between developmental foraging and reproductive

24784,the knowledge gap on the early life history of sea turtles during the lost years continues to hinder research and conservation of this critical life stage when mortality rates are the highest an oceanic model was used in combination with a lagrangian particle tracking framework to simulate and identify potential post hatchling dispersal trajectories of loggerhead and leatherback turtles in the south western indian ocean the study aimed to investigate the effect of hatchling swimming behaviour on hatchling dispersal and survival probability to our knowledge this study provides the first estimate of neonate sea turtle dispersal in the swio by combining a particle tracking model with in situ hatchling behavioural data the model revealed that most virtual hatchlings are transported south westward in the agulhas current with three distinct final locations after a year long simulation each zone comprising on average 20 of the total amount of particles the agulhas return the se atlantic and the southern ocean zones however because loggerhead hatchlings are less strong swimmers compared to leatherbacks they can be advected northward in the near shore coastal current simulations revealed that initial active swimming frenzy as well as variability in oceanic conditions strongly influenced dispersal of virtual hatchlings furthermore variability in oceanic conditions dispersed virtual hatchlings into different areas where threats like fisheries bycatch might also influence their survival lastly the results of this study have potentially broad implications for climate change if turtles adapt by nesting earlier later during the nesting season or further south which may influence hatchling locomotor performance and ultimately survival at early life stages graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sea turtle hatchlings oceanic dispersal particle tracking ocean currents swimming behaviour south africa 1 introduction ocean currents play a major role in shaping animal movements and migrations fossette et al 2012 putman 2018 marine turtles for example perform some of the longest migrations often travelling thousands of kilometres with currents from beaches they hatched from to developmental areas lost years or to and from foraging and nesting grounds by adult turtles these movements of subadults and adult turtles have been well studied mostly using satellite tracking godley et al 2008 schofield et al 2013 but the cryptic phase is the least understood life stage of sea turtles with a general paucity of information regarding their at sea ecology and spatial distribution carr 1980 1986 1987 musick and limpus 1997 only a few studies have managed satellite tracking of hatchlings or post hatchlings scott et al 2014 but they are generally short in duration lasting days to weeks this is useful to describe nearshore distribution and behaviour but long distance dispersal of neonate over months or years need to be modelled to infer their ecology a few studies indicated that post hatchlings swim offshore and remain in pelagic habitats are passive drifters within oceanic currents and occupying sea surface habitats mostly feeding on neustonic prey items mansfield et al 2014 it has also been assumed that neonate turtles have limited swimming and diving abilities due to their small size and positive buoyancy and so remain in the upper 5 m of the water column for the first few months depending on the species davenport and clough 1986 salmon et al 2004 howell et al 2010 and thus drift passively within ocean currents luschi et al 2003 hays et al 2010 even though large scale post hatchling dispersion is driven by oceanic currents recent evidence shows that they actively swim which influences their dispersal trajectories hamann et al 2011 putman et al 2012a putman and mansfield 2015 research also demonstrated that neonate turtles engage in orientated swimming using the earth s magnetic field lohman et al 2012 putman et al 2012b remain in productive waters scott et al 2012 christiansen et al 2016 and are driven by their physiological need to remain in suitable water temperatures gaspar et al 2012 varo cruz et al 2016 indeed as ectotherms sea turtles do not regulate their body temperature and sea surface temperature sst drives post hatchling habitat selection davenport 1997 p gaspar and lalire 2017 marine turtles select temperatures where growth is maximised without compromising their swimming ability swimming activity decreases in 30 c and locomotor coordination is lost above 33 c o hara 1980 while cold water temperature induces hypothermic stunning in water less than 10 c hughes 1974 morreale et al 1992 however neonate thermal tolerance might vary depending on how abrupt the changes in temperature are as well as the animal s thermal history and body condition increased computational power and advances in numerical models of ocean circulation have facilitated the prediction of the distribution of the early life of marine organisms oceans models have thus become a valuable tool for predicting the movement of fish larvae vikebø et al 2010 lobster larvae singh et al 2018 and can also provide insights into the cryptic lost years of oceanic neonate turtles fossette et al 2012 2014 haman et al 2011 by combining high resolution ocean models with particle tracking tools it is possible to simulate their dispersal and estimate the spatio temporal distribution of post hatchling turtles during their oceanic phase putman et al 2012a 2014 putman and naro maciel 2013 furthermore satellite derived ocean products and numerical ocean models have been validated in a number of studies and have shown to reproduce ocean currents with a very high temporal and spatial resolution chassignet et al 2007 sudre and morrow 2008 tonani et al 2015 hart davis et al 2018 cancet et al 2019 while using oceanographic models to simulate hatchling dispersal can appear to simplify biological and ecological aspects different scenarios simulations can be generated and parameters current speed sea surface temperature wind speed swimming activity duration and direction etc changed as our knowledge of hatchling behaviour increases hamann et al 2011 gaspar and lalire 2017 the critically endangered south western indian ocean swio leatherback and vulnerable loggerhead turtle populations nest in one of the most complex and dynamic areas of the world s oceans connecting two contrasting ocean basins the warm indian ocean on the east coast and the cold atlantic ocean on the west coast of southern africa where strong and highly variable currents occur potentially influencing post hatchling dispersal and survival lutjeharms et al 2010 in south africa it is assumed that hatchlings are carried south westward from the rookery along the east and south coasts in the agulhas current hughes 1974 with some potentially entrained into the south east atlantic where sea surface temperature gradually decreases below 15 c and localised upwelling are permanently present smit et al 2010 generating a high resolution dispersion model for neonate turtles might help elucidate why the swio leatherback population is not increasing while having received the same protection as the swio loggerhead population that is growing exponentially nel et al 2013 this study is thus the first attempt to identify potential dispersal pathways of loggerhead and leatherback turtles from the south african component of the swio populations by combining a high resolution ocean model with a particle tracking framework and in situ observations of hatchling swimming behaviour we hypothesised that 1 dispersal is controlled by oceanic currents and will thus transport post hatchlings in the two ocean basins the south west indian ocean and the south east atlantic ocean basins and 2 neonate dispersal is independent of swimming behaviour and species 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study took place on the north eastern coast of south africa in isimangaliso wetland park kwa zulu natal isimangaliso is a unesco world heritage site ramsar site and comprises contiguous terrestrial and marine protected areas mpas the shoreline is predominantly made up of intermediate beaches with some coarse grained steep reflective beaches interspersed with mixed shores and rocky outcrops harris et al 2011 the beaches form the southernmost nesting grounds of loggerhead caretta caretta cc and leatherback dermochelys coriacea dc sea turtles in the world 27 s the rookery is approximately 200 km long and supports nesting of approximately 1000 loggerhead females and less than 100 leatherback females each year nel et al 2013 the majority of nests are laid north of sodwana and particularly for 5 km north of bhanga nek in the loggerhead nesting hotspot while leatherback nests are distributed over the entire rookery south africa is surrounded by two main boundary currents the agulhas current ac and the benguela current bc the ac forms part of the south west indian ocean sub gyre and flows southwestward along the east coast of south africa following the continental shelf edge eventually retroflecting and flowing eastward back into the south indian ocean fig 1 lutjeharms 2006 the ac has been described as one the strongest western boundary currents in the world and is a highly dynamic current with intense mesoscale 100 km radius variability lutjeharms 2006 casal et al 2009 and is characterised by warm tropical water core temperature is 26 5 c ranging from 24 to 28 c lutjeharms et al 2000 the current is 60 to 100 km wide at the sea surface and speeds in its core can exceed 7 2 km h 1 lambardi et al 2008 cyclonic meanders known as natal pulses forming between 29 s and 30 s where the continental slope and wider shelf present favourable conditions for instabilities and upwelling lutjeharms et al 2000 at the western end of the ac between 39 s and 40 s the current retroflects turning eastward to the indian ocean along the subtropical convergence creating the agulhas return current where the shelf edge separates from the coast at the agulhas bank near 33 s the current is steered away increasing its meandering nature and instability and creating large ring shedding events at the retroflection with warm saline water drifting into the south atlantic ocean boebel et al 2003 the benguela current on the western coast of south africa has distinctly different characteristics compared to the ac it is one of the world s four major eastern boundary upwelling systems that is strongly influenced by rings eddies and filaments spawning from the agulhas retroflection holton et al 2017 veitch and penven 2017 it is a weak eastern boundary current of the se atlantic ocean with drift rate estimates of 5 to 15 km d 1 and characterised by an adjacent wind driven coastal upwelling system the benguella upwelling system comprised of cold nutrient rich water spreading offshore shannon and nelson 1996 wedepohl et al 2000 the near shore located 1 from the coast 13 c permanently upwelled water from the namibian and west coast of south africa 18 s to 35 s is cooler than the offshore boundary water located 15 seaward 18 c santos et al 2012 this complex assemblage of a warm intense and highly dynamic western boundary current and a cold weak eastern boundary current represents the oceanic domain that neonate turtles are exposed to during the first few months of their cryptic oceanic life stage 2 2 in situ hatchling data

atlantic oceans within hindcast outputs from the copernicus marine environment monitoring service copernicus http marine copernicus eu the copernicus product is based on the modelling framework known as nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo madec 2008 the copernicus outputs used here global analysis forecast phy 001 024 has a spatial resolution of 0 08 approximately 6 9 km grid spacing and the model is forced with atmospheric conditions that combine 6 hourly air temperature humidity and wind fields from the era40 reanalysis with climatological radiation and freshwater fluxes from the core dataset see scott et al 2012 2017 for this study the surface layer current velocities 0 493 m were used to advect the virtual hatchlings thus nemo hindcasts resolve mesoscale processes such as oceanic eddies and meanders and has successfully been used to track post hatchling dispersal putman et al 2012a scott et al 2012 2014a 2017 hatchling dispersal scenarios were simulated using the lagrangian particle tracking framework parcels probably a really computationally efficient lagrangian simulator delandmeter 2019 parcels is a virtual particle tracking tool that computes the lagrangian trajectories of virtual particles trajectories and final locations of virtual hatchling particles were plotted and divided into distinct geographical zones to identify hot spot areas and calculate the percentage of virtual hatchlings located in each zone the oceanic regions zones for this study included the mozambique channel the agulhas current together with the retroflection region the agulhas return current the benguela current se atlantic and the southern ocean fig 2 once all the simulations were completed the final positions of the virtual particles were determined the final positions were then extracted to calculate the number of particles that ended up in each of the defined regions 2 4 oceanic variability virtual hatchling dispersal was simulated from two different beaches representing the high and low loggerhead and leatherback turtle nest density beaches bhanga nek being the high density beach for loggerheads and manzengwenya the high density beach for leatherbacks approximately 30 km apart the virtual particles were deployed in the model grid cell adjacent to the model land boundary of the nesting beaches given the marked seasonal variability of the regional surface currents at the nesting grounds the timing of hatchling release is important thus to account for variability in oceanographic conditions virtual hatchlings were released at two different times each coinciding with the peak hatching season for each species 15th february for loggerhead and 15th march for leatherbacks a total of 10 000 particles were released for each scenario in 2017 and 2018 in 2017 a strong eddy was situated offshore of the nesting area while in 2018 a weaker eddy was observed offshore of the nesting beaches hence the experiments provide a suitable example of different offshore oceanic conditions occurring at the nesting grounds to identify if dispersal varies between species and with different swimming behaviours outputs for each scenario included three simulations the first 48 h and 365 days trajectories as well as density plots after one year thus for each year and species we have a total of 14 dispersal scenarios in which different locations dates and swimming behaviours were simulated table 1 we further used a pearson chi squared test with the function chisq test package stats version 3 7 0 in r agresti 2007 to determine if there were significant associations between scenarios and zones a cramer v test was then used to measure the strength of associations between groups mchugh 2013 2 5 hatchling swimming behaviour although post hatchlings were believed to be passive drifters within oceanic currents recent evidence shows that they are in fact active swimmers which influence their dispersal trajectories wyneken et al 2008 putman et al 2012a b 2014 after entering the sea post hatchlings start to swim offshore continuously for about 24 48 h called the frenzy period to reach the main oceanic current salmon and wyneken 1987 wyneken and salmon 1992 to replicate this frenzy period we simulated dispersal for virtual hatchlings to either have or lack an initial swim at different velocities to assess if swimming behaviour influences their final dispersal trajectory particles of virtual hatchlings were programmed to swim offshore for the first 48 h of the simulations to replicate the frenzy behaviour and allow hatchlings to reach the offshore agulhas current swimming speeds that have been simulated for neonate turtles vary widely ranging from 0 15 to 1 07 m s 1 depending on the species and age davenport 1987 hamann et al 2011 gaspar et al 2012 gaspar and lalire 2017 in this study we used our hatchling swimming trial data with a mean se of 0 11 0 06 m s range 0 07 0 40 m s 1 n 412 for loggerhead and 0 15 0 07 m s 1 range 0 06 0 33 m s 1 n 48 for leatherback turtle hatchlings fig s1 we combined these with values from the literature and selected simulated swimming speed of 0 15 m s 1 or 0 54 km h 1 for loggerhead and 0 30 m s 1 or 1 08 km h 1 for leatherback hatchlings these swimming speeds are in accordance with previous studies that found that average swimming velocities were under 1 km h 1 for juvenile loggerheads and around 1 km h 1 for leatherbacks polovina et al 2006 abecassis et al 2013 gaspar and lalire 2017 conservative estimates of swimming speed were chosen as a precautionary approach to avoid overestimating the influence of post hatchling behaviour on their dispersal putman et al 2012a virtual hatchlings were simulated to swim offshore for the first 48 h of the simulation initial swim in accordance with the frenzy behaviour observed in hatchling sea turtles wyneken and salmon 1992 and then to travel with the current and swim for 2 h of active swimming per day for 365 days 2 6 thermal environment and potential hatchling mortality to estimate potential mortality of post hatchlings we assumed that their body temperature closely matches that of the sea temperature and thus use sst as a proxy of hatchling body temperature neonate turtles are known to decrease feeding rate in temperature lower than 20 c have reduced swimming activity in temperature lower than 15 c and die in temperature lower than 10 c for prolonged duration hughes 1974 schwartz 1978 davenport 1997 we therefore assumed that post hatchlings encountering a mean sst 15 c for more than 14 days had a 50 chance of dying and that post hatchlings experiencing a mean sst 10 c for more than 3 days died of cold stunning low survival rates are expected if they are transported into cold water which might be the case in the swio if neonates are entrained in the cold southeast atlantic ocean and southern ocean sst data were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa ghrsst at a spatial resolution of 0 25 with daily values covering the entire study area and tracking period 3 results 3 1 main dispersal pathways of virtual hatchlings in the swio a total of 560 000 virtual hatchling particles were released in the simulations and the two species had very similar broad dispersal patterns most virtual hatchlings initiate their dispersal by being entrained south westward with a core area of dispersal within the agulhas current fig 3 few virtual hatchlings however are advected north from the nesting beaches towards mozambique and this took place only in 2017 table 2 as virtual hatchlings move further offshore and initiate their oceanic journey three main dispersal pathways emerged with hatchlings reaching very different oceanic areas the first two pathways continue in a south westerly direction towards the southern edge of the continent and then split in two most virtual hatchlings remain under the influence of the ac and are carried eastwards via the agulhas retroflection and return current to remain in the south west indian ocean swio this is referred to as the south indian ocean pathway virtual hatchlings following the second pathway are entrained into strong eddies and leaked into the south east atlantic ocean this atlantic pathway leads virtual hatchlings into two possible sub trajectories a northern route adjacent to the west african coast and the benguela current and a southern route further west into the se atlantic lastly the few virtual hatchlings that are advected north into mozambique can be dispersed south of madagascar or into the mozambique channel and will be referred to as the mozambique pathway particle counts after a year of simulated dispersal for each scenario also indicated that there were three main dispersal pathways table 2 the agulhas return zone the southern ocean zone and the se atlantic zone overall these three zones hosted the greatest proportion of virtual hatchlings across scenarios years and for both species the two zones with the least consistent amount of virtual hatchlings were the mozambique channel and the benguela current zones 3 2 oceanic variability although the long term dispersal trajectories of virtual hatchlings under different scenarios follow similar broad patterns the 48 h zoom fig s3 and particle counts indicated some differences between the seven scenarios dispersal scenarios differed within and between years for both species as was expected due to the dynamic nature of the agulhas current table 2 in 2017 virtual hatchlings were retained in the vicinity of the nesting beach or pushed north due to the inshore current except for those that had stronger swimming speed during the frenzy or were released further south these were entrained in the current flowing in a south westerly direction virtual hatchling trajectories that lacked an initial swim or were completely passive had high retention rates at the release site in 2017 scenario 3 fig s3m c the 2018 cohort experienced lower variability in oceanic conditions and the three dominant pathways remained the same for both species with more than 70 of loggerhead and 80 of leatherback particles accounted for in these three pathways table 2 however the majority of virtual loggerhead hatchlings ended in the se atlantic while most leatherback particles ended in the southern ocean 3 3 hatchling swimming behaviour the particle counts revealed that the oceanographic conditions of 2017 resulted in disparate results amongst the scenarios with a high percentage of virtual hatchlings being advected north into the mozambique channel zone for scenarios with either no frenzy scenario4 or no swimming at all scenario 5 for both loggerhead 64 8 and 64 9 and leatherback 76 4 and 76 2 virtual hatchlings tables 2 and 3 furthermore higher variability was found in 2017 for loggerhead virtual hatchlings than leatherbacks with the highest number of particles having an end trajectory in the agulhas current retained in the vicinity of the release site for scenarios with slower swimming speed scenarios 2 with 25 2 and 3 with 26 8 respectively compared to leatherbacks with highest numbers in the southern ocean zone for the same scenarios 32 7 and 33 5 the dominant end trajectory for loggerhead virtual hatchlings in 2018 was the se atlantic zone except for scenario 1 with a stronger swimming speed that took virtual hatchlings in the agulhas return zone 37 6 and for scenario 6 with a change in release date that advected hatchlings in the southern ocean zone 33 5 this variability was also noticeable for leatherbacks but particles only deviated from the dominant zone southern ocean in scenario 6 with a later release date 32 6 additionally the scenario with the stronger swimming speed during the frenzy swim took loggerhead virtual hatchlings further offshore fig s2a compared to any other scenario but this was not observed in 2018 fig s2b these findings are supported by the correlation tests that indicated the strongest positive associations between scenarios 1 6 and 7 i e fastest initial offshore swim later release in march or further south in low density area release with the majority of particles ending in the ar sea and so fig s8 however the cramer v test indicated a moderate association among these scenarios in 2017 cramer v test 0 30 and a weak association in 2018 cramer v test 0 11 3 4 thermal environment and potential hatchling mortality we assumed that virtual hatchlings encountering a mean sst of less than 15 c for more than 14 days had a 50 chance of dying and that those experiencing a mean sst equal or less than 10 c for more than 3 days died of cold stunning by overlaying the sst encountered by virtual hatchlings throughout their first year of dispersal we estimated the potential cold induced mortality the sst values indicated that only the southern ocean and benguela current zones had temperatures low enough to impact post hatchling survival only a very small fraction of virtual hatchings ended in the benguela current tables 2 and 3 and of these no loggerheads or leatherbacks encountered sst values to equal or less than 10 c for three days or more in 2017 or 2018 which could have induced hypothermia or mortality table 3 however loggerhead virtual hatchlings encountered sst values equal or less to 15 c for more than 14 days in decreasing order for 15 1 of scenario 1 12 2 of scenario 11 7 for scenario 1 7 8 for scenarios 2 and 3 and lowest percentage for scenarios 4 and 5 1 9 and 1 8 respectively had 50 chance of mortality in the southern ocean and overall very low numbers equal or less than 2 of encountering 10 c sst across all scenarios in 2017 the fraction of virtual hatchlings that encountered cold temperatures 50 chance of hypothermia and experiencing 15 c sst for more than 14 days in the southern ocean were higher in 2018 the highest percentage for scenario 1 25 5 followed by scenario 6 22 8 scenario 4 19 9 scenario 5 19 3 with the lowest being scenario 7 15 7 interestingly the lowest mortalities for both temperatures in the southern ocean were found for the scenarios with no frenzy swim scenario 4 or completely passive scenario 5 but only in 2017 3 5 comparison of loggerhead and leatherback dispersal patterns despite broad apparent similarities a closer examination of our results revealed important differences in dispersal patterns of loggerhead and leatherback virtual hatchlings almost no virtual leatherback hatchlings were advected north into the mozambique channel zone for the scenarios with no frenzy swim scenario 4 0 3 or where they were completely passive scenario 5 0 4 compared to 60 for loggerhead particles from the same scenarios table 2 and figs 3 and 4 this is also evident on the 48 h maps figs s3e i c g additionally the dominant end zone changed with a change in release location scenario 6 2017 being the southern ocean but the agulhas return current with a change in date of release scenario 7 2018 fig s3 highlighting the impact of ocean variability near the nesting sites similar to loggerheads no virtual leatherback hatchlings encountered 10 c sst s in the benguela current zone in either years however some particles in the southern ocean zone encountered 10 c water for more than three days in both years 2017 having lower mortalities 2 for each scenario and 2018 yielding higher potential mortalities for scenarios 3 with 4 8 and 4 5 for scenario 2 table 3 more leatherback particles had a 50 chance of mortality by experiencing 15 c sst s than loggerheads furthermore percentages were more than double in the southern ocean in 2018 compared to 2017 with scenario 3 having the highest number 52 4 followed by scenario 7 52 2 scenario 2 49 8 scenario 1 34 1 and scenarios 5 4 6 in descending order 4 discussion the simulations of the present study provided insight into a significant knowledge gap regarding the spatial distribution of post hatchling sea turtles and present the first estimate of neonate dispersal in the swio the south african component of the swio turtle rookery is unique because hatchlings dispersing from these nesting beaches enter very complex and dynamic oceanic conditions linking two extremely contrasting ocean basins in this study we simulated the potential dispersal pathways of loggerhead and leatherback sea turtle hatchlings in the two ocean basins and assessed the effect of swimming behaviour on their dispersal trajectories as well as compare the effect of varying coastal and oceanic conditions on these trajectories similar to other research our model suggests that post hatchling dispersal is influenced by a combination of oceanic variability and hatchling initial swimming behaviour gaspar et al 2012 putman and he 2013 4 1 post hatchling dispersal pathways in the swio dispersal trajectories of virtual hatchling of both species in the swio are under the direct influence of the ac during the first month at sea moving rapidly south eastward along the coast within the current after reaching the southern tip of africa they can then follow two main pathways the first and main pathway remains under the influence of the ac and leads virtual hatchlings into the agulhas retroflection and then into the eastward flowing agulhas return current returning virtual hatchlings to the warm waters of the south indian ocean the second pathway entrains virtual hatchlings into the agulhas rings and forces them to cross ocean basins to be transported into the se atlantic ocean this is in accordance with oceanographic and modelling research that found that 60 of modelled agulhas current flow follows the retroflection and 40 flows into the se atlantic hermes et al 2007 the results suggested that the simulated active and passive dispersal trajectories of virtual hatchlings are broadly similar and mostly influenced by ocean currents during their first year of dispersal validating our first hypothesis that post hatchling dispersal would mainly be controlled by water circulation this finding is in accordance with other studies for several sea turtle populations and species gaspar et al 2012 putman and mansfield 2015 the similarity between the passive and active dispersal simulations in this study indicates that the simulated swimming speeds of virtual hatchlings are very weak compared to the current velocities of the study region this is not surprising as the ac is a fast flowing western boundary current and evidence suggests that even bigger juvenile turtles under 30 cm have average swimming speeds under 1 km h 1 abecassis et al 2013 which is much less than the ac mean surface velocity exceeding 3 4 km h lutjeharms 2006 this finding is similar to other dispersal studies where strong western boundary currents are present such as the kurushio current in the western pacific which controls leatherback and loggerhead hatchlings dispersal for the first two years of their lives ascani et al 2016 gaspar and lalire 2017 as hatchlings grow and reach 3 to 4 years their swimming abilities improve enabling them to actively target favourable habitats 4 2 oceanic variability oceanic conditions vary considerably between years demonstrated by the comparison between 2017 and 2018 these conditions resulted in different endpoints of virtual hatchlings after one year of simulation in 2017 a landward current pushes particles towards the continent whereas the dominant current in 2018 is parallel to the coast with the presence of an eddy taking particles away from the nesting beach southward oceanic circulation at the nesting site is strongly influenced by eddies which develop in the mozambique channel and move along the eastern coast of south africa due to these strong mesoscale features there is a high level of variability in oceanic conditions offshore of the nesting beaches but also along the entire length of the ac and south african coast lutjeharms et al 2007 braby et al 2016 the high variability in ocean currents within or adjacent to the ac provide strong evidence that virtual hatchlings can become trapped and retained in eddies near or downstream of their release locations or entrained into the inshore northward current this is supported by stranding data showing that most strandings of sea turtle hatchlings occur along the south coast of south africa with very little on the east coast close to the release site de wet 2012 this highlights the dynamic nature of the environment in that two consecutive years are that much different although long term variability in ocean currents might affect the outcome of hatchling dispersal which ultimately remain unpredictable depending on the oceanic conditions of a given year we therefore recommend caution when extrapolating from these results due to the low number of releases replicates at different days or locations 4 3 hatchling swimming behaviour our second hypothesis which proposed that hatchling swimming behaviour will have little effect on their trajectory was poorly supported in this study we tested a variety of hypothetical swimming scenarios and concluded that the dispersal of post hatchlings is affected by active swimming especially during the swimming frenzy period first 48 h this finding agrees with growing evidence showing that hatchling swimming behaviour can influence dispersal estimates hamann et al 2011 briscoe et al 2017 fewest hatchlings will strand with the fastest offshore swimming speed during the frenzy period scenario 1 which seems supported by standing data de wet 2012 the density plots and the particle count of our passive and active simulations also indicate that passive virtual hatchlings have higher retention rates at the nesting site hatchling strandings close to the nesting beaches is rarely observed de wet 2012 consequently virtual hatchlings with faster swimming speeds are less likely to be trapped in the inshore northward current and demonstrates that post hatchlings do engage in active swimming 4 4 thermal environment and potential mortality low temperatures are known to negatively affect sea turtles whose internal temperature follow that of the ambient temperature closely mansfield and putman 2013 christiansen et al 2016 a decline in sst can cause a similar decrease in circulation oxygen uptake and metabolic processes causing marked physiological changes potentially leading to decreased growth and cold stunning hochscheid et al 2004 the analysis of sst conditions in our study revealed that survival rates and thus fitness of virtual hatchlings varied depending on the location of the particles end trajectory in the different marine zones of the two zones where hypothermia could occur the southern ocean zone had much higher potential mortality at 15 c for more than 14 days than the benguela current zone surprisingly no virtual hatchlings encountered sst of 10 c or less for more than three days however due to the strong variability in oceanic conditions validating this finding should be an important priority for future research and the model should be run for several years and for longer periods to assess if this finding represents real conditions and whether seasonal and interannual signals can be quantified favourable conditions of greater food availability are expected to be correlated with greater primary productivity and chlorophyll concentrations which are generally associated with features such as eddies and fronts polovina et al 2000 this is because upwellings occur at the centre of eddies and convergence at the edge where forage and preys concentrate polovina et al 2006 this suggests that post hatchling sea turtles would be able to reach more favourable developmental habitats through directional swimming and consequently increasing their fitness although feeding and growth rates of turtles generally decrease at colder temperatures hochscheid et al 2004 the higher food availability might compensate for this and be beneficial to young turtles as would be the case for virtual hatchling entering the se atlantic this zone is highly productive shannon and nelson 1996 hutchings et al 2009 and might be favoured due to increased foraging opportunities thus it appears that there is a trade off between a suitable thermal environment and food availability usually found in colder waters and the survival of neonate turtles might depend on their ability to reach and remain in habitats offering both warm water and food resources p gaspar and lalire 2017 the availability of thermally beneficial habitat sst and food resources are potentially the two most important factors affecting the fitness and survival of neonate sea turtles as was found by other studies abecassis et al 2013 mansfield et al 2014 varo cruz et al 2016 unfortunately we cannot relate the simulated mortality to our virtual hatchlings energetics because our particles do not have a behaviour such as in an individual based model where each particle has a specific behaviour and thus do not exhibit the same behaviour as real hatchlings do in terms of energy depletion hence our virtual hatchlings do not swim towards favourable conditions where food availability and water temperatures might be optimal we only overlapped our simulated dispersal trajectories to the temperature of the region the particles find themselves in giving each virtual particles its own behaviour would be the next step forward to improve our model 4 5 dissimilarities between species the subsequent part of the second hypothesis stating that post hatchling dispersal is independent of species was partially supported in this paper both species follow similar pathways in 2018 during the initial phase of their dispersal being under the influenced of the ac flowing south westward however detailed observations revealed that there were interspecies differences a large proportion 60 of loggerhead virtual hatchlings were advected northward in the near shore coastal current into the mozambique channel in 2017 while this was not observed for leatherbacks suggesting that their stronger swimming abilities carries them further offshore however it is important to note that our model does not resolve well small scale near shore processes taking place near the nesting beaches which are likely to influence the trajectory of virtual particles especially in the initial phase furthermore the simulation outputs of our one year models show that virtual hatchling emerging from south african beaches reach two main different oceanic areas that in turn affect their fitness and potential survival the highly dynamic and complex oceanic conditions of the region present hatchlings with diverse marine habitats that confer varying levels of fitness to neonate turtles virtual loggerhead particles appear to follow ring shedding events off the agulhas retroflection and then are transported into the se atlantic zone with on average less lethal temperatures than the southern ocean zone where more leatherbacks particles occur this dominant loggerhead dispersal pathway might be a result of their weaker swimming speed that carry them on the inshore of the ac as oppose to leatherbacks that could be entrained further offshore on the outer edge of the ac leading them further south this is supported by the annual stranding data with only occasional leatherback strandings around south africa while several dozens of loggerheads are stranded each year after the hatching season along the south and eastern coastline of south africa de wet 2012 consequently it appears that of the two dominant zones the se atlantic confers higher fitness benefits to neonate turtles compared to the southern ocean the higher potential mortality of leatherback virtual hatchlings in the southern ocean is consistent with the lack of recovery of the species compare to loggerheads exponential increase in the south african rookery nel et al 2013 although different threats might apply at different life stages cold induced mortality for post hatchlings and fisheries bycatch for adults this is surprising as leatherback turtles are able to maintain higher body temperatures than the surrounding water james and mrosovsky 2004 bostrom et al 2010 and we assumed that they would have a survival advantage if dispersed into colder waters however their thermal ability might only be effective at older age classes which could explain why they have higher mortality than loggerheads in this study interestingly our findings coupled with satellite data from south africa demonstrate that adult female post nesting migrations luschi et al 2006 lambardi et al 2008 harris et al 2017 robinson et al 2018 may be similar to our virtual hatchling dispersal found in this study and provides further support for the hypothesis that adult foraging migrations reflect their previous experiences as hatchlings hays et al 2010 scott et al 2014a however more satellite data on both adults and juveniles are needed to verify this hypothesis 4 6 implications for sea turtle fitness and conservation water temperatures experienced by neonates are not the only temperature related threats climate change can also potentially affect hatchling fitness and survival as a result of increased global temperature incubation temperature is expected to rise with skewed sex ratios hawkes et al 2009 incubation periods shorten and produce smaller hatchlings with decreased crawling and swimming speed ischer et al 2009 sim et al 2015 sea turtles have may mitigate these negative effects by altering their nesting phenology nesting earlier or later or by expanding their range poleward expansion hawkes et al 2009 rees et al 2016 butler 2019 a change in the timing of nesting has already been reported in some turtle populations selecting for cooler portion of the nesting season to maintain favourable thermal conditions mazaris et al 2008 saba et al 2012 pike 2013a butt et al 2016 carreras et al 2019 however even if nesting and incubation are successful it does not guarantee successful recruitment if the subsequent dispersal thermal environment does not ensure post hatchling survival our simulation results suggest that nesting earlier later in the season or further south would result in higher potential mortality of post hatchlings during their oceanic dispersal due to hypothermia thus even if they incubate and hatch successfully by nesting earlier later or further south the majority of hatchlings may not survive hence although sea turtles have the ability to adapt to climate change population viability is dependent on survival across all life stages these adaptations may only partially offset the impacts of climate change and may lead sea turtles to nest in suboptimal habitats resulting in ecological traps pike 2013b patel et al 2016 the validation of model outputs remains challenging due to the paucity of direct observations of hatchling spatial distribution at sea hamann et al 2011 gaspar et al 2012 despite these limitations lagrangian analyses and oceanographic models provide a first estimate of post hatchling dispersal which can be enhanced and simulations re run as our understanding of hatchling behavioural ecology improves a shortcoming of our post hatchling dispersal simulations is that our model does not incorporate detailed information about the local inshore currents present in the coastal waters adjacent to the nesting beaches and thus might not represent the oceanic conditions of the frenzy accurately godley et al 2010 future research could assess the inshore currents off the rookery and add the subsequent data into the simulations to enhance our model resolution this would allow to accurately represent the northward movement of loggerhead hatchlings that are entrained in the inshore counter current into mozambican waters secondly the model could be improved and validated by using nano satellite and acoustic tags on post hatchlings leaving the nesting beaches to obtain information on their initial frenzy behaviour direction duration etc mansfield et al 2014 scott et al 2014b this would allow to get a better estimate of leatherback swimming speed as we may have overestimated our modelled swim speed in comparison to our field experiments and a bigger sample size might have corrected for this and other literature values davenport 1987 that only had such high values for subsurface swim it would also be beneficial to identify optimal habitat temperature and abundance of prey for neonate turtles by adding primary production data to the model as a proxy for optimal foraging areas and identify hot spots of higher probability of turtle presence abecassis et al 2013 it would be equally beneficial to also include growth data under different temperature regimes and run simulations for longer time period gaspar and lalire 2017 as turtle hatchlings occupy sea surface habitats they are bound to be impacted by wind as observed by increased stranding numbers during storm events de wet 2012 and shown by monzon arguello et al 2012 and future simulations should incorporate a wind factor in the model lastly high resolution ocean velocity fields from nemo are only available from 2007 to present and it could also be advantageous to run simulations further back in the past and for longer durations for different years and would allow identifying dispersal origin and connections from other rookeries such as australia for loggerheads and gabon for leatherbacks putman et al 2014 this back tracking approach has been successfully used to predict genetic connectivity in sea turtles naro maciel et al 2017 shamblin et al 2017 jensen et al 2020 thus further simulations incorporating the data mentioned above would be valuable to confirm the results described in this study and improve our knowledge of this cryptic stage of sea turtle life cycle 4 7 summary our simulations provide a first estimate of loggerhead and leatherback post hatchling dispersal in the swio the model combined an individual based particle tracking model with empirical data of hatchling swimming behaviour to identify dispersal pathways of two species of sea turtles nesting in south africa the post hatchling dispersal of both loggerhead and leatherback turtle populations in the swio is unique because it encompasses two very contrasting ocean basins the warm swio and the cold se atlantic ocean basins the ac is one of the strongest western boundary currents in the world which forms a conduit for inter ocean exchange beal et al 2011 and provides sea turtle hatchlings in the southwestern indian ocean with a unique habitat and suite of challenges although oceanic currents appear to be the main factor influencing the oceanic dispersal of neonate turtles our results show that hatchling initial swimming behaviour also shape their dispersal pathway simulation outputs from this research provide a better understanding of the at sea distribution of sea turtles during their early life stages by identifying developmental areas and thus could inform management and generate effective conservation measures for threatened species casale and mariani 2014 gaspar and lalire 2017 putman et al 2020 notwithstanding that we still do not know where south african juvenile turtles are distributed and only then could we conserve them effectively since static protected areas may be inadequate for highly migratory species such as sea turtles dynamic protected areas as well as temporary spatial closures may be more suitable and allow connectivity between developmental foraging and reproductive areas grantham et al 2008 maxwell et al 2015 credit authorship contribution statement diane z m le gouvello conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation resources
