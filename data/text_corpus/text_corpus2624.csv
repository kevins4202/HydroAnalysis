and realized the directional production of ocfa continuously and steadily in the process of anaerobic co digestion with disused grease and aerobic sludge for that purpose the anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr was performed under 9 64 0 5 g l of mixed liquid suspended solids mlss and 7 14 d hydraulic residence time hrt conditions on focus the initial nh4 concentration of each cycle was adjusted to enrich propionic acid and maintain the stable operation of asbr for the directional production of ocfa experimental results demonstrated that this process facilitated the enrichment of associated propionic acid generating bacteria with the maximal ocfa yields of 3889 24 mg l volatile fatty acids vfas yield 2240 06 2941 12 mg l ocfa vfas 86 48 90 95 and various ecological conditions gradually stabilized during the operation of asbr moreover the concentration of inorganic ion po4 3 22 65 28 15 mg l and nh4 63 01 108 94 mg l were within the regulatory range available for downstream processes therefore the asbr process can be used for the continuous and stable production of ocfa graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic co digestion odd carbon volatile fatty acids ocfa anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr disused grease microbial community structure 1 introduction household food waste and sewage sludge are by products of urban life and wastewater treatment process which belong to an important part of urban organic solid waste household food waste is one of the main sources of urban environmental pollution and seriously threatens people s daily life and health 1 municipal sewage sludge contains a large number of toxic and harmful substances such as heavy metals organic micropollutants pathogenic microorganisms and parasites eggs 2 etc if no reasonable disposition it is easy to cause secondary air and water pollution and the surrounding ecological environment how to reasonably dispose and manage is an expensive and environmentally sensitive problem at present the treatment methods are mainly landfill incineration and sludge composting so it is urgent to explore harmless methods of resource treatment low cost anaerobic fermentation technology which can actively respond to the latest call of carbon neutrality and the concept of green development is an effective biological treatment method to produce volatile fatty acids basic terminal products with the purpose of dual resource utilization for solid waste 3 4 has broad development prospects in the previous studies anaerobic co digestion technology of disused grease with sewage sludge was mainly applied in the production of volatile fatty acids vfas and methane 5 6 besides it also focused on the directional production of odd carbon volatile fatty acids ocfa by optimizing process operations 7 changing acidizing conditions such as ph substrate concentration hydraulic retention time etc and regulating substrates 8 9 garcia aguirre found that the vfas production could be directed towards desired products that are appropriate for the scope of application by means of waste stream selection and process parameters control i e process ph and temperature 10 the influence of other operational parameters i e retention time and organic loading rate has been also studied by several authors 11 13 as a kind of green intermediate product of anaerobic digestion ocfa are widely used in the area of sewage treatment and sludge reduction they are not only important carbon sources for the synthesis process of polyhydroxyalkanoates phas but also determine the proportion of hydroxy valerate hv in phas polymer 14 the higher the ratio of hv phas the better the elasticity and flexibility of the biodegradable bioplastics and the better the processability 15 16 moreover ocfa can also improve the efficiency of biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal bnr which is strongly dependent on the presence of available vfas 17 18 bnr can be achieved through the transformation of ocfa especially propionic acid and iso valeric acid to phas which were conventionally considered as a key energy source for biological p removal 19 20 disused grease oil fat and aerobic sludge are rich in organic components and nutrients such as c n and p elements required for microbial growth and metabolism 21 with good recyclable value 22 23 the directional production of ocfa by co anaerobic fermentation of disused grease and aerobic sludge is conducive to the harmlessness and reduction of solid waste which can not only realize the reuse of waste resources but also solve the existing problems of large surplus of disused grease and insufficient carbon source during the process of sewage treatment furthermore it can also realize the directional regulation of the performance of phas terminal products and effectively reduce the cost of phas synthesis which has broad development prospects and far reaching practical engineering significance the preliminary studies found that the anaerobic co digestion of disused grease oil and fat with aerobic sludge could not only meet the demands of low operation cost and simple operation process while obtaining high ocfa yield and ocfa vfas in the co digestion liquid 24 25 however the preliminary tests were mainly based on batch tests to explore the working conditions and high ocfa vfas could be obtained only when the fermentation peak was strictly controlled on a certain day ocfa cannot be supplied continuously and stably which makes it difficult to meet the supply demand of carbon sources of the downstream process such as phas and bnr therefore in order to meet the needs of low cost and stability of downstream processes in carbon source production and achieve the regulation of product performance it is necessary to further explore the more cheap and stable operation of the directional acidizing process the anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr was developed based on the sequencing batch reactor and had been successfully applied in laboratory and pilot scales for the treatment of high concentration wastewater including landfill leachate slaughterhouse wastewater municipal sludge dairy and beer wastewater 26 30 etc because of its higher organic loading rate compared with the traditional continuous stirred tank reactor asbr can better adapt to the environment with high organic load and ensure the stability of anaerobic co digestion reaction systems besides the long sedimentation period of asbr leads to good biological flocculation and solid liquid separation effects while the floating of large pieces of sludge can also be blocked by setting a solid liquid separation plate 31 32 therefore it is feasible to directional produce ocfa continuously and stably through the anaerobic co digestion of disused grease and sludge by asbr on the basis of previous studies this study explored a continuous and stable directional acidification process to meet the practical production application under the conditions of controlling the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss hydraulic residence time hrt especially the concentration of nh4 disused grease oil fat and aerobic sludge were treated for anaerobic co digestion using a pilot scale asbr reactor on focus the initial nh4 concentration of each cycle was adjusted to enrich propionic acid and maintain the stable operation of asbr for the directional production of ocfa 33 as a necessary element for the growth and proliferation of microorganisms nh4 was consumed greatly and depended strongly on the reaction system the changes in ecological conditions of fermentation broth during the operation of asbr reactor were investigated meanwhile at the microbial level the main dominant bacteria were confirmed through the analysis of microbial community structure thus the main objective of this study was to realize the directed production of ocfa by asbr and disclose the underlying mechanisms which had provided good guiding significance on the conversion of high value added products from practical wastes 2 materials and methods 2 1 pretreatment and preparation of materials 2 1 1 substrates and inoculum substrates disused grease mainly include waste frying oil swill floating oil and fat 34 which were provided by a canteen located in guangzhou university guangzhou china after further manual screening and flushing to remove residual food additives and grease impurities spilled at high temperatures they were cut and homogenized through a professional blender compared with different inoculums 35 considering the fermentation phase and acid production aerobic sludge used as inoculum was obtained from an aerobic tank in the anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process of a sewage treatment plant located in guangzhou china the sludge was filtered through a no 5 mesh sieve sieve pore is 0 18 mm 0 18 mm to remove unwanted particles and prevent clogging after which it was acclimated with disused grease at 4 5 c before use 2 1 2 fermentation liquid preparation previous studies have found that the fat content had a significant effect on the acid production of hogwash waste grease while the maximal vfas and ocfa yields were achieved with a fat content of 10 g l 25 to obtain a higher yield of ocfa fermentation liquid was prepared with disused grease and sludge by controlling the fat content of 10 g l accurately weigh 30 g of waste fat 3 g of frying waste oil and swill floating oil respectively stir evenly at the same time diluted the volume to 300 ml with deionized water for later use the initial characteristics of the prepared fermentation liquid and aerobic sludge were shown in table 1 2 2 bioreactor set up and stabilizing fermentation system 2 2 1 bioreactor the anaerobic sequencing batch reactor 600 ml working volume used in the test is shown in a schematic diagram in fig 1 the gas ch4 h2 co2 etc that may be generated during the process was quantified with a collection bag in the upper space of reactor while a sampling port was fitted to the upper head of reactor to collect the liquid samples moreover the nitrogen flushing outlet was arranged at the bottom to maintain the strict anaerobic state of the reaction system while the water outlet was arranged in the middle of the reactor for the discharge of fermentation broth the whole reactor was placed on a magnetic stirrer and equipped with a thermostat regulator and a rotational regulator and there was no obvious gas production in the whole fermentation process 2 2 2 system stability maintenance and operational process the asbr reactor was operated at a constant temperature of 35 c with a 7 14 d hydraulic retention time hrt for 20 d and each cycle was 5 d for each cycle the feeding time was 10 min while the sedimentation time was 30 min in this study the reactor was filled with 167 8 ml aerobic sludge and 300 ml prepared fermentation liquid that was sustained for 5 days after initial feeding of the prepared fermentation liquid mixture into the bioreactor the microbial inoculum was added at nearly 9 64 0 5 g l of mlss to activate the process as per our previous study when finishing a cycle of reaction we discharged 420 ml of fermentation liquid after stable delamination of the system 30 of the mixture was retained and then we started the next test before entering the next reaction cycle nh4 concentration was adjusted to the concentration at the beginning of the first cycle reaction 114 05 mg l 5 with ammonium chloride to maintain the stable operation of asbr system 33 making it more conducive to the accumulation of propionic acid during the operation of asbr the changes in ecological conditions of the fermentation broth were determined every day to monitor the stability of asbr system and effluent properties additionally we collected samples with the highest yield concentration of vfas at 4 d a1 and 19 d a4 to analyze their microbial community structures the reactor was always kept in a strict anaerobic state by blowing high purity nitrogen and the mixing rotator speeds were adjusted at 700 50 rpm with the feeding cycles and filtration being performed through a peristaltic pump every day the initial characterization of the start up of asbr unit has been reported in table 1 2 3 analytical methods the analyses of total solids ts volatile solids vs nh4 n concentration po4 3 p concentration total phosphorous tp and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were measured based on the standard analytic methods promulgated by

programmed to rise from 80 to 110 c in 2 min and then rise to 200 c with an elevation of 10 c min during the analysis at the same time nitrogen gas flow rate 50 ml min was used as a carrier 2 4 microbial community structure high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing the characterization of the bacterial communities was performed on samples a1 and a4 utilizing a high throughput 16s rrna gene

taxonomic units otus abundances were assigned using the rdp classifier according to the sequence similarity with a 97 identity threshold 3 results and discussions 3 1 changes of vfas total amount and profile during asbr reaction process 3 1 1 vfas concentration and ocfa production ocfa were the target products of the anaerobic co digestion test while vfas production was used as a major parameter to compare the performance of the reactors and to monitor the acidification degree of disused grease and sludge throughout the study fig 2 shows the variations of vfas ocfa even carbon volatile fatty acids ecfa yields and ocfa vfas mass fraction during the operation of asbr the concentration of vfas increased greatly in the first two cycles while tended to be stable in the last two cycles as the main substrates being fermented disused grease contributed a large part of vfas yield during the process of reaction in addition in the initial operation of the reaction part of aerobic sludge was also used by hydrolytic bacteria and digestion acid producing bacteria such as clostridium and bacteroides as substrates due to the failure to adapt to the environment of high oil content and high organic load 34 39 40 which contributed part of vfas production while in the later stage of the reaction although the sludge would still be hydrolyzed its hydrolysis rate decreased gradually due to the adaptation to the conditions of the reaction system that s why vfas production in the first two cycles was higher than that in the last two cycles from the point of view of a single cycle the total amount of vfas increased at first and then decreased until it reached the maximum yield on the fourth day the maximum vfas concentrations were 3515 99 mg l 4 d 4388 24 mg l 9 d 2917 61 mg l 14 d and 2941 12 mg l respectively we also noticed that the vfas yields decreased slightly at the end of each cycle firstly continuous production of vfas led to partial vfas accumulation in asbr during the anaerobic digestion the partial high content of vfas may increase the acid inhibition for acid forming bacteria and promote the growth of acid utilizing bacteria which was adverse to the vfas accumulation 41 besides as the representatives of animal fat and vegetable oil respectively waste fat and frying oil contained a large number of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids which were easy to produce long chain fatty acids glycerol and other acids after β oxidative hydrolysis while vfas were easy to be converted to the stage of hydrogen and acetic acid production because of the poor stability 42 43 however it was obvious that the vfas yields at the end of the last two cycles decreased hardly which further illustrated the stability of this process in the production of vfas similarly the ocfa yield and ocfa vfas were also fluctuated greatly in the first two cycles while tended to be stable in the last two cycles the maximum ocfa yields of the four cycles were 3129 23 mg l 4 d 3889 24 mg l 9 d 2646 46 mg l 14 d and 2679 29 mg l 20 d while the maximum ocfa vfas were 89 00 4 d 88 67 10 d 90 15 15 d and 90 95 20 d in other words ocfa vfas slightly increased with the progress of the reaction and tended to be stable on the one hand the operating condition of asbr system multi cycle and high organic load was beneficial to the enrichment of bacteria related to ocfa production resulting in a continuous increase of ocfa vfas in the reactor on the other hand previous research works found that ecfa were the main products when the substrate of anaerobic digestion reaction was only sludge 44 46 while the ocfa especially the propionic acid were the main products when the substrate of anaerobic digestion reaction was grease 47 in this paper with the progress of the reaction most of the available sludge had been consumed and then the main fermentation substrate was disused grease which caused the production of propionic acid furthermore the production of propionic acid was provided with strong stability 48 according to the gibbs free energy analysis propionic acid degradation was difficult to spontaneous reaction 49 which led to the gradual accumulation of ocfa that s why ocfa vfas gradually increased while the ecfa vfas decreased within one cycle cycle 3 and cycle 4 it was noted that the total concentrations of vfas and ocfa vfas obtained show that the highest vfas production and ocfa vfas 4388 24 mg l and 90 95 throughout the asbr process was slightly higher than batch test 4219 20 mg l and 89 00 under the same conditions 35 this showed that the optimized process can achieve the same high yields of vfas and ocfa as the batch experiment even better while maintaining its stability furthermore the range of ocfa vfas was 76 62 90 95 and the maximum concentration difference of vfas was less than 5 in the later stage of the process the data here achieved suggested that the asbr reactor can be used to ocfa directional production stably through the anaerobic co digestion of disused grease with aerobic sludge 3 1 2 vfas composition analysis in order to further discuss the performance of reaction products the vfas components of obtained samples 4 d 9 d 14 d and 19 d with the maximum vfas concentrations were also analyzed in this study the distribution of vfas at the highest yield of vfas in each cycle was shown in fig 3 the vfas components detected consisted mainly of acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid iso butyric acid valeric acid and iso valeric acid in this cultivation propionic acid was the main product of anaerobic co digestion in all reaction cycles 84 76 80 94 82 48 and 82 78 respectively while the acetic acid accounted for 5 27 9 67 of total vfas which decreased gradually with the progress of asbr and on the contrary the valeric acid increases gradually from 1 to 8 96 these results were consistent with previous research works 35 the results of existing studies showed that soluble polysaccharides and proteins dissolved by sludge were easily converted directly to acetic acid 50 this situation occurred in the initial stage of the reaction with the maximum amount of available sludge and the acetic acid decreased with the decrease of available sludge gradually during the progress of the anaerobic co digestion reaction the increase of valeric acid was related to the degradation and utilization of protein besides in the acetic acid producing stage due to the inhibition of the degradation pathway from valeric acid to acetic acid resulting in the gradual decrease of acetic acid and the gradual increase of valeric acid the concentrations of butyric acid iso butyric acid and iso valeric acid were generally less than 1 and out of consideration stable asbr operation led propionic acid to be the main fermentation product 82 80 of total vfas followed by valeric acid acetic acid butyric acid iso butyric acid and iso valeric acid accounted for 8 96 5 27 1 44 0 80 and 0 75 of total vfas respectively the results evidenced the stability and feasibility of ocfa directional production 3 2 changes of ecological conditions of fermentation system the ecological conditions of fermentation system including nh4 po4 3 scod scodvfas scod ph and opr were also detected regularly to monitor the stability of asbr reaction fig 4 the first date was determined after one day of reaction and so on in addition to the vfas total amount and profile that will affect the performance of phas terminal products the inorganic components of fermentation system such as nh4 and po4 3 fig 4a will also have an impact on the phas synthesis process 51 52 it can be observed that during the whole reaction process except for a slight increase on the second day the nh4 concentration showed a downward trend in varying degrees with a fluctuation range of 63 01 108 94 mg l which was within the controllable range of downstream process utilization as a necessary element for the growth and proliferation of microorganisms the concentration of nh4 showed a downward trend obviously in each cycle indicating that nh4 was consumed greatly and depended strongly on the reaction system therefore it s vital to adjust the initial nh4 concentration of each cycle in the reaction process for the stable operation of asbr while the concentration of po4 3 fluctuated greatly with an upward trend in the first 3 days of the reaction and then began to decrease continuously until it gradually stabilized in the range of 22 65 28 15 mg l in the last two cycles due to failure to adapt to asbr reaction a large amount of sludge was cracked at the initial stage of anaerobic co digestion reaction resulting in the release rate of po4 3 in the system was greater than its consumption rate and its external performance was the increase of po4 3 concentration then with the continued proliferation of dominant strains consuming po4 3 the concentration of po4 3 began to decrease until the bioreactor reached a state of dynamic equilibrium furthermore the decrement of nh4 and po4 3 concentration were also related to the hydrolysis and acidification of fermentation broth as the main hydrolysates of sludge and disused grease vfas existed widely in the fermentation system the previous studies have demonstrated that vfas as the additional carbon source could result in superior bnr performance 53 54 scod and scodvfas scod fig 4b were also important indexes to evaluate the utilization and transformation ability of organic substrates in the reaction system which indicated the hydrolysis degree of macromolecular organic matter during the operation of asbr reaction system the concentration of scod with an obvious growth trend in the early stage of all reaction cycles was related to the hydrolysis and dissolution of insoluble macromolecular organic matter which increased the concentration of soluble organic matter in the fermentation broth in addition the scod concentrations at the end of each cycle were 6600 8280 7000 and 7060 mg l respectively in this study about 30 of the fermentation liquid and sludge mixture was reserved at the end of each cycle so that scod can be retained into the next cycle resulting in the concentration of scod in other cycles was higher than that in cycle 1 and stabilize gradually in last two cycles 4880 7060 mg l with the stable operation of asbr the maximum values of scodvfas scod from cycle 1 to cycle 4 were 80 54 77 06 72 13 and 73 30 respectively which can be explained that the soluble by products and intermediate products such as succinic acid and lactic acid accumulated with the progress of asbr reaction resulting in a decrease of scodvfas scod when the fermentation reaction was operated stably in asbr system the smaller fluctuation range of scodvfas scod 46 71 73 3 in the latter cycles illustrated the stability of the operation process although scodvfas scod had decreased it was still significantly higher than the results of previous similar studies 47 furthermore in the final effluent of asbr with the maximum of ocfa vfas the nutritional compositions of fermentation broth were c n 105 1 and c p 350 1 they were slightly different from the optimum ratio c n 125 1 and c p 750 1 required by the process of phas synthesis while also belonged to the controllable range 51 55 which made it possible for the effluent to be further used for phas production finally fig 4c described the changes of ph and orp obtained from the whole mixture during the operation of bioreactor ph and orp were also important ecological factors of the organic anaerobic digestion process having significant effects on the metabolic activity of fermentation bacteria and the types of acid products they can also indirectly affect the type of anaerobic digestion by changing the microbial community structure and the ratio of nadh nad within the cells of related microorganisms in the fermentation broth the essence of fermentation reaction was the electron transfer between electron acceptors and electron donors orp reflected the redox property of fermentation system macroscopically 48 while ph affected the growth and metabolism of microorganisms 56 considering the increased ocfa vfas the results of this study showed that the fluctuation range of ph was 4 65 5 05 when the process was running stably which was consistent with the ph observed in batch test 35 the specific change trend of ph was as follows in the first cycle ph showed a sharp decline firstly and then tended to decline slowly with a range of 4 30 5 15 until it finally stayed stable in the range of 4 65 5 05 with a slight fluctuation in other cycles while the fluctuation range of orp was quite different from the results of batch test at first orp was basically stabilized in the range of 111 8 to 129 2 mv after that it began to rise rapidly up to 199 mv on the 8th day and then decreased gradually until it reached the fluctuation range of orp 101 2 188 3 mv for the stable operation of asbr process which was higher than the results of batch test 150 100 mv as the main pathway of acid production in the co digestion process the production of propionic acid was beneficial to the oxidation of nadh which consumed a lot of protons so that the oxidizability of asbr system increased with the continuous production of propionic acid in order to stabilize the production of ocfa the orp increased constantly with the enrichment of dominant strains until it reached a state of relative adaptation of microorganisms to maintain the balance and stability of asbr reaction system 48 the above analysis results further turned out the stability and feasibility of asbr process used in ocfa directional production 3 3 bacterial community composition 3 3 1 bacterial diversity and richness different fermentation conditions affected both the ocfa production and the composition of bacterial communities hence the impact on ocfa production was further monitored through the analysis of bacterial community structure in this study the final samples selected for microbial detection were the microbiological samples of cycle 1 and cycle 4 when they reached acid production peak the analysis data were shown as a1 and a4 respectively which evaluated by seqnum and coverage that the abundant taxonomic groups were covered well in the current samples a1 and a4 table 2 meanwhile the bacterial richness and diversity were carried out by using operational taxonomic units otu chao shannon and simpson indices the results evinced that the richness and diversity of bacteria decreased with the increase of fermentation cycle both a1 and a4 samples which accumulated the highest total vfas yield showed different bacterial richness out 1537 vs 831 chao index 1627 04 vs 1585 35 while diversity indices showed lower bacterial diversity of a1 in comparison to a4 shannon index 6 04 vs 3 18 simpson index 0 006 vs 0 09 the data here achieved suggested that asbr process was conducive to the enrichment of dominant bacteria and targeted production of ocfa to reduce other unnecessary reactions which enabled ocfa vfas to maintain within a relatively stable in the domestication process of asbr the types of available carbon sources were relatively single which were mainly disused grease leading to the death of microorganisms that cannot use grease moreover as one of the hydrolyzed products of grease chain fatty acid lcfa with low concentration had inhibition on gram positive bacteria by attaching to the surface of gram positive bacteria to weaken the transport or protection function of cells while the negative bacteria are unaffected 57 in addition the bacterial community compositions were also analyzed 3 3 2 bacterial community structure the bacterial community compositions in the samples of a1 and a4 were analyzed and the relative abundances of microorganisms were listed table 3 for a better analysis of the microbial community diversity affecting ocfa production in this process at the genus level the species with less than 4 abundance in all samples were classified as other and the rest were analyzed as dominant species study on bacterial community structure at phylum and genus level was briefly shown below the comparison of the community distribution of microorganisms at the phylum level fig 5 showed that the dominant bacteria affecting the directional production of ocfa were most likely to come from firmicutes and bacteroidetes the bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria were considered the dominant phyla of a4 during the process of vfas production by anaerobic fermentation these dominant phyla were also found in previous studies that dealt with the composting of wastes 58 60 among them with the dual functions of hydrolysis and acidification most bacteria belonging to the phylum firmicutes such as selenomonas and veillonella the dominant bacteria producing propionic acid can degrade macromolecular organic compounds into soluble small molecular stable organic compounds such as propionic acid bacteroides had a similar hydrolysis function 61 in addition previous reports indicated that there was a certain link between firmicutes and obesity 62 while proteobacteria was responsible for specific utilization of protein and degradation of polysaccharides which related to the utilization of polysaccharides and butyric acid production 63 compared with a1 a4 increased the relative abundances of firmicutes from 1 35 to 65 36 and bacteroidetes from 8 03 to 23 29 but decreased the abundances of proteobacteria from 36 88 to 9 54 and planctomycetes from 17 96 to 0 24 indicating that co fermentation system enriched more carbohydrates and fats degradation bacteria beneficial to ocfa production in particular the sum of relative abundances of firmicutes and bacteroidetes had reached 88 65 played an essential role in producing ocfa which verified that the dominant bacteria affecting the directional production of ocfa were most likely to come from these two phyla the community distributions of microorganisms in the two samples were also compared and analyzed fig 6 at the genus level to determine the main dominant bacteria and further explore the production mechanism of ocfa the results showed that most of the dominant bacteria in cycle 4 were propionic acid producing bacteria which were all related to the metabolism of lactic acid the dominant bacteria of a4 were selenomonas 21 35 prevotella 16 52 propionispira 7 75 megasphaera 7 21 acetobacter 6 16 dialister 6 22 and veillonella 4 68 which were quite different from the values of a1 0 03 0 03 0 05 0 03 0 03 0 01 and 0 03 and proved that the asbr process was beneficial to the enrichment of dominant bacteria among them selenomonas and prevotella were gram negative bacteria which can be fermented into acetic acid propionic acid and lactic acid with carbohydrates and lactic acid as substrate 64 at the same time propionispira and veillonella were gram negative bacteria which were also typical propionic acid producing bacteria commonly detected at present except for acetobacter consumed propionic acid at the stage of acetic acid production the others were all related to the production of propionic acid which explained the persistent stability of ocfa vfas at the end of the reaction in particular the sum of relative abundances of selenomonas and prevotella had reached 37 86 which played an essential role in producing propionic acid and contributed to the increase of ocfa yield 64 meanwhile from the perspective of lactic acid metabolism the above seven dominant bacteria were all related to the metabolism of lactic acid selenomonas prevotella and dialister were associated with the production of lactic acid while propionispira megasphaera acetobacter and veillonella were related to the consumption of lactic acid therefore the metabolic of lactic acid drove towards ocfa generation 4 conclusions the anaerobic co digestion of disused grease with aerobic sludge was investigated in this study and it also provided us a novel perspective for the targeted production of ocfa in the process of asbr reaction the ocfa yield vfas total amount and profile tended to be stable with the stability of digestion system meanwhile the ecological conditions gradually stabilized during the operation of asbr nh4 63 01 108 94 mg l po4 3 22 65 28 15 mg l scod 4880 7060 mg l ph 4 65 5 05 and orp 101 2 188 3 mv while the downstream effluent met the requirements of following process on the premise of achieving a higher yield of ocfa furthermore the analysis of bacterial community composition proved that the asbr process was beneficial to the enrichment of propionic acid producing bacteria selenomonas and prevotella were the dominant genera while firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla that contributed to the increase of ocfa yield therefore asbr is a potential alternative for the directional production of ocfa credit authorship contribution statement zhihui wang formal analysis

and realized the directional production of ocfa continuously and steadily in the process of anaerobic co digestion with disused grease and aerobic sludge for that purpose the anaerobic sequencing

gradually stabilized during the operation of asbr moreover the concentration of inorganic ion po4 3 22 65 28 15 mg l and nh4 63 01 108 94 mg l were within the regulatory range available for downstream processes therefore the asbr process can be used for the continuous and stable production of ocfa graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic co digestion odd carbon volatile fatty acids ocfa anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr disused grease microbial community structure 1 introduction household food waste and sewage sludge are by products of urban life and wastewater treatment process which belong to an important part of urban organic solid waste household food waste is one of the main sources of urban environmental pollution and seriously threatens people s daily life and health 1 municipal sewage sludge contains a large number of toxic and harmful substances such as heavy metals organic micropollutants pathogenic microorganisms and parasites eggs 2 etc if no reasonable disposition it is easy to cause secondary air and water pollution and the surrounding ecological environment how to reasonably dispose and manage is an expensive and environmentally sensitive problem at present the treatment methods are mainly landfill incineration and sludge composting so it is urgent to explore harmless methods of resource treatment low cost anaerobic fermentation technology which can actively respond to the latest call of carbon neutrality and the concept of green development is an effective biological treatment method to produce volatile fatty acids basic terminal products with the purpose of dual resource utilization for solid waste 3 4 has broad development prospects in the previous studies anaerobic co digestion technology of disused grease with sewage sludge was mainly applied in the production of volatile fatty acids vfas and methane 5 6 besides it also focused on the directional production of odd carbon volatile fatty acids ocfa by optimizing process operations 7 changing acidizing conditions such as ph substrate concentration hydraulic retention time etc and regulating substrates 8 9 garcia aguirre found that the vfas production could be directed towards desired products that are appropriate for the scope of application by means of waste stream selection and process parameters control i e process ph and temperature 10 the influence of other operational parameters i e retention time and organic loading rate has been also studied by several authors 11 13 as a kind of green intermediate product of anaerobic digestion ocfa are widely used in the area of sewage treatment and sludge reduction they are not only important carbon sources for the synthesis process of polyhydroxyalkanoates phas but also determine the proportion of hydroxy valerate hv in phas polymer 14 the higher the ratio of hv phas the better the elasticity and flexibility of the biodegradable bioplastics and the better the processability 15 16 moreover ocfa can also improve the efficiency of biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal bnr which is strongly dependent on the presence of available vfas 17 18 bnr can be achieved through the transformation of ocfa especially propionic acid and iso valeric acid to phas which were conventionally considered as a key energy source for biological p removal 19 20 disused grease oil fat and aerobic sludge are rich in organic components and nutrients such as c n and p elements required for microbial growth and metabolism 21 with good recyclable value 22 23 the directional production of ocfa by co anaerobic fermentation of disused grease and aerobic sludge is conducive to the harmlessness and reduction of solid waste which can not only realize the reuse of waste resources but also solve the existing problems of large surplus of disused grease and insufficient carbon source during the process of sewage treatment furthermore it can also realize the directional regulation of the performance of phas terminal products and effectively reduce the cost of phas synthesis which has broad development prospects and far reaching practical engineering significance the preliminary studies found that the anaerobic co digestion of disused grease oil and fat with aerobic sludge could not only meet the demands of low operation cost and simple operation process while obtaining high ocfa yield and ocfa vfas in the co digestion liquid 24 25 however the preliminary tests were mainly based on batch tests to explore the working conditions and high ocfa vfas could be obtained only when the fermentation peak was strictly controlled on a certain day ocfa cannot be supplied continuously and stably which makes it difficult to meet the supply demand of carbon sources of the downstream process such as phas and bnr therefore in order to meet the needs of low cost and stability of downstream processes in carbon source production and achieve the regulation of product performance it is necessary to further explore the more cheap and stable operation of the directional acidizing process the anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr was developed based on the sequencing batch reactor and had been successfully applied in laboratory and pilot scales for the treatment of high concentration wastewater including landfill leachate slaughterhouse wastewater municipal sludge dairy and beer wastewater 26 30 etc because of its higher organic loading rate compared with the traditional continuous stirred tank reactor asbr can better adapt to the environment with high organic load and ensure the stability of anaerobic co digestion reaction systems besides the long sedimentation period of asbr leads to good biological flocculation and solid liquid separation effects while the floating of large pieces of sludge can also be blocked by setting a solid liquid separation plate 31 32 therefore it is feasible to directional produce ocfa continuously and stably through the anaerobic co digestion of disused grease and sludge by asbr on the basis of previous studies this study explored a continuous and stable directional acidification process to meet the practical production application under the conditions of controlling the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss hydraulic residence time hrt especially the concentration of nh4 disused grease oil fat and aerobic sludge were treated for anaerobic co digestion using a pilot scale asbr reactor on focus the initial nh4 concentration of each cycle was adjusted to enrich propionic acid and maintain the stable operation of asbr for the directional production of ocfa 33 as a necessary element for the growth and proliferation of microorganisms nh4 was consumed greatly and depended strongly on the reaction system the changes in ecological conditions of fermentation broth during the operation of asbr reactor were investigated meanwhile at the microbial level the main dominant bacteria were confirmed through the analysis of microbial community structure thus the main objective of this study was to realize the directed production of ocfa by asbr and disclose the underlying mechanisms which had provided good guiding significance on the conversion of high value added products from practical wastes 2 materials and methods 2 1 pretreatment and preparation of materials 2 1 1 substrates and inoculum substrates disused grease mainly include waste frying oil swill floating oil and fat 34 which were provided by a canteen located in guangzhou university guangzhou china after further manual screening and flushing to remove residual food additives and grease impurities spilled at high temperatures they were cut and homogenized through a professional blender compared with different inoculums 35 considering the fermentation phase and acid production aerobic sludge used as inoculum was obtained from an aerobic tank in the anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process of a sewage treatment plant located in guangzhou china the sludge was filtered through a no 5 mesh sieve sieve pore is 0 18 mm 0 18 mm to remove unwanted particles and prevent clogging after which it was acclimated with disused grease at 4 5 c before use 2 1 2 fermentation liquid preparation previous studies have found that the fat content had a significant effect on the acid production of hogwash waste grease while the maximal vfas and ocfa yields were achieved with a fat content of 10 g l 25 to obtain a higher yield of ocfa fermentation liquid was prepared with disused grease and sludge by controlling the fat content of 10 g l accurately weigh 30 g of waste fat 3 g of frying waste oil and swill floating oil respectively stir evenly at the same time diluted the volume to 300 ml with deionized water for later use the initial characteristics of the prepared fermentation liquid and aerobic sludge were shown in table 1 2 2 bioreactor set up and stabilizing fermentation system 2 2 1 bioreactor the anaerobic sequencing batch reactor 600 ml working volume used in the test is shown in a schematic diagram in fig 1 the gas ch4 h2 co2 etc that may be generated during the process was quantified with a collection bag in the upper space of reactor while a sampling port was fitted to the upper head of reactor to collect the liquid samples moreover the nitrogen flushing outlet was arranged at the bottom to maintain the strict anaerobic state of the reaction system while the water outlet was arranged in the middle of the reactor for the discharge of fermentation broth the whole reactor was placed on a magnetic stirrer and equipped with a thermostat regulator and a rotational regulator and there was no obvious gas production in the whole fermentation process 2 2 2 system stability maintenance and operational process the asbr reactor was operated at a constant temperature of 35 c with a 7 14 d hydraulic retention time hrt for 20 d and each cycle was 5 d for each cycle the feeding time was 10 min while the sedimentation time was 30 min in this study the reactor was filled with 167 8 ml aerobic sludge and 300 ml prepared fermentation liquid that was sustained for 5 days after initial feeding of the prepared fermentation liquid mixture into the bioreactor the microbial inoculum was added at nearly 9 64 0 5 g l of mlss to activate the process as per our previous study when finishing a cycle of reaction we discharged 420 ml of fermentation liquid after stable delamination of the system 30 of the mixture was retained and then we started the next test before entering the next reaction cycle nh4 concentration was adjusted to the concentration at the beginning of the first cycle reaction 114 05 mg l 5 with ammonium chloride to maintain the stable operation of asbr system 33 making it more conducive to the accumulation of propionic acid during the operation of asbr the changes in ecological conditions of the fermentation broth were determined every day to monitor the stability of asbr system and effluent properties additionally we collected samples with the highest yield concentration of vfas at 4 d a1 and 19 d a4 to analyze their microbial community structures the reactor was always kept in a strict anaerobic state by blowing high purity nitrogen and the mixing rotator speeds were adjusted at 700 50 rpm with the feeding cycles and filtration being performed through a peristaltic pump every day the initial characterization of the start up of asbr unit has been reported in table 1 2 3 analytical methods the analyses of total solids ts volatile solids vs nh4 n concentration po4 3 p concentration total phosphorous tp and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were measured based on the standard analytic methods promulgated by

technologies inc usa with a flame ionization detector fid and cnw cd wax capillary column 37 injector and detector temperatures were 220 and 250 c respectively the temperature of the oven was programmed to rise from 80 to 110 c in 2 min and then rise to 200 c with an elevation of 10 c min during the analysis at the same time nitrogen gas flow rate 50 ml min was used as a carrier 2 4 microbial community structure high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing the characterization of the bacterial communities was performed on samples a1 and a4 utilizing a high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis the pcr amplicon sequencing analysis was executed with the help of sangon biotech shanghai co ltd shanghai china and was based on the illumina miseq hiseq platform 38 total dna was

taxonomic units otus abundances were assigned using the rdp classifier according to the sequence similarity with a 97 identity threshold 3 results and discussions 3 1 changes of vfas total amount and profile during asbr reaction process 3 1 1 vfas concentration and ocfa production ocfa were the target products of the anaerobic co digestion test while vfas production was used as a major parameter to compare the performance of the reactors and to monitor the acidification degree of disused grease and sludge throughout the study fig 2 shows the variations of vfas ocfa even carbon volatile fatty acids ecfa yields and ocfa vfas mass fraction during the operation of asbr the concentration of vfas increased greatly in the first two cycles while tended to be stable in the last two cycles as the main substrates being fermented disused grease contributed a large part of vfas yield during the process of reaction in addition in the initial operation of the reaction part of aerobic sludge was also used by hydrolytic bacteria and digestion acid producing bacteria such as clostridium and bacteroides as substrates due to the failure to adapt to the environment of high oil content and high organic load 34 39 40 which contributed part of vfas production while in the later stage of the reaction although the sludge would still be hydrolyzed its hydrolysis rate decreased gradually due to the adaptation to the conditions of the reaction system that s why vfas production in the first two cycles was higher than that in the last two cycles from the point of view of a single cycle the total amount of vfas increased at first and then decreased until it reached the maximum yield on the fourth day the maximum vfas concentrations were 3515 99 mg l 4 d 4388 24 mg l 9 d 2917 61 mg l 14 d and 2941 12 mg l respectively we also noticed that the vfas yields decreased slightly at the end of each cycle firstly continuous production of vfas led to partial vfas accumulation in asbr during the anaerobic digestion the partial high content of vfas may increase the acid inhibition for acid forming bacteria and promote the growth of acid utilizing bacteria which was adverse to the vfas accumulation 41 besides as the representatives of animal fat and vegetable oil respectively waste fat and frying oil contained a large number of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids which were easy to produce long chain fatty acids glycerol and other acids after β oxidative hydrolysis while vfas were easy to be converted to the stage of hydrogen and acetic acid production because of the poor stability 42 43 however it was obvious that the vfas yields at the end of the last two cycles decreased hardly which further illustrated the stability of this process in the production of vfas similarly the ocfa yield and ocfa vfas were also fluctuated greatly in the first two cycles while tended to be stable in the last two cycles the maximum ocfa yields of the four cycles were 3129 23 mg l 4 d 3889 24 mg l 9 d 2646 46 mg l 14 d and 2679 29 mg l 20 d while the maximum ocfa vfas were 89 00 4 d 88 67 10 d 90 15 15 d and 90 95 20 d in other words ocfa vfas slightly increased with the progress of the reaction and tended to be stable on the one hand the operating condition of asbr system multi cycle and high organic load was beneficial to the enrichment of bacteria related to ocfa production resulting in a continuous increase of ocfa vfas in the reactor on the other hand previous research works found that ecfa were the main products when the substrate of anaerobic digestion reaction was only sludge 44 46 while the ocfa especially the propionic acid were the main products when the substrate of anaerobic digestion reaction was grease 47 in this paper with the progress of the reaction most of the available sludge had been consumed and then the main fermentation substrate was disused grease which caused the production of propionic acid furthermore the production of propionic acid was provided with strong stability 48 according to the gibbs free energy analysis propionic acid degradation was difficult to spontaneous reaction 49 which led to the gradual accumulation of ocfa that s why ocfa vfas gradually increased while the ecfa vfas decreased within one cycle cycle 3 and cycle 4 it was noted that the total concentrations of vfas and ocfa vfas obtained show that the highest vfas production and ocfa vfas 4388 24 mg l and 90 95 throughout the asbr process was slightly higher than batch test 4219 20 mg l and 89 00 under the same conditions 35 this showed that the optimized process can achieve the same high yields of vfas and ocfa as the batch experiment even better while maintaining its stability furthermore the range of ocfa vfas was 76 62 90 95 and the maximum concentration difference of vfas was less than 5 in the later stage of the process the data here achieved suggested that the asbr reactor can be used to ocfa directional production stably through the anaerobic co digestion of disused grease with aerobic sludge 3 1 2 vfas composition analysis in order to further discuss the performance of reaction products the vfas components of obtained samples 4 d 9 d 14 d and 19 d with the maximum vfas concentrations were also analyzed in this study the distribution of vfas at the highest yield of vfas in each cycle was shown in fig 3 the vfas components detected consisted mainly of acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid iso butyric acid valeric acid and iso valeric acid in this cultivation propionic acid was the main product of anaerobic co digestion in all reaction cycles 84 76 80 94 82 48 and 82 78 respectively while the acetic acid accounted for 5 27 9 67 of total vfas which decreased gradually with the progress of asbr and on the contrary the valeric acid increases gradually from 1 to 8 96 these results were consistent with previous research works 35 the results of existing studies showed that soluble polysaccharides and proteins dissolved by sludge were easily converted directly to acetic acid 50 this situation occurred in the initial stage of the reaction with the maximum amount of available sludge and the acetic acid decreased with the decrease of available sludge gradually during the progress of the anaerobic co digestion reaction the increase of valeric acid was related to the degradation and utilization of protein besides in the acetic acid producing stage due to the inhibition of the degradation pathway from valeric acid to acetic acid resulting in the gradual decrease of acetic acid and the gradual increase of valeric acid the concentrations of butyric acid iso butyric acid and iso valeric acid were generally less than 1 and out of consideration stable asbr operation led propionic acid to be the main fermentation product 82 80 of total vfas followed by valeric acid acetic acid butyric acid iso butyric acid and iso valeric acid accounted for 8 96 5 27 1 44 0 80 and 0 75 of total vfas respectively the results evidenced the stability and feasibility of ocfa directional production 3 2 changes of ecological conditions of fermentation system the ecological conditions of fermentation system including nh4 po4 3 scod scodvfas scod ph and opr were also detected regularly to monitor the stability of asbr reaction fig 4 the first date was determined after one day of reaction and so on in addition to the vfas total amount and profile that will affect the performance of phas terminal products the inorganic components of fermentation system such as nh4 and po4 3 fig 4a will also have an impact on the phas synthesis process 51 52 it can be observed that during the whole reaction process except for a slight increase on the second day the nh4 concentration showed a downward trend in varying degrees with a fluctuation range of 63 01 108 94 mg l which was within the controllable range of downstream process utilization as a necessary element for the growth and proliferation of microorganisms the concentration of nh4 showed a downward trend obviously in each cycle indicating that nh4 was consumed greatly and depended strongly on the reaction system therefore it s vital to adjust the initial nh4 concentration of each cycle in the reaction process for the stable operation of asbr while the concentration of po4 3 fluctuated greatly with an upward trend in the first 3 days of the reaction and then began to decrease continuously until it gradually stabilized in the range of 22 65 28 15 mg l in the last two cycles due to failure to adapt to asbr reaction a large amount of sludge was cracked at the initial stage of anaerobic co digestion reaction resulting in the release rate of po4 3 in the system was greater than its consumption rate and its external performance was the increase of po4 3 concentration then with the continued proliferation of dominant strains consuming po4 3 the concentration of po4 3 began to decrease until the bioreactor reached a state of dynamic equilibrium furthermore the decrement of nh4 and po4 3 concentration were also related to the hydrolysis and acidification of fermentation broth as the main hydrolysates of sludge and disused grease vfas existed widely in the fermentation system the previous studies have demonstrated that vfas as the additional carbon source could result in superior bnr performance 53 54 scod and scodvfas scod fig 4b were also important indexes to evaluate the utilization and transformation ability of organic substrates in the reaction system which indicated the hydrolysis degree of macromolecular organic matter during the operation of asbr reaction system the concentration of scod with an obvious growth trend in the early stage of all reaction cycles was related to the hydrolysis and dissolution of insoluble macromolecular organic matter which increased the concentration of soluble organic matter in the fermentation broth in addition the scod concentrations at the end of each cycle were 6600 8280 7000 and 7060 mg l respectively in this study about 30 of the fermentation liquid and sludge mixture was reserved at the end of each cycle so that scod can be retained into the next cycle resulting in the concentration of scod in other cycles was higher than that in cycle 1 and stabilize gradually in last two cycles 4880 7060 mg l with the stable operation of asbr the maximum values of scodvfas scod from cycle 1 to cycle 4 were 80 54 77 06 72 13 and 73 30 respectively which can be explained that the soluble by products and intermediate products such as succinic acid and lactic acid accumulated with the progress of asbr reaction resulting in a decrease of scodvfas scod when the fermentation reaction was operated stably in asbr system the smaller fluctuation range of scodvfas scod 46 71 73 3 in the latter cycles illustrated the stability of the operation process although scodvfas scod had decreased it was still significantly higher than the results of previous similar studies 47 furthermore in the final effluent of asbr with the maximum of ocfa vfas the nutritional compositions of fermentation broth were c n 105 1 and c p 350 1 they were slightly different from the optimum ratio c n 125 1 and c p 750 1 required by the process of phas synthesis while also belonged to the controllable range 51 55 which made it possible for the effluent to be further used for phas production finally fig 4c described the changes of ph and orp obtained from the whole mixture during the operation of bioreactor ph and orp were also important ecological factors of the organic anaerobic digestion process having significant effects on the metabolic activity of fermentation bacteria and the types of acid products they can also indirectly affect the type of anaerobic digestion by changing the microbial community structure and the ratio of nadh nad within the cells of related microorganisms in the fermentation broth the essence of fermentation reaction was the electron transfer between electron acceptors and electron donors orp reflected the redox property of fermentation system macroscopically 48 while ph affected the growth and metabolism of microorganisms 56 considering the increased ocfa vfas the results of this study showed that the fluctuation range of ph was 4 65 5 05 when the process was running stably which was consistent with the ph observed in batch test 35 the specific change trend of ph was as follows in the first cycle ph showed a sharp decline firstly and then tended to decline slowly with a range of 4 30 5 15 until it finally stayed stable in the range of 4 65 5 05 with a slight fluctuation in other cycles while the fluctuation range of orp was quite different from the results of batch test at first orp was basically stabilized in the range of 111 8 to 129 2 mv after that it began to rise rapidly up to 199 mv on the 8th day and then decreased gradually until it reached the fluctuation range of orp 101 2 188 3 mv for the stable operation of asbr process which was higher than the results of batch test 150 100 mv as the main pathway of acid production in the co digestion process the production of propionic acid was beneficial to the oxidation of nadh which consumed a lot of protons so that the oxidizability of asbr system increased with the continuous production of propionic acid in order to stabilize the production of ocfa the orp increased constantly with the enrichment of dominant strains until it reached a state of relative adaptation of microorganisms to maintain the balance and stability of asbr reaction system 48 the above analysis results further turned out the stability and feasibility of asbr process used in ocfa directional production 3 3 bacterial community composition 3 3 1 bacterial diversity and richness different fermentation conditions affected both the ocfa production and the composition of bacterial communities hence the impact on ocfa production was further monitored through the analysis of bacterial community structure in this study the final samples selected for microbial detection were the microbiological samples of cycle 1 and cycle 4 when they reached acid production peak the analysis data were shown as a1 and a4 respectively which evaluated by seqnum and coverage that the abundant taxonomic groups were covered well in the current samples a1 and a4 table 2 meanwhile the bacterial richness and diversity were carried out by using operational taxonomic units otu chao shannon and simpson indices the results evinced that the richness and diversity of bacteria decreased with the increase of fermentation cycle both a1 and a4 samples which accumulated the highest total vfas yield showed different bacterial richness out 1537 vs 831 chao index 1627 04 vs 1585 35 while diversity indices showed lower bacterial diversity of a1 in comparison to a4 shannon index 6 04 vs 3 18 simpson index 0 006 vs 0 09 the data here achieved suggested that asbr process was conducive to the enrichment of dominant bacteria and targeted production of ocfa to reduce other unnecessary reactions which enabled ocfa vfas to maintain within a relatively stable in the domestication process of asbr the types of available carbon sources were relatively single which were mainly disused grease leading to the death of microorganisms that cannot use grease moreover as one of the hydrolyzed products of grease chain fatty acid lcfa with low concentration had inhibition on gram positive bacteria by attaching to the surface of gram positive bacteria to weaken the transport or protection function of cells while the negative bacteria are unaffected 57 in addition the bacterial community compositions were also analyzed 3 3 2 bacterial community structure the bacterial community compositions in the samples of a1 and a4 were analyzed and the relative abundances of microorganisms were listed table 3 for a better analysis of the microbial community diversity affecting ocfa production in this process at the genus level the species with less than 4 abundance in all samples were classified as other and the rest were analyzed as dominant species study on bacterial community structure at phylum and genus level was briefly shown below the comparison of the community distribution of microorganisms at the phylum level fig 5 showed that the dominant bacteria affecting the directional production of ocfa were most likely to come from firmicutes and bacteroidetes the bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria were considered the dominant phyla of a4 during the process of vfas production by anaerobic fermentation these dominant phyla were also found in previous studies that dealt with the composting of wastes 58 60 among them with the dual functions of hydrolysis and acidification most bacteria belonging to the phylum firmicutes such as selenomonas and veillonella the dominant bacteria producing propionic acid can degrade macromolecular organic compounds into soluble small molecular stable organic compounds such as propionic acid bacteroides had a similar hydrolysis function 61 in addition previous reports indicated that there was a certain link between firmicutes and obesity 62 while proteobacteria was responsible for specific utilization of protein and degradation of polysaccharides which related to the utilization of polysaccharides and butyric acid production 63 compared with a1 a4 increased the relative abundances of firmicutes from 1 35 to 65 36 and bacteroidetes from 8 03 to 23 29 but decreased the abundances of proteobacteria from 36 88 to 9 54 and planctomycetes from 17 96 to 0 24 indicating that co fermentation system enriched more carbohydrates and fats degradation bacteria beneficial to ocfa production in particular the sum of relative abundances of firmicutes and bacteroidetes had reached 88 65 played an essential role in producing ocfa which verified that the dominant bacteria affecting the directional production of ocfa were most likely to come from these two phyla the community distributions of microorganisms in the two samples were also compared and analyzed fig 6 at the genus level to determine the main dominant bacteria and further explore the production mechanism of ocfa the results showed that most of the dominant bacteria in cycle 4 were propionic acid producing bacteria which were all related to the metabolism of lactic acid the dominant bacteria of a4 were selenomonas 21 35 prevotella 16 52 propionispira 7 75 megasphaera 7 21 acetobacter 6 16 dialister 6 22 and veillonella 4 68 which were quite different from the values of a1 0 03 0 03 0 05 0 03 0 03 0 01 and 0 03 and proved that the asbr process was beneficial to the enrichment of dominant bacteria among them selenomonas and prevotella were gram negative bacteria which can be fermented into acetic acid propionic acid and lactic acid with carbohydrates and lactic acid as substrate 64 at the same time propionispira and veillonella were gram negative bacteria which were also typical propionic acid producing bacteria commonly detected at present except for acetobacter consumed propionic acid at the stage of acetic acid production the others were all related to the production of propionic acid which explained the persistent stability of ocfa vfas at the end of the reaction in particular the sum of relative abundances of selenomonas and prevotella had reached 37 86 which played an essential role in producing propionic acid and contributed to the increase of ocfa yield 64 meanwhile from the perspective of lactic acid metabolism the above seven dominant bacteria were all related to the metabolism of lactic acid selenomonas prevotella and dialister were associated with the production of lactic acid while propionispira megasphaera acetobacter and veillonella were related to the consumption of lactic acid therefore the metabolic of lactic acid drove towards ocfa generation 4 conclusions the anaerobic co digestion of disused grease with aerobic sludge was investigated in this study and it also provided us a novel perspective for the targeted production of ocfa in the process of asbr reaction the ocfa yield vfas total amount and profile tended to be stable with the stability of digestion system meanwhile the ecological conditions gradually stabilized during the operation of asbr nh4 63 01 108 94 mg l po4 3 22 65 28 15 mg l scod 4880 7060 mg l ph 4 65 5 05 and orp 101 2 188 3 mv while the downstream effluent met the requirements of following process on the premise of achieving a higher yield of ocfa furthermore the analysis of bacterial community composition proved that the asbr process was beneficial to the enrichment of propionic acid producing bacteria selenomonas and prevotella were the dominant genera while firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla that contributed to the increase of ocfa yield therefore asbr is a potential alternative for the directional production of ocfa credit authorship contribution statement zhihui wang formal analysis

into rivers and lakes in developing regions like eastern china 1 2 since the point sources have been effectively controlled rdw pollution management has got more attention in recent years 3 5 unlike urban domestic wastewater udw rdw discharging is relatively decentralized because of the rural households geographical distribution 6 scale effect of centralized management could not be realized in rdw on the contrary it is not cost efficient and sustainable to construct extensive scale pipe networks and wastewater treatment plants wwtps covering the scattered villages in rural areas as a result the village is usually taken as a fundamental and minimum unit for rdw treatment to avoid the immense investment in decentralized wastewater transportation and collection meanwhile the processes adapted for rdw treating must be simplified energy saving and resource recovering for environmental protection policies in short the low consuming technologies for rdw management could be promising and adoptable great efforts have been made to explore the appropriate rdw managing mode general methods for rdw treatment usually focused on the end of pipe mixed wastewater ignoring making benefits from source separated pretreatment the contrasting characteristics of grey water 7 and black water bw in rdw were revealed 6 8 bw containing higher pollutant concentration showed a higher contaminants removal efficiency in separated pretreatment e g anaerobic digestion than the mixed wastewater in the terminal treatment source separated anaerobic pretreatment without energy consumption is more cost effective than the aerobic treatment of domestic wastewater 9 11 furthermore the pollutant load removal in the pretreatment stage helped reduce the subsequent treating strength to achieve good energy saving performance 12 from the perspective of the treatment cost of the whole process the source separated pretreatment would be promising if adopted for rdw treatment for the terminal rdw treatment bio eco technology combined systems are considered the most common options 13 14 rdw is often presented to be low strength at the end of the village collecting pipe network 15 usually the low concentrated organic matter could not afford the activated sludge metabolism to maintain a high concentration of activated sludge as a result activated sludge processes usually have limitations in sustainability for rdw treatment with low sludge yields and an excellent ability to resist shock loading biofilm processes are a more reliable biological unit filters and rotating biological contactors rbcs are the preferred and advanced biofilm reactors 16 17 a system consisted of the anaerobic baffled reactor abr anoxic filters anf waterwheel driving rotating biological contactors wdrbcs and constructed wetland cw has been proved to be feasible in rdw treatment in our previous experimental researches 15 as an innovation in energy conservation and driving device saving the water wheel was induced to multiple rbcs and achieved remarkable efficiency however the system s performance in full scale application with a long term operation is still unclear furthermore in the previous study 18 20 the low temperature was fund had a noticeable influence on biological units the full scale application s adjustment to annual climate change remains to be explored as a result we designed and constructed a full scale system combined with source separated pretreatment and the end of pipe bio eco treatment for a village rdw management with positioning in the biological unit to remove organic matter and the ecological unit to reuse nutrients the process applied in the system was further optimized motors for rbcs driving was omitted and the only energy consuming equipment was a pump in the whole full scale system this design makes the rdw processing low in energy and device consumption and the performance in full scale application is worth studying it has been witnessed in the literature survey that the studies on the full scale application of source separation for rdw treatment are currently very minimal hence this study aimed to improve knowledge and understanding about rdw management and provide a cost effective case for rdw pollution control this article focused on the biological unit optimization in pollutant removal and on long term performance as a result the optimal operating parameters for the biological unit were obtained in addition we presented the seasonal performance variation of the system one year observation confirmed the stability of the system meanwhile the present study revealed the potential and limitations of the process 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction and setting of the village rdw treating system the full scale rdw treating system was constructed in a village 119 99638 e 31 54152 n of changzhou city in jiangsu province china in the monsoon climate region 16 c annual average temperature 1086 mm annual total precipitation fig 1 shows the rdw treating system s flow chart consisting of source separated pretreatment and the terminal bio eco treatment the village consisted of 44 households contains 124 persons the detected rdw population equivalent was about 80 l cap d the village s daily generated domestic wastewater was about 10m3 d source separated drainage was set at every household the household s bw collected from water closet source was separately conserved in the septic tank 2 m3 volume with a hydraulic retention time hrt of about 30 d while the gw collected from all other sources including the washing cooking and so on was directly drained to the village rdw collecting pipe network without any pretreatment the pretreated bw was mixed with the raw gw in the drainage pipe the synthetic wastewater was the influent into the terminal bio eco treatment with an average flow rate of 0 42 m3 h i e the designed treatment flow rate 10 t d three sections were contained in the terminal bio eco treatment including anoxic filter anf multi stage waterwheel driving rotating biological contactors ms wdrbcs and constructed vegetable wetland cvw this study focused on the performance of biological units i e anf and ms wdrbcs as fig 1 shows the biological unit consisted of an anoxic filter and three stage wdrbcs our experimental research 15 explored the optimized design parameters for the treatment process with that guidance we still made some adjustments for the full scale application the underground anf filled with the vertical banded wool felt media see media in fig 1 had a 5 m3 effective volume with an expected 12 h hrt hrtanf each stage stainless steel wdrbc 950 mm 800 mm 850 mm had three parts one waterwheel area 200 mm wide in the middle of the horizontal rotating shaft with a 150 mm wide waterwheel and two disc areas 300 mm wide at both ends of the rotating shaft the disc areas contained 0 208 m3 practical volume with an expected 0 5 h hrt hrtms wdrbcs where 16 discs with 700 mm diameter were vertical and equally placed in see wdrbc in fig 1 the felt pasted discs of wdrbc were about 40 submerged the vertical distance between each wdrbc was set at 0 6 m for water dropping the influent flowed into anf by gravity one pump with a rated power of 340 watts was set at the end of the anf anf treated water was drained to the top of ms wdrbcs and was distributed through a divisible overflow weir for treating and waterwheel driving furthermore the waterwheel driving water flow was adjusted to keep discs rotating rate at 4 8 r min the aerobically treated effluence of the last stage wdrbc was partially recycled to the anf serving as a nitrate source for denitrification a divisible overflow weir was set to regulate the reflux ratio the remaining effluence flowed to the cvw i e ecological unit see the oenanthe in fig 1 by gravity for advanced treatment the driving and energy consuming device in the whole system was the only water pump rather than the air pump or differential engine energy efficiency and facility simplification was realized in this combined treatment system 2 2 operation setting in the biological unit the treatment goal was to remove chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and other reducing substances to provide conditions for further treatment in the subsequent ecological unit according to the reported research 21 22 reflux ratio and hrt played an essential role in the process s performance in pollutant removal meanwhile the reflux ratio determined the energy consumption and it was valuable to explore the optimal reflux ratio in addition hrt equivalent to the flow rate in a fixed volume treatment facility determined the processing capacity in this built combined system the sizes of the equipment were not adjustable regulating reflux ratio rr and flow rate fr could help detect the optimum energy efficiency condition and hydraulic load limit this study was divided into three periods in chronological order in period i and period ii rr and fr were regulated respectively then the full scale system ran with the selected parameters for four consecutive seasons 47 observation days in period iii the operating parameters of each period including the constant and the regulated are presented in table 1 2 3 sample and testing the whole system s construction was finished in 2019 this study focused on the performance of biological units i e anf and ms wdrbcs water samples were collected from the anf influent anfinf anf effluence anfef and ms wdrbcs effluence ms wdrbcef water quality index including chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured in the lab of southeast university according to standard methods 23 water temperature wt was measured in situ with the temperature meter 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was carried out with originpro 2018b software originlab corporation usa and spss software ibm corporation usa mann whitney u test p 0 05 significant level was used to identify pairwise seasonal differences of wt and the pollutant removal efficiencies 3 result and discussion 3 1 the reflux ratio regulating adaptation three sampling points were set at the inlet the end of anf and the end of ms wdrbcs in the period i the water characteristics of the inlet sampling point could reflect the initial substrate concentration the anaerobic influent and the aerobic reflux were blended and treated in anf the water characteristics at the end of anf could reflect the efficiency of diluting and anoxic biological treating fig 2 shows cod nh4 n and tn concentration evolution in the influents and effluences of anf and ms wdrbcs and removal efficiencies under increasing reflux ratios the average values of wt cod nh4 n and tn in the anf influent anfin were 13 0 0 9 c 152 7 24 1 mg l 25 4 2 6 mg l and 28 8 2 9 mg l respectively in period i cod removal efficiencies were 64 4 and 80 0 at 50 rr and 300 rr with concentrations of ms wdrbcef 46 1 7 3 mg l and 34 7 1 3 mg l respectively the removal efficiency of cod raised with the increase of the rr in fig 2 a in the biological treatment system consisting of anf and ms wdrbcs the increase of the rr strengthened aerobic treatment and improved the removal of organic matter from the perspective of the anf unit the proportion of anf to cod removal also increased with the increase of rr and it was more evident than the increase of the removal efficiency of the entire combined biological treatment system the reduction of cod concentration in anf was mainly dependent on biodegradation and reflux dilution the biodegradation process mainly relied on the denitrification process to consume organic matter with the increase of rr more nitrates generated by the subsequent aerobic treatment were carried back into the anf as a result the demand for carbon sources for denitrification increased which increased the proportion of cod removal in anf however with the increase of reflux the dilution effect in anf would be more prominent and the bod5 to cod ratio and cod to nitrogen ratio would both decrease 24 which adversely affected the biological denitrification and slowed down the consumption of carbon sources 25 as shown in fig 2 a the removal efficiency of cod in anf raised slowly after rr reached 200 from another perspective the rr increasing would cause an increase in energy consumption there was a balance between the increase in energy consumption and the improvement of the cod removal efficiency and the rr was the key parameter in general the system worked well in cod removal in village rdw treatment due to the front source separated drainage and bw anaerobic pretreatment the biological treatment system influent anfinf cod concentration was relatively low even under the condition of the lowest rr i e 50 the effluence concentration could still be reduced to 46 1 mg l reaching the local rdw pollutant emission standards i e 50 mg l the ammonia transformation process mainly occurred in the aerobic unit i e ms wdrbcs of biological treatment the conversion of nh4 n by the aerobic unit depended on the nitrification of microbial the nitrifying bacteria was not limited by carbon sources i e cod for nitrification under sufficient alkalinity conditions the removal efficiency of nh4 n by nitrification would continue to increase as the reflux ratio increased that was consistent with the phenomenon we had observed the nh4 n removal efficiency of the entire biological treatment system increased as the rr increased nh4 n removal efficiencies were 61 2 and 86 8 at 50 rr and 300 rr with concentrations of ms wdrbcef 8 3 1 1 mg l and 3 6 0 7 mg l respectively fig 2 b shows that the removal efficiency of nh4 n in anf also increased with rr that was partly because the increase in rr increased the dilution effect moreover as the rr increased the reoxygenation capacity of ms wdrbcs was enhanced the unconsumed do in the backflow entered anf resulting in the nitrification reaction in anf it could be seen in fig 2 b that the proportion of nh4 n removal in anf increases with the increase of the rr however in the entire biological treatment system the nh4 n removal efficiency raised extremely slow after rr reached 200 which showed that nitrification had been negatively affected the main reason was that the increase of reflux increased the do that flowed back into anf which destroyed the hypoxic environment in anf and inhibited the denitrification 26 27 when the carbon source consumption of denitrification in anf declined the organic matter entering ms wdrbcs increased the growth of heterotrophic bacteria was encouraged which affected the nitrification of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria 20 the above mentioned denitrifying inhibition was also reflected in the evolution of the tn removal efficiency as fig 2 c shows the tn removal efficiency raised from 33 5 at 50 rr the tn removal efficiency peaked at 40 9 at 200 rr and then showed a downward trend that matched with the 200 rr at which the growth rate of nh4 n removal began to decrease when the rr was increased to 300 the tn removal efficiency decreased to 34 4 it could also be seen from fig 2 c that the tn removal proportion in anf was higher than that in ms wdrbcs which indicated that anf was the central unit of denitrification however ms wdrbcs still drew a light contribution to tn removal indicating that denitrification still existed in the aerobic treating unit ms wdrbcs the biofilm on the discs still had a hypoxic denitrification microenvironment that apparent aerobic denitrification had also been reported in previous studies 28 besides our previous experimental research 15 found that the tn removal efficiency changed with the rr to show the same trend as this full scale application however in this application the average tn removal efficiency in anf was higher under the condition of series rr comparing the influent quality we found that the carbon to nitrogen ratio of 5 3 in this application is higher than 3 5 under the experimental conditions it shows that the increase of carbon to nitrogen ratio helped promote the removal of tn in the rdw treating process consisting of anf and ms wdrbcs the rr significantly impacted the tn removal of the system mainly by affecting the denitrification process in the anf in short we found that the full scale system has reasonable removal efficiencies for rdw treatment at all given rr levels the concentration of cod nh4 n and tn in the effluence of the biological treatment system could be accepted the cod removal efficiency continued to increase as the rr increased the nh4 n removal efficiency increased slightly after the rr was increased to 200 while the removal efficiency of tn reached the peak when at 200 rr that is to say the best operating rr of the system was 200 considering multiple indexes the value was consistent with the rr required under low temperature conditions in the previous study 20 and higher than the 150 rr in the room temperature study 15 this study in the period i was conducted in winter at an average wt of 13 0 c the wt was lower than those of the reported research 29 30 the low operating wt might cause the higher required rr 31 3 2 the flow rate regulating adaptation the hydraulic retention time was a significant parameter for the water treatment process because it reflected the efficiency and the related index for equivalent infrastructure investment however a backflow was set at the end of ms wdrbcs to anf in the process moreover the practical volumes of anf and ms wdrbcs were fixed and nonadjustable the hrt of each unit could not be strictly defined let alone being regulated by resetting the units volume therefore the hydraulic load adaptability of the facility was studied by adjusting the inlet flow rate fr fig 3 illustrates the fr regulating effect on the system performance i e cod nh4 n and tn concentrations in the influents and effluences from anf and ms wdrbcs and removal efficiencies under different fr fr was set at 0 42 m3 h i e the designed treating fr 10 m3 d at the beginning and then increased to 0 50 m3 h 0 60 m3 h and 0 70 m3 h sequentially while the rrs were all set at the proved optimal value of 200 detected in period i in period ii cod nh4 n and tn average concentrations in the anf influents were147 3 24 9 mg l 23 5 1 5 mg l and 26 9 2 2 mg l respectively in this biological treatment system study the removal efficiencies of cod are 78 0 and 66 6 at 0 42 m3 h and 0 70 m3 h with average concentrations of ms wdrbcef 28 8 6 3 mg l and 48 3 12 9 mg l respectively the removal efficiency of cod in the whole system decreased with the increase of fr however when the fr is set at the maximum of 0 70 m3 h the cod concentration in ms wdrbcef remains low still reached the local rdw emission standard i e 50 mg l from the perspective of cod removal the biological treatment system did not collapse at 0 70 m3 h it could be seen from fig 3 a that with the increase of fr the proportion of cod removal in anf gradually decreased from 81 3 to 70 4 that meant the cod removal efficiency in the ms wdrbcs increased relatively with the increase of fr the cod load entering the system increased and the cod load entering ms wdrbcs through anf also increased as the substrate increased heterotrophic bacteria increased in the ms wdrbcs which was originally dominated by autotrophic nitrifying bacteria 32 as a result the ms wdrbcs unit performed an increase in the proportion of cod removal nh4 n removal efficiencies were 84 0 and 61 0 at 0 42 m3 h fr and 0 70 m3 h fr with concentrations of ms wdrbcef 3 8 1 0 mg l and 9 7 1 3 mg l respectively the removal efficiency of nh4 n in the biological treatment system decreased with the increase of fr furthermore when the fr increased to 0 70 m3 h the nh4 n concentration of ms wdrbcef exceeded the local rdw pollutant emission standard i e 8 0 mg l the biological treatment system could run at the maximum fr of 0 60 m3 h within the nh4 n discharge limitation as fig 3 b shows with the increase of fr the proportion of nh4 n removal in the ms wdrbc decreased from 31 6 to 28 9 that might be due to the increase of nh4 n load entering the system as the fr increased moreover the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria in the ms wdrbcs where was originally dominated by autotrophic nitrifying bacteria had increased because of the simultaneous increase of cod load mentioned above as a result the ms wdrbcs unit performed a decrease in the proportion of nh4 n removal the removal efficiency of tn by the biological treatment system decreased with the increase of fr tn removal efficiencies were 41 4 and 33 7 at 0 42 m3 h fr and 0 70 m3 h fr with concentrations of ms wdrbcef 15 7 2 8 mg l and 18 3 2 9 mg l respectively as fig 3 c illustrates with the increase of fr the removal efficiency of tn in anf gradually decreased from 32 3 to 23 6 as fr increased the tn load entering the system increased meanwhile the nitrification in the ms wdrbcs unit was weakened as abovementioned consequently the nitrate flowing back to the anf in the reflux as the electron acceptor was reduced the removal of tn in the denitrification process was also reduced although the fr increased from 0 42 to 0 70 the tn concentration in effluence could still meet the local rdw pollutant emission standards i e 20 mg l that result indicated the system tn removal adaptability to increasing hydraulic load in conclusion the most sensitive water quality indicator affected by fr was nh4 n the nh4 n concentration of ms wdrbcef was the first to exceed the standard with the fr increasing but it still met the emission standard at the fr of 0 6 m3 h through cod nh4 n and tn removal studies we found that the biological treatment system for full scale applications could bear an extra fr increase the village rdw treatment system was initially designed for the fr of 0 42 m3 h but it still had the potential for a 42 fr increase related literature reported that per capita domestic sewage generation in developing regions still had room for growth 33 the system could adapt to the future increase in the amount of rdw in the village the system adapted fr fluctuation excellently in the village rdw treatment 3 3 the long term performance the full scale application was operated under the optimal rr i e 200 and designed fr i e 0 42 m3 h in the long term for four consecutive seasons i e period iii in table 1 moreover 47 random observations information about the actual sampling days shown in table s1 in supplementary material of anfin anfef and ms wdrbcef were conducted in the duration the average wt of all the observations was 19 8 5 9 c the long term performance of the system was shown in table 2 and fig 4 the average cod concentration of anjin was 149 6 35 1 mg l table 2 according to reported research 6 34 the cod concentration of real rdw at the provenance was more than 800 mg l the evident cod decrease in terminal treatment system influent owed to the source separated drainage and septic pretreatment see fig 1 this phenomenon indicated that source separation and pretreatment effectively decreased the pollutant load entering the terminal village rdw treatment system the decrease would make great sense to energy saving and cost reducing in the rdw treatment process the proportions of cod removal efficiency in anf and ms wdrbcs were 56 6 and 28 3 respectively anf continuously made a significant contribution to cod removal in one year running compared to our previous wdsrbc research data i e 18 3 21 cod removal efficiency in sawders of this full scale application was relatively higher however it was lower than that i e 40 reported in the earlier study on sawders with polyurethane sponge padded 20 this difference was mainly caused by the enhancing measure of media adding that means the application still had room for pollutant removal efficiency improvement nevertheless the cod concentration i e 22 6 6 9 mg l in ms wdrbcef was still lower than the local rdw pollution discharge standard i e 50 mg l the biological treatment system showed sufficient capacity in cod removal for nitrogen removal the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tn were 87 6 and 44 2 respectively the removal efficiency of nh4 n was like the pilot study result reported in the literature 20 which was higher than 85 the removal of nh4 n mainly relies on the aerobic nitrification process indicating that the ms wdrbcs of this process had an excellent reoxygenation and stable nitrification performance the removal efficiency of tn was also lower than 50 in the pilot study reported in the literature 21 indicating that denitrification was a shortcoming in the long term biochemical processing the full scale rdw treatment application has room for improvement in the aspect of denitrification as the system was equipped with a constructed vegetable wetland for further resource utilization of nutrients 35 the functional positioning of the biological treatment was only for reducing substances i e cod and nh4 n removal the designed functional positioning was realized in the long term operation from the perspective of cod and nh4 n removal the biofilm process was different from the activated sludge process in the remaining sludge output according to the mechanism consequently the capacity to remove phosphorus by discharging the remaining sludge was limited in theory the capacity of this system for tp removal should be limited the long term operating results show that the tp average removal efficiency was only 28 2 as expected as table 2 shows the anf where the wastewater entered was the central unit for tp removal and the removal efficiency accounts for 75 the related research 15 showed that the interception could remove about 30 of phosphorus in particle state in domestic wastewater in the treatment facility by physical interaction therefore in the string of treating devices phosphorus removal should mainly occur in the first treatment unit i e anf which was presented in this study as expected at the end of the experimental observation for about one year we observed that the bottom of the anf had 7 0 cm deposited sludge and each stage rbc bottom had 5 0 cm deposited sludge according to the size of each unit the calculated excess sludge with high water content throughout the year was about 0 35 m3 compared with the traditional activated sludge process this process produced less sludge in biological units the long term operation results showed that the biological treatment combined with anf and ms wdrbcs had a significant and stable effect on cod and nh4 n removal from rdw the subsequent ecological treatment i e constructed vegetable wetland could reuse the remaining nitrogen and phosphorus by the vegetables planted such a functionally positioned process could minimize the use of energy and chemicals the long term operation of the full scale application indicates that the system realizes lower energy and device consumption less by product in site nutrients re utilization in rdw management it is a feasible and sustainable combined treatment process for village rdw 3 4 seasonal statistical analysis as long term observation shows in fig 4 we found that this system had fluctuations in the pollutant removal efficiency of rdw relevant reports 36 38 showed that temperature significantly affected domestic wastewater biological treatment the application location of this study belonged to the monsoon climate zone with four distinct seasons throughout the year we grouped all observations in the past year into four consecutive seasons see fig 4 and table s2 in supplementary material and pairwise compared each season s wts and pollutant removal efficiencies by mann whitney u test see table 3 at the same time the seasonal variation trend of the average wts and pollutant removal efficiencies were compared in fig 5 as seen in table s2 the lowest and highest wt was in winter and summer with average values of 10 6 1 5 and 25 2 2 2 c from the perspective of seasonal average wt winter was the most disadvantageous season whose average temperature was classified as low temperature as reported 20 39 as fig 5 illustrates seasonal average wts decreased in the following order summer autumn spring winter meanwhile seasonal average cod nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies decreased in the same order see fig 5 a b c in general the lower the seasonal average wt was the lower pollutant removal efficiency was gained however there was no evident variation tendency shown on seasonal average tp removal efficiencies for investigating the significance of seasonal differences we conducted the mann whitney u test for seasonal data comparison the results are shown in table 3 table 3 shows that wts of the system influent between every two seasons all had significant differences p 0 05 it demonstrates that the full scale application suffered significant seasonal temperature differences meanwhile nh4 n removal efficiencies showed significant differences p 0 05 in every two seasons cod and tn removal efficiencies significant differences were not shown in every comparison but all appeared in winter summer and spring summer comparison with colossal wt differences however seasonal tp removal efficiencies showed no significant differences to sum up the pollution removal of this system was affected by wt the removal efficacy of nh4 n was more sensitive to wt than those of cod and tn while the tp removal relationship with wt was not significant as previously discussed the main reason was that the tp removal mainly relied on physical functions 20 rather than the microbial conversion that was sensitive to temperature variating 31 40 generally pollutant removal efficiencies decreased as wt decreased the wt adjustment of this system indicated that the pollutant removal of the full scale application might have limitations in other cold areas 4 conclusion the combined biological units i e anf and ms wdrbcs with hrtanf 12 h and hrtms wdrbcs 1 5 h performed best in pollutants removal at 200 rr although the designed capacity was set at 0 42 m3 h biological treatment could still burden a 42 fr increase which showed the potential in coping with the increase of village capita rdw generation in the future the pollutant load entering the terminal treatment system was effectively reduced for the fore source separation and primary treatment furthermore the long term running result showed that the system had achieved commendable removal efficiencies of 84 9 3 1 cod 87 6 3 5 nh4 n 44 2 3 1 tn and 28 2 2 0 tp in anf ms wdrbcs respectively cod and nh4 n were more effectively removed as the biological treatment functional positioning was designed seasonal wt variation was found to have a remarkable effect on biological treatment nh4 n removal was found the most sensitive index of pollutant removal to rr fr and wt variating overall the full scale system combined with source separated pretreatment and the end of pipe bio eco treatment is feasible and eligible for a village scale rdw management in the aspect of pollutant removal the system has shown the reliability of a year round operation which gives a promising outlook of a wide range of promotions and applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13121,rural domestic wastewater rdw management has always been challenging due to the vast range and decentralized household distribution this study constructed a full scale system combined with source separated pretreatment and terminal bio eco treatment for a village rdw treating the process of the application was designed from the perspective of low consumption in energy and device the performance of the biological units consisted of an anoxic filter anf and multi stage waterwheel driving rotating biological contactors ms wdrbcs was investigated anf ms wdrbcs with hrtanf 12 h and hrtms wdrbcs 1 5 h performed best in pollutants removal at 200 reflux ratio rr the maximum flow rate fr that the system could burden is 0 6 m3 h with a 42 increase from the designed fr 0 42 m3 h which shows the potential in coping with the future increase of individual rdw generation meanwhile the source separation and primary treatment could effectively reduce the pollutant load entering the biologic units in the four consecutive seasons operating 84 9 3 1 cod 87 6 3 5 nh4 n 44 2 3 1 tn and 28 2 2 0 tp are removed respectively seasonal water temperature wt variation is found to have a

into rivers and lakes in developing regions like eastern china 1 2 since the point sources have been effectively controlled rdw pollution management has got more attention in recent years 3 5 unlike urban domestic wastewater udw rdw discharging is relatively decentralized because of the rural households geographical distribution 6 scale effect of centralized management could not be realized in rdw on the contrary it is not cost efficient and sustainable to construct extensive scale pipe networks and wastewater treatment plants wwtps covering the scattered villages in rural areas as a result the village is usually taken as a fundamental and minimum unit for rdw treatment to avoid the immense investment in decentralized wastewater transportation and collection meanwhile the processes adapted for rdw treating must be simplified energy saving and resource recovering for environmental protection policies in short the low consuming technologies for rdw management could be promising and adoptable great efforts have been made to explore the appropriate rdw managing mode general methods for rdw treatment usually focused on the end of pipe mixed wastewater ignoring making benefits from source separated pretreatment the contrasting characteristics of grey water 7 and black water bw in rdw were revealed 6 8 bw containing higher pollutant concentration showed a higher contaminants removal efficiency in separated pretreatment e g anaerobic digestion than the mixed wastewater in the terminal treatment source separated anaerobic pretreatment without energy consumption is more cost effective than the aerobic treatment of domestic wastewater 9 11 furthermore the pollutant load removal in the pretreatment stage helped reduce the subsequent treating strength to achieve good energy saving performance 12 from the perspective of the treatment cost of the whole process the source separated pretreatment would be promising if adopted for rdw treatment for the terminal rdw treatment bio eco technology combined systems are considered the most common options 13 14 rdw is often presented to be low strength at the end of the village collecting pipe network 15 usually the low concentrated organic matter could not afford the activated sludge metabolism to maintain a high concentration of activated sludge as a result activated sludge processes usually have limitations in sustainability for rdw treatment with low sludge yields and an excellent ability to resist shock loading biofilm processes are a more reliable biological unit filters and rotating biological contactors rbcs are the preferred and advanced biofilm reactors 16 17 a system consisted of the anaerobic baffled reactor abr anoxic filters anf waterwheel driving rotating biological contactors wdrbcs and constructed wetland cw has been proved to be feasible in rdw treatment in our previous experimental researches 15 as an innovation in energy conservation and driving device saving the water wheel was induced to multiple rbcs and achieved remarkable efficiency however the system s performance in full scale application with a long term operation is still unclear furthermore in the previous study 18 20 the low temperature was fund had a noticeable influence on biological units the full scale application s adjustment to annual climate change remains to be explored as a result we designed and constructed a full scale system combined with source separated pretreatment and the end of pipe bio eco treatment for a village rdw management with positioning in the biological unit to remove organic matter and the ecological unit to reuse nutrients the process applied in the system was further optimized motors for rbcs driving was omitted and the only energy consuming equipment was a pump in the whole full scale system this design makes the rdw processing low in energy and device consumption and the performance in full scale application is worth studying it has been witnessed in the literature survey that the studies on the full scale application of source separation for rdw treatment are currently very minimal hence this study aimed to improve knowledge and understanding about rdw management and provide a cost effective case for rdw pollution control this article focused on the biological unit optimization in pollutant removal and on long term performance as a result the optimal operating parameters for the biological unit were obtained in addition we presented the seasonal performance variation of the system one year observation confirmed the stability of the system meanwhile the present study revealed the potential and limitations of the process 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction and setting of the village rdw treating system the full scale rdw treating system was constructed in a village 119 99638 e 31 54152 n of changzhou city in jiangsu province china in the monsoon climate region 16 c annual average temperature 1086 mm annual total precipitation fig 1 shows the rdw treating system s flow chart consisting of source separated pretreatment and the terminal bio eco treatment the village consisted of 44 households contains 124 persons the detected rdw population equivalent was about 80 l cap d the village s daily generated domestic wastewater was about 10m3 d source separated drainage was set at every household the household s bw collected from water closet source was separately conserved in the septic tank 2 m3 volume with a hydraulic retention time hrt of about 30 d while the gw collected from all other sources including the washing cooking and so on was directly drained to the village rdw collecting pipe network without any pretreatment the pretreated bw was mixed with the raw gw in the drainage pipe the synthetic wastewater was the influent into the terminal bio eco treatment with an average flow rate of 0 42 m3 h i e the designed treatment flow rate 10 t d three sections were contained in the terminal bio eco treatment including anoxic filter anf multi stage waterwheel driving rotating biological contactors ms wdrbcs and constructed vegetable wetland cvw this study focused on the performance of biological units i e anf and ms wdrbcs as fig 1 shows the biological unit consisted of an anoxic filter and three stage wdrbcs our experimental research 15 explored the optimized design parameters for the treatment process with that guidance we still made some adjustments for the full scale application the underground anf filled with the vertical banded wool felt media see media in fig 1 had a 5 m3 effective volume with an expected 12 h hrt hrtanf each stage stainless steel wdrbc 950 mm 800 mm 850 mm had three parts one waterwheel area 200 mm wide in the middle of the horizontal rotating shaft with a 150 mm wide waterwheel and two disc areas 300 mm wide at both ends of the rotating shaft the disc areas contained 0 208 m3 practical volume with an expected 0 5 h hrt hrtms wdrbcs where 16 discs with 700 mm diameter were vertical and equally placed in see wdrbc in fig 1 the felt pasted discs of wdrbc were about 40 submerged the vertical distance between each wdrbc was set at 0 6 m for water dropping the influent flowed into anf by gravity one pump with a rated power of 340 watts was set at the end of the anf anf treated water was drained to the top of ms wdrbcs and was distributed through a divisible overflow weir for treating and waterwheel driving furthermore the waterwheel driving water flow was adjusted to keep discs rotating rate at 4 8 r min the aerobically treated effluence of the last stage wdrbc was partially recycled to the anf serving as a nitrate source for denitrification a divisible overflow weir was set to regulate the reflux ratio the remaining effluence flowed to the cvw i e ecological unit see the oenanthe in fig 1 by gravity for advanced treatment the driving and energy consuming device in the whole system was the only water pump rather than the air pump or differential engine energy efficiency and facility simplification was realized in this combined treatment system 2 2 operation setting in the biological unit the treatment goal was to remove chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and other reducing substances to provide conditions for further treatment in the subsequent ecological unit according to the reported research 21 22 reflux ratio and hrt played an essential role in the process s performance in pollutant removal meanwhile the reflux ratio determined the energy consumption and it was valuable to explore the optimal reflux ratio in addition hrt equivalent to the flow rate in a fixed volume treatment facility determined the processing capacity in this built combined system the sizes of the equipment were not adjustable regulating reflux ratio rr and flow rate fr could help detect the optimum energy efficiency condition and hydraulic load limit this study was divided into three periods in chronological order in period i and period ii rr and fr were regulated respectively then the full scale system ran with the selected parameters for four consecutive seasons 47 observation days in period iii the operating parameters of each period including the constant and the regulated are presented in table 1 2 3 sample and testing the whole system s construction was finished in 2019 this study focused on the performance of biological units i e anf and ms wdrbcs water samples were collected from the anf influent anfinf anf effluence anfef and ms wdrbcs effluence ms wdrbcef water quality index including chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured in the lab of southeast university according to standard methods 23 water temperature wt was measured in situ with the temperature meter 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was carried out with originpro 2018b software originlab corporation usa and spss software ibm corporation usa mann whitney u test p 0 05 significant level was used to identify pairwise seasonal differences of wt and the pollutant removal efficiencies 3 result and discussion 3 1 the reflux ratio regulating adaptation three sampling points were set at the inlet the end of anf and the end of ms wdrbcs in the period i the water characteristics of the inlet sampling point could reflect the initial substrate concentration the anaerobic influent and the aerobic reflux were blended and treated in anf the water characteristics at the end of anf could reflect the efficiency of diluting and anoxic biological treating fig 2 shows cod nh4 n and tn concentration evolution in the influents and effluences of anf and ms wdrbcs and removal efficiencies under increasing reflux ratios the average values of wt cod nh4 n and tn in the anf influent anfin were 13 0 0 9 c 152 7 24 1 mg l 25 4 2 6 mg l and 28 8 2 9 mg l respectively in period i cod removal efficiencies were 64 4 and 80 0 at 50 rr and 300 rr with concentrations of ms wdrbcef 46 1 7 3 mg l and 34 7 1 3 mg l respectively the removal efficiency of cod raised with the increase of the rr in fig 2 a in the biological treatment system consisting of anf and ms wdrbcs the increase of the rr strengthened aerobic treatment and improved the removal of organic matter from the perspective of the anf unit the proportion of anf to cod removal also increased with the increase of rr and it was more evident than the increase of the removal efficiency of the entire combined biological treatment system the reduction of cod concentration in anf was mainly dependent on biodegradation and reflux dilution the biodegradation process mainly relied on the denitrification process to consume organic matter with the increase of rr more nitrates generated by the subsequent aerobic treatment were carried back into the anf as a result the demand for carbon sources for denitrification increased which increased the proportion of cod removal in anf however with the increase of reflux the dilution effect in anf would be more prominent and the bod5 to cod ratio and cod to nitrogen ratio would both decrease 24 which adversely affected the biological denitrification and slowed down the consumption of carbon sources 25 as shown in fig 2 a the removal efficiency of cod in anf raised slowly after rr reached 200 from another perspective the rr increasing would cause an increase in energy consumption there was a balance between the increase in energy consumption and the improvement of the cod removal efficiency and the rr was the key parameter in general the system worked well in cod removal in village rdw treatment due to the front source separated drainage and bw anaerobic pretreatment the biological treatment system influent anfinf cod concentration was relatively low even under the condition of the lowest rr i e 50 the effluence concentration could still be reduced to 46 1 mg l reaching the local rdw pollutant emission standards i e 50 mg l the ammonia transformation process mainly occurred in the aerobic unit i e ms wdrbcs of biological treatment the conversion of nh4 n by the aerobic unit depended on the nitrification of microbial the nitrifying bacteria was not limited by carbon sources i e cod for nitrification under sufficient alkalinity conditions the removal efficiency of nh4 n by nitrification would continue to increase as the reflux ratio increased that was consistent with the phenomenon we had observed the nh4 n removal efficiency of the entire biological treatment system increased as the rr increased nh4 n removal efficiencies were 61 2 and 86 8 at 50 rr and 300 rr with concentrations of ms wdrbcef 8 3 1 1 mg l and 3 6 0 7 mg l respectively fig 2 b shows that the removal efficiency of nh4 n in anf also increased with rr that was partly because the increase in rr increased the dilution effect moreover as the rr increased the reoxygenation capacity of ms wdrbcs was enhanced the unconsumed do in the backflow entered anf resulting in the nitrification reaction in anf it could be seen in fig 2 b that the proportion of nh4 n removal in anf increases with the increase of the rr however in the entire biological treatment system the nh4 n removal efficiency raised extremely slow after rr reached 200 which showed that nitrification had been negatively affected the main reason was that the increase of reflux increased the do that flowed back into anf which destroyed the hypoxic environment in anf and inhibited the denitrification 26 27 when the carbon source consumption of denitrification in anf declined the organic matter entering ms wdrbcs increased the growth of heterotrophic bacteria was encouraged which affected the nitrification of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria 20 the above mentioned denitrifying inhibition was also reflected in the evolution of the tn removal efficiency as fig 2 c shows the tn removal efficiency raised from 33 5 at 50 rr the tn removal efficiency peaked at 40 9 at 200 rr and then showed a downward trend that matched with the 200 rr at which the growth rate of nh4 n removal began to decrease when the rr was increased to 300 the tn removal efficiency decreased to 34 4 it could also be seen from fig 2 c that the tn removal proportion in anf was higher than that in ms wdrbcs which indicated that anf was the central unit of denitrification however ms wdrbcs still drew a light contribution to tn removal indicating that denitrification still existed in the aerobic treating unit ms wdrbcs the biofilm on the discs still had a hypoxic denitrification microenvironment that apparent aerobic denitrification had also been reported in previous studies 28 besides our previous experimental research 15 found that the tn removal efficiency changed with the rr to show the same trend as this full scale application however in this application the average tn removal efficiency in anf was higher under the condition of series rr comparing the influent quality we found that the carbon to nitrogen ratio of 5 3 in this application is higher than 3 5 under the experimental conditions it shows that the increase of carbon to nitrogen ratio helped promote the removal of tn in the rdw treating process consisting of anf and ms wdrbcs the rr significantly impacted the tn removal of the system mainly by affecting the denitrification process in the anf in short we found that the full scale system has reasonable removal efficiencies for rdw treatment at all given rr levels the concentration of cod nh4 n and tn in the effluence of the biological treatment system could be accepted the cod removal efficiency continued to increase as the rr increased the nh4 n removal efficiency increased slightly after the rr was increased to 200 while the removal efficiency of tn reached the peak when at 200 rr that is to say the best operating rr of the system was 200 considering multiple indexes the value was consistent with the rr required under low temperature conditions in the previous study 20 and higher than the 150 rr in the room temperature study 15 this study in the period i was conducted in winter at an average wt of 13 0 c the wt was lower than those of the reported research 29 30 the low operating wt might cause the higher required rr 31 3 2 the flow rate regulating adaptation the hydraulic retention time was a significant parameter for the water treatment process because it reflected the efficiency and the related index for equivalent infrastructure investment however a backflow was set at the end of ms wdrbcs to anf in the process moreover the practical volumes of anf and ms wdrbcs were fixed and nonadjustable the hrt of each unit could not be strictly defined let alone being regulated by resetting the units volume therefore the hydraulic load adaptability of the facility was studied by adjusting the inlet flow rate fr fig 3 illustrates the fr regulating effect on the system performance i e cod nh4 n and tn concentrations in the influents and effluences from anf and ms wdrbcs and removal efficiencies under different fr fr was set at 0 42 m3 h i e the designed treating fr 10 m3 d at the beginning and then increased to 0 50 m3 h 0 60 m3 h and 0 70 m3 h sequentially while the rrs were all set at the proved optimal value of 200 detected in period i in period ii cod nh4 n and tn average concentrations in the anf influents were147 3 24 9 mg l 23 5 1 5 mg l and 26 9 2 2 mg l respectively in this biological treatment system study the removal efficiencies of cod are 78 0 and 66 6 at 0 42 m3 h and 0 70 m3 h with average concentrations of ms wdrbcef 28 8 6 3 mg l and 48 3 12 9 mg l respectively the removal efficiency of cod in the whole system decreased with the increase of fr however when the fr is set at the maximum of 0 70 m3 h the cod concentration in ms wdrbcef remains low still reached the local rdw emission standard i e 50 mg l from the perspective of cod removal the biological treatment system did not collapse at 0 70 m3 h it could be seen from fig 3 a that with the increase of fr the proportion of cod removal in anf gradually decreased from 81 3 to 70 4 that meant the cod removal efficiency in the ms wdrbcs increased relatively with the increase of fr the cod load entering the system increased and the cod load entering ms wdrbcs through anf also increased as the substrate increased heterotrophic bacteria increased in the ms wdrbcs which was originally dominated by autotrophic nitrifying bacteria 32 as a result the ms wdrbcs unit performed an increase in the proportion of cod removal nh4 n removal efficiencies were 84 0 and 61 0 at 0 42 m3 h fr and 0 70 m3 h fr with concentrations of ms wdrbcef 3 8 1 0 mg l and 9 7 1 3 mg l respectively the removal efficiency of nh4 n in the biological treatment system decreased with the increase of fr furthermore when the fr increased to 0 70 m3 h the nh4 n concentration of ms wdrbcef exceeded the local rdw pollutant emission standard i e 8 0 mg l the biological treatment system could run at the maximum fr of 0 60 m3 h within the nh4 n discharge limitation as fig 3 b shows with the increase of fr the proportion of nh4 n removal in the ms wdrbc decreased from 31 6 to 28 9 that might be due to the increase of nh4 n load entering the system as the fr increased moreover the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria in the ms wdrbcs where was originally dominated by autotrophic nitrifying bacteria had increased because of the simultaneous increase of cod load mentioned above as a result the ms wdrbcs unit performed a decrease in the proportion of nh4 n removal the removal efficiency of tn by the biological treatment system decreased with the increase of fr tn removal efficiencies were 41 4 and 33 7 at 0 42 m3 h fr and 0 70 m3 h fr with concentrations of ms wdrbcef 15 7 2 8 mg l and 18 3 2 9 mg l respectively as fig 3 c illustrates with the increase of fr the removal efficiency of tn in anf gradually decreased from 32 3 to 23 6 as fr increased the tn load entering the system increased meanwhile the nitrification in the ms wdrbcs unit was weakened as abovementioned consequently the nitrate flowing back to the anf in the reflux as the electron acceptor was reduced the removal of tn in the denitrification process was also reduced although the fr increased from 0 42 to 0 70 the tn concentration in effluence could still meet the local rdw pollutant emission standards i e 20 mg l that result indicated the system tn removal adaptability to increasing hydraulic load in conclusion the most sensitive water quality indicator affected by fr was nh4 n the nh4 n concentration of ms wdrbcef was the first to exceed the standard with the fr increasing but it still met the emission standard at the fr of 0 6 m3 h through cod nh4 n and tn removal studies we found that the biological treatment system for full scale applications could bear an extra fr increase the village rdw treatment system was initially designed for the fr of 0 42 m3 h but it still had the potential for a 42 fr increase related literature reported that per capita domestic sewage generation in developing regions still had room for growth 33 the system could adapt to the future increase in the amount of rdw in the village the system adapted fr fluctuation excellently in the village rdw treatment 3 3 the long term performance the full scale application was operated under the optimal rr i e 200 and designed fr i e 0 42 m3 h in the long term for four consecutive seasons i e period iii in table 1 moreover 47 random observations information about the actual sampling days shown in table s1 in supplementary material of anfin anfef and ms wdrbcef were conducted in the duration the average wt of all the observations was 19 8 5 9 c the long term performance of the system was shown in table 2 and fig 4 the average cod concentration of anjin was 149 6 35 1 mg l table 2 according to reported research 6 34 the cod concentration of real rdw at the provenance was more than 800 mg l the evident cod decrease in terminal treatment system influent owed to the source separated drainage and septic pretreatment see fig 1 this phenomenon indicated that source separation and pretreatment effectively decreased the pollutant load entering the terminal village rdw treatment system the decrease would make great sense to energy saving and cost reducing in the rdw treatment process the proportions of cod removal efficiency in anf and ms wdrbcs were 56 6 and 28 3 respectively anf continuously made a significant contribution to cod removal in one year running compared to our previous wdsrbc research data i e 18 3 21 cod removal efficiency in sawders of this full scale application was relatively higher however it was lower than that i e 40 reported in the earlier study on sawders with polyurethane sponge padded 20 this difference was mainly caused by the enhancing measure of media adding that means the application still had room for pollutant removal efficiency improvement nevertheless the cod concentration i e 22 6 6 9 mg l in ms wdrbcef was still lower than the local rdw pollution discharge standard i e 50 mg l the biological treatment system showed sufficient capacity in cod removal for nitrogen removal the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tn were 87 6 and 44 2 respectively the removal efficiency of nh4 n was like the pilot study result reported in the literature 20 which was higher than 85 the removal of nh4 n mainly relies on the aerobic nitrification process indicating that the ms wdrbcs of this process had an excellent reoxygenation and stable nitrification performance the removal efficiency of tn was also lower than 50 in the pilot study reported in the literature 21 indicating that denitrification was a shortcoming in the long term biochemical processing the full scale rdw treatment application has room for improvement in the aspect of denitrification as the system was equipped with a constructed vegetable wetland for further resource utilization of nutrients 35 the functional positioning of the biological treatment was only for reducing substances i e cod and nh4 n removal the designed functional positioning was realized in the long term operation from the perspective of cod and nh4 n removal the biofilm process was different from the activated sludge process in the remaining sludge output according to the mechanism consequently the capacity to remove phosphorus by discharging the remaining sludge was limited in theory the capacity of this system for tp removal should be limited the long term operating results show that the tp average removal efficiency was only 28 2 as expected as table 2 shows the anf where the wastewater entered was the central unit for tp removal and the removal efficiency accounts for 75 the related research 15 showed that the interception could remove about 30 of phosphorus in particle state in domestic wastewater in the treatment facility by physical interaction therefore in the string of treating devices phosphorus removal should mainly occur in the first treatment unit i e anf which was presented in this study as expected at the end of the experimental observation for about one year we observed that the bottom of the anf had 7 0 cm deposited sludge and each stage rbc bottom had 5 0 cm deposited sludge according to the size of each unit the calculated excess sludge with high water content throughout the year was about 0 35 m3 compared with the traditional activated sludge process this process produced less sludge in biological units the long term operation results showed that the biological treatment combined with anf and ms wdrbcs had a significant and stable effect on cod and nh4 n removal from rdw the subsequent ecological treatment i e constructed vegetable wetland could reuse the remaining nitrogen and phosphorus by the vegetables planted such a functionally positioned process could minimize the use of energy and chemicals the long term operation of the full scale application indicates that the system realizes lower energy and device consumption less by product in site nutrients re utilization in rdw management it is a feasible and sustainable combined treatment process for village rdw 3 4 seasonal statistical analysis as long term observation shows in fig 4 we found that this system had fluctuations in the pollutant removal efficiency of rdw relevant reports 36 38 showed that temperature significantly affected domestic wastewater biological treatment the application location of this study belonged to the monsoon climate zone with four distinct seasons throughout the year we grouped all observations in the past year into four consecutive seasons see fig 4 and table s2 in supplementary material and pairwise compared each season s wts and pollutant removal efficiencies by mann whitney u test see table 3 at the same time the seasonal variation trend of the average wts and pollutant removal efficiencies were compared in fig 5 as seen in table s2 the lowest and highest wt was in winter and summer with average values of 10 6 1 5 and 25 2 2 2 c from the perspective of seasonal average wt winter was the most disadvantageous season whose average temperature was classified as low temperature as reported 20 39 as fig 5 illustrates seasonal average wts decreased in the following order summer autumn spring winter meanwhile seasonal average cod nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies decreased in the same order see fig 5 a b c in general the lower the seasonal average wt was the lower pollutant removal efficiency was gained however there was no evident variation tendency shown on seasonal average tp removal efficiencies for investigating the significance of seasonal differences we conducted the mann whitney u test for seasonal data comparison the results are shown in table 3 table 3 shows that wts of the system influent between every two seasons all had significant differences p 0 05 it demonstrates that the full scale application suffered significant seasonal temperature differences meanwhile nh4 n removal efficiencies showed significant differences p 0 05 in every two seasons cod and tn removal efficiencies significant differences were not shown in every comparison but all appeared in winter summer and spring summer comparison with colossal wt differences however seasonal tp removal efficiencies showed no significant differences to sum up the pollution removal of this system was affected by wt the removal efficacy of nh4 n was more sensitive to wt than those of cod and tn while the tp removal relationship with wt was not significant as previously discussed the main reason was that the tp removal mainly relied on physical functions 20 rather than the microbial conversion that was sensitive to temperature variating 31 40 generally pollutant removal efficiencies decreased as wt decreased the wt adjustment of this system indicated that the pollutant removal of the full scale application might have limitations in other cold areas 4 conclusion the combined biological units i e anf and ms wdrbcs with hrtanf 12 h and hrtms wdrbcs 1 5 h performed best in pollutants removal at 200 rr although the designed capacity was set at 0 42 m3 h biological treatment could still burden a 42 fr increase which showed the potential in coping with the increase of village capita rdw generation in the future the pollutant load entering the terminal treatment system was effectively reduced for the fore source separation and primary treatment furthermore the long term running result showed that the system had achieved commendable removal efficiencies of 84 9 3 1 cod 87 6 3 5 nh4 n 44 2 3 1 tn and 28 2 2 0 tp in anf ms wdrbcs respectively cod and nh4 n were more effectively removed as the biological treatment functional positioning was designed seasonal wt variation was found to have a remarkable effect on biological treatment nh4 n removal was found the most sensitive index of pollutant removal to rr fr and wt variating overall the full scale system combined with source separated pretreatment and the end of pipe bio eco treatment is feasible and eligible for a village scale rdw management in the aspect of pollutant removal the system has shown the reliability of a year round operation which gives a promising outlook of a wide range of promotions and applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13122,in growing urban areas increasing nitrogen loads to large wwtps can be problematic for the existing nitrification denitrification stage and necessitate the enlargement of the entire wastewater treatment system nitrogen removal is usually the most critical process in overload situations often limited by the hydraulic capacities for recirculation a simple and cost effective way to meet low nitrogen effluent requirements is the proposed single stage mbbr this system can be implemented additionally as a bypass in the effluent to investigate the practicability of the proposed concept a pilot plant was operated to polish treated wastewater with an mbbr the process is designed for post treatment denitrification to eliminate the remaining nitrate nitrogen in the already treated wastewater the paper extends the current knowledge of low concentration gradients since no information is available on the post treatment of nitrate nitrogen to 2 5 mg l or below in addition the tested hydraulic retention time hrt of only 60 min is exceptional allowing future single stage mbbrs to be sized smaller the first results of one year of operation showed a stable nitrate nitrogen reduction from 10 0 mgno3 n l to 5 0 mgno3 n l to comply with required effluent concentrations for total nitrogen a maximum removal rate of 2 07 gnox n m2 d at t 20 c was reached average nox n removal of 71 could be achieved at a minimal hrt of only 1 h following a two month start up phase the process proved to be robust after carbon dosage interruptions full performance was regained after only three days in summer graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords denitrification mbbr nitrogen removal nitrate nitrogen polishing process bypass operation 1 introduction in germany and many other countries population density has increased in recent decades especially in urban areas according to the german federal statistical office growth in cities and metropolitan regions is expected to continue in the future wastewater treatment in these areas and cities is often carried out by large wastewater treatment plants wwtps designed for 100 000 population equivalents or more these wwtps must comply with strict effluent limits in particular nitrogen is subject to a limit of 13 mg l in 2 h composite samples to reach these strict effluent concentrations new technologies are necessary to upgrade overloaded wwtps 1 the most common technology for biological nitrogen removal in the mainstream of large wwtps is nitrification denitrification 2 pre denitrification for example is well understood and established for large wwtps 3 5 therefore the nitrogen removal efficiency depends on among other factors the necessary recirculation ratio to transfer produced nitrate nitrogen into the pre anoxic zone and maximum elimination rates between 75 and 90 can be reached 6 ingolstadt wwtp is designed for 275 000 population equivalents pe actual loads are increasing in the raw wastewater especially nitrogen resulting in an actual load of approximately 290 000 pe with respect to this parameter the biological treatment is accomplished in the first biological stage fig 1 by pre denitrification and phosphorus removal followed by a high loaded activated sludge process after a pass through the interim clarifier nitrification in the second biological stage is carried out by a trickling filter due to the low reaction kinetics of nitrification compared to chemical oxygen demand cod removal and the limited hydraulic possibilities for recirculation the cod supply for existing pre denitrification is limited this is especially true for two stage wwtps with pre denitrification the plant has already been optimized and recirculation of the wastewater cannot be increased further due to structural constraints further upgrading the mainstream process can only be achieved by a costly expansion of both existing stages a cost efficient and more resource saving solution is required to handle the effluent requirements thus to reach the aspired goals very quickly short planning and construction times are necessary since only the nitrogen effluent requirement of 13 mg l is problematic due to high nitrate nitrogen influent concentrations specifically targeted nitrate nitrogen removal is proposed as post denitrification of the low strength effluent of the wwtp with methanol as an external carbon source a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr is planned in an existing tank previously pre thickener where approximately 60 of the effluent can be treated fig 1 in the bypass nitrate nitrogen should be reduced from 10 mgno3 n l to lower than 5 mgno3 n l so that the nitrogen concentration in the entire effluent will be well below the effluent requirement of 13 mg l total nitrogen the mbbr process was first introduced in the 1990s by h ødegaard 7 and is now known as a reliable treatment for wwtps particularly smaller wwtps 8 9 post denitrification as mbbr is well understood for regular nitrogen removal and is documented in the literature 10 12 mbbrs have also been implemented to full scale plants for post denitrification in the mainstream 13 15 and even as an application to small wwtps after trickling filters to reduce total nitrogen removal 16 mbbrs for denitrification have not been used in a single stage to polish treated wastewater of large wwtps however due to the low concentrations in the effluent of the wwtp inflow to the mbbr post denitrification it was unclear whether stable denitrification could be achieved at low no3 n concentrations thus the functionality of the presented large scale concept was questionable therefore a pilot plant was operated to investigate the practicality of the single stage mbbr system installed at the wwtp and to gain experience for the planned operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot plant a pilot plant was built in a 20 foot container for the preliminary testing of the planned post denitrification of the treated wastewater fig 2 therefore the pilot plant is installed in the bypass between effluent of the trickling filters and inlet to the existing secondary clarifier the 20 foot container was divided into three zones which are connected by permeable perforated sheets thus the pilot plant is operated as a continuous system the 20 foot container includes a denitrification basin with 10 6 m3 a post aeration zone with 1 8 m3 and a post clarifier with 12 5 m3 the aeration zone was not in operation during the present study a post clarifier zone was installed in the pilot plant for sludge analysis and effluent measurement for the final large scale implementation fig 1 an additional secondary clarifier is not planned since the existing secondary clarifier will be used here the inflow is carried out by a submersible pump which is positioned in the effluent of the trickling filters therefore the inflow to the pilot plant consists of already treated wastewater with a mean influent concentration for the investigated operation described in table 4 the post denitrification zone is operated as mbbr under anoxic conditions and mixed with a centric mechanical stirrer providing good mixing at 47 rpm for the denitrification of nitrate nitrogen doc must be available to the microorganism and therefore external carbon is added to the process of the pilot plant the addition of the external carbon was carried out by a dosing device directly at the inlet of the pilot plant in correlation with the nox n concentration of the influent methanol ch3oh was used as an external carbon source biofilm carriers required for the mbbr process were launched with a filling ratio of 33 from hel x table 1 with a total protected biofilm surface area of 1735 m2 according to 17 the filling ratio should be under 70 to move the carrier suspension freely other studies showed that an optimum filling ratio of 40 should be chosen to reach sufficient oxygen transfer efficiency for the attached biofilm 18 19 following denitrification the water flows further into the post aeration section via a steel perforated plate the post aeration not in use during the present study is designed to eliminate any remaining carbon from dosage if required and to strip n2 after the post aeration zone excess sludge is separated in the post clarifier by sedimentation and flotation sludge pumps are installed for the discharge of excess sludge the operating conditions during the start up phase and the one year operation from july 2019 to july 2020 are described in the table below 2 2 continuous measurements two methods were used in measuring the performance data of the pilot plant for one continuous online measurement by spectrometer probes and sensors was carried out and recorded online table 3 in the inlet the parameters nox n po4 p and the process flow were determined temperature and ph were measured within the denitrification mbbr zone in the effluent the parameters no3 n and no2 n were measured 2 3 sampling analysis additionally laboratory analytic tests were carried out weekly to check online values the study of deviations in online measurement and laboratory analytic tests revealed only small discrepancies the online measurement parameters no3 n deviated at a maximum from 1 00 to 1 28 mg l po4 p from 0 40 to 0 09 mg l and no2 n from 0 86 to 0 36 mg l compared to the measurement by probes in the analytics laboratory which was carried out once a week using the lck cuvette test system by hach lange gmbh no3 n lck339 0 23 13 50 mg l po4 p lck348 0 5 5 0 mg l po4 p lck349 0 05 1 5 mg l no2 n lck 342 0 6 6 0 mg l cod lck 1414 5 60 mg l because of negligible deviation between these methods both were used to interpret the operation of the pilot plant unfortunately the cod measurements could only be measured in the laboratory because there was no suitable continous measuring probe or sensor for this parameter 2 4 carbon dosage the wwtps at klagsham and sjölunda were designed as activated sludge plant for nitrification and an mbbr process was built for regular post denitrification in the mainstream operated with nitrate nitrogen concentration levels of 20 mg l 14 in this study in comparison the post denitrification works as an additional system to polish already treated wastewater in the effluent pre denitrification is already achieved at the wwtp fig 1 the wwtp in sjölunda uses methanol as an external carbon for post denitrification other boundary conditions in sjölunda such as higher filling ratio and higher nox n influent concentration to the mbbr denitrification differ from the general conditions in this study nevertheless methanol seems to be suitable due to its low cost and good controllability 17 which is why methanol was also used to operate the pilot plant the stoichiometrically required methanol for denitrification to reduce 1 kgno3 n is 2 47 kg methanol 22 experimental studies and literature studies show that in practice 3 0 kg ch3oh methanol kg no3 n in the influent is necessary for complete denitrification 23 in this case according to the cod ch3oh ratio of 1 5 24 a dosage of 4 5 kg cod methanol kg no3 n is the minimum required for a dosage of 3 0 kg ch3oh kg no3 n further studies show methanol to nitrate nitrogen ratios between 3 and 4 kg ch3oh kg no3 n in practice 15 due to the effect of dissolved oxygen in the denitrification process more methanol is needed this can be calculated approximately to 1 kg o2 0 87 kg methanol 22 the carbon dosage at the pilot plant was set in correlation with the influent sum parameter nox n because continuous no3 n influent measurement was not available during operation different dosage ratios between 3 0 and 5 1 kg ch3oh kg nox ninfluent were tested 2 5 carbon interruption stable operation of the pilot plant or the process can only be ensured with sufficient carbon addition since the easily degradable carbons are no longer present in the feed the biochemical process of the microorganisms is inhibited in order to check to what extent the entire process is affected in the absence of carbon dosage carbon interruptions were simulated in total five carbon interruptions with a duration of 21 days 2 days 2 days 4 days and 20 days were simulated by stopping the methanol dosage 2 6 calculation equations the following calculation equations are the

plant will be presented as well as the findings of the pilot plant operation for the period july 2019 to july 2020 treating the low strength effluent of the trickling filters and the effects of simulated carbon interruptions on the process results in figs 3 and 5 were created based on the measured parameters in the laboratory due to missing continuous no3 n online measurement in the influent further results in this study figs 4 6 were created on the basis of the continuous online measurements with spectrometer probes and sensors as described in section 2 2 3 1 start up phase april 2019 june 2019 to start up the operation of the pilot plant the denitrification mbbr was filled with biofilm covered carriers the new carriers were previously placed on top of the nitrifying trickling filters for several weeks before start up the biofilm on the carriers therefore consisted mostly of autotrophic biomass and only limited heterotrophic microorganisms that are needed for denitrification still a quick start up could be observed within a few weeks during the start up phase from 3 april 2019 to 02 june 2019 fig 3 the increase in process flow led to increasing nitrate nitrogen load and resulted in hydraulic retention times hrt of 5 1 to 1 0 h the no3 n concentration in the influent to the pilot plant effluent trickling filters varied between 9 4 and 15 4 mgno3 n l the methanol dosage was set to 3 0 kg methanol kg nox ninfluent at the beginning and was adjusted successively up to 3 9 kg methanol kg nox ninfluent the influent temperature in this phase increased slightly from 14 0 to 19 0 c and the process flow was raised incrementally from 2 1 to 10 6 m3 h starting at low nitrate nitrogen loads supported the growth of heterotrophic biomass for denitrification and an instant denitrification performance could be measured even from the very beginning the pilot plant already fulfilled the designed and required denitrification performance with concentrations below 5 mgno3 n l in the effluent despite the increasing nitrate nitrogen loads in the influent to the pilot plant from 0 24 to 1 22 gnox n m2 d caused by the rise of process flow a steadily increasing denitrification performance could be observed the effluent concentrations remained below 5 mgno3 n l with only one exception even at a process flow of 10 6 m3 h the hrt in the pilot plant decreased to 1 h with the increased process flow of 10 6 m3 h see fig 3 the concentrations in the effluent suggest that even at the maximum process flow the capacity limits were not yet reached because of sufficient denitrification the process flow of 10 6 m3 h and the increased carbon dosage of 3 9 kg methanol kg nox ninfluent were kept constant for further operation 3 2 continuous operation july 2019 july 2020 fig 4 shows the nox n removal rate after start up in the period july 2019 to july 2020 as a function of the nox n load in the influent to the pilot plant with carbon dosages between 3 9 and 4 1 kg methanol kg nox n fig 6 during operation it excludes results of operational malfunction such as carbon interruption that were simulated to investigate the stability of the process and changed carbon dosages 3 1 5 1 kg methanol kg noxn the average removal efficiency during one year of operation including summer and winter temperatures table 4 was 71 with mean effluent concentrations of only 3 8 mgnox n l and reaching a maximum specific nox n removal rate of 2 07 gnox n m2 d the nox n removal in this post denitrification process mainly shows the removal of nitrate nitrogen due to its toxicity to aquatic life 25 no2 n was closely investigated no2 n concentrations in the effluent of the pilot plant increased slightly from 0 3 mgno2 n l to 0 6 mgno2 n l median values during normal operation according to l kopec 16 reduction rates in the post denitrification of an mbbr for total nitrogen removal of 86 can be reached the higher total nitrogen removal rates found by kopec compared to this study can be explained by the fact that l kopec worked with a sequencing batch reactor that was designed for post denitrification with recirculation furthermore the nitrate nitrogen concentrations in kopec s study of 37 mgno3 n l are favorable for the removal rates in biological denitrification according to the monod kinetic 26 compared to the low concentration levels found in the influent of 10 12 mgno3 n l in this study 3 3 temperature influence fig 5 shows the effect of varying seasonal temperatures on the no3 n influent load compared to the no3 n removal rate during one year of pilot plant operation the no3 n influent load varies between 0 74 and 2 17 gno3 n m2 d it is caused by lower but still stable nitrification rates of the trickling filters in the colder season of the large wwtp lower temperatures are mostly present in autumn and winter with min of 9 c and max of 16 c resulting in slightly lower influent loads the removal rates of the pilot plant at lower temperatures lie in a range between 0 39 gno3 n m2 d and 1 20 gno3 n m2 d those surprisingly low but still stable removal rates are reached despite the low hrt of only 1 h and low influent concentrations with a median value of 10 0 mgno3 n l table 4 the removal rates in spring and summer min 15 c max 22 c are in a range between 0 77 and 1 49 gno3 n m2 d and therefore significantly higher than in autumn and winter to optimize the process temperature dependent loading of the system should be recommended to increase the hrt in periods with lower temperatures this aspect will be investigated further in future experiments at the pilot plant besides the influence of the temperature lower nitrification rates in the trickling filters lead to even lower nitrate nitrogen concentrations in the influent of the pilot plant with a median value of 8 6 mgnox n l in autumn and winter compared to 10 0 mgnox n l in spring and summer 3 4 phosphorus limitation another study found that phosphorus can be a limiting factor for post denitrification 14 m mases 14 observed that influent concentrations above 0 05 0 10 mgpo4 p l to the mbbr were required for stable post denitrification however the process described by mases operates at higher no3 n concentrations to be eliminated therefore more phosphorus is needed than in this presented study the median influent concentration to the pilot plant of 0 2 mgpo4 p l and minimum concentration of 0 1 mgpo4 p l table 4 were measured and no effect on the process was observed furthermore the annual average ratio of filtrated pinfluent nox ninfluent at klagshamn with a factor of 0 027 in 2009 and 0 050 in 2007 14 compared to 0 057 pinfluent nox ninfluent in this study shows that phosphorus is not a limiting factor for post denitrification in this process 3 5 carbon dosage and interruptions to investigate the stability of the mbbr process for post denitrification in the low strength effluent for a large wwtp and to assess the microbiological behavior of the organisms a total of five carbon interruptions were simulated the interruptions and continuous operation of one year are displayed in fig 6 additionally different carbon dosages with methanol were investigated to observe the performance of the process fig 6 shows the nox n removal rates over the period of one year july 2019 july 2020 depending on the temperature and carbon dosage including planned carbon interruptions positive nox removal concentrations show the results for denitrification whereas negative nox n removal concentrations lead to the assumption that nitrification takes place to a low degree during carbon interruptions the carbon dosage in normal operation was set to a ratio of 3 9 to 4 1 kg methanol kg nox ninfluent from 48d to 72d 16 sept 2019 10 oct 2019 the dosage was increased to 5 1 kg methanol kg nox n influent increasing the carbon dosage did not significantly improve the nox n removal performance instead the performance fell to 0 77 gnox n m2 d because of a sudden fall in temperature from 19 c to 15 c decreasing the carbon dosage from 198d to 224d 13 feb 2020 10 mar 2020 to 3 2 kg methanol kg nox n influent led to a reduction in performance of minus 25 nox n removal increasing the process flow up to 14 m3 h reduced the hrt to 45 min hrt 0 75 still the low hrt does not strongly affect the performance in the process temperature and carbon dosage seem to be the main factors influencing post denitrification at low concentration gradients during the period 294d 329d 19 may 2020 23 june 2020 with temperatures from 16 to 20 c carbon dosage of 3 9 kg methanol kg nox n influent and low hrt of 0 8 fig 6 showed significantly higher removal rates 1 5 1 8 g m2 d due to the influence of increasing temperatures fig 6 also shows the five periods of carbon interruptions with the interruption in carbon dosage the denitrification stops abruptly at each interruption in addition the cod entering the denitrification process at the pilot plant seems to be residual during carbon interruptions the cod in the influent and the effluent was about 32 mgcodfiltered l and no denitrification was observed after reconnecting the carbon dosage following the first interruption at 178d 198d 21 days the nox n removal increased up to 11 percentage of nox n removal in the pilot plant within four days after 10 days the nox n removal increased up to the original level of 40 the temperature was in the range of 10 13 c in the second 252d 253d 2 days third 278d 279d 2 days and fourth 287d 290d 4 days carbon interruption the denitrification stopped abruptly within one day however the denitrifying process also recovered into steady operation within one day as soon as carbon was present again this proves the stability when recovering the process performance after short carbon interruptions after the fifth carbon interruption at 333d 352d 20 days with influent temperatures between 16 and 20 c a much faster regain of the original nox n removal rate could be observed after reconnecting the carbon dosage after one day the nox n removal increased up to 11 and further increased to 51 within another day reaching its normal level on the third day with 70 nox n removal as fig 7 shows the carriers are covered with biofilm under stable conditions a when enough carbon is dosed to the process during the longer carbon interruptions the thickness of the biofilm on the carriers decreased significantly after 16 days b initial studies have already been conducted to determine the biomass concentration in the process the biofilm was detached from ten carriers according to c steinbrenner 27 biomass concentrations were found in the range between 1 8 and 2 1 kg total solids m3 during stable operation in the denitrification mbbr further investigations are necessary to verify the method of biomass determination and to generate further results also with regard to the microbiological diversity in the biofilm 3 6 aerobic cod degradation and remaining cod in process at the pilot plant the influent concentrations are 7 0 8 0 mgo2 l dissolved oxygen due to the upstream nitrifying trickling filters the average concentration of oxygen in the denitrification mbbr zone was found to be 0 9 mgo2 l these measurement results were confirmed based on random measurements it is assumed that the heterotrophic microorganisms metabolize the available dissolved oxygen in the influent aerobic cod degradation until anoxic conditions are reached then methanol is metabolized further by denitrification of no3 n to nitrogen gas this leads to a difference between 6 1 and 7 1 mgo2 l from aerobic cod degradation the amount of cod degradation must be considered by carbon dosage and added to the required carbon dosage for anoxic denitrification measuring codfiltered during interruption of carbon dosage showed that the codfiltered in the influent to the denitrification process is residual and will not be metabolized by the microorganism further the remaining cod after the denitrification process in normal operation was studied during operation with 3 9 4 1 kg methanol kg nox ninfluent see fig 6 the median influent concentration to the pilot plant was 32 0 mgcodfiltered l compared to the effluent median value of 35 8 mgcodfiltered l a slight amount of 3 8 mgcodfiltered l could be the remaining cod of methanol the presence of remaining cod in the effluent can best be observed in the period with 5 1 kg methanol kg nox ninfluent fig 6 during this period a mean remaining cod methanol of 16 0 mgcodfiltered l could be measured further work is needed to identify the optimum carbon dosage and prevention of remaining cod in the effluent due to the additional process system in addition the necessity of a post aeration zone to eliminate the remaining cod has to be studied 3 7 nitrification in the first carbon interruption for 21 days 21d a slight reduction of no2 n from 1 8 to 1 0 mgno2 n l could be measured as well as a no3 n increase up to 10 0 mgno3 n l reaching higher concentrations compared to the nox n influent concentration nitration of no2 n to no3 n is therefore assumed reconnection of the carbon led to nitrite formation for one week from 1 0 to 2 1 mgno2 n l during the fifth carbon interruption of 20 days an increase of no2 n from 0 5 in the influent to 1 7 mgno2 n l in the effluent was observed without a measurable increase of no3 n during normal operation nh4 n is reduced from influent concentrations of 3 4 mgnh4 n l median value see table 4 to 2 5 mgnh4 n l median value in the effluent of the pilot plant therefore 0 9 mgnh4 n l would be available for nitration of nh4 n to no2 n furthermore higher dissolved oxygen concentrations are available during carbon interruptions for autotrophs since no faster aerobic carbon degradation takes place the results indicate that nitration to no2 n constantly takes place to a small degree during normal operation the median value in the effluent is 0 6 mgno2 n l compared to the median value of 0 3 mgno2 n l in the influent during normal operation these results can be supported by the general conditions needed for nitrification like a high concentration of dissolved oxygen 7 8 mgo2 l and washed in nitrifying microorganisms from the trickling filter that are currently present in this process due to its toxicity to aquatic life nitrite in the effluent must be limited 4 conclusions increasing influent loads to large wwtps in growing urban areas often result in effluent requirements being exceeded especially with respect to the parameter nitrogen instead of costly enlargements of the existing wastewater treatment system a targeted treatment system to polish treated wastewater is suggested to obtain knowledge and design parameters for a full scale single stage system a pilot plant was operated and investigated during the start up phase with low specific loads heterotrophic biomass growth for denitrification proved to be rapid and stable denitrification performance was achieved during the 60 day start up phase the required denitrification performance was met with effluent concentrations well below 5 mgno3 n l at the targeted process flow of 10 6 m3 h with an hrt of 1 h after the start up phase the continuous operation over one year showed an average nox n removal performance of 71 at temperatures 15 c with a stable nitrate nitrogen reduction from 10 0 mgno3 n l to 5 0 mgno3 n l the main parameters affecting the biological process are the low no3 n concentrations in the already treated wastewater and low temperatures 15 c despite the temperature variations the no3 n concentrations in the effluent were found to be well below 5 mgno3 n l throughout the year thus meeting the required effluent concentrations even a maximum nox n removal rate of 2 07 gnox n m2 d was measured during summer t 20 c in combination with relatively high nox n influent concentrations of 12 4 mgnox n l nonetheless this is not expected to be the absolute maximum the process proved to be robust even when simulating carbon dosage interruptions with short term carbon interruptions between 2 and 4 days the denitrification stops abruptly but there is a return to the original performance within one day after reconnecting the carbon dosage after long term carbon interruptions between 20 and 21 days the process resumed within 3 days in summer and up to 10 days in winter even po4 p concentrations below 0 2 mg l do not seem to be a limiting factor for complete denitrification below 5 mgno3 n l further investigations are necessary to optimize the correct carbon dosage depending on temperature as well as changing nox n concentrations and complete degrading of methanol from the influent another important issue is the limited nitration observed especially during carbon interruptions this study demonstrates that denitrification can be realized using a single stage mbbr even at low concentration gradients and proves the robustness of the biofilm process furthermore the process represents a cost efficient and resource saving solution for polluted and overloaded large scale wastewater treatment plants where reduced reactor sizes are possible due to the low hrt of 1 h required declaration of competing interest all authors have

13122,in growing urban areas increasing nitrogen loads to large wwtps can be problematic for the existing nitrification denitrification stage and necessitate the enlargement of the entire wastewater treatment system nitrogen removal is usually the most critical process in overload situations often limited by the hydraulic capacities for recirculation a simple and cost effective way to meet low nitrogen effluent requirements is the proposed single stage mbbr this system can be implemented additionally as a bypass in the effluent to investigate the practicability of the proposed concept a pilot plant was operated to polish treated wastewater with an mbbr the process is designed for post treatment denitrification to eliminate the remaining nitrate nitrogen in the already treated wastewater the paper extends the current knowledge of low concentration gradients since no information is available on the post treatment of nitrate nitrogen to 2 5 mg l or below in addition the tested hydraulic retention time hrt of only 60 min is exceptional allowing future single stage mbbrs to be sized smaller the first results of one year of operation showed a stable nitrate nitrogen reduction from 10 0 mgno3 n l to 5 0 mgno3 n l to comply with required effluent concentrations for total nitrogen a maximum removal rate of 2 07 gnox n m2 d at t 20 c was reached average nox n removal of 71 could be achieved at a minimal hrt of only 1 h following a two month start up phase the process proved to be robust after carbon dosage interruptions full performance was regained after only three days in summer graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords denitrification mbbr nitrogen removal nitrate nitrogen polishing process bypass operation 1 introduction in germany and many other countries population density has increased in recent decades especially in urban areas according to the german federal statistical office growth in cities and metropolitan regions is expected to continue in the future wastewater treatment in these areas and cities is often carried out by large wastewater treatment plants wwtps designed for 100 000 population equivalents or more these wwtps must comply with strict effluent limits in particular nitrogen is subject to a limit of 13 mg l in 2 h composite samples to reach these strict effluent concentrations new technologies are necessary to upgrade overloaded wwtps 1 the most common technology for biological nitrogen removal in the mainstream of large wwtps is nitrification denitrification 2 pre denitrification for example is well understood and established for large wwtps 3 5 therefore the nitrogen removal efficiency depends on among other factors the necessary recirculation ratio to transfer produced nitrate nitrogen into the pre anoxic zone and maximum elimination rates between 75 and 90 can be reached 6 ingolstadt wwtp is designed for 275 000 population equivalents pe actual loads are increasing in the raw wastewater especially nitrogen resulting in an actual load of approximately 290 000 pe with respect to this parameter the biological treatment is accomplished in the first biological stage fig 1 by pre denitrification and phosphorus removal followed by a high loaded activated sludge process after a pass through the interim clarifier nitrification in the second biological stage is carried out by a trickling filter due to the low reaction kinetics of nitrification compared to chemical oxygen demand cod removal and the limited hydraulic possibilities for recirculation the cod supply for existing pre denitrification is limited this is especially true for two stage wwtps with pre denitrification the plant has already been optimized and recirculation of the wastewater cannot be increased further due to structural constraints further upgrading the mainstream process can only be achieved by a costly expansion of both existing stages a cost efficient and more resource saving solution is required to handle the effluent requirements thus to reach the aspired goals very quickly short planning and construction times are necessary since only the nitrogen effluent requirement of 13 mg l is problematic due to high nitrate nitrogen influent concentrations specifically targeted nitrate nitrogen removal is proposed as post denitrification of the low strength effluent of the wwtp with methanol as an external carbon source a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr is planned in an existing tank previously pre thickener where approximately 60 of the effluent can be treated fig 1 in the bypass nitrate nitrogen should be reduced from 10 mgno3 n l to lower than 5 mgno3 n l so that the nitrogen concentration in the entire effluent will be well below the effluent requirement of 13 mg l total nitrogen the mbbr process was first introduced in the 1990s by h ødegaard 7 and is now known as a reliable treatment for wwtps particularly smaller wwtps 8 9 post denitrification as mbbr is well understood for regular nitrogen removal and is documented in the literature 10 12 mbbrs have also been implemented to full scale plants for post denitrification in the mainstream 13 15 and even as an application to small wwtps after trickling filters to reduce total nitrogen removal 16 mbbrs for denitrification have not been used in a single stage to polish treated wastewater of large wwtps however due to the low concentrations in the effluent of the wwtp inflow to the mbbr post denitrification it was unclear whether stable denitrification could be achieved at low no3 n concentrations thus the functionality of the presented large scale concept was questionable therefore a pilot plant was operated to investigate the practicality of the single stage mbbr system installed at the wwtp and to gain experience for the planned operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot plant a pilot plant was built in a 20 foot container for the preliminary testing of the planned post denitrification of the treated wastewater fig 2 therefore the pilot plant is installed in the bypass between effluent of the trickling filters and inlet to the existing secondary clarifier the 20 foot container was divided into three zones which are connected by permeable perforated sheets thus the pilot plant is operated as a continuous system the 20 foot container includes a denitrification basin with 10 6 m3 a post aeration zone with 1 8 m3 and a post clarifier with 12 5 m3 the aeration zone was not in operation during the present study a post clarifier zone was installed in the pilot plant for sludge analysis and effluent measurement for the final large scale implementation fig 1 an additional secondary clarifier is not planned since the existing secondary clarifier will be used here the inflow is carried out by a submersible pump which is positioned in the effluent of the trickling filters therefore the inflow to the pilot plant consists of already treated wastewater with a mean influent concentration for the investigated operation described in table 4 the post denitrification zone is operated as mbbr under anoxic conditions and mixed with a centric mechanical stirrer providing good mixing at 47 rpm for the denitrification of nitrate nitrogen doc must be available to the microorganism and therefore external carbon is added to the process of the pilot plant the addition of the external carbon was carried out by a dosing device directly at the inlet of the pilot plant in correlation with the nox n concentration of the influent methanol ch3oh was used as an external carbon source biofilm carriers required for the mbbr process were launched with a filling ratio of 33 from hel x table 1 with a total protected biofilm surface area of 1735 m2 according to 17 the filling ratio should be under 70 to move the carrier suspension freely other studies showed that an optimum filling ratio of 40 should be chosen to reach sufficient oxygen transfer efficiency for the attached biofilm 18 19 following denitrification the water flows further into the post aeration section via a steel perforated plate the post aeration not in use during the present study is designed to eliminate any remaining carbon from dosage if required and to strip n2 after the post aeration zone excess sludge is separated in the post clarifier by sedimentation and flotation sludge pumps are installed for the discharge of excess sludge the operating conditions during the start up phase and the one year operation from july 2019 to july 2020 are described in the table below 2 2 continuous measurements two methods were used in measuring the performance data of the pilot plant for one continuous online measurement by spectrometer probes and sensors was carried out and recorded online table 3 in the inlet the parameters nox n po4 p and the process flow were determined temperature and ph were measured within the denitrification mbbr zone in the effluent the parameters no3 n and no2 n were measured 2 3 sampling analysis additionally laboratory analytic tests were carried out weekly to check online values the study of deviations in online measurement and laboratory analytic tests revealed only small discrepancies the online measurement parameters no3 n deviated at a maximum from 1 00 to 1 28 mg l po4 p from 0 40 to 0 09 mg l and no2 n from 0 86 to 0 36 mg l compared to the measurement by probes in the analytics laboratory which was carried out once a week using the lck cuvette test system by hach lange gmbh no3 n lck339 0 23 13 50 mg l po4 p lck348 0 5 5 0 mg l po4 p lck349 0 05 1 5 mg l no2 n lck 342 0 6 6 0 mg l cod lck 1414 5 60 mg l because of negligible deviation between these methods both were used to interpret the operation of the pilot plant unfortunately the cod measurements could only be measured in the laboratory because there was no suitable continous measuring probe or sensor for this parameter 2 4 carbon dosage the wwtps at klagsham and sjölunda were designed as activated sludge plant for nitrification and an mbbr process was built for regular post denitrification in the mainstream operated with nitrate nitrogen concentration levels of 20 mg l 14 in this study in comparison the post denitrification works as an additional system to polish already treated wastewater in the effluent pre denitrification is already achieved at the wwtp fig 1 the wwtp in sjölunda uses methanol as an external carbon for post denitrification other boundary conditions in sjölunda such as higher filling ratio and higher nox n influent concentration to the mbbr denitrification differ from the general conditions in this study nevertheless methanol seems to be suitable due to its low cost and good controllability 17 which is why methanol was also used to operate the pilot plant the stoichiometrically required methanol for denitrification to reduce 1 kgno3 n is 2 47 kg methanol 22 experimental studies and literature studies show that in practice 3 0 kg ch3oh methanol kg no3 n in the influent is necessary for complete denitrification 23 in this case according to the cod ch3oh ratio of 1 5 24 a dosage of 4 5 kg cod methanol kg no3 n is the minimum required for a dosage of 3 0 kg ch3oh kg no3 n further studies show methanol to nitrate nitrogen ratios between 3 and 4 kg ch3oh kg no3 n in practice 15 due to the effect of dissolved oxygen in the denitrification process more methanol is needed this can be calculated approximately to 1 kg o2 0 87 kg methanol 22 the carbon dosage at the pilot plant was set in correlation with the influent sum parameter nox n because continuous no3 n influent measurement was not available during operation different dosage ratios between 3 0 and 5 1 kg ch3oh kg nox ninfluent were tested 2 5 carbon interruption stable operation of the pilot plant or the process can only be ensured with sufficient carbon addition since the easily degradable carbons are no longer present in the feed the biochemical process of the microorganisms is inhibited in order to check to what extent the entire process is affected in the absence of carbon dosage carbon interruptions were simulated in total five carbon interruptions with a duration of 21 days 2 days 2 days 4 days and 20 days were simulated by stopping the methanol dosage 2 6 calculation equations the following calculation equations are the

simulated carbon interruptions on the process results in figs 3 and 5 were created based on the measured parameters in the laboratory due to missing continuous no3 n online measurement in the influent further results in this study figs 4 6 were created on the basis of the continuous online measurements with spectrometer probes and sensors as described in section 2 2 3 1 start up phase april 2019 june 2019 to start up the operation of the pilot plant the denitrification mbbr was filled with biofilm covered carriers the new carriers were previously placed on top of the nitrifying trickling filters for several weeks before start up the biofilm on the carriers therefore consisted mostly of autotrophic biomass and only limited heterotrophic microorganisms that are needed for denitrification still a quick start up could be observed within a few weeks during the start up phase from 3 april 2019 to 02 june 2019 fig 3 the increase in process flow led to increasing nitrate nitrogen load and resulted in hydraulic retention times hrt of 5 1 to 1 0 h the no3 n concentration in the influent to the pilot plant effluent trickling filters varied between 9 4 and 15 4 mgno3 n l the methanol dosage was set to 3 0 kg methanol kg nox ninfluent at the beginning and was adjusted successively up to 3 9 kg methanol kg nox ninfluent the influent temperature in this phase increased slightly from 14 0 to 19 0 c and the process flow was raised incrementally from 2 1 to 10 6 m3 h starting at low nitrate nitrogen loads supported the growth of heterotrophic biomass for denitrification and an instant denitrification performance could be measured even from the very beginning the pilot plant already fulfilled the designed and required denitrification performance with concentrations below 5 mgno3 n l in the effluent despite the increasing nitrate nitrogen loads in the influent to the pilot plant from 0 24 to 1 22 gnox n m2 d caused by the rise of process flow a steadily increasing denitrification performance could be observed the effluent concentrations remained below 5 mgno3 n l with only one exception even at a process flow of 10 6 m3 h the hrt in the pilot plant decreased to 1 h with the increased process flow of 10 6 m3 h see fig 3 the concentrations in the effluent suggest that even at the maximum process flow the capacity limits were not yet reached because of sufficient denitrification the process flow of 10 6 m3 h and the increased carbon dosage of 3 9 kg methanol kg nox ninfluent were kept constant for further operation 3 2 continuous operation july 2019 july 2020 fig 4 shows the nox n removal rate after start up in the period july 2019 to july 2020 as a function of the nox n load in the influent to the pilot plant with carbon dosages between 3 9 and 4 1 kg methanol kg nox n fig 6 during operation it excludes results of operational malfunction such as carbon interruption that were simulated to investigate the stability of the process and changed carbon dosages 3 1 5 1 kg methanol kg noxn the average removal efficiency during one year of operation including summer and winter temperatures table 4 was 71 with mean effluent concentrations of only 3 8 mgnox n l and reaching a maximum specific nox n removal rate of 2 07 gnox n m2 d the nox n removal in this post denitrification process mainly shows the removal of nitrate nitrogen due to its toxicity to aquatic life 25 no2 n was closely investigated no2 n concentrations in the effluent of the pilot plant increased slightly from 0 3 mgno2 n l to 0 6 mgno2 n l median values during normal operation according to l kopec 16 reduction rates in the post denitrification of an mbbr for total nitrogen removal of 86 can be reached the higher total nitrogen removal rates found by kopec compared to this study can be explained by the fact that l kopec worked with a sequencing batch reactor that was designed for post denitrification with recirculation furthermore the nitrate nitrogen concentrations in kopec s study of 37 mgno3 n l are favorable for the removal rates in biological denitrification according to the monod kinetic 26 compared to the low concentration levels found in the influent of 10 12 mgno3 n l in this study 3 3 temperature influence fig 5 shows the effect of varying seasonal temperatures on the no3 n influent load compared to the no3 n removal rate during one year of pilot plant operation the no3 n influent load varies between 0 74 and 2 17 gno3 n m2 d it is caused by lower but still stable nitrification rates of the trickling filters in the colder season of the large wwtp lower temperatures are mostly present in autumn and winter with min of 9 c and max of 16 c resulting in slightly lower influent loads the removal rates of the pilot plant at lower temperatures lie in a range between 0 39 gno3 n m2 d and 1 20 gno3 n m2 d those surprisingly low but still stable removal rates are reached despite the low hrt of only 1 h and low influent concentrations with a median value of 10 0 mgno3 n l table 4 the removal rates in spring and summer min 15 c max 22 c are in a range between 0 77 and 1 49 gno3 n m2 d and therefore significantly higher than in autumn and winter to optimize the process temperature dependent loading of the system should be recommended to increase the hrt in periods with lower temperatures this aspect will be investigated further in future experiments at the pilot plant besides the influence of the temperature lower nitrification rates in the trickling filters lead to even lower nitrate nitrogen concentrations in the influent of the pilot plant with a median value of 8 6 mgnox n l in autumn and winter compared to 10 0 mgnox n l in spring and summer 3 4 phosphorus limitation another study found that phosphorus can be a limiting factor for post denitrification 14 m mases 14 observed that influent concentrations above 0 05 0 10 mgpo4 p l to the mbbr were required for stable post denitrification however the process described by mases operates at higher no3 n concentrations to be eliminated therefore more phosphorus is needed than in this presented study the median influent concentration to the pilot plant of 0 2 mgpo4 p l and minimum concentration of 0 1 mgpo4 p l table 4 were measured and no effect on the process was observed furthermore the annual average ratio of filtrated pinfluent nox ninfluent at klagshamn with a factor of 0 027 in 2009 and 0 050 in 2007 14 compared to 0 057 pinfluent nox ninfluent in this study shows that phosphorus is not a limiting factor for post denitrification in this process 3 5 carbon dosage and interruptions to investigate the stability of the mbbr process for post denitrification in the low strength effluent for a large wwtp and to assess the microbiological behavior of the organisms a total of five carbon interruptions were simulated the interruptions and continuous operation of one year are displayed in fig 6 additionally different carbon dosages with methanol were investigated to observe the performance of the process fig 6 shows the nox n removal rates over the period of one year july 2019 july 2020 depending on the temperature and carbon dosage including planned carbon interruptions positive nox removal concentrations show the results for denitrification whereas negative nox n removal concentrations lead to the assumption that nitrification takes place to a low degree during carbon interruptions the carbon dosage in normal operation was set to a ratio of 3 9 to 4 1 kg methanol kg nox ninfluent from 48d to 72d 16 sept 2019 10 oct 2019 the dosage was increased to 5 1 kg methanol kg nox n influent increasing the carbon dosage did not significantly improve the nox n removal performance instead the performance fell to 0 77 gnox n m2 d because of a sudden fall in temperature from 19 c to 15 c decreasing the carbon dosage from 198d to 224d 13 feb 2020 10 mar 2020 to 3 2 kg methanol kg nox n influent led to a reduction in performance of minus 25 nox n removal increasing the process flow up to 14 m3 h reduced the hrt to 45 min hrt 0 75 still the low hrt does not strongly affect the performance in the process temperature and carbon dosage seem to be the main factors influencing post denitrification at low concentration gradients during the period 294d 329d 19 may 2020 23 june 2020 with temperatures from 16 to 20 c carbon dosage of 3 9 kg methanol kg nox n influent and low hrt of 0 8 fig 6 showed significantly higher removal rates 1 5 1 8 g m2 d due to the influence of increasing temperatures fig 6 also shows the five periods of carbon interruptions with the interruption in carbon dosage the denitrification stops abruptly at each interruption in addition the cod entering the denitrification process at the pilot plant seems to be residual during carbon interruptions the cod in the influent and the effluent was about 32 mgcodfiltered l and no denitrification was observed after reconnecting the carbon dosage following the first interruption at 178d 198d 21 days the nox n removal increased up to 11 percentage of nox n removal in the pilot plant within four days after 10 days the nox n removal increased up to the original level of 40 the temperature was in the range of 10 13 c in the second 252d 253d 2 days third 278d 279d 2 days and fourth 287d 290d 4 days carbon interruption the denitrification stopped abruptly within one day however the denitrifying process also recovered into steady operation within one day as soon as carbon was present again this proves the stability when recovering the process performance after short carbon interruptions after the fifth carbon interruption at 333d 352d 20 days with influent temperatures between 16 and 20 c a much faster regain of the original nox n removal rate could be observed after reconnecting the carbon dosage after one day the nox n removal increased up to 11 and further increased to 51 within another day reaching its normal level on the third day with 70 nox n removal as fig 7 shows the carriers are covered with biofilm under stable conditions a when enough carbon is dosed to the process during the longer carbon interruptions the thickness of the biofilm on the carriers decreased significantly after 16 days b initial studies have already been conducted to determine the biomass concentration in the process the biofilm was detached from ten carriers according to c steinbrenner 27 biomass concentrations were found in the range between 1 8 and 2 1 kg total solids m3 during stable operation in the denitrification mbbr further investigations are necessary to verify the method of biomass determination and to generate further results also with regard to the microbiological diversity in the biofilm 3 6 aerobic cod degradation and remaining cod in process at the pilot plant the influent concentrations are 7 0 8 0 mgo2 l dissolved oxygen due to the upstream nitrifying trickling filters the average concentration of oxygen in the denitrification mbbr zone was found to be 0 9 mgo2 l these measurement results were confirmed based on random measurements it is assumed that the heterotrophic microorganisms metabolize the available dissolved oxygen in the influent aerobic cod degradation until anoxic conditions are reached then methanol is metabolized further by denitrification of no3 n to nitrogen gas this leads to a difference between 6 1 and 7 1 mgo2 l from aerobic cod degradation the amount of cod degradation must be considered by carbon dosage and added to the required carbon dosage for anoxic denitrification measuring codfiltered during interruption of carbon dosage showed that the codfiltered in the influent to the denitrification process is residual and will not be metabolized by the microorganism further the remaining cod after the denitrification process in normal operation was studied during operation with 3 9 4 1 kg methanol kg nox ninfluent see fig 6 the median influent concentration to the pilot plant was 32 0 mgcodfiltered l compared to the effluent median value of 35 8 mgcodfiltered l a slight amount of 3 8 mgcodfiltered l could be the remaining cod of methanol the presence of remaining cod in the effluent can best be observed in the period with 5 1 kg methanol kg nox ninfluent fig 6 during this period a mean remaining cod methanol of 16 0 mgcodfiltered l could be measured further work is needed to identify the optimum carbon dosage and prevention of remaining cod in the effluent due to the additional process system in addition the necessity of a post aeration zone to eliminate the remaining cod has to be studied 3 7 nitrification in the first carbon interruption for 21 days 21d a slight reduction of no2 n from 1 8 to 1 0 mgno2 n l could be measured as well as a no3 n increase up to 10 0 mgno3 n l reaching higher concentrations compared to the nox n influent concentration nitration of no2 n to no3 n is therefore assumed reconnection of the carbon led to nitrite formation for one week from 1 0 to 2 1 mgno2 n l during the fifth carbon interruption of 20 days an increase of no2 n from 0 5 in the influent to 1 7 mgno2 n l in the effluent was observed without a measurable increase of no3 n during normal operation nh4 n is reduced from influent concentrations of 3 4 mgnh4 n l median value see table 4 to 2 5 mgnh4 n l median value in the effluent of the pilot plant therefore 0 9 mgnh4 n l would be available for nitration of nh4 n to no2 n furthermore higher dissolved oxygen concentrations are available during carbon interruptions for autotrophs since no faster aerobic carbon degradation takes place the results indicate that nitration to no2 n constantly takes place to a small degree during normal operation the median value in the effluent is 0 6 mgno2 n l compared to the median value of 0 3 mgno2 n l in the influent during normal operation these results can be supported by the general conditions needed for nitrification like a high concentration of dissolved oxygen 7 8 mgo2 l and washed in nitrifying microorganisms from the trickling filter that are currently present in this process due to its toxicity to aquatic life nitrite in the effluent must be limited 4 conclusions increasing influent loads to large wwtps in growing urban areas often result in effluent requirements being exceeded especially with respect to the parameter nitrogen instead of costly enlargements of the existing wastewater treatment system a targeted treatment system to polish treated wastewater is suggested to obtain knowledge and design parameters for a full scale single stage system a pilot plant was operated and investigated during the start up phase with low specific loads heterotrophic biomass growth for denitrification proved to be rapid and stable denitrification performance was achieved during the 60 day start up phase the required denitrification performance was met with effluent concentrations well below 5 mgno3 n l at the targeted process flow of 10 6 m3 h with an hrt of 1 h after the start up phase the continuous operation over one year showed an average nox n removal performance of 71 at temperatures 15 c with a stable nitrate nitrogen reduction from 10 0 mgno3 n l to 5 0 mgno3 n l the main parameters affecting the biological process are the low no3 n concentrations in the already treated wastewater and low temperatures 15 c despite the temperature variations the no3 n concentrations in the effluent were found to be well below 5 mgno3 n l throughout the year thus meeting the required effluent concentrations even a maximum nox n removal rate of 2 07 gnox n m2 d was measured during summer t 20 c in combination with relatively high nox n influent concentrations of 12 4 mgnox n l nonetheless this is not expected to be the absolute maximum the process proved to be robust even when simulating carbon dosage interruptions with short term carbon interruptions between 2 and 4 days the denitrification stops abruptly but there is a return to the original performance within one day after reconnecting the carbon dosage after long term carbon interruptions between 20 and 21 days the process resumed within 3 days in summer and up to 10 days in winter even po4 p concentrations below 0 2 mg l do not seem to be a limiting factor for complete denitrification below 5 mgno3 n l further investigations are necessary to optimize the correct carbon dosage depending on temperature as well as changing nox n concentrations and complete degrading of methanol from the influent another important issue is the limited nitration observed especially during carbon interruptions this study demonstrates that denitrification can be realized using a single stage mbbr even at low concentration gradients and proves the robustness of the biofilm process furthermore the process represents a cost efficient and resource saving solution for polluted and overloaded large scale wastewater treatment plants where reduced reactor sizes are possible due to the low hrt of 1 h required declaration of competing interest all authors have

13123,the construction of a solid state carrier transport prompted z scheme photocatalytic system represents a crucial possibility for green technology as it can achieve valid carrier separation transfer in hybrid heterojunction providing an innovative way to manage improved sunlight driven photocatalytic performance over to conventional composites therefore how to establish a photocatalytic z scheme complex with an appropriate position of energy band and redox capacity has been a research focus herein spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 nanocomposites were integrated with a one step hydrothermal method by using sodium oleate as the surfactant benefitting from the unique spindle shaped bivo4 and ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets the composite photocatalysts possess a large aspect ratio leading to solid light capturing ability and considerable surface areas for photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics the tetracycline tc and ciprofloxacin cip photodegradation rates are as high as 81 10 and 94 8 in 60 min respectively the photocatalytic performance of these ternary composites is superior to other photocatalyst counterparts the spindle shaped bivo4 nanostructures have superior optical performance oriented carrier transport and photooxidation response addressing the short carrier diffusion length issue that could cause a visible recombination rate for the electron hole couple in the conventional bivo4 photocatalyst it is demonstrated that the enhanced photocatalytic performance refers to the improved photogenerated electron hole pairs and rapid carriers transfer in the composite photocatalysts under visible light irradiation this study affords a promising platform for preparing other z scheme photocatalysts with high catalytic performance for the degradation of antibiotics and renewable solar energy collection in biochemical transformation graphical abstract a solid state carrier transport prompted z scheme photocatalytic system based on the spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 heterojunction under simulated sunlight is constructed for highly efficient antibiotics degradation unlabelled image keywords z scheme photocatalyst spindle shaped bivo4 nanorods ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheet antibiotics degradation 1 introduction antibiotics are widely used in various fields such as healthcare agriculture aquaculture veterinary etc in china as the largest producer and user of antibiotics 1 antibiotic residues have been detected in several rivers and even in the running water of cities antibiotic residues and other pollute may enter human bodies through drinking water and aquatic products and lead to many problems such as bacterial resistance endangering the health of human bodies 2 5 due to the inadequate understanding and treatment of wastewater with antibiotics water pollution problems caused by antibiotic residues have been emerging consequently from the perspective of environmental protection and life safety it is demanding to address the issue of antibiotic pollutions at present there are many technologies to handle residual antibiotics in water i physical approaches such as adsorption and extraction microbial degradation although this adsorption approach shows a noticeable performance in removing antibiotics the antibiotics cannot be wholly disposed of and require further treatment ii advanced oxidation methods such as ozone fenton 6 7 photodecomposition electrochemical treatment and semiconductor photocatalysis etc these methods are simple widely used and maybe more suitable for water treatment photocatalytic technology not only can completely degrade antibiotic pollutants but also utilize natural light which is a clean and recycling resource hence it provides a crucial application potential in the antibiotic contamination disposed of in the water environment recently bismuth based photocatalysts such as bivo4 8 9 biox x br i cl 10 13 bi2o3 14 15 bi2wo6 15 bi2moo6 16 17 have been widely concerned which benefit from their unique electronic structure and strong visible light absorption capacity previous studies demonstrated that the properties of bivo4 are dependent on the facet properties crystallographic planes morphology and nanostructure bivo4 crystals usually have three crystallographic styles namely tetragonal zircon like tetragonal scheelite like and monoclinic scheelite like it was reported that under visible light illumination monoclinic bivo4 possesses improved photocatalytic activity for organic pollutants degradation when compared with the other counterparts monoclinic bivo4 has been regarded as one of the most promising sunlight driven photocatalysts due to the unique band edges and band gap 18 19 nevertheless the short carrier diffusion length 70 nm could cause a nonnegligible recombination rate for the electron hole couple in the bivo4 photocatalyst various methods were proposed to address this issue for example well defined morphology design 8 20 33 charge abundant heteroatoms doping 9 34 43 and heterojunctions construction 14 25 44 53 for instance liu et al 24 used ctab as a surfactant for the controlled preparation of bivo4 nanosheets and bivo4 nanorods arini et al 8 used a template free precipitation method to prepare flower like microsphere bivo4 at 60 c with the size around 2 μm to 4 μm mohamad et al prepared micro flower like rgo g c3n4 bivo4 and verified that the existence of rgo benefited the migration and diffusion of photo generated carriers li et al 25 prepared rugby like g c3n4 bivo4 core shell composites by adjusting the ph which showed excellent performance in the degradation of methyl orange basically compared with separate ones these methods used combined to improve the photocatalytic ability of bivo4 would be more effective on the one hand it was reported that the one dimensional bivo4 nanocrystals possessed impressive photoabsorption abilities in the visible light range a superior oxidizing capacity and can be served as an efficient charge transfer supporter on the other hand a powerful photocatalytic system desires efficient separation of photoproduced e h pairs to prevent recombination 10 54 and naturally requires broad bandgap semiconductors nonetheless this is an overwhelming pressure for researchers to design a photocatalyst entity that both owns a slim bandgap to derive extra solar energy operated for generating photoelectrons and owns a proper energy gap to possess appropriate redox potential used for the photocatalysis surrounded by various methods the construction of a solid state carrier transport prompted z scheme photocatalytic system has attracted a lot of attention recently as this can solve the drawbacks of an individual photocatalyst that z scheme photocatalysis organization can broaden the spectral responsive range and promote the carrier separation and transport efficiency as well as advance the redox capacity herein we report the solid state carrier transport prompted z scheme photocatalytic system spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 nanocomposite which provides a unique way to accomplish improved sunlight driven photocatalytic performance over to conventional photocatalysts the spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 composite was synthesized with a one step hydrothermal approach by using sodium oleate as the surfactant the experimental results demonstrate that the content of sodium oleate plays a vital role in the morphology control of final samples and the possible evolution mechanism was studied as well benefited from the unique spindle shaped nanostructure of bivo4 and layered g c3n4 nanosheets the composite photocatalysts possess a large aspect ratio intense light capturing ability and desired carrier transfer path showing excellent photocatalytic degradation performance of antibiotics it is indicated that the boosted photocatalytic efficiency refers to the improved photogenerated e h pairs and rapid carriers transfer efficiency in the composite photocatalysts under visible light exposure the effective carrier transport path and band matching between bivo4 and g c3n4 construct a unique z scheme heterojunction which inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs and pro the catalytic activity this work shows that the bivo4 rgo g c3n4 heterojunction can effectively extend the lifetime of photogenerated electrons which has a certain inspiration for the photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics under simulated sunlight this work brings encouraging ideas for the construction of other z scheme photocatalytic systems with superior performance for antibiotic degradation and sustainable chemical conversion of solar energy collection 2 experimental section 2 1 synthesis of spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 nanocomposites 2 1 1 chemicals and materials melamine c3n6h6 bismuth nitrate pentahydrate bi no 3 5h2o ammonium vanadate nh4vo3 sodium oleate c17h33coona ciprofloxacin chfno cip tetracycline c22h24n2o8 tc anhydrous ethanol deionized water graphene oxide go the reagents were analytical grade without further purification and were introduced in experiments in this study distilled water was used in all experiments 2 1 2 synthesis of g c3n4 nanosheets based on our previous synthesis procedure 55 2 g of melamine powder was dispersed on the bottom of the crucible following the crucible was covered and placed in a muffle furnace with the initial temperature of 30 c and the heating rate of 2 c min heated to 500 c for 2 h and then 540 c for 2 h afterward the obtained yellow bulk sample was ground into powder put into the muffle furnace again and kept at 500 c for 2 h finally the white flocculent ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets were obtained 2 1 3 synthesis of spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 composites firstly 0 097 g bi no3 5h2o 0 002 g go powder and 0 0138 g g c3n4 powder were ultrasonically dispersed into 15 ml ethanol solution a 0 0234 g 0 1 mmol nh4vo3 powder was dissolved in 15 ml deionized water and stirred until the solution was transparent solution b a certain amount of c17h33co2na was dissolved in 15 ml deionized water and stirred until the solution was colorless and transparent solution c the pre made solutions a and b were successively added into solution c to obtain a yellow compound after stirring for 30 min the compound solution was added to a 50 ml teflon reactor and heated at 160 c for 11 h the prepared samples were washed twice with n hexane and ethanol subsequently the final spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 photocatalyst was obtained after drying the centrifugate at 60 c for 6 h to study the influence of the sodium oleate content on the morphology of brc samples the molar ratio of c17h33co2na to bi no3 5h2o was set as 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 and the resulting products were recorded as s brc 1 s brc 2 s brc 3 s brc 4 s brc 5 respectively 2 2 characterization the crystalline phase of the prepared products was studied by x ray diffraction xrd d max2500vl pc and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi was selected to measure the surface composition raman spectroscopy labram hr evolution and infrared spectroscopy ftir cary 5000 were adopted to characterize the composition structure of the samples their microstructure and morphology were investigated by high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem fei tecnai g2 f20 their energy band structure and photoabsorption properties were determined by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv vis drs cary 5000 ac impedance test eis chi660e was adopted to analyze the carrier separation efficiency of the samples room temperature esr spectra of oh and o2 trapped by dmpo were obtained using a bruker a300 a200 electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer 2 3 antibiotic degradation experiments the photocatalytic properties of the as prepared catalysts were assessed by degradation of tc cip and rhb under the irradiation of xenon lamp perfect light technology co ltd beijing pls sxe300 the xenon light source with a power of 300 w was used to simulate sunlight 10 mg photocatalyst was used in all degradation tests before the degradation experiment the suspension of the catalyst and organics 50 ml was stirred for 30 min in the dark to make sure the adsorption desorption equilibrium during the photocatalytic experiments 3 ml suspension was extracted within a certain period then the supernatant was taken into a cuvette and the absorbance spectra were measured by uv vis spectrometer 3 result and discussion it was found that sodium oleate plays an indispensable role in the formation of s brc composites as shown in fig 1 each bi3 ion electrostatically interacts with three oleic acid ions to form a bis oleic acid complex the hydrophobic interaction of the oleate tails assembles into an ordered layered mesostructure while the oleate ions are in a head to head or tail to tail double layer structure after adding nh4vo3 and following through a hydrothermal treatment a similar pearl necklace type bivo4 quantum wire with an ordered internal structure is formed as the reaction progresses these quantum wires tend to gather together due to the decrease in surface energy gradually tilt to a certain angle and accumulate in the radial order while being subjected to the repulsive interaction between oleic acid ions in the external direction as the reaction procedure proceeds a spindle shaped nanostructure with better crystallinity is finally formed in order to further explore the role of various surfactants in preparing bivo4 nanostructures more results are shown in supporting information figs s1 and s2 3 1 structures and compositions the crystallinity determination for the synthesized samples was characterized by xrd as seen in fig 2a it shows that a strong diffraction peak at 2θ 27 8 was observed for pure g c3n4 indicating the presence of the 002 plane which is related to the interlayer accumulation of aromatic rings while the weak 100 plane of g c3n4 at 2θ 13 4 assigned to the auxiliary difference of the graphite phase or the formation of different types of polymeric phase 24 44 for the bivo4 the observed diffraction peaks associated with 28 8 and 30 6 are the characteristic peaks of the monoclinic scheelite phase 18 56 which correspond to the 121 and 040 crystal planes of the monoclinic scheelite bivo4 respectively the nanocomposite photocatalysts s brc 1 2 3 4 5 samples were synthesized by tuning the sodium oleate proportions the characteristic peaks of 28 8 and 30 6 appear in all s brc pieces further demonstrating the crystal stability of the monoclinic bivo4 in addition the diffraction peak positions and intensity corresponding to the crystal plane vary not significantly with the increase of sodium oleate content indicating that the crystal phase structure of bivo4 is stable it should be noted that for all s brc samples no obvious rgo peak could be seen in fig 2a which may be due to the low load of go and the stronger 121 plane of the bivo4 phase as a sensitive analytical method raman spectroscopy can be used to obtain information of molecular vibration and rotation it can be applied to the study of structural defects in the composites as well as seen in fig 2b for the pure g c3n4 several characteristic peaks were observed at 486 539 708 770 1211 and 1234 cm 1 corresponding to the vibration modes of cn heterocycles for the s brc samples different from the xrd results the raman data showed that the vibration peak of bivo4 became more remarkable with the increase of sodium oleate for the detail the external mode of bivo4 is mainly located at 350 cm 1 and 820 cm 1 which are assigned to vo3 deformation and symmetric vo stretching respectively apart from being used as a surfactant sodium oleate can also serve as a reducing agent for reducing go to rgo it was reported that the raman signal intensity ratio of peak d to peak g indicated the number of structural defects in rgo as reflected by the ratio of id ig in the raman spectra fig 2b there are more surface functional groups and defects in the prepared samples with the increase of sodium oleate which shows a higher reduction rate of go more raman characterizations of go were performed and the quality of the go content was further analyzed 57 58 details are shown in fig s3 this was further confirmed by ftir characterization as observed in fig 2c the characteristic absorption band of cn heterocyclic cn and cn structure stretching vibration appeared at a wavenumber of 1200 1700 cm 1 in the s brc composites which indicates the presence of g c3n4 the absorption bands located at 3100 3300 cm 1 attribute to the oh and vo4 3 absorption respectively and the bands located at 1100 cm 1 700 cm 1 and 500 cm 1 correspond to the vo stretching vibration vo bonds and the bio bond respectively these chemical bonds and functional groups in the synthesized samples indicate the successful preparation of the s brc composite photocatalyst 3 2 morphology analysis to obtain the information of microscopic structures and morphologies of the s brc samples sem tem and hrtem measurements were performed as shown in fig 3a and fig s4 it can be seen that the content of sodium oleate plays an essential role in the morphology evolution of the bivo4 products in detail when the molar ratio of c17h33co2na to bi no 3 5h2o is 2 1 the material is filament like when the molar ratio is 3 1 the material is a lump like and rod like complex as the amount of c17h33co2na continues to increase the morphology of bivo4 rgo g c3n4 gradually turns into a tapered rod like structure two ends of the rod like structure are relatively thin with a length of about 300 nm and a diameter of about 5 nm different from many regular rod shaped morphologies the nanorods studied in this work are spindle shaped and the ends of the rods are sharper which means that the radius of curvature changes as the radius of curvature decreases along with the increase in carrier density and electric field intensity the current density of the reaction will increase so as to obtain higher photocatalytic reaction efficiency similar to the spindle shaped structure proposed by liu min 59 the lower the radius of the tip the higher the electric field will be brought under the same light excitation conditions besides the π π interaction between rgo and g c3n4 is beneficial for the enhanced catalytic activity making it easier for organic pollutants adsorbed on the surface of s brc composites during the photocatalytic experiments the electron density and mobility of the s brc hybrids are improved and the electron transfer accelerates it is noted that when the molar ratio of c17h33co2na to bi no 3 5h2o was 5 1 and 6 1 the size of the rod reaches about 5 μm in length and the sample agglomeration appears more sem images of bivo4 rgo g c3n4 composites are shown in fig s4 the morphology of the prepared composite was characterized by fesem tem tem eds and hrtem it can be seen from fig 3a d the spindle shaped bivo4 are densely and relatively uniformly distributed on two dimensional material substrates the length of rods is about 300 nm and most rods are spindle like that is thin at both ends and wide in the middle in the hrtem images it is noted that these bivo4 nanorods have a rough surface and are modified by many bivo4 nanoparticles compared to those nanorods with a smooth surface it was reported that the rough surface could significantly improve the adsorption capacity of the target organic pollutant molecules 19 23 60 the crystal lattice fringes relative to bivo4 and g c3n4 can be found in fig 3e and f the lattice spacing of 0 225 and 0 35 nm could be ascribed to the 121 of bivo4 and 002 of g c3n4 respectively more hrtem images of ultrathin g c3n4 are shown in fig s5 fig 3d shows that the lattice spacing of rgo and bivo4 overlaps indicating a close contact between rgo and bivo4 fig 1g l further revealed the existence of c n o bi and v elements and showed that spindle like bivo4 were uniformly distributed on the surface of two dimensional substrate materials more elements mapping images are displayed in fig s6 the above results proved that bivo4 rgo and g c3n4 were successfully combined possibly forming a heterojunction structure 3 3 xps analysis the chemical composition and elemental states of the synthesized samples are further investigated by xps the xps full spectrum image of s brc 3 and g c3n4 are shown in fig 4a the detailed information can be seen in the high resolution x ray photoelectron spectra shown in fig 4b f as displayed in fig 4b the c 1s spectrum can be de convoluted into two peaks at binding energies of 284 8 and 288 1 ev which correspond to graphitic sites in the carbon nitride matrix cc and the sp2 hybridized carbon in the aromatic ring attached to the amino group c n 3 respectively the n 1 s xps spectrum in fig 4b can be decomposed into three peaks ascribable to c n c at 398 2 ev n c 3 at 399 5 ev and nh at 401 1 ev commonly the shifts in the binding energy of xps spectra refer to the electron migration path in the heterostructure it should be noted that compared with g c3n4 the peak position of c 1s and n 1s in the s brc sample shifts to higher binding energy which is related to an efficient carrier transport in the formed heterojunction it is inferred that the electronegativity of o is relatively large which makes the lone pair of the electron cloud of the no bond shift to n therefore the ability of the n nucleus to bind extranuclear electrons will be strengthened and the binding energy will increase accordingly similarly compared to the single g c3n4 the peak position of c 1 s in the composite material also shifts to bigger binding energy indicating a tight contact formation in the heterojunction photocatalytic system in fig 4d the binding energy peaks at 158 9 ev and 164 3 ev are observed and attributed to bi 4f 7 2 and bi 4f 5 2 respectively in fig 4e the binding energy peaks at 516 4 ev and 528 3 ev are assigned to v 2p 3 2 and v 2p 1 2 respectively it is shown in fig 4f the binding energy peaks located at 530 0 ev and 533 6 ev are attributed to co and c oh in rgo respectively 3 4 photocatalytic performance to investigate the photocatalytic activity of s brc samples the tc and cip degradation experiments were measured under simulated sunlight the dark adsorption was carried out at room temperature for 30 min before the experiment to reach the adsorption desorption equilibrium the experimental results are shown in fig 5a the degradation activity of the ternary s brc composite is better than that of pure g c3n4 after 60 min of simulated sunlight irradiation the tc degradation efficiency over g c3n4 and s brc 1 2 3 4 5 are 34 36 64 44 65 64 81 10 73 51 and 67 44 respectively among them the degradation efficiency of tc by s brc 3 is the highest the reaction rate constant k was calculated from the kinetic equation ln c c0 kt in fig 5c the reaction rate constant for pure g c3n4 is 0 00602 min 1 while the constant for the s brc 3 sample is 0 13843 min 1 which is 22 times that of pure g c3n4 the photocatalytic degradation tests of cip were carried out to further evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the s brc photocatalysts and the degradation efficiency of cip by s brc 3 reaches 94 8 in 60 min fig 5d shows in the photocatalytic degradation of cip the reaction rate constant for pure g c3n4 and s brc 3 samples are 0 01139 min 1 and 0 04653 min 1 respectively indicating that the reaction rate constant for the s brc 3 sample is 4 1 times that for pure g c3n4 more degradation experiments are shown in fig s7 moreover the prepared photocatalyst can be used for photocatalytic hydrogen production indicating that this material has potential application in alleviating the energy crisis as displayed in fig s8 the hydrogen production increased almost straightly after 36 h of reaction indicating that the photocatalytic stability of s brc composites is relatively good to further investigate the go rgo stability of the catalysts in the photocatalytic reaction process the raman signals of s brc samples before and after the photocatalytic reaction were collected as shown in fig s9 the id ig values for the two samples have changed little indicating the content of go rgo is relatively stable 61 64 3 5 photogenerated carrier properties and photocatalytic mechanism uv vis diffuse reflectance technique was further applied for the analysis of optical properties and investigation of the possible mechanism of the s brc composite system fig 6a shows the detailed uv vis diffuse reflection spectra of g c3n4 and s brc hybrid photocatalysts it can be seen that g c3n4 has significant light absorption in the 300 500 nm wavelength range when combined with pure bivo4 the visible absorption range in 500 800 nm is enhanced the absorption band edges of g c3n4 and s brc are about 490 nm and 560 nm respectively compared with g c3n4 the absorption band edges of s brc composites show a significant redshift using the kubelka munk formula the bandgap energy of the semiconductor can be estimated as follows 1 αh ν 1 n a hν e g where α is the light absorption index ν is the light frequency h is planck s constant a is constant eg is the semiconductor bandgap width n is related to the type of semiconductor fig 6 a shows that the eg of pure g c3n4 is 2 79 ev the potential of the valence band and conduction band of pure g c3n4 is calculated according to the following equations 2 e vb χ e e 0 5 e g 3 e cb e vb e g where χ is electronegativity for semiconductors ee is the energy of a free electron on the hydrogen scale eg represents the absorption bandgap energy the n value can be 0 5 and 2 which correspond to direct and indirect semiconductors respectively therefore the valence band potential evb and conduction band potential ecb of g c3n4 are calculated as 1 63 ev and 1 16 ev respectively the correspondence relationship between αhν 2 and hν 2 is obtained by transforming drs curves of different samples as shown in the inset of fig 6a the linear part of the elongated curve is tangent to the x axis and the bandgap of the sample g c3n4 and s brc 3 samples are estimated at 2 79 and 2 53 ev respectively these results indicate that the s brc composites can effectively utilize visible light and improve photocatalytic activity to compare the carrier separation in the samples the fluorescence spectra were performed and shown in fig 6b the emission band situated at around 445 nm refers to the recombination of photogenerated e h pairs within the g c3n4 for the s brc composites one more emission band is located at about 490 nm which is due to the carrier recombination within bivo4 besides the pure g c3n4 possesses low carrier separation efficiency resulting in the most vigorous pl intensity while for the s brc composites all pl peak intensities significantly decrease because of the formation of a new electron transport pathway it also shows bivo4 rgo and g c3n4 have a strong interaction among these s brc samples the fluorescence intensity of s brc 3 is the lowest indicating that the excellent photo generated carrier separation efficiency the separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs and carriers transfer efficiency played an essential role in photocatalytic reactions therefore electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to characterize the photogenerated electron transport properties and the electron transfer speed of the sample in the eis nyquist plots fig 6c the arc radius of s brc composites was smaller than that of g c3n4 indicating that s brc photocatalysts had lower electrical resistance and quicker electron transfer an equivalent circuit diagram fig 6c inset could be obtained by fitting previous studies had shown that rp in the equivalent circuit diagram represents the charge transfer resistance of the semiconductor electrolyte interface reflecting the catalytic activity the calculated results show that the rp value of the s brc 3 sample is about one third of that of pure g c3n4 therefore s brc photocatalysts had lower charge transfer resistance and higher catalytic activity consistent with its higher photocatalytic activity fig 6 d is the eis byrd phase diagram a powerful tool for studying the lifetime of photogenerated electrons in semiconductors the lifetime of the photogenerated electron τe can be obtained by determining the frequency of the intermediate frequency peak fmax from the equation τe 1 2πfmax the fmax of pure g c3n4 and s brc 1 2 3 4 5 samples are 12 3 hz 0 46 hz 0 19 hz 0 11 hz 1 05 hz 1 07 hz respectively the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons of the composite sample is significantly longer than that of g c3n4 indicating superior photocatalytic performance to further clarify the carrier transport process and photocatalysis mechanism esr analysis of the g c3n4 and the s brc 3 samples were carried out as can be seen in fig 7 the characteristic peaks of 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo o2 and dmpo oh are present under visible light illumination while there are no characteristic peaks of dmpo o2 and dmpo in the control experiment in the dark this indicates that o2 and oh play critical roles in the photocatalytic process meanwhile the characteristic peaks of the composite sample s brc 3 are significantly higher than that of g c3n4 according to the results of the uv vis diffuse reflection test in fig 5 the cb position of g c3n4 is 1 16 ev which satisfies the conditions for producing o2 however the conduction band position of bivo4 does not meet the needs for producing o2 if the composite material follows the traditional type ii structure the electrons on the conduction band of g c3n4 will be transferred to the conduction band of bivo4 and the intensity of o2 detected by ers should be reduced the o2 and oh signals in the s brc 3 composite are significantly higher than those in g c3n4 suggesting that the z scheme photocatalytic system formation the electrons in the bivo4 valence band are quickly transferred to the conduction band of g c3n4 through the conductor bridge rgo to recombine with the holes thereby obtaining more o2 and oh signals based abovementioned data and analysis the possible photocatalytic mechanism of antibiotic degradation over z scheme s brc samples is shown in fig 8 and eqs 4 8 under visible light irradiation both g c3n4 nanosheets and spindle shaped bivo4 can be excited by light to generate electron hole pairs the spindle shaped bivo4 is beneficial for the improved light capture and electron transfer capability the photogenerated electrons in the cb of bivo4 nanorods would quickly transfer to the vb of g c3n4 nanosheets through the conductor rgo to combine with holes resulting in the accumulation of electrons in the cb of g c3n4 nanosheets and the holes in the vb of bivo4 nanorods the cb of g c3n4 nanosheets is approximately 1 16 ev which is more negative than the potential of o2 o2 while the vb of bivo4 is approximately 2 6 ev which is more positive than the potential of oh oh thus o2 and oh can be produced through photo excitation these active groups with strong oxidizing properties can oxidize antibiotics for example tetracycline into co2 and h2o without making other harmful pollutants this method is highly efficient pollution free easy to operate and has a broad application prospect 4 g c

4 conclusion in summary a z scheme spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 photocatalyst has been synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method this preparation method has a certain versatility and universality and can be broadened to the preparation of other composite photocatalysts in which the surfactant sodium oleate plays a crucial role in controlling the morphology of spindle shaped bivo4 in general the oleate and bismuth ions compound guides the assembly of bivo4 nanoparticles and then forms a rod like morphology besides the morphology optical electrochemical and photocatalytic applications of synthesized composites were studied systematically the results show that the photocatalytic performance of s brc composites is significantly improved compared to pure g c3n4 the degradation efficiencies of tc and cip by 10 mg s brc 3 photocatalyst reach 81 10 and 94 8 within 60 min respectively in addition spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 show broader optical absorption and prominent photocatalytic degradation rate than g c3n4 in the degradation of antibiotics this kind of s brc photocatalyst shows excellent promise in the photodegradation of organic pollutants and the purification of water contamination in the future however how to further regulate the morphology and increase the specific surface area of bivo4 nanorods need to be investigated in more depth the effects of different surfactants on the formation of bivo4 nanostructures and the corresponding photocatalytic performance need more detailed experimental support and data analysis as well declaration

13123,the construction of a solid state carrier transport prompted z scheme photocatalytic system represents a crucial possibility for green technology as it can achieve valid carrier separation transfer in hybrid heterojunction providing an innovative way to manage improved sunlight driven photocatalytic performance over to conventional composites therefore how to establish a photocatalytic z scheme complex with an appropriate position of energy band and redox capacity has been a research focus herein spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 nanocomposites were integrated with a one step hydrothermal method by using sodium oleate as the surfactant benefitting from the unique spindle shaped bivo4 and ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets the composite photocatalysts possess a large aspect ratio leading to solid light capturing ability and considerable surface areas for photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics the tetracycline tc and ciprofloxacin cip photodegradation rates are as high as 81 10 and 94 8 in 60 min respectively the photocatalytic performance of these ternary composites is superior to other photocatalyst counterparts the spindle shaped bivo4 nanostructures have superior optical performance oriented carrier transport and photooxidation response addressing the short carrier diffusion length issue that could cause a visible recombination rate for the electron hole couple in the conventional bivo4 photocatalyst it is demonstrated that the enhanced photocatalytic performance refers to the improved photogenerated electron hole pairs and rapid carriers transfer in the composite photocatalysts under visible light irradiation this study affords a promising platform for preparing other z scheme photocatalysts with high catalytic performance for the degradation of antibiotics and renewable solar energy collection in biochemical transformation graphical abstract a solid state carrier transport prompted z scheme photocatalytic system based on the spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 heterojunction under simulated sunlight is constructed for highly efficient antibiotics degradation unlabelled image keywords z scheme photocatalyst spindle shaped bivo4 nanorods ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheet antibiotics degradation 1 introduction antibiotics are widely used in various fields such as healthcare agriculture aquaculture veterinary etc in china as the largest producer and user of antibiotics 1 antibiotic residues have been detected in several rivers and even in the running water of cities antibiotic residues and other pollute may enter human bodies through drinking water and aquatic products and lead to many problems such as bacterial resistance endangering the health of human bodies 2 5 due to the inadequate understanding and treatment of wastewater with antibiotics water pollution problems caused by antibiotic residues have been emerging consequently from the perspective of environmental protection and life safety it is demanding to address the issue of antibiotic pollutions at present there are many technologies to handle residual antibiotics in water i physical approaches such as adsorption and extraction microbial degradation although this adsorption approach shows a noticeable performance in removing antibiotics the antibiotics cannot be wholly disposed of and require further treatment ii advanced oxidation methods such as ozone fenton 6 7 photodecomposition electrochemical treatment and semiconductor photocatalysis etc these methods are simple widely used and maybe more suitable for water treatment photocatalytic technology not only can completely degrade antibiotic pollutants but also utilize natural light which is a clean and recycling resource hence it provides a crucial application potential in the antibiotic contamination disposed of in the water environment recently bismuth based photocatalysts such as bivo4 8 9 biox x br i cl 10 13 bi2o3 14 15 bi2wo6 15 bi2moo6 16 17 have been widely concerned which benefit from their unique electronic structure and strong visible light absorption capacity previous studies demonstrated that the properties of bivo4 are dependent on the facet properties crystallographic planes morphology and nanostructure bivo4 crystals usually have three crystallographic styles namely tetragonal zircon like tetragonal scheelite like and monoclinic scheelite like it was reported that under visible light illumination monoclinic bivo4 possesses improved photocatalytic activity for organic pollutants degradation when compared with the other counterparts monoclinic bivo4 has been regarded as one of the most promising sunlight driven photocatalysts due to the unique band edges and band gap 18 19 nevertheless the short carrier diffusion length 70 nm could cause a nonnegligible recombination rate for the electron hole couple in the bivo4 photocatalyst various methods were proposed to address this issue for example well defined morphology design 8 20 33 charge abundant heteroatoms doping 9 34 43 and heterojunctions construction 14 25 44 53 for instance liu et al 24 used ctab as a surfactant for the controlled preparation of bivo4 nanosheets and bivo4 nanorods arini et al 8 used a template free precipitation method to prepare flower like microsphere bivo4 at 60 c with the size around 2 μm to 4 μm mohamad et al prepared micro flower like rgo g c3n4 bivo4 and verified that the existence of rgo benefited the migration and diffusion of photo generated carriers li et al 25 prepared rugby like g c3n4 bivo4 core shell composites by adjusting the ph which showed excellent performance in the degradation of methyl orange basically compared with separate ones these methods used combined to improve the photocatalytic ability of bivo4 would be more effective on the one hand it was reported that the one dimensional bivo4 nanocrystals possessed impressive photoabsorption abilities in the visible light range a superior oxidizing capacity and can be served as an efficient charge transfer supporter on the other hand a powerful photocatalytic system desires efficient separation of photoproduced e h pairs to prevent recombination 10 54 and naturally requires broad bandgap semiconductors nonetheless this is an overwhelming pressure for researchers to design a photocatalyst entity that both owns a slim bandgap to derive extra solar energy operated for generating photoelectrons and owns a proper energy gap to possess appropriate redox potential used for the photocatalysis surrounded by various methods the construction of a solid state carrier transport prompted z scheme photocatalytic system has attracted a lot of attention recently as this can solve the drawbacks of an individual photocatalyst that z scheme photocatalysis organization can broaden the spectral responsive range and promote the carrier separation and transport efficiency as well as advance the redox capacity herein we report the solid state carrier transport prompted z scheme photocatalytic system spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 nanocomposite which provides a unique way to accomplish improved sunlight driven photocatalytic performance over to conventional photocatalysts the spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 composite was synthesized with a one step hydrothermal approach by using sodium oleate as the surfactant the experimental results demonstrate that the content of sodium oleate plays a vital role in the morphology control of final samples and the possible evolution mechanism was studied as well benefited from the unique spindle shaped nanostructure of bivo4 and layered g c3n4 nanosheets the composite photocatalysts possess a large aspect ratio intense light capturing ability and desired carrier transfer path showing excellent photocatalytic degradation performance of antibiotics it is indicated that the boosted photocatalytic efficiency refers to the improved photogenerated e h pairs and rapid carriers transfer efficiency in the composite photocatalysts under visible light exposure the effective carrier transport path and band matching between bivo4 and g c3n4 construct a unique z scheme heterojunction which inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs and pro the catalytic activity this work shows that the bivo4 rgo g c3n4 heterojunction can effectively extend the lifetime of photogenerated electrons which has a certain inspiration for the photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics under simulated sunlight this work brings encouraging ideas for the construction of other z scheme photocatalytic systems with superior performance for antibiotic degradation and sustainable chemical conversion of solar energy collection 2 experimental section 2 1 synthesis of spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 nanocomposites 2 1 1 chemicals and materials melamine c3n6h6 bismuth nitrate pentahydrate bi no 3 5h2o ammonium vanadate nh4vo3 sodium oleate c17h33coona ciprofloxacin chfno cip tetracycline c22h24n2o8 tc anhydrous ethanol deionized water graphene oxide go the reagents were analytical grade without further purification and were introduced in experiments in this study distilled water was used in all experiments 2 1 2 synthesis of g c3n4 nanosheets based on our previous synthesis procedure 55 2 g of melamine powder was dispersed on the bottom of the crucible following the crucible was covered and placed in a muffle furnace with the initial temperature of 30 c and the heating rate of 2 c min heated to 500 c for 2 h and then 540 c for 2 h afterward the obtained yellow bulk sample was ground into powder put into the muffle furnace again and kept at 500 c for 2 h finally the white flocculent ultrathin g c3n4 nanosheets were obtained 2 1 3 synthesis of spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 composites firstly 0 097 g bi no3 5h2o 0 002 g go powder and 0 0138 g g c3n4 powder were ultrasonically dispersed into 15 ml ethanol solution a 0 0234 g 0 1 mmol nh4vo3 powder was dissolved in 15 ml deionized water and stirred until the solution was transparent solution b a certain amount of c17h33co2na was dissolved in 15 ml deionized water and stirred until the solution was colorless and transparent solution c the pre made solutions a and b were successively added into solution c to obtain a yellow compound after stirring for 30 min the compound solution was added to a 50 ml teflon reactor and heated at 160 c for 11 h the prepared samples were washed twice with n hexane and ethanol subsequently the final spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 photocatalyst was obtained after drying the centrifugate at 60 c for 6 h to study the influence of the sodium oleate content on the morphology of brc samples the molar ratio of c17h33co2na to bi no3 5h2o was set as 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 and the resulting products were recorded as s brc 1 s brc 2 s brc 3 s brc 4 s brc 5 respectively 2 2 characterization the crystalline phase of the prepared products was studied by x ray diffraction xrd d max2500vl pc and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi was selected to measure the surface composition raman spectroscopy labram hr evolution and infrared spectroscopy ftir cary 5000 were adopted to characterize the composition structure of the samples their microstructure and morphology were investigated by high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem fei tecnai g2 f20 their energy band structure and photoabsorption properties were determined by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv vis drs cary 5000 ac impedance test eis chi660e was adopted to analyze the carrier separation efficiency of the samples room temperature esr spectra of oh and o2 trapped by dmpo were obtained using a bruker a300 a200 electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer 2 3 antibiotic degradation experiments the photocatalytic properties of the as prepared catalysts were assessed by degradation of tc cip and rhb under the irradiation of xenon lamp perfect light technology co ltd beijing pls sxe300 the xenon light source with a power of 300 w was used to simulate sunlight 10 mg photocatalyst was used in all degradation tests before the degradation experiment the suspension of the catalyst and organics 50 ml was stirred for 30 min in the dark to make sure the adsorption desorption equilibrium during the photocatalytic experiments 3 ml suspension was extracted within a certain period then the supernatant was taken into a cuvette and the absorbance spectra were measured by uv vis spectrometer 3 result and discussion it was found that sodium oleate plays an indispensable role in the formation of s brc composites as shown in fig 1 each bi3 ion electrostatically interacts with three oleic acid ions to form a bis oleic acid complex the hydrophobic interaction of the oleate tails assembles into an ordered layered mesostructure while the oleate ions are in a head to head or tail to tail double layer structure after adding nh4vo3 and following through a hydrothermal treatment a similar pearl necklace type bivo4 quantum wire with an ordered internal structure is formed as the reaction progresses these quantum wires tend to gather together due to the decrease in surface energy gradually tilt to a certain angle and accumulate in the radial order while being subjected to the repulsive interaction between oleic acid ions in the external direction as the reaction procedure proceeds a spindle shaped nanostructure with better crystallinity is finally formed in order to further explore the role of various surfactants in preparing bivo4 nanostructures more results are shown in supporting information figs s1 and s2 3 1 structures and compositions the crystallinity determination for the synthesized samples was characterized by xrd as seen in fig 2a it shows that a strong diffraction peak at 2θ 27 8 was observed for pure g c3n4 indicating the presence of the 002 plane which is related to the interlayer accumulation of aromatic rings while the weak 100 plane of g c3n4 at 2θ 13 4 assigned to the auxiliary difference of the graphite phase or the formation of different types of polymeric phase 24 44 for the bivo4 the observed diffraction peaks associated with 28 8 and 30 6 are the characteristic peaks of the monoclinic scheelite phase 18 56 which correspond to the 121 and 040 crystal planes of the monoclinic scheelite bivo4 respectively the nanocomposite photocatalysts s brc 1 2 3 4 5 samples were synthesized by tuning the sodium oleate proportions the characteristic peaks of 28 8 and 30 6 appear in all s brc pieces further demonstrating the crystal stability of the monoclinic bivo4 in addition the diffraction peak positions and intensity corresponding to the crystal plane vary not significantly with the increase of sodium oleate content indicating that the crystal phase structure of bivo4 is stable it should be noted that for all s brc samples no obvious rgo peak could be seen in fig 2a which may be due to the low load of go and the stronger 121 plane of the bivo4 phase as a sensitive analytical method raman spectroscopy can be used to obtain information of molecular vibration and rotation it can be applied to the study of structural defects in the composites as well as seen in fig 2b for the pure g c3n4 several characteristic peaks were observed at 486 539 708 770 1211 and 1234 cm 1 corresponding to the vibration modes of cn heterocycles for the s brc samples different from the xrd results the raman data showed that the vibration peak of bivo4 became more remarkable with the increase of sodium oleate for the detail the external mode of bivo4 is mainly located at 350 cm 1 and 820 cm 1 which are assigned to vo3 deformation and symmetric vo stretching respectively apart from being used as a surfactant sodium oleate can also serve as a reducing agent for reducing go to rgo it was reported that the raman signal intensity ratio of peak d to peak g indicated the number of structural defects in rgo as reflected by the ratio of id ig in the raman spectra fig 2b there are more surface functional groups and defects in the prepared samples with the increase of sodium oleate which shows a higher reduction rate of go more raman characterizations of go were performed and the quality of the go content was further analyzed 57 58 details are shown in fig s3 this was further confirmed by ftir characterization as observed in fig 2c the characteristic absorption band of cn heterocyclic cn and cn structure stretching vibration appeared at a wavenumber of 1200 1700 cm 1 in the s brc composites which indicates the presence of g c3n4 the absorption bands located at 3100 3300 cm 1 attribute to the oh and vo4 3 absorption respectively and the bands located at 1100 cm 1 700 cm 1 and 500 cm 1 correspond to the vo stretching vibration vo bonds and the bio bond respectively these chemical bonds and functional groups in the synthesized samples indicate the successful preparation of the s brc composite photocatalyst 3 2 morphology analysis to obtain the information of microscopic structures and morphologies of the s brc samples sem tem and hrtem measurements were performed as shown in fig 3a and fig s4 it can be seen that the content of sodium oleate plays an essential role in the morphology evolution of the bivo4 products in detail when the molar ratio of c17h33co2na to bi no 3 5h2o is 2 1 the material is filament like when the molar ratio is 3 1 the material is a lump like and rod like complex as the amount of c17h33co2na continues to increase the morphology of bivo4 rgo g c3n4 gradually turns into a tapered rod like structure two ends of the rod like structure are relatively thin with a length of about 300 nm and a diameter of about 5 nm different from many regular rod shaped morphologies the nanorods studied in this work are spindle shaped and the ends of the rods are sharper which means that the radius of curvature changes as the radius of curvature decreases along with the increase in carrier density and electric field intensity the current density of the reaction will increase so as to obtain higher photocatalytic reaction efficiency similar to the spindle shaped structure proposed by liu min 59 the lower the radius of the tip the higher the electric field will be brought under the same light excitation conditions besides the π π interaction between rgo and g c3n4 is beneficial for the enhanced catalytic activity making it easier for organic pollutants adsorbed on the surface of s brc composites during the photocatalytic experiments the electron density and mobility of the s brc hybrids are improved and the electron transfer accelerates it is noted that when the molar ratio of c17h33co2na to bi no 3 5h2o was 5 1 and 6 1 the size of the rod reaches about 5 μm in length and the sample agglomeration appears more sem images of bivo4 rgo g c3n4 composites are shown in fig s4 the morphology of the prepared composite was characterized by fesem tem tem eds and hrtem it can be seen from fig 3a d the spindle shaped bivo4 are densely and relatively uniformly distributed on two dimensional material substrates the length of rods is about 300 nm and most rods are spindle like that is thin at both ends and wide in the middle in the hrtem images it is noted that these bivo4 nanorods have a rough surface and are modified by many bivo4 nanoparticles compared to those nanorods with a smooth surface it was reported that the rough surface could significantly improve the adsorption capacity of the target organic pollutant molecules 19 23 60 the crystal lattice fringes relative to bivo4 and g c3n4 can be found in fig 3e and f the lattice spacing of 0 225 and 0 35 nm could be ascribed to the 121 of bivo4 and 002 of g c3n4 respectively more hrtem images of ultrathin g c3n4 are shown in fig s5 fig 3d shows that the lattice spacing of rgo and bivo4 overlaps indicating a close contact between rgo and bivo4 fig 1g l further revealed the existence of c n o bi and v elements and showed that spindle like bivo4 were uniformly distributed on the surface of two dimensional substrate materials more elements mapping images are displayed in fig s6 the above results proved that bivo4 rgo and g c3n4 were successfully combined possibly forming a heterojunction structure 3 3 xps analysis the chemical composition and elemental states of the synthesized samples are further investigated by xps the xps full spectrum image of s brc 3 and g c3n4 are shown in fig 4a the detailed information can be seen in the high resolution x ray photoelectron spectra shown in fig 4b f as displayed in fig 4b the c 1s spectrum can be de convoluted into two peaks at binding energies of 284 8 and 288 1 ev which correspond to graphitic sites in the carbon nitride matrix cc and the sp2 hybridized carbon in the aromatic ring attached to the amino group c n 3 respectively the n 1 s xps spectrum in fig 4b can be decomposed into three peaks ascribable to c n c at 398 2 ev n c 3 at 399 5 ev and nh at 401 1 ev commonly the shifts in the binding energy of xps spectra refer to the electron migration path in the heterostructure it should be noted that compared with g c3n4 the peak position of c 1s and n 1s in the s brc sample shifts to higher binding energy which is related to an efficient carrier transport in the formed heterojunction it is inferred that the electronegativity of o is relatively large which makes the lone pair of the electron cloud of the no bond shift to n therefore the ability of the n nucleus to bind extranuclear electrons will be strengthened and the binding energy will increase accordingly similarly compared to the single g c3n4 the peak position of c 1 s in the composite material also shifts to bigger binding energy indicating a tight contact formation in the heterojunction photocatalytic system in fig 4d the binding energy peaks at 158 9 ev and 164 3 ev are observed and attributed to bi 4f 7 2 and bi 4f 5 2 respectively in fig 4e the binding energy peaks at 516 4 ev and 528 3 ev are assigned to v 2p 3 2 and v 2p 1 2 respectively it is shown in fig 4f the binding energy peaks located at 530 0 ev and 533 6 ev are attributed to co and c oh in rgo respectively 3 4 photocatalytic performance to investigate the photocatalytic activity of s brc samples the tc and cip degradation experiments were measured under simulated sunlight the dark adsorption was carried out at room temperature for 30 min before the experiment to reach the adsorption desorption equilibrium the experimental results are shown in fig 5a the degradation activity of the ternary s brc composite is better than that of pure g c3n4 after 60 min of simulated sunlight irradiation the tc degradation efficiency over g c3n4 and s brc 1 2 3 4 5 are 34 36 64 44 65 64 81 10 73 51 and 67 44 respectively among them the degradation efficiency of tc by s brc 3 is the highest the reaction rate constant k was calculated from the kinetic equation ln c c0 kt in fig 5c the reaction rate constant for pure g c3n4 is 0 00602 min 1 while the constant for the s brc 3 sample is 0 13843 min 1 which is 22 times that of pure g c3n4 the photocatalytic degradation tests of cip were carried out to further evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the s brc photocatalysts and the degradation efficiency of cip by s brc 3 reaches 94 8 in 60 min fig 5d shows in the photocatalytic degradation of cip the reaction rate constant for pure g c3n4 and s brc 3 samples are 0 01139 min 1 and 0 04653 min 1 respectively indicating that the reaction rate constant for the s brc 3 sample is 4 1 times that for pure g c3n4 more degradation experiments are shown in fig s7 moreover the prepared photocatalyst can be used for photocatalytic hydrogen production indicating that this material has potential application in alleviating the energy crisis as displayed in fig s8 the hydrogen production increased almost straightly after 36 h of reaction indicating that the photocatalytic stability of s brc composites is relatively good to further investigate the go rgo stability of the catalysts in the photocatalytic reaction process the raman signals of s brc samples before and after the photocatalytic reaction were collected as shown in fig s9 the id ig values for the two samples have changed little indicating the content of go rgo is relatively stable 61 64 3 5 photogenerated carrier properties and photocatalytic mechanism uv vis diffuse reflectance technique was further applied for the analysis of optical properties and investigation of the possible mechanism of the s brc composite system fig 6a shows the detailed uv vis diffuse reflection spectra of g c3n4 and s brc hybrid photocatalysts it can be seen that g c3n4 has significant light absorption in the 300 500 nm wavelength range when combined with pure bivo4 the visible absorption range in 500 800 nm is enhanced the absorption band edges of g c3n4 and s brc are about 490 nm and 560 nm respectively compared with g c3n4 the absorption band edges of s brc composites show a significant redshift using the kubelka munk formula the bandgap energy of the semiconductor can be estimated as follows 1 αh ν 1 n a hν e g where α is the light absorption index ν is the light frequency h is planck s constant a is constant eg is the semiconductor bandgap width n is related to the type of semiconductor fig 6 a shows that the eg of pure g c3n4 is 2 79 ev the potential of the valence band and conduction band of pure g c3n4 is calculated according to the following equations 2 e vb χ e e 0 5 e g 3 e cb e vb e g where χ is electronegativity for semiconductors ee is the energy of a free electron on the hydrogen scale eg represents the absorption bandgap energy the n value can be 0 5 and 2 which correspond to direct and indirect semiconductors respectively therefore the valence band potential evb and conduction band potential ecb of g c3n4 are calculated as 1 63 ev and 1 16 ev respectively the correspondence relationship between αhν 2 and hν 2 is obtained by transforming drs curves of different samples as shown in the inset of fig 6a the linear part of the elongated curve is tangent to the x axis and the bandgap of the sample g c3n4 and s brc 3 samples are estimated at 2 79 and 2 53 ev respectively these results indicate that the s brc composites can effectively utilize visible light and improve photocatalytic activity to compare the carrier separation in the samples the fluorescence spectra were performed and shown in fig 6b the emission band situated at around 445 nm refers to the recombination of photogenerated e h pairs within the g c3n4 for the s brc composites one more emission band is located at about 490 nm which is due to the carrier recombination within bivo4 besides the pure g c3n4 possesses low carrier separation efficiency resulting in the most vigorous pl intensity while for the s brc composites all pl peak intensities significantly decrease because of the formation of a new electron transport pathway it also shows bivo4 rgo and g c3n4 have a strong interaction among these s brc samples the fluorescence intensity of s brc 3 is the lowest indicating that the excellent photo generated carrier separation efficiency the separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs and carriers transfer efficiency played an essential role in photocatalytic reactions therefore electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to characterize the photogenerated electron transport properties and the electron transfer speed of the sample in the eis nyquist plots fig 6c the arc radius of s brc composites was smaller than that of g c3n4 indicating that s brc photocatalysts had lower electrical resistance and quicker electron transfer an equivalent circuit diagram fig 6c inset could be obtained by fitting previous studies had shown that rp in the equivalent circuit diagram represents the charge transfer resistance of the semiconductor electrolyte interface reflecting the catalytic activity the calculated results show that the rp value of the s brc 3 sample is about one third of that of pure g c3n4 therefore s brc photocatalysts had lower charge transfer resistance and higher catalytic activity consistent with its higher photocatalytic activity fig 6 d is the eis byrd phase diagram a powerful tool for studying the lifetime of photogenerated electrons in semiconductors the lifetime of the photogenerated electron τe can be obtained by determining the frequency of the intermediate frequency peak fmax from the equation τe 1 2πfmax the fmax of pure g c3n4 and s brc 1 2 3 4 5 samples are 12 3 hz 0 46 hz 0 19 hz 0 11 hz 1 05 hz 1 07 hz respectively the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons of the composite sample is significantly longer than that of g c3n4 indicating superior photocatalytic performance to further clarify the carrier transport process and photocatalysis mechanism esr analysis of the g c3n4 and the s brc 3 samples were carried out as can be seen in fig 7 the characteristic peaks of 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo o2 and dmpo oh are present under visible light illumination while there are no characteristic peaks of dmpo o2 and dmpo in the control experiment in the dark this indicates that o2 and oh play critical roles in the photocatalytic process meanwhile the characteristic peaks of the composite sample s brc 3 are significantly higher than that of g c3n4 according to the results of the uv vis diffuse reflection test in fig 5 the cb position of g c3n4 is 1 16 ev which satisfies the conditions for producing o2 however the conduction band position of bivo4 does not meet the needs for producing o2 if the composite material follows the traditional type ii structure the electrons on the conduction band of g c3n4 will be transferred to the conduction band of bivo4 and the intensity of o2 detected by ers should be reduced the o2 and oh signals in the s brc 3 composite are significantly higher than those in g c3n4 suggesting that the z scheme photocatalytic system formation the electrons in the bivo4 valence band are quickly transferred to the conduction band of g c3n4 through the conductor bridge rgo to recombine with the holes thereby obtaining more o2 and oh signals based abovementioned data and analysis the possible photocatalytic mechanism of antibiotic degradation over z scheme s brc samples is shown in fig 8 and eqs 4 8 under visible light irradiation both g c3n4 nanosheets and spindle shaped bivo4 can be excited by light to generate electron hole pairs the spindle shaped bivo4 is beneficial for the improved light capture and electron transfer capability the photogenerated electrons in the cb of bivo4 nanorods would quickly transfer to the vb of g c3n4 nanosheets through the conductor rgo to combine with holes resulting in the accumulation of electrons in the cb of g c3n4 nanosheets and the holes in the vb of bivo4 nanorods the cb of g c3n4 nanosheets is approximately 1 16 ev which is more negative than the potential of o2 o2 while the vb of bivo4 is approximately 2 6 ev which is more positive than the potential of oh oh thus o2 and oh can be produced through photo excitation these active groups with strong oxidizing properties can oxidize antibiotics for example tetracycline into co2 and h2o without making other harmful pollutants this method is highly efficient pollution free easy to operate and has a broad application prospect 4 g c

4 conclusion in summary a z scheme spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 photocatalyst has been synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method this preparation method has a certain versatility and universality and can be broadened to the preparation of other composite photocatalysts in which the surfactant sodium oleate plays a crucial role in controlling the morphology of spindle shaped bivo4 in general the oleate and bismuth ions compound guides the assembly of bivo4 nanoparticles and then forms a rod like morphology besides the morphology optical electrochemical and photocatalytic applications of synthesized composites were studied systematically the results show that the photocatalytic performance of s brc composites is significantly improved compared to pure g c3n4 the degradation efficiencies of tc and cip by 10 mg s brc 3 photocatalyst reach 81 10 and 94 8 within 60 min respectively in addition spindle shaped bivo4 rgo g c3n4 show broader optical absorption and prominent photocatalytic degradation rate than g c3n4 in the degradation of antibiotics this kind of s brc photocatalyst shows excellent promise in the photodegradation of organic pollutants and the purification of water contamination in the future however how to further regulate the morphology and increase the specific surface area of bivo4 nanorods need to be investigated in more depth the effects of different surfactants on the formation of bivo4 nanostructures and the corresponding photocatalytic performance need more detailed experimental support and data analysis as well declaration

13124,in this work nanocomposite polyelectrolytes ncps based on alkylated chitosan macromonomers ionic monomers and 2d nanofillers of montmorillonite clay types were used to eliminate emerging contaminants such as amoxicillin amx tetracycline tet and ciprofloxacin cip in water for the removal studies the effects of ph ionic strength amount of adsorbent and kinetic and isothermic processes were studied removal percentages of 65 0 81 4 and 76 7 were obtained at ph 9 0 11 0 and 11 0 for cip tet and amx respectively it was also demonstrated that as the ionic strength increased the elimination percentage decreased due to competition between sodium and chloride ions for the active sites on the adsorbent higher adsorption was obtained at an adsorbent dose of 0 03 g for cip amx and 0 02 g for tet the adsorption kinetics showed that both the pseudo first order model and pseudo second order model described the adsorption process and the maximum adsorption capacity was at 30 min due to the availability of active sites present in the ncps regarding the maximum retention adhesion capacity the langmuir isotherm was described as measuring values of 58 6 291 7 and 97 6 mg g 1 for

and their accelerating increase has become a global problem because wastewater treatment plants containing these products do not have sufficient technologies this has permitted them to be present in drinking water and has generated adverse effects on humans and aquatic environmental ecosystems 1 3 antibiotics have been used in both human and veterinary medicine for therapeutic purposes to treat different infectious diseases 4 becoming a major problem worldwide since the release of waste into the health pharmaceutical domestic and animal farm sectors arrives to aquatic systems and enters the food chain in small quantities causing adverse effects on human health and animals and plants 5 7 this problem is because the high proportions of doses administered are mainly discarded through animals or humans as primary compounds 8 which increases the presence and accumulation of antibiotics in rivers lagoons and groundwater generating and promoting the presence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains 9 currently different technologies for the elimination of antibiotics in water have been reported such as advanced oxidation 10 photocatalytic degradation and ozonification 11 12 filtration membranes 13 biological treatment 14 and adsorption methods 15 however adsorption methods are one of the most attractive methods due to their ease of handling efficiency low costs and regeneration capabilities 16 at present different materials with antibiotic removal capabilities have been reported some of these materials are alginate pearls with graphene functionalized for the removal of ciprofloxacin obtaining removal capacity of 301 4 mg g 1 the removal capacity of this material is influenced by physisorption and chemosorption processes where the physisorption was driven by van der waals forces and the pore size distribution of the materials while the chemosorption was due to the formation between the groups amines of the hydrogel the hydroxyl carboxyl epoxy groups of the graphene sheets and hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of the alginate forming electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonds and π π interactions 17 humic acid and cellulose nanocomposites have been used for the removal of ciprofloxacin in water obtaining a maximum adsorption capacity of 10 87 mg g 1 where the main removal mechanism was by cation exchange due to an ion exchange of the hydroxyl groups of the nanocomposite with the protonated amines of the antibiotic molecule as well as the hydrogen bridge formation and the interlayers cationic interactions of the material 18 by eliminating tetracycline from clay minerals an adsorption capacity of 156 mg g 1 was obtained the main mechanism being the ion exchange through the intercalation of tetracycline molecules electrostatic interactions between the cationic species and the surface binding sites of the material and complexation on the surface of the material 19 removal of amoxicillin by cellulose nanocomposite and laminar double hydroxides obtaining maximum retention capacity around 138 3 mg g 1 where the amoxicillin adsorption mechanism was mainly based on electrostatic interactions due to the interactions present between the functional groups of the antibiotic a ph 7 interacting with the filler charges of the polymeric matrix 20 based on the abovementioned work the removal of three types of antibiotics widely used in both human and veterinary medicine such as ciprofloxacin cip from the fluoroquinolone family was addressed ciprofloxacin is considered a high risk antibiotic causing potential threats to human health and aquatic organisms this type of antibiotic is associated with the emergence of resistant bacterial strains genetic mutations in many organisms and serious damage to human health 21 tetracycline tet which has a tetrahydrophenyl ring is fairly stable difficult to absorb and approximately 80 is estimated to be lost through urine and faeces although at low concentration levels the capacity of this antibiotic produces antibiotic resistant genes and strains of high resistance that can spread to humans through the food chain 22 wide spectrum antibiotic amoxicillin amx which is used for both gram negative and high positive bacteria is a beta lactam antibiotic and is used for respiratory tract infections and urinary tract treatment and prevention of infections and is also a growth promoter in animals its metabolic degradation rate is low and it has been found in high concentrations in effluents worldwide 23 examples of some concentrations found in aqueous systems are described cip concentrations in water bodies with a very high concentration of up to 31 mg l 1 in pharmaceutical effluents and 2 5 6 5 mg l 1 in surface waters 5 in the case of tetracycline maximum concentrations of 9500 ng l 1 have been found in the wenyu river in beijing 24 in groundwater 19 9 103 ng l 1 25 and in drinking water of 68 6 ng l 1 26 for the case of amx concentrations range from 1 10 6 to 11 9 μg l 1 have been reported in groundwater rivers hospital wastewater drinking water in different countries of the world 27 due to the high environmental problems and associated problems that bring the presence of antibiotics to aqueous systems it is essential to apply different materials in a highly efficient and environmentally friendly manner this study aims to address this problem through the use of nanocomposite polyelectrolytes ncps by using 2d nanofillers nfs that is a type of montmorillonite a mineral material in layers that is abundant in nature presenting a large specific surface area and high ion exchange capacity 28 chitosan a biopolymer obtained from the fifth is widely used in different fields of research and has high physicochemical and biological properties that makes it an ideal candidate for different applications 29 chemical modifications were performed to obtain chitosan with permanent charges quaternary ammonium groups and a macromonomer to polymerize with monomers containing anionic and cationic charges the novelty of the use of these ncps is based on the fact that the polymeric matrix is based on chitosan modified with quaternary ammonium groups and vinyl groups macromonomer that being in contact with monomer form networks and interactions with the nfs which make it a material with high capacities in the removal of this type of pollutants this is due to the different groups present in the matrix of the nanocomposite that make it possible for them to have high interactions with antibiotics thus in this work we sought to determine the antibiotic retention efficiency using ncps from an alkylated chitosan macromonomer ionic monomers and nf with ion exchange capacity in antibiotics widely used in human and veterinary medicine under different experimental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials to obtain the ncps the following chemical reagents were used chitosan with a degree of acetylation of 36 4 n 3 chloro 2

acryloylamino propyl trimethylammonium chloride clapta 75 wt in h2o and nanoclay montmorillonite mmt as cationic exchangers n n methylene bis acrylamide mba 99 was used as the cross linking reagent and ammonium persulfate aps 99 and n n n n tetramethylethylenediamine temed 99 were used as the initiator and co initiator respectively all reagents were purchased from sigma aldrich sodium hydroxide

aldrich and amoxicillin amx 98 assay for hplc sigma aldrich the properties of antibiotics see table 1 2 2 synthesis of nanocomposite polyelectrolytes ncps the synthesis of ncps was performed in three steps i the starting point was to obtain alkylated chitosan by using the alkylating agent n 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride ii adding vinyl groups to it by means of glycidyl methacrylate converting the alkylated chitosan as a macromonomer reported in a previous work by our research group 32 and iii the production of ncps ncps were obtained using 1 5 5 molar ratios of alkylated chitosan macromonomer clapta ssna and different wt montmorillonite the synthesis was conducted by using in situ free radical polymerization in 20 0 ml of 1 7 mol l 1 sodium chloride solution previously nanofillers were sonicated for a period of 8 0 min at 100 amplitude with a pulse of 0 5 s on and 10 0 s off on a sonic vibram cell subsequently the ratio of monomers was added macromonomer and remained in agitation for a period of 24 0 h then 5 mol mba and 3 mol aps were added with respect to the monomers and degassed with nitrogen for 10 min additionally temed was added at an equal ratio of aps and placed in an ethylene glycol bath at a temperature of 80 0 1 c for 8 0 h under constant agitation the material obtained was fractionated and washed for a period of 96 0 h with water replacement every 6 0 h to remove the reactants that did not react and dried at room temperature 33 it should be noted that blank trials without nf were also conducted a representation scheme of the obtaining of the ncps is shown in fig 1a 2 3 characterization of nanocomposite polyelectrolytes ncps characterization of ncps was performed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir using a perkin elmer 1760 x spectrophotometer with a 4000 400 cm 1 range and kbr pickup thermogravimetric analysis tga was performed using netzsch 209 fi iris equipment in a n2 atmosphere at a heating rate of

percentage of removal r of antibiotics by ncps was calculated using eqs 1 and 2 to calculate the mass of antibiotic adsorbed per gram of ncps qe mg g 1 1 r c o c e c o 100 2 q e c o c e m v where c o is the initial antibiotic concentration mg l 1 c e is the equilibrium concentration in the solution mg l 1 v is the volume of the solution l and m is the mass of ncps g 34 the evaluation of antibiotic removal capacity by the pnc was performed by batch procedure using an orbital shaker type batch unimax 1010 heidolph hcl and naoh 1 0 mol l 1 were used to adjust the initial ph of the samples to study the effect on removal efficiency the ph measurements were conducted with a ph meter previously calibrated before each use ncps 0 02 g was added to 20 0 ml amber vials and 5 0 ml of antibiotic solution was added at 20 0 mg l 1 the ph values of the antibiotic solutions were 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 and 11 0 the containers containing the antibiotic pnc mixture were shaken at 25 0 1 c in a shaker with a digital incubator at 200 0 rpm for 8 0 h the effect of ionic strength was investigated using different concentrations of 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 mol l 1 nacl at ph 9 0 for cip and 11 0 for tet and amx the effect of the dosage of pnc was studied in the presence of 0 005 0 01 0 02 0 03 and 0 05 g following the same experimental conditions the contact time of the ncps with the antibiotic plays an important role in the removal process therefore the contact time for the removal of antibiotics by ncps was studied at shaking times of 5 0 15 0 30 0 60 0 120 0 180 0 300 0 400 0 and 1440 0 min under optimal conditions of 0 03 g and ph 11 for amx 0 03 g and ph 9 for cip and 0 02 g and ph 11 0 for tet the experimental results obtained were used to create pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models to conduct the studies of removal in equilibrium the content of pnc was kept constant at optimal experimental conditions such as ph adsorbent dosage ionic strength contact time and by varying the concentration of antibiotics 5 0 20 0 50 0 80 0 100 0 150 0 and 200 0 mg l 1 the experiments were conducted at different temperatures 25 0 35 0 and 45 0 c the experimental results were evaluated using langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich isotherm models from the adjusted models obtained parameters related to the antibiotic adsorption processes were determined a representative scheme of the adsorption pollutant removal process is shown in fig 1b 2 5 determination of antibiotic concentration the concentration of antibiotics was analysed using a uv vis spectrophotometer orion aquamate 8000 thermo fisher scientific which was used at maximum absorption wavelengths of 277 0 231 0 and 361 0 nm for cip amx and tet respectively cip calibration was prepared with concentrations from 0 0 to 20 0 mg l 1 and the coefficient of determination r2value was 0 9998 the limit of detection lod was 0 08 mg l 1 and the limit of quantification loq was 0 15 mg l 1 an amx calibration curve was prepared with concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 50 0 mg l 1 the coefficient of determination r2value was 0 999 and the lod and loq were 0 14 and 0 38 mg l 1 respectively the tet calibration curve was prepared with concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 30 0 mg l 1 and the coefficient of determination r2value was 0 998 the lod was 0 11 mg l 1 and the loq was 0 25 mg l 1 2 6 statistical analysis the data are presented as the mean standard deviation one analysis of variance anova with tukey s test was used to analyse the significant differences between samples for all tests the level of significance was set to p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 and p 0 0001 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ncps to obtain the ncps chitosan was initially modified by alkylation with quaternary ammonium groups and the addition of vinyl groups by means of a methacrylate process with glycidyl methacrylate to anchor polymer chains and to encourage interactions present in the polymer matrix pmx the results of this process have been described and reported in previous work by our research group 32 35 for the incorporation of mmt clay type nanofillers nfs into the pmx and pssna and pclapta polymer chains from the in situ polymerization process of ssna and clapta monomers with alkylated chitosan macromonomers different spectroscopic tests were performed including thermal morphological and rheological tests to determine the effects of loads and nf fig 2a shows the ft ir spectra of the different ncps obtained hydrogels without nf hgs and with nf ncps have characteristic absorption bands attributed to mpx 1042 cm 1 s o stretching 1187 cm 1 ch 1 4 substitution 1485 cm 1 bending of the quaternary ammonium group 1652 cm 1 the carbon oxygen double bond c 0 2944 cm 1 ch stretching or cc stretching and 3421 cm 1 nh stretching 36 nf absorption bands were observed at 1037 cm 1 si o si stretching 3428 cm 1 oh stretching and 3620 cm 1 si oh stretching it should be noted that the band representative of the si oh interactions of the nf in the ncps is not presented this absence can be attributed to the interactions between nf and pmx that have high positive charge contents due to quaternary ammonium groups of chitosan macromonomer and pclapta 37 fig 2b shows the tga thermogram of the ncps the decomposition temperatures were between 25 0 and 150 0 c which was attributed to the water physically adsorbed by the ncps and a slight loss was attributed to the water that was occluded between the nf sheets interacting with the functional groups of the pmx at 344 0 350 0 c the maximum degradation temperature for ncps was observed for all samples there was an increase in the residual mass percentages attributed to the effect of nf on pmx and the process of intercalation of some polymer chains in the nf sheets fig 2c shows the sem images of the different ncps observing changes with respect to the roughness in the morphology of the ncps to different relationships of nf vs the material without nf which is attributed to the increase in the different nominal concentrations of nf on the other hand the formation of pores in the structure of the materials may be attributed to the process of polymerization of cationic and anionic monomers in the presence of the alkylated macromonomer and to the lyophilization process fig 2d shows the results obtained from elemental analysis by eds determining two representative elements in the nanofiller as si and al demonstrating the increase in the concentration of the two elements as the nominal concentrations of nf in the pmx increase confirming the presence of nf as well as the results obtained by tga in the residual mass the process of delamination is one of the critical processes when preparing ncps in the presence of nanoparticles and specifically 2d type nanoparticles such as clay to verify that clay sheets present this phenomenon tem images and xrd patterns are corroborated fig 3a shows the tem images for the different ncps providing a visual and direct way the distribution and type of morphology of the nf in the pmx a specific area of the sample i ncps present nf in the matrix which corroborates the results shown above ii the distribution of nf in ncps with 3 nf has a higher exfoliation compared with ncps 6 and 9 from this it is possible to suggest a morphology between intercalated and exfoliated types for ncps 3 and intercalated for ncps 6 and 9 from these results obtained qualitatively they are corroborated by quantitative results measuring the interlaminar distance of the nf sheets by using xrd and eq 3 which corresponds to bragg s law 3 nλ 2 d sen θ nfs mmt has reflection peak 8 8 2 θ corresponding to an interlaminar distance of 10 4 å 38 therefore if there is a displacement of the peak to smaller angles it is suggested that the material has an intercalated morphology and in the case that no peak is present it is suggested that the ncps have an exfoliated morphology 39 ncps 3 shows no presence of the characteristic peak of the nanofiller in fig 3b therefore the presence of an exfoliated and intercalated morphology is confirmed as shown in fig 3a these results can be related to the low concentration of nf present in the pmx as well as to the interactions present by the greater amount of positive loads present in the matrix and negative loads of the interlaminar spaces present in the nf for ncps 6 and 9 there is a displacement of the peak to smaller angles of approximately 4 0 2 θ corresponding to an interlaminate distance of 21 9 å presenting an interlaminar space difference of 11 9 å with respect to the interlaminar distance of the nf these results suggest an interspersed morphology attributed to the highest concentration of nf the water adsorption capacity with respect to time is shown in fig 3c and the adsorption comparison in equilibrium with the addition of nf is shown in fig 3d in fig 3c an increase in adsorption capacity can be seen for both ncps and hgs observing an increase in capacity up to 420 min later a slight decrease was observed until reaching an adsorption plate to verify that hydrogels have differences in adsorption capacity a one way anova with multiple comparison tukey analysis was performed where ncps do not show significant differences this nonsignificant difference in ncps is attributed to nf dispersion which may affect adsorption due to the orientation that nf sheets may exhibit preventing the diffusion of water molecules into the pmx these results have been reported in different studies where they have used 2d nanoparticles of the clay type which can restrict the molecular dynamics of the chains present making the polymer chains not partially relaxed which causes the processes of diffusion of water molecules to occur 40 41 to determine the effect of nf on pmx the mechanical resistance of the ncps was determined through rheological tests studying the viscoelastic properties of the ncps through oscillatory deformation tests and evaluating the variation in the storage module g that describes the elastic component of the ncps and the loss modulus g which is related to the viscous component or energy released from ncps due to the deformation process fig 4a shows the viscoelastic linear region lvr of the ncps and demonstrates that the materials under study can withstand deformation up to approximately 10 0 12 0 15 0 and 22 0 of the stress without breaking the microstructure of their network for hgs ncps 3 ncps 6 and ncps 9 respectively indicating that these materials exhibit elastic behaviour at low deformation rates because the storage module is larger than the loss module 42 in the lvr the effect of the nf concentrations in the pmx can be determined thus fig 4b shows the complex modulus 43 g of the different ncps containing the elastic and viscous contributions of the materials g is calculated by eq 4 4 g g 2 g 2 as shown in fig 4b ncps showed significant differences when the concentration of nf increased compared with pmx and without the presence of nf as well as significant differences between ncps 3 vs ncps 6 and 9 however there were no significant differences between ncps 6 and ncps 9 these results are influenced by the lack of homogeneity and high nf contents 3 2 adsorption experiments this section describes and discusses the results of the adsorption capacity of the different pmx based ncps with quaternary ammonium groups sulfonates and aromatic rings and the addition of 2d nanoparticle clay sheets for the retention of three antibiotics for use in both human and veterinary medicine through primary and secondary interactions between analyte and adsorbent ph studies have played a major role in retention capacity as they can affect the physicochemical properties of antibiotics influencing adsorption processes by altering loads fig 5 shows the ph variation 3 0 11 0 for the different ncps and antibiotics the maximum percentage of retention of clay contents in the material was reached at ph 9 0 for cip and at ph 11 0 for tet and amx these results are favoured by the strong interactions between ncps and antibiotics where antibiotic speciation plays a fundamental role in the case of cip two values of pka are presented one is 5 9 and another is 8 8 implying that at ph values below 5 9 cip adopts its cationic form due to the protonation of the secondary amine in the piperazine group whereas at ph values between 5 9 and 8 8 the molecule is in its zwitterionic form in which the charge of the deprotonated carboxylic acid and the protonated secondary amine are the dominant species in equilibrium and at ph values greater than 8 8 the secondary amine is stripped resulting in a charged molecule in its anionic form 44 tet has three functional groups according to the variation of the ph in the solution presenting speciation at a low ph of 3 2 being in its cationic form at ph values between 3 2 and 7 8 tet is in the zwitterionic state and at ph values above 7 8 tet behaves as an anionic molecule 45 amx has three pka1 values of 2 4 carboxyl pka2 7 4 amine and pka3 9 6 phenol indicating that at a neutral ph it is zwitterion at ph 2 4 it is mainly cationic and at ph greater than 7 4 it is negatively charged for this reason for the three antibiotics as the ph is increased there are more negative charges in solution which makes greater interactions between the antibiotic and adsorbent evident 46 this effect of higher retention is due to speciation by the antibiotic molecule and the strong coulombic interactions with functional groups of npes it should be remembered that the pmx of the npes is based on chitosan alkylated with quaternary ammonium groups pssna and pclapta in conclusion it can be said that electrostatic interactions were the main driving force in retention processes however because of the groups present in pmx and antibiotics other interactions occur such as i π π stacking interactions due to the aromatic ring of pssna and the benzene rings of antibiotic molecules ii hydrogen bonds and iii hydrophobic interactions 47 49 fig 5c compares the variation of the nf contents for the three antibiotics at optimal ph obtained in the previous ph study thus for cip there were significant differences between ncps 3 and 6 and material without nf while ncps 9 did not present significant differences see table s1 in the same way it happened for the percentages of removal of tet and amx however when comparisons were made between the different ncps see fig 5d it could be seen that ncps 3 presented the best retention value of the three antibiotics similarly comparisons were made between nominal nf concentrations showing significant differences for cip nonsignificant differences for tet and significant differences for amx see table s1 based on the previous results and to continue the different retention trials ncps 3 were selected these results agree with the characterization results showing that ncps 3 have optimal characteristics according to an exfoliated morphology and no significant differences between the ncps in the complex modulus the retention results can be attributed to the low exfoliation of the material and the increase in rheological propositions since increasing the g due to the increase of nf antibiotic molecules is prevented from spreading in the pmx easily in fig 6a is shown the effect of increased nacl concentrations on removal it demonstrates clearly a decrease in removal percentage as nacl concentration increased these results were caused by competition for the active sites by the ncps since the increases in ions in solution are an important factor that limits the effects of removal and interaction these results agree with different studies that have shown the effect of the increase in nacl on the removal of organic pollutants yu et al removed cip using multiple wall nanotubes where the influence of salinity in the concentration range of 0 0 0 4 mol l 1 decreased retention percentages as salt concentrations increased 50 on the other hand afzal et al removed antibiotics using hydrogel beads modified with humic acid where the increase in ionic strength at different nacl concentrations 0 1 0 mol l 1 affected retention rates as salt concentrations increased 51 these results were mainly due to electrolytes in solution which modified the electrostatic interactions between the analyte and the ncps where interactions present either the attractive or repulsive type they may be affected by the addition of ions in solution because the active sites of the ncps are found with positive charges interacting with the chloride ions as well as negatively charged antibiotics interacting with sodium ions which is reflected in the decrease in the retention percentages 52 the retention effect with respect to the dose of ncps is shown in fig 6b it is noted that there was an increase in the retention percentages as the content increased from 5 0 to 20 0 mg for tet but decreased at doses of ncps 20 0 mg while cip and amx had the maximum retention at 30 0 mg and at doses 30 0 mg there was a decrease this correlation of the positive increase between the dose of ncps and antibiotics is related to the availability of active sites or the surface of the material but may also be affected by the speciation and variation of loads present in antibiotics the removal experiments with respect to contact time provide us with important information regarding the speed of removal and help us to know the optimal balance time in this study the contact time was varied from 0 0 to 30 0 h in fig 6 c the effect of the contact time for the three antibiotics is presented showing a slight increase between 0 5 h and 2 0 h of contact for the three antibiotics anova tests of multiple comparisons were performed for this purpose see fig 6 where it was shown that the three beats did not present significant differences which allowed us to select a time of 0 5 h for the contact time from the results shown in fig 6 c and d it can be said that for a period 0 5 h repulsive forces arose due to the lack of availability of vacant active sites in the retention process as well as after those times with a constant retention this may have been due to a retention of less available active sites that is as available sites present saturations the speed of removal was affected by the speed of the antibiotics to reach the least available sites in the ncps 53 furthermore the kinetic adsorption parameters were evaluated by applying nonlinear models of the lagergren pseudo first order model and pseudo second order model 54 the nonlinear equations of the models are given by eqs 5 and 6 5 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 6 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q t and q e mg g 1 are the adsorption capacities of antibiotics at time t min and equilibrium state respectively k1 and k2 are related to the rate constants for pseudo first and pseudo second order models respectively in table 2 the retention kinetic parameters of the three antibiotics are presented showing that the two models have correlation coefficients close to unity indicating that the applied models conform to the experimental data obtained see fig s1 moreover the qe values obtained by both methods and experimentally calculated qe are similar concluding that the two methods can describe the kinetic parameters of the process of removal of these antibiotics in the presence of ncps the effects of the initial antibiotic concentration and temperature are shown in fig 7a the removal capacity of the three antibiotics increased by increasing the antibiotic concentration to 80 0 mg l 1 for cip and up to 100 0 mg l 1 for tet and amx later at these concentrations a slight decrease was observed and remained constant up to 200 0 mg l 1 these results may be because ncps have a limited number of active sites available and of the speciation of antibiotics at the optimal ph on the other hand it can be said that there is a driving force that overcomes resistance to mass transfer of antibiotics in the aqueous phases and the ncps which is due to a slight increase in clearance capacity as initial concentrations increase up to maximum retention capacity 55 in fig 7b the effect of temperature was evaluated for the three antibiotics at the maximum removal concentration for cip tet and amx there was an increase in retention by increasing the temperature for cip and amx from 25 0 to 45 0 c and tet from 25 0 to 35 0 c these results are due to an increase in the expansion of the cavities formed by ncps that cause antibiotic molecules to penetrate the least available active sites in ncps 34 the decrease in retention percentage at temperatures 35 0 c for tet may be due to the thermal movement of antibiotic molecules which weakens the forces of attraction between active sites and speciation charges 56 to determine the adsorption parameters nonlinear equations of adsorption isotherms were used as they provide us with important information regarding the interactions of ncps and antibiotics 55 57 the nonlinear equations to determine the adsorption parameters were the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r model 58 59 which are given in eqs 7 10 7 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 8 q e k f c e 1 n 9 q e rt b t ln a t c e 10 q e q m exp β ε 2 where for the langmuir isotherm q e mg g 1 is the equilibrium adsorption of the ncps q m mg g 1 is the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity c e mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration and bl l g 1 is associated with the free energy of sorption for freundlich isotherms n is a dimensionless parameter that indicates the favourability of adsorption and kf mg g 1 is the freundlich constant indicating the adsorption capacity for the temkin isotherm at l g 1 is the temkin constant and bt j mol 1 is the heat of adsorption β mol2j 2 was a constant related to the adsorption energy and ε was the polanyi potential r and t were the gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and absolute temperature k the experimental data were adjusted to the different models as shown in fig 8 for freundlich isotherms at temperatures of 25 0 35 0 and 45 0 c and as shown in fig s2 s3 and s4 for langmuir temkin and d r isotherms at different temperatures respectively the adsorption isotherm parameters obtained are shown in table 3 from the results obtained it can be said that the langmuir model does not conform to the data obtained due to the negative values obtained for qm and bl for tet and amx at temperatures of 35 0 and 45 0 c in this case we can say that the langmuir model only adjusts to temperatures of 25 c presenting maximum retention capacities of 58 6 291 7 and 97 6 mg g 1 for cip tet and amx respectively the freundlich isotherm presented correlation coefficients similar to the langmuir isotherm and according to the nature of the ncps heterogeneous it can be said that this model conforms to the experimental data obtained on the other hand information was obtained considering the parameter n determined by the freundlich equation that represents the adsorption force indicating values of 1 n between 0 and 1 that favour the adsorption process for most cases in this study 60 from the findings found in this study it is suggested that adsorption cannot be clearly described by a single mathematical model due to the heterogeneous nature of the material as has been reported in previous studies of antibiotic removal 61 62 to compare the maximum equilibrium retention capacity with different materials reported in previous publications on antibiotic removal in table 4 the qm obtained using the langmuir model at a temperature of 25 0 c is presented as can be seen in the literature different types of materials are presented to be applied in the retention processes the adsorption by the different materials will depend on different factors such as the capacity for interactions that may be present in the materials under study which in turn depend on the available groups that can interact with the speciation of each antibiotic in this table we can find different maximum adsorption capacity values for antibiotics such as nanocomposite materials based on humic acids and cellulose for removal of ciprofloxacin obtaining maximum retention capacity of 10 8 mg g 1 18 from the results of the retention experiments obtained for the different study variables it can be observed that the maximum retention capacity is greater for the tet when it is compared as the maximum capacity obtained by the cip and amx as can be seen in table 3 at 25 c from that it is proposed that the main retention mechanism by the cnps 3 it is through the electrostatic interactions present between the quaternary ammonium groups present intrinsically in the polymer matrix due to the alkylation of the chitosan with the alkylating agent and also to the quaternary ammonium groups contributed by the repeating unit of the copolymer used this in agree with the highest retention percentage obtained the ph between 9 0 and 11 0 and the speciation of the antibiotics with negative charges at that ph however it can be evidenced that retention occurs at lower ph and can be attributed to secondary interactions such as hydrogen bonding interactions because the antibiotics under study present hydrogen donors and acceptors that can easily interact with the polar functional groups of the matrix polymeric such as hydroxyl groups amino group residues and carboxyl groups 71 other types of interactions may also occur such as π π stacking interactions due to the aromatic ring of pssna and the benzene rings of antibiotic molecules 47 49 see fig 9 4 conclusions a novel nanocomposite polyelectrolyte ncps based on alkylated chitosan monomers with quaternary ammoniun groups sulfonic acid and montmorillonite to be used as a potential adsorbent in the removal of emerging antibiotic type contaminants such as amoxicillin amx tetracycline tet and ciprofloxacin cip ncps were characterized by various techniques such as ftir drx tga sem tem and rheology the materials presented an improvement in rheological and thermal characteristics however the increase in nanofiller contents means that there are no significant differences in water adsorption in the removal studies it was observed that the optimal ph was 9 0 for cip and 11 0 for tet and amx the ncps with 3 wt nanofiller have the highest adsorption for the three antibiotics removal percentage for antibiotics 80 0 was given in a time of 30 min and adsorbent dosage of 0 02 g for tet and 0 03 for cip and amx due to load distribution and speciation of antibiotics at optimal ph nonlinear first order and second order kinetics models with r2 of 0 99 1 00 describe the kinetic adsorption behaviour of ncps meanwhile the non linear adsorption model that best describes adsorption is from the langmuir model at 25 0 c the maximum capacities obtained at 25 0 c were 58 6 291 7 and 97 6 mg g 1 for cip tet and amx respectively this

13124,in this work nanocomposite polyelectrolytes ncps based on alkylated chitosan macromonomers ionic monomers and 2d nanofillers of montmorillonite clay types were used to eliminate emerging contaminants such as amoxicillin amx tetracycline tet and ciprofloxacin cip in water for the removal studies the effects of ph ionic strength amount of adsorbent and kinetic and isothermic processes were studied removal percentages of 65 0 81 4 and 76 7 were obtained at ph 9 0 11 0 and 11 0 for cip tet and amx respectively it was also demonstrated that as the ionic strength increased the elimination percentage decreased due to competition between sodium and chloride ions for the active sites on the adsorbent higher adsorption was obtained at an adsorbent dose of 0 03 g for cip amx and 0 02 g for tet the adsorption kinetics showed that both the pseudo first order model and pseudo second order model described the adsorption process and the maximum adsorption capacity was at 30 min due to the availability of active sites present in the ncps regarding the maximum retention adhesion capacity the langmuir isotherm was described as measuring values of 58 6 291 7 and 97 6 mg g 1 for

and their accelerating increase has become a global problem because wastewater treatment plants containing these products do not have sufficient technologies this has permitted them to be present in drinking water and has generated adverse effects on humans and aquatic environmental ecosystems 1 3 antibiotics have been used in both human and veterinary medicine for therapeutic purposes to treat different infectious diseases 4 becoming a major problem worldwide since the release of waste into the health pharmaceutical domestic and animal farm sectors arrives to aquatic systems and enters the food chain in small quantities causing adverse effects on human health and animals and plants 5 7 this problem is because the high proportions of doses administered are mainly discarded through animals or humans as primary compounds 8 which increases the presence and accumulation of antibiotics in rivers lagoons and groundwater generating and promoting the presence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains 9 currently different technologies for the elimination of antibiotics in water have been reported such as advanced oxidation 10 photocatalytic degradation and ozonification 11 12 filtration membranes 13 biological treatment 14 and adsorption methods 15 however adsorption methods are one of the most attractive methods due to their ease of handling efficiency low costs and regeneration capabilities 16 at present different materials with antibiotic removal capabilities have been reported some of these materials are alginate pearls with graphene functionalized for the removal of ciprofloxacin obtaining removal capacity of 301 4 mg g 1 the removal capacity of this material is influenced by physisorption and chemosorption processes where the physisorption was driven by van der waals forces and the pore size distribution of the materials while the chemosorption was due to the formation between the groups amines of the hydrogel the hydroxyl carboxyl epoxy groups of the graphene sheets and hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of the alginate forming electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonds and π π interactions 17 humic acid and cellulose nanocomposites have been used for the removal of ciprofloxacin in water obtaining a maximum adsorption capacity of 10 87 mg g 1 where the main removal mechanism was by cation exchange due to an ion exchange of the hydroxyl groups of the nanocomposite with the protonated amines of the antibiotic molecule as well as the hydrogen bridge formation and the interlayers cationic interactions of the material 18 by eliminating tetracycline from clay minerals an adsorption capacity of 156 mg g 1 was obtained the main mechanism being the ion exchange through the intercalation of tetracycline molecules electrostatic interactions between the cationic species and the surface binding sites of the material and complexation on the surface of the material 19 removal of amoxicillin by cellulose nanocomposite and laminar double hydroxides obtaining maximum retention capacity around 138 3 mg g 1 where the amoxicillin adsorption mechanism was mainly based on electrostatic interactions due to the interactions present between the functional groups of the antibiotic a ph 7 interacting with the filler charges of the polymeric matrix 20 based on the abovementioned work the removal of three types of antibiotics widely used in both human and veterinary medicine such as ciprofloxacin cip from the fluoroquinolone family was addressed ciprofloxacin is considered a high risk antibiotic causing potential threats to human health and aquatic organisms this type of antibiotic is associated with the emergence of resistant bacterial strains genetic mutations in many organisms and serious damage to human health 21 tetracycline tet which has a tetrahydrophenyl ring is fairly stable difficult to absorb and approximately 80 is estimated to be lost through urine and faeces although at low concentration levels the capacity of this antibiotic produces antibiotic resistant genes and strains of high resistance that can spread to humans through the food chain 22 wide spectrum antibiotic amoxicillin amx which is used for both gram negative and high positive bacteria is a beta lactam antibiotic and is used for respiratory tract infections and urinary tract treatment and prevention of infections and is also a growth promoter in animals its metabolic degradation rate is low and it has been found in high concentrations in effluents worldwide 23 examples of some concentrations found in aqueous systems are described cip concentrations in water bodies with a very high concentration of up to 31 mg l 1 in pharmaceutical effluents and 2 5 6 5 mg l 1 in surface waters 5 in the case of tetracycline maximum concentrations of 9500 ng l 1 have been found in the wenyu river in beijing 24 in groundwater 19 9 103 ng l 1 25 and in drinking water of 68 6 ng l 1 26 for the case of amx concentrations range from 1 10 6 to 11 9 μg l 1 have been reported in groundwater rivers hospital wastewater drinking water in different countries of the world 27 due to the high environmental problems and associated problems that bring the presence of antibiotics to aqueous systems it is essential to apply different materials in a highly efficient and environmentally friendly manner this study aims to address this problem through the use of nanocomposite polyelectrolytes ncps by using 2d nanofillers nfs that is a type of montmorillonite a mineral material in layers that is abundant in nature presenting a large specific surface area and high ion exchange capacity 28 chitosan a biopolymer obtained from the fifth is widely used in different fields of research and has high physicochemical and biological properties that makes it an ideal candidate for different applications 29 chemical modifications were performed to obtain chitosan with permanent charges quaternary ammonium groups and a macromonomer to polymerize with monomers containing anionic and cationic charges the novelty of the use of these ncps is based on the fact that the polymeric matrix is based on chitosan modified with quaternary ammonium groups and vinyl groups macromonomer that being in contact with monomer form networks and interactions with the nfs which make it a material with high capacities in the removal of this type of pollutants this is due to the different groups present in the matrix of the nanocomposite that make it possible for them to have high interactions with antibiotics thus in this work we sought to determine the antibiotic retention efficiency using ncps from an alkylated chitosan macromonomer ionic monomers and nf with ion exchange capacity in antibiotics widely used in human and veterinary medicine under different experimental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials to obtain the ncps the following chemical reagents were used chitosan with a degree of acetylation of 36 4 n 3 chloro 2

aldrich and amoxicillin amx 98 assay for hplc sigma aldrich the properties of antibiotics see table 1 2 2 synthesis of nanocomposite polyelectrolytes ncps the synthesis of ncps was performed in three steps i the starting point was to obtain alkylated chitosan by using the alkylating agent n 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride ii adding vinyl groups to it by means of glycidyl methacrylate converting the alkylated chitosan as a macromonomer reported in a previous work by our research group 32 and iii the production of ncps ncps were obtained using 1 5 5 molar ratios of alkylated chitosan macromonomer clapta ssna and different wt montmorillonite the synthesis was conducted by using in situ free radical polymerization in 20 0 ml of 1 7 mol l 1 sodium chloride solution previously nanofillers were sonicated for a period of 8 0 min at 100 amplitude with a pulse of 0 5 s on and 10 0 s off on a sonic vibram cell subsequently the ratio of monomers was added macromonomer and remained in agitation for a period of 24 0 h then 5 mol mba and 3 mol aps were added with respect to the monomers and degassed with nitrogen for 10 min additionally temed was added at an equal ratio of aps and placed in an ethylene glycol bath at a temperature of 80 0 1 c for 8 0 h under constant agitation the material obtained was fractionated and washed for a period of 96 0 h with water replacement every 6 0 h to remove the reactants that did not react and dried at room temperature 33 it should be noted that blank trials without nf were also conducted a representation scheme of the obtaining of the ncps is shown in fig 1a 2 3 characterization of nanocomposite polyelectrolytes ncps characterization of ncps was performed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir using a

removal capacity by the pnc was performed by batch procedure using an orbital shaker type batch unimax 1010 heidolph hcl and naoh 1 0 mol l 1 were used to adjust the initial ph of the samples to study the effect on removal efficiency the ph measurements were conducted with a ph meter previously calibrated before each use ncps 0 02 g was added to 20 0 ml amber vials and 5 0 ml of antibiotic solution was added at 20 0 mg l 1 the ph values of the antibiotic solutions were 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 and 11 0 the containers containing the antibiotic pnc mixture were shaken at 25 0 1 c in a shaker with a digital incubator at 200 0 rpm for 8 0 h the effect of ionic strength was investigated using different concentrations of 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 mol l 1 nacl at ph 9 0 for cip and 11 0 for tet and amx the effect of the dosage of pnc was studied in the presence of 0 005 0 01 0 02 0 03 and 0 05 g following the same experimental conditions the contact time of the ncps with the antibiotic plays an important role in the removal process therefore the contact time for the removal of antibiotics by ncps was studied at shaking times of 5 0 15 0 30 0 60 0 120 0 180 0 300 0 400 0 and 1440 0 min under optimal conditions of 0 03 g and ph 11 for amx 0 03 g and ph 9 for cip and 0 02 g and ph 11 0 for tet the experimental results obtained were used to create pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models to conduct the studies of removal in equilibrium the content of pnc was kept constant at optimal experimental conditions such as ph adsorbent dosage ionic strength contact time and by

evaluated using langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich isotherm models from the adjusted models obtained parameters related to the antibiotic adsorption processes were determined a representative scheme of the adsorption pollutant removal process is shown in fig 1b 2 5 determination of antibiotic concentration the concentration of antibiotics was analysed using a uv vis spectrophotometer orion aquamate 8000 thermo fisher scientific which was used at maximum absorption wavelengths of 277 0 231 0 and 361 0 nm for cip amx and tet respectively cip calibration was

samples for all tests the level of significance was set to p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 and p 0 0001 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ncps to obtain the ncps chitosan was initially modified by alkylation with quaternary ammonium groups and the addition of vinyl groups by means of a methacrylate process with glycidyl methacrylate to anchor polymer chains and to encourage interactions present in the polymer matrix pmx the results of this process have been described and reported in previous work by our research group 32 35 for the incorporation of mmt clay type nanofillers nfs into the pmx and pssna and pclapta polymer chains from the in situ polymerization process of ssna and clapta monomers with alkylated chitosan macromonomers different spectroscopic tests were performed including thermal morphological and rheological tests to determine the effects of loads and nf fig 2a shows the ft ir spectra of the different ncps obtained hydrogels without nf hgs and with nf ncps have characteristic absorption bands attributed to mpx 1042 cm 1 s o stretching 1187 cm 1 ch 1 4 substitution 1485 cm 1 bending of the quaternary ammonium group 1652 cm 1 the carbon oxygen double bond c 0 2944 cm 1 ch stretching or cc stretching and 3421 cm 1 nh stretching 36 nf absorption bands were observed at 1037 cm 1 si o si stretching 3428 cm 1 oh stretching and 3620 cm 1 si oh stretching it should be noted that the band representative of the si oh interactions of the nf in the ncps is not presented this absence can be attributed to the interactions between nf and pmx that have high positive charge contents due to quaternary ammonium groups of chitosan macromonomer and pclapta 37 fig 2b shows the tga thermogram of the ncps the decomposition temperatures were between 25 0 and 150 0 c which was attributed to the water physically adsorbed by the ncps and a slight loss was attributed to the water that was occluded between the nf sheets interacting with the functional groups of the pmx at 344 0 350 0 c the maximum degradation temperature for ncps was observed for all samples there was an increase in the residual mass percentages attributed to the effect of nf on pmx and the process of intercalation of some polymer chains in the nf sheets fig 2c shows the sem images of the different ncps observing changes with respect to the roughness in the morphology of the ncps to different relationships of nf vs the material without nf which is attributed to the increase in the different nominal concentrations of nf on the other hand the formation of pores in the structure of the materials may be attributed to the process of polymerization of cationic and anionic monomers in the presence of the alkylated macromonomer and to the lyophilization process fig 2d shows the results obtained from elemental analysis by eds determining two representative elements in the nanofiller as si and al demonstrating the increase in the concentration of the two elements as the nominal concentrations of nf in the pmx increase confirming the presence of nf as well as the results obtained by tga in the residual mass the process of delamination is one of the critical processes when preparing ncps in the presence of nanoparticles and specifically 2d type nanoparticles such as clay to verify that clay sheets present this phenomenon tem images and xrd patterns are corroborated fig 3a shows the tem images for the different ncps providing a visual and direct way the distribution and type of morphology of the nf in the pmx a specific area of the sample i ncps present nf in the matrix which corroborates the results shown above ii the distribution of nf in ncps with 3 nf has a higher exfoliation compared with ncps 6 and 9 from this it is possible to suggest a morphology between intercalated and exfoliated types for ncps 3 and intercalated for ncps 6 and 9 from these results obtained qualitatively they are corroborated by quantitative results measuring the interlaminar distance of the nf sheets by using xrd and eq 3 which corresponds to bragg s law 3 nλ 2 d sen θ nfs mmt has reflection peak 8 8 2 θ corresponding to an interlaminar distance of 10 4 å 38 therefore if there is a displacement of the peak to smaller angles it is suggested that the material has an intercalated morphology and in the case that no peak is present it is suggested that the ncps have an exfoliated morphology 39 ncps 3 shows no presence of the characteristic peak of the nanofiller in fig 3b therefore the presence of an exfoliated and intercalated morphology is confirmed as shown in fig 3a these results can be related to the low concentration of nf present in the pmx as well as to the interactions present by the greater amount of positive loads present in the matrix and negative loads of the interlaminar spaces present in the nf for ncps 6 and 9 there is a displacement of the peak to smaller angles of approximately 4 0 2 θ corresponding to an interlaminate distance of 21 9 å presenting an interlaminar space difference of 11 9 å with respect to the interlaminar distance of the nf these results suggest an interspersed morphology attributed to the highest concentration of nf the water adsorption capacity with respect to time is shown in fig 3c and the adsorption comparison in equilibrium with the addition of nf is shown in fig 3d in fig 3c an increase in adsorption capacity can be seen for both ncps and hgs observing an increase in capacity up to 420 min later a slight decrease was observed until reaching an adsorption plate to verify that hydrogels have differences in adsorption capacity a one way anova with multiple comparison tukey analysis was performed where ncps do not show significant differences this nonsignificant difference in ncps is attributed to nf dispersion which may affect adsorption due to the orientation that nf sheets may exhibit preventing the diffusion of water molecules into the pmx these results have been reported in different studies where they have used 2d nanoparticles of the clay type which can restrict the molecular dynamics of the chains present making the polymer chains not partially relaxed which causes the processes of diffusion of water molecules to occur 40 41 to determine the effect of nf on pmx the mechanical resistance of the ncps was determined through rheological tests studying the viscoelastic properties of the ncps through oscillatory deformation tests and evaluating the variation in the storage module g that describes the elastic component of the ncps and the loss modulus g which is related to the viscous component or energy released from ncps due to the deformation process fig 4a shows the viscoelastic linear region lvr of the ncps and demonstrates that the materials under study can withstand deformation up to approximately 10 0 12 0 15 0 and 22 0 of the stress without breaking the microstructure of their network for hgs ncps 3 ncps 6 and ncps 9 respectively indicating that these materials exhibit elastic behaviour at low deformation rates because the storage module is larger than the loss module 42 in the lvr the effect of the nf concentrations in the pmx can be determined thus fig 4b shows the complex modulus 43 g of the different ncps containing the elastic and viscous contributions of the materials g is calculated by eq 4 4 g g 2 g 2 as shown in fig 4b ncps showed significant differences when the concentration of nf increased compared with pmx and without the presence of nf as well as significant differences between ncps 3 vs ncps 6 and 9 however there were no significant differences between ncps 6 and ncps 9 these results are influenced by the lack of homogeneity and high nf contents 3 2 adsorption experiments this section describes and discusses the results of the adsorption capacity of the different pmx based ncps with quaternary ammonium groups sulfonates and aromatic rings and the addition of 2d nanoparticle clay sheets for the retention of three antibiotics for use in both human and veterinary medicine through primary and secondary interactions between analyte and adsorbent ph studies have played a major role in retention capacity as they can affect the physicochemical properties of antibiotics influencing adsorption processes by altering loads fig 5 shows the ph variation 3 0 11 0 for the different ncps and antibiotics the maximum percentage of retention of clay contents in the material was reached at ph 9 0 for cip and at ph 11 0 for tet and amx these results are favoured by the strong interactions between ncps and antibiotics where antibiotic speciation plays a fundamental role in the case of cip two values of pka are presented one is 5 9 and another is 8 8 implying that at ph values below 5 9 cip adopts its cationic form due to the protonation of the secondary amine in the piperazine group whereas at ph values between 5 9 and 8 8 the molecule is in its zwitterionic form in which the charge of the deprotonated carboxylic acid and the protonated secondary amine are the dominant species in equilibrium and at ph values greater than 8 8 the secondary amine is stripped resulting in a charged molecule in its anionic form 44 tet has three functional groups according to the variation of the ph in the solution presenting speciation at a low ph of 3 2 being in its cationic form at ph values between 3 2 and 7 8 tet is in the zwitterionic state and at ph values above 7 8 tet behaves as an anionic molecule 45 amx has three pka1 values of 2 4 carboxyl pka2 7 4 amine and pka3 9 6 phenol indicating that at a neutral ph it is zwitterion at ph 2 4 it is mainly cationic and at ph greater than 7 4 it is negatively charged for this reason for the three antibiotics as the ph is increased there are more negative charges in solution which makes greater interactions between the antibiotic and adsorbent evident 46 this effect of higher retention is due to speciation by the antibiotic molecule and the strong coulombic interactions with functional groups of npes it should be remembered that the pmx of the npes is based on chitosan alkylated with quaternary ammonium groups pssna and pclapta in conclusion it can be said that electrostatic interactions were the main driving force in retention processes however because of the groups present in pmx and antibiotics other interactions occur such as i π π stacking interactions due to the aromatic ring of pssna and the benzene rings of antibiotic molecules ii hydrogen bonds and iii hydrophobic interactions 47 49 fig 5c compares the variation of the nf contents for the three antibiotics at optimal ph obtained in the previous ph study thus for cip there were significant differences between ncps 3 and 6 and material without nf while ncps 9 did not present significant differences see table s1 in the same way it happened for the percentages of removal of tet and amx however when comparisons were made between the different ncps see fig 5d it could be seen that ncps 3 presented the best retention value of the three antibiotics similarly comparisons were made between nominal nf concentrations showing significant differences for cip nonsignificant differences for tet and significant differences for amx see table s1 based on the previous results and to continue the different retention trials ncps 3 were selected these results agree with the characterization results showing that ncps 3 have optimal characteristics according to an exfoliated morphology and no significant differences between the ncps in the complex modulus the retention results can be attributed to the low exfoliation of the material and the increase in rheological propositions since increasing the g due to the increase of nf antibiotic molecules is prevented from spreading in the pmx easily in fig 6a is shown the effect of increased nacl concentrations on removal it demonstrates clearly a decrease in removal percentage as nacl concentration increased these results were caused by competition for the active sites by the ncps since the increases in ions in solution are an important factor that limits the effects of removal and interaction these results agree with different studies that have shown the effect of the increase in nacl on the removal of organic pollutants yu et al removed cip using multiple wall nanotubes where the influence of salinity in the concentration range of 0 0 0 4 mol l 1 decreased retention percentages as salt concentrations increased 50 on the other hand afzal et al removed antibiotics using hydrogel beads modified with humic acid where the increase in ionic strength at different nacl concentrations 0 1 0 mol l 1 affected retention rates as salt concentrations increased 51 these results were mainly due to electrolytes in solution which modified the electrostatic interactions between the analyte and the ncps where interactions present either the attractive or repulsive type they may be affected by the addition of ions in solution because the active sites of the ncps are found with positive charges interacting with the chloride ions as well as negatively charged antibiotics interacting with sodium ions which is reflected in the decrease in the retention percentages 52 the retention effect with respect to the dose of ncps is shown in fig 6b it is noted that there was an increase in the retention percentages as the content increased from 5 0 to 20 0 mg for tet but decreased at doses of ncps 20 0 mg while cip and amx had the maximum retention at 30 0 mg and at doses 30 0 mg there was a decrease this correlation of the positive increase between the dose of ncps and antibiotics is related to the availability of active sites or the surface of the material but may also be affected by the speciation and variation of loads present in antibiotics the removal experiments with respect to contact time provide us with important information regarding the speed of removal and help us to know the optimal balance time in this study the contact time was varied from 0 0 to 30 0 h in fig 6 c the effect of the contact time for the three antibiotics is presented showing a slight increase between 0 5 h and 2 0 h of contact for the three antibiotics anova tests of multiple comparisons were performed for this purpose see fig 6 where it was shown that the three beats did not present significant differences which allowed us to select a time of 0 5 h for the contact time from the results shown in fig 6 c and d it can be said that for a period 0 5 h repulsive forces arose due to the lack of availability of vacant active sites in the retention process as well as after those times with a constant retention this may have been due to a retention of less available active sites that is as available sites present saturations the speed of removal was affected by the speed of the antibiotics to reach the least available sites in the ncps 53 furthermore the kinetic adsorption parameters were evaluated by applying nonlinear models of the lagergren pseudo first order model and pseudo second order model 54 the nonlinear equations of the models are given by eqs 5 and 6 5 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 6 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q t and q e mg g 1 are the adsorption capacities of antibiotics at time t min and equilibrium state respectively k1 and k2 are related to the rate constants for pseudo first and pseudo second order models respectively in table 2 the retention kinetic parameters of the three antibiotics are presented showing that the two models have correlation coefficients close to unity indicating that the applied models conform to the experimental data obtained see fig s1 moreover the qe values obtained by both methods and experimentally calculated qe are similar concluding that the two methods can describe the kinetic parameters of the process of removal of these antibiotics in the presence of ncps the effects of the initial antibiotic concentration and temperature are shown in fig 7a the removal capacity of the three antibiotics increased by increasing the antibiotic concentration to 80 0 mg l 1 for cip and up to 100 0 mg l 1 for tet and amx later at these concentrations a slight decrease was observed and remained constant up to 200 0 mg l 1 these results may be because ncps have a limited number of active sites available and of the speciation of antibiotics at the optimal ph on the other hand it can be said that there is a driving force that overcomes resistance to mass transfer of antibiotics in the aqueous phases and the ncps which is due to a slight increase in clearance capacity as initial concentrations increase up to maximum retention capacity 55 in fig 7b the effect of temperature was evaluated for the three antibiotics at the maximum removal concentration for cip tet and amx there was an increase in retention by increasing the temperature for cip and amx from 25 0 to 45 0 c and tet from 25 0 to 35 0 c these results are due to an increase in the expansion of the cavities formed by ncps that cause antibiotic molecules to penetrate the least available active sites in ncps 34 the decrease in retention percentage at temperatures 35 0 c for tet may be due to the thermal movement of antibiotic molecules which weakens the forces of attraction between active sites and speciation charges 56 to determine the adsorption parameters nonlinear equations of adsorption isotherms were used as they provide us with important information regarding the interactions of ncps and antibiotics 55 57 the nonlinear equations to determine the adsorption parameters were the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r model 58 59 which are given in eqs 7 10 7 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 8 q e k f c e 1 n 9 q e rt b t ln a t c e 10 q e q m exp β ε 2 where for the langmuir isotherm q e mg g 1 is the equilibrium adsorption of the ncps q m mg g 1 is the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity c e mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration and bl l g 1 is associated with the free energy of sorption for freundlich isotherms n is a dimensionless parameter that indicates the favourability of adsorption and kf mg g 1 is the freundlich constant indicating the adsorption capacity for the temkin isotherm at l g 1 is the temkin constant and bt j mol 1 is the heat of adsorption β mol2j 2 was a constant related to the adsorption energy and ε was the polanyi potential r and t were the gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and absolute temperature k the experimental data were adjusted to the different models as shown in fig 8 for freundlich isotherms at temperatures of 25 0 35 0 and 45 0 c and as shown in fig s2 s3 and s4 for langmuir temkin and d r isotherms at different temperatures respectively the adsorption isotherm parameters obtained are shown in table 3 from the results obtained it can be said that the langmuir model does not conform to the data obtained due to the negative values obtained for qm and bl for tet and amx at temperatures of 35 0 and 45 0 c in this case we can say that the langmuir model only adjusts to temperatures of 25 c presenting maximum retention capacities of 58 6 291 7 and 97 6 mg g 1 for cip tet and amx respectively the freundlich isotherm presented correlation coefficients similar to the langmuir isotherm and according to the nature of the ncps heterogeneous it can be said that this model conforms to the experimental data obtained on the other hand information was obtained considering the parameter n determined by the freundlich equation that represents the adsorption force indicating values of 1 n between 0 and 1 that favour the adsorption process for most cases in this study 60 from the findings found in this study it is suggested that adsorption cannot be clearly described by a single mathematical model due to the heterogeneous nature of the material as has been reported in previous studies of antibiotic removal 61 62 to compare the maximum equilibrium retention capacity with different materials reported in previous publications on antibiotic removal in table 4 the qm obtained using the langmuir model at a temperature of 25 0 c is presented as can be seen in the literature different types of materials are presented to be applied in the retention processes the adsorption by the different materials will depend on different factors such as the capacity for interactions that may be present in the materials under study which in turn depend on the available groups that can interact with the speciation of each antibiotic in this table we can find different maximum adsorption capacity values for antibiotics such as nanocomposite materials based on humic acids and cellulose for removal of ciprofloxacin obtaining maximum retention capacity of 10 8 mg g 1 18 from the results of the retention experiments obtained for the different study variables it can be observed that the maximum retention capacity is greater for the tet when it is compared as the maximum capacity obtained by the cip and amx as can be seen in table 3 at 25 c from that it is proposed that the main retention mechanism by the cnps 3 it is through the electrostatic interactions present between the quaternary ammonium groups present intrinsically in the polymer matrix due to the alkylation of the chitosan with the alkylating agent and also to the quaternary ammonium groups contributed by the repeating unit of the copolymer used this in agree with the highest retention percentage obtained the ph between 9 0 and 11 0 and the speciation of the antibiotics with negative charges at that ph however it can be evidenced that retention occurs at lower ph and can be attributed to secondary interactions such as hydrogen bonding interactions because the antibiotics under study present hydrogen donors and acceptors that can easily interact with the polar functional groups of the matrix polymeric such as hydroxyl groups amino group residues and carboxyl groups 71 other types of interactions may also occur such as π π stacking interactions due to the aromatic ring of pssna and the benzene rings of antibiotic molecules 47 49 see fig 9 4 conclusions a novel nanocomposite polyelectrolyte ncps based on alkylated chitosan monomers with quaternary ammoniun groups sulfonic acid and montmorillonite to be used as a potential adsorbent in the removal of emerging antibiotic type contaminants such as amoxicillin amx tetracycline tet and ciprofloxacin cip ncps were characterized by various techniques such as ftir drx tga sem tem and rheology the materials presented an improvement in rheological and thermal characteristics however the increase in nanofiller contents means that there are no significant differences in water adsorption in the removal studies it was observed that the optimal ph was 9 0 for cip and 11 0 for tet and amx the ncps with 3 wt nanofiller have the highest adsorption for the three antibiotics removal percentage for antibiotics 80 0 was given in a time of 30 min and adsorbent dosage of 0 02 g for tet and 0 03 for cip and amx due to load distribution and speciation of antibiotics at optimal ph nonlinear first order and second order kinetics models with r2 of 0 99 1 00 describe the kinetic adsorption behaviour of ncps meanwhile the non linear adsorption model that best describes adsorption is from the langmuir model at 25 0 c the maximum capacities obtained at 25 0 c were 58 6 291 7 and 97 6 mg g 1 for cip tet and amx respectively this
