23990,a year long four dimensional variational 4d var data assimilation experiment formulated on the physical space statistical analysis system psas algorithm has been applied to the adriatic sea for the very first time high resolution multi platform observations were assimilated into the regional ocean modeling system roms forced by mesoscale atmospheric model aladin hr aire limitée adaptation dynamique développement international including important freshwater river inflows and realistic open boundary conditions for the period between october 2014 and september 2015 the observations included sea surface temperature sst measured by satellites in situ temperature and salinity data measured by various moving argo profiling floats shipborne ctds sea glider towed ctd profiler and moored platforms ocean current profiles measured by moored acoustic doppler current profilers adcps and 30 minute de tided surface currents from high frequency hf radars three model simulations were integrated 1 a non assimilative simulation over a year long period baseline simulation 2 a non assimilative simulation initiated by the previous assimilation 4 day cycle background simulation and 3 a fully assimilative simulation that used all available observations during the 4 day assimilation cycle analysis simulation the assimilation significantly improved the modeling system performance especially in sst with time average rmse equaling 0 9 0 7 and 0 5 c and bias equaling 0 39 0 15 0 01 c for the baseline background and analysis simulations respectively these reductions were mostly achieved during the wintertime outbreaks of a cold and dry bora wind caused by an underestimation of heat and momentum fluxes by the atmospheric model such fine adjustments in the northern and middle adriatic may be responsible for improved reproduction of dense water generation and the associated adriatic thermohaline circulation keywords 4d var data assimilation multiyear simulation roms model adriatic sea dynamics 1 introduction recent advances in computing power developments in ocean data assimilation hereafter da techniques improvements in satellite radiometer resolution and increased number of locally available observations i e coastal hf radars adcps and ctd mooring cruises coastal buoys have allowed for substantial advances in objective and dynamically consistent mapping of the ocean state dobricic and pinardi 2008 li et al 2008 the four dimensional variational 4d var da technique courtier et al 1994 courtier 1997 is the most advanced version of the variational schemes with its usage becoming more prevalent in ocean research weaver et al 2003 moore et al 2009 2011a b usui et al 2015 there are many benefits of using 4d var da over simpler methods like 3d var optimal interpolation or the simplest nudging techniques powell et al 2008 2012 moore et al 2009 2011a b matthews et al 2012 powell 2017 the notable feature of 4d var da is its capability to ingest observations at their exact time and location together with their time evolving error covariance matrix weaver and courtier 2001 this feature retains temporal information that would otherwise be lost through averaging thus enhancing our ability to simulate rapidly changing coastal ocean dynamics as occurs during severe and abrupt winter storms that are associated with extreme cooling processes janeković et al 2014 by definition variational methods aim to minimize model to data discrepancy j o and changes to the model background associated model part of the cost function j m at the same time during each da cycle usually referred to as total cost function j j m j o eq 1 this is achieved by adjusting the control parameters for initial and boundary conditions and atmospheric forcing fields 1 j j m j o 1 2 δ x t d 1 δ x 1 2 g δ x d t r 1 g δ x d where x is state vector i e free surface currents or tracer δ x represents deviation of x from its background d is the normalized background error covariance matrix r is the normalized observational error matrix and g δ x d represents the mismatch between the tangent linear model mapped to the observations g δ x and the innovation vector d defined as difference between observations and the model equivalent of the observations computed from the background circulation the goal of minimization is to find optimal perturbation δ x a such as to minimize j with respect to the deviation of the state vector from its background δ x eq 2 2 δ x a d 1 g t r 1 g 1 g t r 1 d one of the challenges in this approach is to very closely proximate the d matrix which in our case was done by using correlation modeling via a generalized diffusion equation weaver and courtier 2001 these methods rely on the linear variational approach tangent linear model and the adjoint model that limits spatial and temporal scales specific to the modeled region in high resolution coastal applications nonlinearity of the system increases with smaller spatial and temporal scales which can be of order of 100 m in space and seconds in time consequently this can pose significant computational burdens despite the demanding computational requirements 4d var has also been successfully applied in highly dynamical regional coastal seas janeković et al 2013 iermano et al 2015 souza et al 2015 kerry et al 2016 sperrevik et al 2017 the scope of the study is the adriatic sea the 800 200 km northernmost extension of the mediterranean sea connected to the adjacent ionian sea through the otranto strait fig 1 the adriatic bathymetry exhibits a shallow 80 m and wide northern adriatic shelf gently increasing in depth towards the middle adriatic depressions of approx 250 m jabuka pit jp in fig 1 being separated from the 1200 m deep and circular southern adriatic pit sap by the 170 m deep palagruža sill ps in fig 1 general circulation of the adriatic is cyclonic with eastern adriatic current eac flowing along the eastern perimeter of the sea and transporting saline levantine intermediate water liw zore armanda 1963 while the western adriatic current wac transports fresher surface water having its origin in the northern adriatic orlić et al 1992 artegiani et al 1997 although the northern adriatic is shallow and its bathymetry mostly flat its circulation is particularly challenging to reproduce this is because of 1 the influence of large rivers of which the largest is the po river with an annual mean flux of approx 1500 m3 s raicich 1994 vilibić et al 2016 and 2 extreme forcing during winters when across basin cold and dry bora winds blow downslope along the coastal mountains and extensively cool the shallow sea grisogono and belušić 2009 heat losses during such periods may reach 2000 w m2 janeković et al 2014 the consequence is the generation of extremely dense and cold waters 1030 0 kg m3 and 5 7 c during extreme episodes e g 2012 mihanović et al 2013 janeković et al 2014 which sink to form a bottom density current nof 1983 and fill the middle adriatic depressions artegiani and salusti 1987 vilibić and supić 2005 and the southern adriatic pit querin et al 2016 conversely during the summer season sea surface temperatures can reach as high as 30 c with sharp thermocline located at 20 m depth additionally the effect of tides can be important in the northern adriatic particularly in narrow channels janeković and kuzmić 2005 in this study we present a year long reanalysis of the adriatic dynamics carried out by using 4d var da formulated on the physical space statistical analysis system algorithm psas moore et al 2011b in this system applied minimization procedures that estimate optimal analysis increments are defined in the observation space in contrast to the primal definition and full model space i4d var the motivation for the study was to a quantify the usefulness of 4d var da in such a dynamic environment due to linear constraints inherent inside tangent linear and adjoint models b quantify how long the improvements achieved by da persist in the model and c quantify the improvements in reproducing the ocean state i e to reach the best ocean state description in relation to different observing platforms used in the adriatic sea the structure of the paper is as follows the modeling system setup is described in section 2 multi platform observations assimilated in our numerical experiments in section 3 section 4 is an assessment of the results and a verification using the independent dataset and section 5 contains the discussion and summarizes the major conclusions 2 numerical model setup

stokes equations with finite difference approximation and a time splitting approach shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 2009 the standard set of daily averaged lateral boundary conditions free surface temperature salinity and velocity were interpolated from the wider adriatic regional model adriatic forecasting system areg and imposed at the only open boundary fig 1 white line at the otranto strait areg does not use any form of data assimilation oddo et al 2006 however it is nested within the larger mediterranean forecasting system mfs which uses 3d var data assimilation pinardi et al 2003 pinardi and coppini 2010 tonani et al 2014 the implicit chapman scheme chapman 1985 for free surface the flather scheme for 2d momentum flather 1976 and a combination of radiation nudging for 3d fields momentum and tracers temperature and salinity have been used for nonlinear boundary formulations marchesiello et al 2001 following previous adriatic studies janeković et al 2014 vilibić et al 2016 mihanović et al 2018 the roms numerical grid was set to a horizontal resolution of 2 km with 20 vertically distributed s layers in order to avoid numerical instabilities the bathymetry was smoothed using linear programming dutour sikirić et al 2009 prior to the study a nonlinear no assimilation model used for dense water formation analysis was integrated over 8 years 2008 2015 mihanović et al 2018 these model results were used to compute a statistical representation of monthly model background error covariance for the initial boundary and forcing fields weaver and courtier 2001 assuming that background errors are proportional to variability in the nonlinear no assimilative model isotropic decorrelation error covariance scales for initial and boundary fields used during the normalization computations were set to 30 km for the horizontal and 20 m for the vertical direction atmospheric forcing decorrelation error covariance scales used 100 km in horizontal all scales were based on the precomputed statistical values from the 8 year non assimilative run additional tuning and rescaling of the background and observation error covariance matrices mattern et al 2018 was not performed but could be completed in future experiments atmospheric forcing at the ocean surface has been taken from the hydrostatic version of the numerical weather prediction model aladin hr aire limitée adaptation dynamique développement international operationally run by the croatian meteorological and hydrological service tudor et al 2013 2015 the model resolution is 8 km in horizontal with 37 vertical sigma layers in vertical the winds were dynamically downscaled to horizontal resolution of 2 km ivatek šahdan and tudor 2004 all meteorological variables were provided with a 3 h time interval the meteorological model was executed 4 times a day initial conditions were computed using mesoscale data assimilation 3d var for upper air fields and optimal interpolation for screen level parameters stanešić 2011 lateral boundary conditions were obtained from operational global forecast runs of the ifs integrated forecast system model in the ecmwf european centre for medium range forecasts where global analysis was completed using the 4d var assimilation technique bulk parameterization fairall et al 1996 has been used for transferring surface variables into the ocean roms model for the da adjoint model clamped boundary conditions were used instead of radiation nudging of 3d fields the 4th order akima advection scheme shchepetkin and mcwilliams 1998 was used for temperature and salinity in both the horizontal and the vertical as there was no available adjoint mpdata advection scheme smolarkiewicz and margolin 1998 used in the nonlinear no assimilation 8 year simulation in the case of momentum we used the upwind third order scheme in the horizontal and the fourth order central scheme in the vertical ocean turbulence was modeled using the standard setup based on the gls mixing scheme umlauf and burchard 2003 within the da model two outer and eight inner loops were used to ensure optimal minimization of the cost function j during our experiment 1 october 2014 30 september 2015 the 4d var psas approach moore et al 2011b was applied to the simulation splitting the one year simulation into 91 four day assimilation cycles each starting from the previous cycle using saved initial conditions this window cycling was needed to insure validity of the tangent linear model assumption powell et al 2008 within the 4 day window the window length of 4 days was determined using multiple tangent linear model simulations propagating perturbations forward in time as in the da and computing appropriate spatial correlations in time with fully nonlinear model solutions propagating the exactly same perturbations when correlation values begin to decay linear assumption is no longer valid in setting the assimilation window moreover high nonlinearity usually occurring inside vertical turbulent scheme was not computed inside tangent linear model but instead it was saved during the first nonlinear model integration as spatial and temporal variable vertical viscosity and diffusivity coefficients and then used inside tangent linear and adjoint models within each cycle to compare the performance of the da analysis to that of the non assimilative nonlinear model three experiments were undertaken 1 a non assimilative nonlinear simulation hereafter called the baseline simulation 2 a non assimilative nonlinear simulation initiated by the previous assimilation 4 day cycle hereafter called the background simulation and 3 a fully assimilative nonlinear simulation that used all available observations during the 4 days assimilation cycle hereafter called the analysis simulation 3 observations the observational period ranged from 1 october 2014 to 30 september 2015 with more than 15 million high resolution observations used in the da most of which were sea surface temperatures sst measured by satellite radiometers and surface ocean currents measured with high frequency hf radars in addition the following in situ data has been used for the da 1 vertical temperature and salinity profiles from various ocean platforms argo profiling floats shipborne yo yo profiler autonomous glider conductivity temperature depth ctd probes and constant depth moorings and 2 vertical current profiles from five moored acoustic doppler current profilers adcp fig 2 a large number of observations came from the nadex 2015 experiment described by vilibić et al 2018 each observation has been quality checked and mapped to the model grid using the seapy python package https github com powellb seapy creating so called super observations as a standard input for the 4d var da system the process of creating super observations involves spatially and temporally aggregating observations all of the observations of the same type that are contained in the same model grid cell and 5 min time interval are averaged to produce super observation computed mean value and mean spatial temporal location was assigned as a single time cell value for the observation type and location variance determined during the aggregation was used for estimating the error of representativeness filling the corresponding observation error matrix r we used the larger value between the specific instrument errors and computed variance during the aggregation an independent set of 85 ctd stations in total 16 591 depth measurements mostly from the eastern region of the adriatic sea fig 2 was used for validation of the 4d var da model performance 3 1 satellite sst data we used l2p granule swath sst data from the modis aqua platform at the native resolution of 1 km available from nasa jet propulsion laboratory jpl obpg rsmas 2006 data consisting of up to 2 swaths per day were retrieved for the adriatic sea region for the duration of the experiment resulting in a total of 750 scenes using the provided quality flags qf we used only the best quality data qf 5 and those observations at least 10 km away from the coast or an open boundary depending on the specific scene number of useful raw data varied between 1000 and 151 000 averaging 30 000 in addition to the modis aqua data we used the avhrr l3c mono sensor gridded product only from night scenes e u copernicus marine service information http marine copernicus eu and applied the same selection criteria as above we chose only night scenes as they were not affected by diurnal warming the model was not fully capable of representing diurnal heating due to the variable sigma coordinate depth of the first surface layer recent advances in roms modeling and the new vertical layer distribution scheme might help with this issue souza et al 2015 but were not used in the study in total we assimilated approx 5 2 million gridded sst data from l3c and approx 5 1 million gridded sst data from l2p modis aqua fig 2 color represents total number of assimilated modis sst values for each model grid cell 3 2 in situ temperature and salinity data vertical profiles of temperature and salinity were obtained by shipborne ctd measurements at 66 stations 7898 samples in the northern adriatic and were used in the da fig 2 black circles shipborne ctd measurements collected along the entire eastern adriatic sea at 85 stations 16 591 ctd samples fig 2 black stars were used exclusively for model validation all ctd measurements were carried out with regularly calibrated seabird sbe 19 and sbe 25 probes with an accuracy of at least 0 005 c for temperature and 0 001 for salinity the data from two argo profiling floats id 6901826 and 6901827 drifting in the deep sap between 1 october 2014 and 30 september 2015 were used in the da fig 2 black pluses during the nadex 2015 experiment vilibić et al 2018 four moored stations were deployed between november 2014 and august 2015 in the coastal northeastern adriatic fig 2 red squares equipped with ctd sbe16 data loggers measuring bottom temperature and salinity at 10 min intervals one adcp was moored in the hf radar domain area from december 2014 to july 2015 fig 2 blue square measuring ocean temperature at the bottom along with a vertical profile of ocean currents in addition the nadex experiment included two mobile ocean platforms for measuring temperature and salinity a slocum glider was deployed between 24 and 27 february 2015 in front of kvarner bay fig 2 yellow line kokkini et al 2017 while a towed yo yo profiler was operated in the same region between 19 and 20 march 2015 fig 2 blue line 3 3 adcp data there were 10 teledyne rdi adcp stations deployed during the nadex experiment in the coastal northeastern and middle adriatic we used current data from 5 stations in the da experiment fig 2 4 red and one blue squares the remaining 5 stations were moored in very narrow channels that were not properly resolved with the 2 km roms model grid and were therefore not used the adcp data were assimilated as hourly averaged values to minimize the effect of bad quality data present at the original sampling interval 10 or 15 min the vertical profiles for each of horizontal current components were de tided the adcp configuration used a fine vertical cell size 1 or 2 m depending on the site depth and a relatively small number of pings 100 120 pings 10 or 15 min to save battery for a long term deployment providing instrument error close to 0 05 m s altogether 654 912 east and north current components were taken into the da experiment prescribed observational error was taken as the larger value between aggregated super observations variance and estimated adcp measurement error 0 05 m s 3 4 hf radar surface currents data two wera hf radars operating at 26 275 mhz with a 150 khz bandwidth were installed in the middle adriatic in march 2014 covering the area between the islands of vis šolta and hvar fig 2 green dots half hourly de tided surface currents over the 2 2 km grid were used in the da prior to assimilation the hf radar data were quality checked using the procedures described by gomez et al 2014 and only the data with the best qf were used a winter storm damaged and shut down the equipment from 30 january 2015 but radar operations were restored at the beginning of may 2015 during the mapping from the hf radar grid to the roms model grid the creation of the super observations the variance was computed and used to prescribe observation errors for the da overall during the year long experiment we assimilated a 5 2 million observations of gridded sst data from l3c b 5 1 million of gridded sst data from l2p modis aqua c shipborne ctd measurements at 66 stations in total 7898 samples d adcp data from 5 stations in total 654 912 east and north current components and e half hourly hf radar surface current data in total 4 4 million of gridded east and north surface current components 4 results 4 1 cost function during the year long da experiment applied model minimization procedure reduced observation to model discrepancy scaled with appropriate observation error covariance matrix j o inside the cost function j in eq 1 fig 3a and at the same time penalizing mismatch with the model background j m in the eq 1 and fig 3b for details see broquet et al 2011 moore et al 2009 2011a b overall the mismatch between the model and the observations j o was reduced approximately by half fig 3c black line note that it is also a function of the number of assimilated observations however the mismatch does vary with different assimilation cycles falling between 30 and 70 sst and hf radar surface currents apparently contributed the most to the j o part of the cost function fig 4a both in the background and analysis simulations however when scaling contributions to the j o with the total number of used observations it appears that ctd observations for example when present in specific assimilation cycle contributed between 37 and 68 of the j o cost function while sst contributed only about 17 this may allow future reductions in the use of vast numbers of sst observations as their contribution to the innovation vector is relatively modest some observing platforms were active in data collection for a few days only covering just one da cycle yet contributed significantly to the cost function in these cycles an example is the glider fig 4b light blue color which operated for a few days in the area where the northern adriatic front is normally present in february kokkini et al 2017 observation to model difference for the glider data in the baseline model was particularly pronounced with the model overshooting the temperature up to 2 c vilibić et al 2018 a significant contribution to the observational part of the cost function also came from adcp data due to positioning in a complex coastal region where quality of the model reproduction is limited by its resolution by contrast the contribution of argo float data was found to be low argo floats were profiling in the deep open ocean area of the sap which was far better reproduced by simulations than shallow coastal regions when operating half hourly hf radar data covered a relatively small coastal area but had frequent temporal resolution so their contribution to the j o cost function was found to be significant simply because there were many of them the observation related cost function has a noteworthy annual change fig 3a with minimum values occurring in late autumn october november 2014 coinciding with the breakdown of the seasonal pycnocline and the homogenization of the water column buljan and zore armanda 1976 artegiani et al 1997 it is low during wintertime when the hf radars were not operating and clouds masked sst observations the cost function increases during specific cycles peaking in two cycles between mid february and mid march 2015 fig 4b just after the pronounced bora episodes vilibić et al 2018 which reached their maxima in the area where most in situ measurements were taken coastal northeastern adriatic the cost function has its highest values during summer particularly for the background simulation as there is a large number of available observations large values are evident in the analysis because the shallow thermocline and the respective upper layer dynamics are probably not well reproduced with a coarse vertical resolution of only 20 sigma levels even though we used an increased vertical resolution near the surface however the cost function decreases substantially with the da in the analysis simulation particularly during the periods in which the background run performed the worst e g beginning of june 2015 deviations from the model background state are penalized inside j m fig 3b which shows a different annual distribution it is the largest in the winter period dec mar when system needs to modify ocean dynamics the most in order to get closer to the observations total cost function j during each experiment cycle is simply the sum of the j o and j m i e sum of fig 3a and b 4 2 temperature and salinity the assimilation results in a considerable reduction in variance and bias especially for sst which is one of the major contributors in the j o cost function fig 4 the baseline background and analysis simulations have domain averaged mean biases of 0 4 c 0 1 c and 0 01 c respectively fig 5 spatially the largest bias in the non assimilative baseline simulation is located in the northern and central regions of the adriatic sea peaking in front of the po river fig 5 these regions are shallow with fresh waters at the surface and respond faster to the atmospheric forcing e g heating during summer also a large positive sst bias is present in the coastal eastern area of the sap where the warm and saline eac is entering the adriatic orlić et al 1992 artegiani et al 1997 while the positive sst bias is rather small in the center of the sap interestingly the bias is negative in the eastern coastal regions of the northern adriatic which is largely a result of an underestimated wintertime cooling driven by strong bora winds peaking in that area vilibić et al 2018 the background simulation exhibits similar but much weaker spatial bias structures than the baseline solution while small patchy positive and negative biases are present over the adriatic in the analysis run similarly to bias the largest sst rmse of 0 9 c is found in the baseline simulation fig 6a equaling 0 7 c and 0 5 c in the background fig 6b and analysis fig 6c simulations respectively the high sst rmse values diminish in the analysis simulation revealing the capacity of the da to properly reduce model to data mismatch in the adriatic sea the largest baseline simulation sst rmse is present in the northern adriatic off the po river but also in the coastal and frontal regions e g in the wac that flows southeastward along western adriatic shoreline and is characterized by lower salinity artegiani et al 1997 in the background simulation sst rmse remains high off the po river and albanian rivers only as this rmse grows in one da cycle this indicates a rapid development of errors in the model in areas off the largest adriatic rivers as river plumes may change in a short time kourafalou 1999 note that we used climatological values to represent 41 fresh river inflows but did not change the ambient temperature as those data were not available janeković et al 2014 year long mean sst in the adriatic sea from the analysis simulation is presented in fig 7a all well known features as defined by orlić et al 1992 and artegiani et al 1997 are embedded in the sst distribution i sst maximum along the northern and eastern perimeter of the sap where eac brings warm waters from the ionian sea ii a narrow coastal strip of colder surface waters related to the western adriatic current extending from the northern adriatic along the western coast to the southern adriatic and iii lower sst in coastal waters along the northeastern adriatic which are separated from the open adriatic by numerous islands and affected by orographically driven local bora wind however the da warms up the surface of the most of the adriatic fig 7b particularly in the northern adriatic and in the coastal strip of the southeastern adriatic at the same time the center of the sap differs little between the assimilation and baseline simulations by contrast kvarner region in the coastal northeastern adriatic and the coastal strip between the bay of manfredonia and bari in the southern adriatic have been cooled by the da indicating that the cooling processes are not properly reproduced in these coastal regions and in the atmospheric model used to force the ocean for the assimilated ctd measurements which were mostly carried out in the shallow northern adriatic fig 2 black circles salinity rmse has been reduced by 50 the rmse for the baseline background and analysis simulations was 0 75 0 81 and 0 39 respectively however there was no reduction in temperature rmse 1 2 c 1 5 c 1 4 c for the baseline background and analysis simulations respectively this was presumably a consequence of the domain wide sst data that dominated in the cost function minimization whilst assimilated ctd measurements were exclusively made in the northern shallow adriatic less than 50 m depth yet validation of simulations on the independent ctd measurements from 85 stations in the deeper regions of the eastern adriatic observation depths up to 270 m fig 2 black results in a reduction of the bias and rmse for temperature table 1 the analysis simulation shows a bias that is almost 3 times lower than the baseline simulation for temperature while the respective rmse has been reduced by about 20 however in the case of salinity analysis results did not show any improvement over the baseline solution 4 3 currents and circulation the analysis simulation assimilated 4 4 million of gridded surface currents measurements north and east components obtained by the hf radars overall the da reduced rmse table 2 to o 0 1 m s while bias was already small the reduction of rmse is significant for both the along and the across basin components namely by 60 in the analysis simulation with respect to the baseline simulations 0 08 vs 0 13 m s average correlation between analysis and hf radar surface currents equaled 0 62 and 0 78 for the across and along basin directions respectively in the case of baseline simulation the correlation was 0 27 and 0 41 for across and along directions fig 8 yet the rmse and correlation changed with time fig 8 presumably due to the variability of the northwesterly eac orlić et al 2006 the da also managed to decrease the bias and rmse for horizontal current components measured at discrete depths and adcp stations moored in complex coastal regions table 2 where an exchange between open adriatic and coastal waters occurs vilibić et al 2018 in total 654 912 velocity vectors originating from 5 moored stations were mapped onto 20 vertical model layers and hourly means the bias and rmse were small before assimilation 0 001 m s and 0 07 m s respectively close to the standard deviation of the time series 0 05 m s the assimilation practically removed the mean bias while reducing the rmse for about 11 across basin direction and 14 along basin direction overall the average surface currents resembled the circulation regimes previously described in the adriatic fig 9a the most prominent of these include the wac which peaks at 40 cm s at the gargano promontory and in the southern adriatic and the eac which crosses the palagruža sill off the middle adriatic islands and then follows the isobaths of the jabuka pit martin et al 2009 however the da slightly modified these surface circulation regimes fig 9b for example the eac strengthened in southern coastal regions while the cyclonic circulation weakened in the central part of the sap i e the cyclonic circulation became narrower stronger and confined to the coasts the implication is an enlargement of the central sap area where open ocean convection is known to occur gačić et al 2002 vilibić and šantić 2008 thus presumably impacting the production of dense waters the same may be seen along the perimeter of the jabuka pit the analysis simulation shows a weakened cyclonic circulation around the pit changes can be also seen in the wac where most of the wac strengthens near the coast while weakening at its outer edges a counterclockwise difference in surface currents between analysis and baseline simulations may also be seen along the eastern shores of the northern adriatic indicating a weakening of the cyclonic circulation in that region as in the sap such a weakening may affect the rates of the dense water formation occurring in the northern adriatic bergamasco et al 1999 mihanović et al 2013 benetazzo et al 2014 to further investigate differences between simulations we computed year long mean transports along the five transects fig 10 interestingly the largest difference in surface currents found in the sap where da suggests a weaker cyclonic gyre fig 9b was not present in the mean transport fig 10 bottom transect a maximal value of 40 m2 s on the eastern side compared well to the baseline simulation for the same region western regions of sap gyre show a similar picture the da slightly reducing transport and having the most pronounced difference 100 km from the italian coast similarly influx from the southern adriatic into the middle adriatic over the palagruža sill fig 1 shows little difference between all three simulations with slightly stronger outflow of the wac along the western side in the case of da in the middle adriatic second transect from the top fig 10 the da simulation exhibits slightly stronger wac at the western side of the adriatic when compared to the baseline simulation which is compensated by the eac along the eastern side the largest relative difference in transport is in the northern adriatic along the eastern coastal regions top transect close to istria where da reduces along coast transport and moves it into the central part of northern adriatic those fine scale adjustments found in the da simulations could possibly impact other bio chemical processes strongly dependent on the physical oceanography background fields e g turchetto et al 2012 batistić et al 2014 4 4 surface and lateral boundary conditions differences between the analysis and baseline simulations were shaped by different initial conditions and different imposed forcings between those simulations both at the sea surface control vectors for atmosphere heat salt and wind stress and at the open boundary tracers free surface and momentum increments yearly mean across and along basin wind stress corrections fig 11a b were mainly applied close to the hf radar region as the most effective way to bring analysis closer to the observations strong but sporadic adjustments in wintertime mostly showed the bora wind pathways and were dominated by two banners of maximum stress correction the narrower northern banner where the bora wind maximum was occurring resembles the senj jet where the bora can blow with hurricane force within the channels dorman et al 2007 grisogono and belušić 2009 the broader southern maximum matched the sukošan jet which normally results in extensive heat loss off the middle adriatic islands janeković et al 2014 and directly influences the hf radar region modeling ocean dynamics induced by strong bora wind is problematic if using uncoupled and or low resolution atmospheric model forcing fields as coupled models correct fluxes and winds during severe bora episodes pullen et al 2006 2007 ličer et al 2016 along basin wind stress corrections which are influenced by the strong along basin sirocco wind lionello et al 2012 pomaro et al 2017 are mostly restricted to the middle adriatic fig 11b and reducing wind stress as a consequence the assimilation lowers heat loss and surface cooling in these areas fig 11c otherwise heat flux increases in the analysis simulation peaking in the central part of the southern adriatic there were noticeable and subtle open boundary condition differences between the analysis and baseline simulations at the lateral model boundary located in the otranto strait the differences were relatively small for salinity up to 0 05 fig 12a while ranging up to 0 25 c for temperature fig 12b the largest da correction in salinity was in the intermediate layer 50 150 m where the da increased the salinity therefore forcing the model to properly estimate the inflow of the liw into the adriatic in contrast salinity decreased at the surface in the analysis simulation in the subsurface layer up to 50 m temperature increased in the analysis simulation along central and eastern sections of the lateral boundary at depths between 150 and 400 m a small decrease in temperature in the analysis simulation was present where the deeper segment of the liw was flowing into the adriatic gačić et al 1996 these are important implications from a biological and chemical point of view as inputs via boundary conditions 5 discussion and conclusions until now reproducing the dynamics of the adriatic at high resolution has been predominantly achieved by ocean models forced by mesoscale atmospheric models e g bergamasco et al 1999 beg paklar et al 2001 or coupled atmosphere ocean models e g loglisci et al 2004 pullen et al 2006 2007 ličer et al 2016 some of them using a simple bias correction for improving the model performance e g benetazzo et al 2014 to improve the model dynamics we implemented a state of the art assimilation technique the largest differences in current velocity between model simulations with and without assimilation were obtained for the rim surface currents around the adriatic depressions and along the narrow coastal region in the front of istria east coast of northern adriatic during a fully assimilative simulation the surface portion of cyclonic gyre around the sap is confined towards the perimeter enlarging the area with low currents inside the gyre this may affect dense water formation during the wintertime gačić et al 2002 potentially changing the rate of modeled dense water generation in turn changing the thermohaline circulation manca et al 2006 ashkenazy et al 2012 cardin et al 2015 and the oscillatory thermohaline pattern in the eastern mediterranean gačić et al 2010 mihanović et al 2015 as seen by the models regarding transports across the sap gyre da simulation suggested similar flow as in the baseline solution a substantial difference between assimilated and non assimilated model results also occurs in the northern adriatic off the po river delta where the non assimilative model is too cold this may be a result of the introduction of riverine inputs into the model without river temperature information for example we added input from the largest adriatic river the po river only as a fresh water source with neutral temperature janeković et al 2014 consequently heat fluxes might not be properly reproduced here which again might affect the thermohaline circulation of the shallow adriatic driven by the dense water formation on the shelf beg paklar et al 2001 mihanović et al 2013 the third example of improving the adriatic dynamics is the correction of an overheating of the coastal area in the northeastern adriatic seen in non assimilative simulation this may prevent or weaken the dense water formation which occurs in this area characterized by the maximum of the dry and cold bora wind events grisogono and belušić 2009 janeković et al 2014 overall the 4d var da has improved our understanding of a number of processes which occur in the adriatic sea allowing for their proper quantification in the future similarly the 4d var da resulted in better estimates of surface boundary conditions where the largest correction was for the wind stress as the most effective mechanism for minimizing the difference between the model and observed hf radar surface circulation during the winter spring season corrections were driven by the bora cold wind events the bora driven wind stress is responsible for strong downwind ocean currents up to 1 m s in the senj jet martin et al 2006 precisely where the 4d var wind stress corrections are important the senj jet together with the trieste jet drives the bipole cyclone anticyclone circulation in the northern adriatic zore armanda and gačić 1987 kuzmić et al 2006 delimiting the area where dense water is formed during wintertime thus the introduction of a proper wind stress component is crucial for a more accurate reproduction of the dense water generation these corrections reflect a handicap of the bora dynamics in the aladin hr model which with a horizontal resolution of 8 km for heat fluxes and 2 km for winds cannot resolve bora driven jet changes vortices and submesoscale features that are known to appear during the severe bora wind episodes kuzmić et al 2015 the correction in lateral boundary conditions fig 12 were reminiscent of the problems of larger outer models used to provide boundary conditions for local models here the areg forecasting system data were adjusted to reproduce the inflow of surface waters and the top of the levantine intermediate water both located in the upper 200 m in the otranto strait boundary this might indicate an improper introduction of rivers in the outer model and inaccuracies in the atmospheric forcing which are not fully resolved at the sea surface through the operational assimilation of the mediterranean forecasting system tonani et al 2009 although the majority of assimilated data were satellite sst and hf radar measurements in situ observations encompassing the whole water column contributed significantly to the minimization of the cost function if scaled with number of observations assimilation of ctd data has been already found important for improving intermediate and deep ocean dynamics lee et al 2018 this also applied to the argo profiles broquet et al 2011 fragoso et al 2016 but in our study only two argo profilers were used and they were restricted to the deep sap only therefore they contributed little to the cost function hf radar measurements contributed substantially to the cost function and their assimilation is carried out regularly in coastal regions zhang et al 2010 matthews et al 2012 sperrevik et al 2015 souza et al 2015 here hf radar measurements encompassed a relatively small marginal sub basin area but were used frequently in time at 30 min intervals similarly one glider crossed over the northern adriatic front that was poorly captured by the non assimilative model thereby contributing significantly to the cost function despite being restricted to just one assimilation cycle of 4 days the area characterized by the northern adriatic front has been recognized as important feature through a number of past efforts zore armanda 1983 lee et al 2005 kokkini et al 2017 vilibić et al 2018 clearly an extension of glider measurements over a longer period even during few weeks would greatly improve our understanding of the northern adriatic dynamics furthermore our study highlights the importance of in situ measurements for improving our understanding of ocean dynamics through the da the da model skill compared against background solution indicates the predictability skill of da for each of the assimilation 4 day windows this is defined as in zhang et al 2010 3 skill 1 rmse da rmse b where rmse da stands for data assimilation rmse and rmse b for background i e before data assimilation rmse all scaled with observation s errors by computing the skill for the different types of observations and observing platforms we can measure specifically where da is performing better i e having smaller rmse than the background simulation in our case the da skill was consistently better across glider observations 30 for temperature and 39 for salinity yo yo towed ctd 36 for temperature ctd stations 38 for salinity sst modis 27 l3 22 hf radar 30 for across and 36 for along basin surface current components and overall adcp average of 10 during the whole year long experiment additionally these results point to a potential operational capability of the da application as its skill outperforms non assimilative model configuration all the da corrections to the control vector atmospheric forcing initial state and boundary conditions appear physical and in the right location and direction overall results are in general agreement with the adriatic sea dynamics yet improving many fine scale features which could have profound implications on the long term climatology dense water formation in the northern regions deep water convection in the southern adriatic or inflow through the boundary conditions to quantify such an impact further research is foreseen credit authorship contribution statement i janeković conceptualization

23990,a year long four dimensional variational 4d var data assimilation experiment formulated on the physical space statistical analysis system psas algorithm has been applied to the adriatic sea for the very first time high resolution multi platform observations were assimilated into the regional ocean modeling system roms forced by mesoscale atmospheric model aladin hr aire limitée adaptation dynamique développement international including important freshwater river inflows and realistic open boundary conditions for the period between october 2014 and september 2015 the observations included sea surface temperature sst measured by satellites in situ temperature and salinity data measured by various moving argo profiling floats shipborne ctds sea glider towed ctd profiler and moored platforms ocean current profiles measured by moored acoustic doppler current profilers adcps and 30 minute de tided surface currents from high frequency hf radars three model simulations were integrated 1 a non assimilative simulation over a year long period baseline simulation 2 a non assimilative simulation initiated by the previous assimilation 4 day cycle background simulation and 3 a fully assimilative simulation that used all available observations during the 4 day assimilation cycle analysis simulation the assimilation significantly improved the modeling system performance especially in sst with time average rmse equaling 0 9 0 7 and 0 5 c and bias equaling 0 39 0 15 0 01 c for the baseline background and analysis simulations respectively these reductions were mostly achieved during the wintertime outbreaks of a cold and dry bora wind caused by an underestimation of heat and momentum fluxes by the atmospheric model such fine adjustments in the northern and middle adriatic may be responsible for improved reproduction of dense water generation and the associated adriatic thermohaline circulation keywords 4d var data assimilation multiyear simulation roms model adriatic sea dynamics 1 introduction recent advances in computing power developments in ocean data assimilation hereafter da techniques improvements in satellite radiometer resolution and increased number of locally available observations i e coastal hf radars adcps and ctd mooring cruises coastal buoys have allowed for substantial advances in objective and dynamically consistent mapping of the ocean state dobricic and pinardi 2008 li et al 2008 the four dimensional variational 4d var da technique courtier et al 1994 courtier 1997 is the most advanced version of the variational schemes with its usage becoming more prevalent in ocean research weaver et al 2003 moore et al 2009 2011a b usui et al 2015 there are many benefits of using 4d var da over simpler methods like 3d var optimal interpolation or the simplest nudging techniques powell et al 2008 2012 moore et al 2009 2011a b matthews et al 2012 powell 2017 the notable feature of 4d var da is its capability to ingest observations at their exact time and location together with their time evolving error covariance matrix weaver and courtier 2001 this feature retains temporal information that would otherwise be lost through averaging thus enhancing our ability to simulate rapidly changing coastal ocean dynamics as occurs during severe and abrupt winter storms that are associated with extreme cooling processes janeković et al 2014 by definition variational methods aim to minimize model to data discrepancy j o and changes to the model background associated model part of the cost function j m at the same time during each da cycle usually referred to as total cost function j j m j o eq 1 this is achieved by adjusting the control parameters for initial and boundary conditions and atmospheric forcing fields 1

covariance matrix r is the normalized observational error matrix and g δ x d represents the mismatch between the tangent linear model mapped to the observations g δ x and the innovation vector d defined as difference between observations and the model equivalent of the observations computed from the background circulation the goal of minimization is to find optimal perturbation δ x a such as to minimize j with respect to the deviation of the state vector from its background δ x eq 2 2 δ x a d 1 g t r 1 g 1 g t r 1 d one of the challenges in this approach is to very closely proximate the d matrix which in our case was done by using correlation modeling via a generalized diffusion equation weaver and courtier 2001 these methods rely on the linear variational approach tangent linear model and the adjoint model that limits spatial and temporal scales specific to the modeled region in high resolution coastal applications nonlinearity of the system increases with smaller spatial and temporal scales which can be of order of 100 m in space and seconds in time consequently this can pose significant computational burdens despite the demanding computational requirements 4d var has also been successfully applied in highly dynamical regional coastal seas janeković et al 2013 iermano et al 2015 souza et al 2015 kerry et al 2016 sperrevik et al 2017 the scope of the study is the adriatic sea the 800 200 km northernmost extension of the mediterranean sea connected to the adjacent ionian sea through the otranto strait fig 1 the adriatic bathymetry exhibits a shallow 80 m and wide northern adriatic shelf gently increasing in depth towards the middle adriatic depressions of approx 250 m jabuka pit jp in fig 1 being separated from the 1200 m deep and circular southern

transporting saline levantine intermediate water liw zore armanda 1963 while the western adriatic current wac transports fresher surface water having its origin in the northern adriatic orlić et al 1992 artegiani et al 1997 although the northern adriatic is shallow and its bathymetry mostly flat its circulation is particularly challenging to reproduce this is because of 1 the influence of large rivers of which the largest is the po river with an annual mean flux of approx 1500 m3 s raicich 1994 vilibić et al 2016 and 2 extreme forcing during winters when across basin cold and dry bora winds blow downslope along the coastal mountains and extensively cool the shallow sea grisogono and belušić 2009 heat losses during such periods may reach 2000 w m2 janeković et al 2014 the consequence is the generation of extremely dense and cold waters 1030 0 kg m3 and 5 7 c during extreme episodes e g 2012 mihanović et al 2013 janeković et al 2014 which sink to form a bottom density current nof 1983 and fill the middle adriatic depressions artegiani and salusti 1987 vilibić and supić 2005 and the southern adriatic pit querin et al 2016 conversely during the summer season sea surface temperatures can reach as high as 30 c with sharp thermocline located at 20 m depth additionally the effect of tides can be important in the northern adriatic particularly in narrow channels janeković and kuzmić 2005 in this study we present a year long reanalysis of the adriatic dynamics carried out by using 4d var da formulated on the physical space statistical analysis system algorithm psas moore et al 2011b in this system applied minimization procedures that estimate optimal analysis increments are defined in the observation space in contrast to the primal definition and full model space i4d var the motivation for the study was to a quantify the usefulness of 4d var da in such a dynamic environment due to linear constraints inherent inside tangent linear and adjoint models b quantify how long the improvements achieved by da persist in the model and c quantify the improvements in reproducing the ocean state i e to reach the best ocean state description in relation to different observing platforms used in the adriatic sea the structure of the paper is as follows the modeling system setup is described in section 2 multi platform observations assimilated in our numerical experiments in section 3 section 4 is an assessment of the results and a verification using the independent dataset and section 5 contains the discussion and summarizes the major conclusions 2 numerical model setup

areg does not use any form of data assimilation oddo et al 2006 however it is nested within the larger mediterranean forecasting system mfs which uses 3d var data assimilation pinardi et al 2003

fields momentum and tracers temperature and salinity have been used for nonlinear boundary formulations marchesiello et al 2001 following previous adriatic studies janeković et al 2014 vilibić et al 2016 mihanović et al 2018 the roms numerical grid was set to a horizontal resolution of 2 km with 20 vertically distributed s layers in order to avoid numerical instabilities the bathymetry was smoothed using linear programming dutour sikirić et al 2009 prior to the study a nonlinear no assimilation model used for dense water formation analysis was integrated over 8 years 2008 2015 mihanović et al 2018 these model results were used to compute a statistical representation of monthly model background error covariance for the initial boundary and forcing fields weaver and courtier 2001 assuming that background errors are proportional to variability in the nonlinear no assimilative model isotropic decorrelation error covariance scales for initial and boundary fields used during the normalization computations were set to 30 km for the horizontal and 20 m for the vertical direction atmospheric forcing decorrelation error covariance scales used 100 km in horizontal all scales were based on the precomputed statistical values from the 8 year non assimilative run additional tuning and rescaling of the background and observation error covariance matrices mattern et al 2018 was not performed but could be completed in future experiments atmospheric forcing at the ocean surface has been taken from the hydrostatic version of the numerical weather prediction model aladin hr aire limitée adaptation dynamique développement international operationally run by the croatian meteorological and hydrological service tudor et al 2013 2015 the model resolution is 8 km in horizontal with

forecasts where global analysis was completed using the 4d var assimilation technique bulk parameterization fairall et al 1996 has been used for transferring surface variables into the ocean roms model for the da adjoint model clamped boundary conditions were used instead of radiation nudging of 3d fields the 4th order akima advection scheme shchepetkin and mcwilliams 1998 was used for temperature and salinity in both the horizontal and the vertical as there was no available adjoint mpdata advection scheme smolarkiewicz and margolin 1998 used in the nonlinear no assimilation 8 year simulation in the case of momentum we used the upwind third order scheme in the horizontal and the fourth order central scheme in the vertical ocean turbulence was modeled using the standard setup based on the gls mixing scheme umlauf and burchard 2003 within the da model two outer and eight inner loops were used to ensure optimal minimization of the cost function j during our experiment 1 october 2014 30 september 2015 the 4d var psas approach moore et al 2011b was applied to the simulation splitting the one year simulation into 91 four day assimilation cycles each starting from the previous cycle using saved initial conditions this window cycling was needed to insure validity of the tangent linear model assumption powell et al 2008 within the 4 day window the window length of 4 days was determined using multiple tangent linear model simulations propagating perturbations forward in time as in the da and computing appropriate spatial correlations in time with fully nonlinear model solutions propagating the exactly same perturbations when correlation values begin to decay linear assumption is no longer valid in setting the assimilation window moreover high nonlinearity usually occurring inside vertical turbulent scheme was not computed inside tangent linear model but instead it was saved during the first nonlinear model integration as spatial and temporal variable vertical viscosity and diffusivity coefficients and then used inside tangent linear and adjoint models within each cycle to compare the performance of the da analysis to that of the non assimilative nonlinear model three experiments were undertaken 1 a non assimilative nonlinear simulation hereafter called the baseline simulation 2 a non assimilative nonlinear simulation initiated by the previous assimilation 4 day cycle hereafter called the background simulation and 3 a fully assimilative nonlinear simulation that used all available observations during the 4 days assimilation cycle hereafter called the analysis simulation 3 observations the observational period ranged from 1 october 2014 to 30 september 2015 with more than 15 million high resolution observations used in the da most of which were sea surface temperatures sst measured by satellite radiometers and surface ocean currents measured with high frequency hf radars in addition the following in situ data has been used for the da 1 vertical temperature and salinity profiles from various ocean platforms argo profiling floats shipborne yo yo profiler autonomous glider conductivity temperature depth ctd probes and constant depth moorings and 2 vertical current profiles from five moored acoustic doppler current profilers adcp fig 2 a large number of observations came from the nadex 2015 experiment described by vilibić et al 2018 each observation has been quality checked and mapped to the model grid using the seapy python package https github com powellb seapy creating so called super observations as a standard input for the 4d var da system the process of creating super observations involves spatially and temporally aggregating observations all of the observations of the same type that are contained in the same model grid cell and 5 min time interval are averaged to produce super observation computed mean value and mean spatial temporal location was assigned as a single time cell value for the observation type and location variance determined during the aggregation was used for estimating the error of representativeness filling the corresponding observation error matrix r we used the larger value between the specific instrument errors and computed variance during the aggregation an independent set of 85 ctd stations in total 16 591 depth measurements mostly from the eastern region of the adriatic sea fig 2 was used for validation of the 4d var da model performance 3 1 satellite sst data we used l2p granule swath sst data from the modis aqua platform at the native resolution of 1 km available from nasa jet propulsion laboratory jpl obpg rsmas 2006 data consisting of up to 2 swaths per day were retrieved for the adriatic sea region for the duration of the experiment resulting in a total of 750 scenes using the provided quality flags qf we used only the best quality data qf 5 and those observations at least 10 km away from the coast or an open boundary depending on the specific scene number of useful raw data varied between 1000 and 151 000 averaging 30 000 in addition to the modis aqua data we used the avhrr l3c mono sensor gridded product only from night scenes e u copernicus marine service information http marine copernicus eu and applied the same selection criteria as above we chose only night scenes as they were not affected by diurnal warming the model was not fully capable of representing diurnal heating due to the variable sigma coordinate depth of the first surface layer recent advances in roms modeling and the new vertical layer distribution scheme might help with this issue souza et al 2015 but were not used in the study in total we assimilated approx 5 2 million gridded sst data from l3c and approx 5 1 million gridded sst data from l2p modis aqua fig 2 color represents total number of assimilated modis sst values for each model grid cell 3 2 in situ temperature and salinity data vertical profiles of temperature and salinity were obtained by shipborne ctd measurements at 66 stations 7898 samples in the northern adriatic and were used in the da fig 2 black circles shipborne ctd measurements collected along the entire eastern adriatic sea at 85 stations 16 591 ctd samples fig 2 black stars were used exclusively for model validation all ctd measurements were carried out with regularly calibrated seabird sbe 19 and sbe 25 probes with an accuracy of at least 0 005 c for temperature and 0 001 for salinity the data from two argo profiling floats id 6901826 and 6901827 drifting in the deep sap between 1 october 2014 and 30 september 2015 were used in the da fig 2 black pluses during the nadex 2015 experiment vilibić et al 2018 four moored stations were deployed between november 2014 and august 2015 in the coastal northeastern adriatic fig 2 red squares equipped with ctd sbe16 data loggers measuring bottom temperature and salinity at 10 min intervals one adcp was moored in the hf radar domain area from december 2014 to july 2015 fig 2 blue square measuring ocean temperature at the bottom along with a vertical profile of ocean currents in addition the nadex experiment included two mobile ocean platforms for measuring temperature and salinity a slocum glider was deployed between 24 and 27 february 2015 in front of kvarner bay fig 2 yellow line kokkini et al 2017 while a towed yo yo profiler was operated in the same region between 19 and 20 march 2015 fig 2 blue line 3 3 adcp data there were 10 teledyne rdi adcp stations deployed during the nadex experiment in the coastal northeastern and middle adriatic we used current data from 5 stations in the da experiment fig 2 4 red and one blue squares the remaining 5 stations were moored in very narrow channels that were not properly resolved with the 2 km roms model grid and were therefore not used the adcp data were assimilated as hourly averaged values to minimize the effect of bad quality data present at the original sampling interval 10 or 15 min the vertical profiles for each of horizontal current components were de tided the adcp configuration used a fine vertical cell size 1 or 2 m depending on the site depth and a relatively small number of pings 100 120 pings 10 or 15 min to save battery for a long term deployment providing instrument error close to 0 05 m s altogether 654 912 east and north current components were taken into the da experiment prescribed observational error was taken as the larger value between aggregated super observations variance and estimated adcp measurement error 0 05 m s 3 4 hf radar surface currents data two wera hf radars operating at 26 275 mhz with a 150 khz bandwidth were installed in the middle adriatic in march 2014 covering the area between the islands of vis šolta and hvar fig 2 green dots half hourly de tided surface currents over the 2 2 km grid were used in the da prior to assimilation the hf radar data were quality checked using the procedures described by gomez et al 2014 and only the data with the best qf were used a winter storm damaged and shut down the equipment from 30 january 2015 but radar operations were restored at the beginning of may 2015 during the mapping from the hf radar grid to the roms model grid the creation of the super observations the variance was computed and used to prescribe observation errors for the da overall during the year long experiment we assimilated a 5 2 million observations of gridded sst data from l3c b 5 1 million of gridded sst data from l2p modis aqua c shipborne ctd measurements at 66 stations in total 7898 samples d adcp data from 5 stations in total 654 912 east and north current components and e half hourly hf radar surface current data in total 4 4 million of gridded east and north surface current components 4 results 4 1 cost function during the year long da experiment applied model minimization procedure reduced observation to model discrepancy scaled with appropriate observation error covariance matrix j o inside the cost function j in eq 1 fig 3a and at the same time penalizing mismatch with the model background j m in the eq 1 and fig 3b for details see broquet et al 2011 moore et al 2009 2011a b overall the mismatch between the model and the observations j o was reduced approximately by half fig 3c black line note that it is also a function of the number of assimilated observations however the mismatch does vary with different assimilation cycles falling between 30 and 70 sst and hf radar surface currents apparently contributed the most to the j o part of the cost function fig 4a both in the background and analysis simulations however when scaling contributions to the j o with the total number of used observations it appears that ctd observations for example when present in specific assimilation cycle contributed between 37 and 68 of the j o cost function while sst contributed only about 17 this may allow future reductions in the use of vast numbers of sst observations as their contribution to the innovation vector is relatively modest some observing platforms were active in data collection for a few days only covering just one da cycle yet contributed significantly to the cost function in these cycles an example is the glider fig 4b light blue color which operated for a few days in the area where the northern adriatic front is normally present in february kokkini et al 2017 observation to model difference for the glider data in the baseline model was particularly pronounced with the model overshooting the temperature up to 2 c vilibić et al 2018 a significant contribution to the observational part of the cost function also came from adcp data due to positioning in a complex coastal region where quality of the model reproduction is limited by its resolution by contrast the contribution of argo float data was found to be low argo floats were profiling in the deep open ocean area of the sap which was far better reproduced by simulations than shallow coastal regions when operating half hourly hf radar data covered a relatively small coastal area but had frequent temporal resolution so their contribution to the j o cost function was found to be significant simply because there were many of them the observation related cost function has a noteworthy annual change fig 3a with minimum values occurring in late autumn october november 2014 coinciding with the breakdown of the seasonal pycnocline and the homogenization of the water column buljan and zore armanda 1976 artegiani et al 1997 it is low during wintertime when the hf radars were not operating and clouds masked sst observations the cost function increases during specific cycles peaking in two cycles between mid february and mid march 2015 fig 4b just after the pronounced bora episodes vilibić et al 2018 which reached their maxima in the area where most in situ measurements were taken coastal northeastern adriatic the cost function has its highest values during summer particularly for the background simulation as there is a large number of available observations large values are evident in the analysis because the shallow thermocline and the respective upper layer dynamics are probably not well reproduced with a coarse vertical resolution of only 20 sigma levels even though we used an increased vertical resolution near the surface however the cost function decreases substantially with the da in the analysis simulation particularly during the periods in which the background run performed the worst e g beginning of june 2015 deviations from the model background state are penalized inside j m fig 3b which shows a different annual distribution it is the largest in the winter period dec mar when system needs to modify ocean dynamics the most in order to get closer to the observations total cost function j during each experiment cycle is simply the sum of the j o and j m i e sum of fig 3a and b 4 2 temperature and salinity the assimilation results in a considerable reduction in variance and bias especially for sst which is one of the major contributors in the j o cost function fig 4 the baseline background and analysis simulations have domain averaged mean biases of 0 4 c 0 1 c and 0 01 c respectively fig 5 spatially the largest bias in the non assimilative baseline simulation is located in the northern and central regions of the adriatic sea peaking in front of the po river fig 5 these regions are shallow with fresh waters at the surface and respond faster to the atmospheric forcing e g heating during summer also a large positive sst bias is present in the coastal eastern area of the sap where the warm and saline eac is entering the adriatic orlić et al 1992 artegiani et al 1997 while the positive sst bias is rather small in the center of the sap interestingly the bias is negative in the eastern coastal regions of the northern adriatic which is largely a result of an underestimated wintertime cooling driven by strong bora winds peaking in that area vilibić et al 2018 the background simulation exhibits similar but much weaker spatial bias structures than the baseline solution while small patchy positive and negative biases are present over the adriatic in the analysis run similarly to bias the largest sst rmse of 0 9 c is found in the baseline simulation fig 6a equaling 0 7 c and 0 5 c in the background fig 6b and analysis fig 6c simulations respectively the high sst rmse values diminish in the analysis simulation revealing the capacity of the da to properly reduce model to data mismatch in the adriatic sea the largest baseline simulation sst rmse is present in the northern adriatic off the po river but also in the coastal and frontal regions e g in the wac that flows southeastward along western adriatic shoreline and is characterized by lower salinity artegiani et al 1997 in the background simulation sst rmse remains high off the po river and albanian rivers only as this rmse grows in one da cycle this indicates a rapid development of errors in the model in areas off the largest adriatic rivers as river plumes may change in a short time kourafalou 1999 note that we used climatological values to represent 41 fresh river inflows but did not change the ambient temperature as those data were not available janeković et al 2014 year long mean sst in the adriatic sea from the analysis simulation is presented in fig 7a all well known features as defined by orlić et al 1992 and artegiani et al 1997 are embedded in the sst distribution i sst maximum along the northern and eastern perimeter of the sap where eac brings warm waters from the ionian sea ii a narrow coastal strip of colder surface waters related to the western adriatic current extending from the northern adriatic along the western coast to the southern adriatic and iii lower sst in coastal waters along the northeastern adriatic which are separated from the open adriatic by numerous islands and affected by orographically driven local bora wind however the da warms up the surface of the most of the adriatic fig 7b particularly in the northern adriatic and in the coastal strip of the southeastern adriatic at the same time the center of the sap differs little between the assimilation and baseline simulations by contrast kvarner region in the coastal northeastern adriatic and the coastal strip between the bay of manfredonia and bari in the southern adriatic have been cooled by the da indicating that the cooling processes are not properly reproduced in these coastal regions and in the atmospheric model used to force the ocean for the assimilated ctd measurements which were mostly carried out in the shallow northern adriatic fig 2 black circles salinity rmse has been reduced by 50 the rmse for the baseline background and analysis simulations was 0 75 0 81 and 0 39 respectively however there was no reduction in temperature rmse 1 2 c 1 5 c 1 4 c for the baseline background and analysis simulations respectively this was presumably a consequence of the domain wide sst data that dominated in the cost function minimization whilst assimilated ctd measurements were exclusively made in the northern shallow adriatic less than 50 m depth yet validation of simulations on the independent ctd measurements from 85 stations in the deeper regions of the eastern adriatic observation depths up to 270 m fig 2 black results in a reduction of the bias and rmse for temperature table 1 the analysis simulation shows a bias that is almost 3 times lower than the baseline simulation for temperature while the respective rmse has been reduced by about 20 however in the case of salinity analysis results did not show any improvement over the baseline solution 4 3 currents and circulation the analysis simulation assimilated 4 4 million of gridded surface currents measurements north and east components obtained by the hf radars overall the da reduced rmse table 2 to o 0 1 m s while bias was already small the reduction of rmse is significant for both the along and the across basin components namely by 60 in the analysis simulation with respect to the baseline simulations 0 08 vs 0 13 m s average correlation between analysis and hf radar surface currents equaled 0 62 and 0 78 for the across and along basin directions respectively in the case of baseline simulation the correlation was 0 27 and 0 41 for across and along directions fig 8 yet the rmse and correlation changed with time fig 8 presumably due to the variability of the northwesterly eac orlić et al 2006 the da also managed to decrease the bias and rmse for horizontal current components measured at discrete depths and adcp stations moored in complex coastal regions table 2 where an exchange between open adriatic and coastal waters occurs vilibić et al 2018 in total 654 912 velocity vectors originating from 5 moored stations were mapped onto 20 vertical model layers and hourly means the bias and rmse were small before assimilation 0 001 m s and 0 07 m s respectively close to the standard deviation of the time series 0 05 m s the assimilation practically removed the mean bias while reducing the rmse for about 11 across basin direction and 14 along basin direction overall the average surface currents resembled the circulation regimes previously described in the adriatic fig 9a the most prominent of these include the wac which peaks at 40 cm s at the gargano promontory and in the southern adriatic and the eac which crosses the palagruža sill off the middle adriatic islands and then follows the isobaths of the jabuka pit martin et al 2009 however the da slightly modified these surface circulation regimes fig 9b for example the eac strengthened in southern coastal regions while the cyclonic circulation weakened in the central part of the sap i e the cyclonic circulation became narrower stronger and confined to the coasts the implication is an enlargement of the central sap area where open ocean convection is known to occur gačić et al 2002 vilibić and šantić 2008 thus presumably impacting the production of dense waters the same may be seen along the perimeter of the jabuka pit the analysis simulation shows a weakened cyclonic circulation around the pit changes can be also seen in the wac where most of the wac strengthens near the coast while weakening at its outer edges a counterclockwise difference in surface currents between analysis and baseline simulations may also be seen along the eastern shores of the northern adriatic indicating a weakening of the cyclonic circulation in that region as in the sap such a weakening may affect the rates of the dense water formation occurring in the northern adriatic bergamasco et al 1999 mihanović et al 2013 benetazzo et al 2014 to further investigate differences between simulations we computed year long mean transports along the five transects fig 10 interestingly the largest difference in surface currents found in the sap where da suggests a weaker cyclonic gyre fig 9b was not present in the mean transport fig 10 bottom transect a maximal value of 40 m2 s on the eastern side compared well to the baseline simulation for the same region western regions of sap gyre show a similar picture the da slightly reducing transport and having the most pronounced difference 100 km from the italian coast similarly influx from the southern adriatic into the middle adriatic over the palagruža sill fig 1 shows little difference between all three simulations with slightly stronger outflow of the wac along the western side in the case of da in the middle adriatic second transect from the top fig 10 the da simulation exhibits slightly stronger wac at the western side of the adriatic when compared to the baseline simulation which is compensated by the eac along the eastern side the largest relative difference in transport is in the northern adriatic along the eastern coastal regions top transect close to istria where da reduces along coast transport and moves it into the central part of northern adriatic those fine scale adjustments found in the da simulations could possibly impact other bio chemical processes strongly dependent on the physical oceanography background fields e g turchetto et al 2012 batistić et al 2014 4 4 surface and lateral boundary conditions differences between the analysis and baseline simulations were shaped by different initial conditions and different imposed forcings between those simulations both at the sea surface control vectors for atmosphere heat salt and wind stress and at the open boundary tracers free surface and momentum increments yearly mean across and along basin wind stress corrections fig 11a b were mainly applied close to the hf radar region as the most effective way to bring analysis closer to the observations strong but sporadic adjustments in wintertime mostly showed the bora wind pathways and were dominated by two banners of maximum stress correction the narrower northern banner where the bora wind maximum was occurring resembles the senj jet where the bora can blow with hurricane force within the channels dorman et al 2007 grisogono and belušić 2009 the broader southern maximum matched the sukošan jet which normally results in extensive heat loss off the middle adriatic islands janeković et al 2014 and directly influences the hf radar region modeling ocean dynamics induced by strong bora wind is problematic if using uncoupled and or low resolution atmospheric model forcing fields as coupled models correct fluxes and winds during severe bora episodes pullen et al 2006 2007 ličer et al 2016 along basin wind stress corrections which are influenced by the strong along basin sirocco wind lionello et al 2012 pomaro et al 2017 are mostly restricted to the middle adriatic fig 11b and reducing wind stress as a consequence the assimilation lowers heat loss and surface cooling in these areas fig 11c otherwise heat flux increases in the analysis simulation peaking in the central part of the southern adriatic there were noticeable and subtle open boundary condition differences between the analysis and baseline simulations at the lateral model boundary located in the otranto strait the differences were relatively small for salinity up to 0 05 fig 12a while ranging up to 0 25 c for temperature fig 12b the largest da correction in salinity was in the intermediate layer 50 150 m where the da increased the salinity therefore forcing the model to properly estimate the inflow of the liw into the adriatic in contrast salinity decreased at the surface in the analysis simulation in the subsurface layer up to 50 m temperature increased in the analysis simulation along central and eastern sections of the lateral boundary at depths between 150 and 400 m a small decrease in temperature in the analysis simulation was present where the deeper segment of the liw was flowing into the adriatic gačić et al 1996 these are important implications from a biological and chemical point of view as inputs via boundary conditions 5 discussion and conclusions until now reproducing the dynamics of the adriatic at high resolution has been predominantly achieved by ocean models forced by mesoscale atmospheric models e g bergamasco et al 1999 beg paklar et al 2001 or coupled atmosphere ocean models e g loglisci et al 2004 pullen et al 2006 2007 ličer et al 2016 some of them using a simple bias correction for improving the model performance e g benetazzo et al 2014 to improve the model dynamics we implemented a state of the art assimilation technique the largest differences in current velocity between model simulations with and without assimilation were obtained for the rim surface currents around the adriatic depressions and along the narrow coastal region in the front of istria east coast of northern adriatic during a fully assimilative simulation the surface portion of cyclonic gyre around the sap is confined towards the perimeter enlarging the area with low currents inside the gyre this may affect dense water formation during the wintertime gačić et al 2002 potentially changing the rate of modeled dense water generation in turn changing the thermohaline circulation manca et al 2006 ashkenazy et al 2012 cardin et al 2015 and the oscillatory thermohaline pattern in the eastern mediterranean gačić et al 2010 mihanović et al 2015 as seen by the models regarding transports across the sap gyre da simulation suggested similar flow as in the baseline solution a substantial difference between assimilated and non assimilated model results also occurs in the northern adriatic off the po river delta where the non assimilative model is too cold this may be a result of the introduction of riverine inputs into the model without river temperature information for example we added input from the largest adriatic river the po river only as a fresh water source with neutral temperature janeković et al 2014 consequently heat fluxes might not be properly reproduced here which again might affect the thermohaline circulation of the shallow adriatic driven by the dense water formation on the shelf beg paklar et al 2001 mihanović et al 2013 the third example of improving the adriatic dynamics is the correction of an overheating of the coastal area in the northeastern adriatic seen in non assimilative simulation this may prevent or weaken the dense water formation which occurs in this area characterized by the maximum of the dry and cold bora wind events grisogono and belušić 2009 janeković et al 2014 overall the 4d var da has improved our understanding of a number of processes which occur in the adriatic sea allowing for their proper quantification in the future similarly the 4d var da resulted in better estimates of surface boundary conditions where the largest correction was for the wind stress as the most effective mechanism for minimizing the difference between the model and observed hf radar surface circulation during the winter spring season corrections were driven by the bora cold wind events the bora driven wind stress is responsible for strong downwind ocean currents up to 1 m s in the senj jet martin et al 2006 precisely where the 4d var wind stress corrections are important the senj jet together with the trieste jet drives the bipole cyclone anticyclone circulation in the northern adriatic zore armanda and gačić 1987 kuzmić et al 2006 delimiting the area where dense water is formed during wintertime thus the introduction of a proper wind stress component is crucial for a more accurate reproduction of the dense water generation these corrections reflect a handicap of the bora dynamics in the aladin hr model which with a horizontal resolution of 8 km for heat fluxes and 2 km for winds cannot resolve bora driven jet changes vortices and submesoscale features that are known to appear during the severe bora wind episodes kuzmić et al 2015 the correction in lateral boundary conditions fig 12 were reminiscent of the problems of larger outer models used to provide boundary conditions for local models here the areg forecasting system data were adjusted to reproduce the inflow of surface waters and the top of the levantine intermediate water both located in the upper 200 m in the otranto strait boundary this might indicate an improper introduction of rivers in the outer model and inaccuracies in the atmospheric forcing which are not fully resolved at the sea surface through the operational assimilation of the mediterranean forecasting system tonani et al 2009 although the majority of assimilated data were satellite sst and hf radar measurements in situ observations encompassing the whole water column contributed significantly to the minimization of the cost function if scaled with number of observations assimilation of ctd data has been already found important for improving intermediate and deep ocean dynamics lee et al 2018 this also applied to the argo profiles broquet et al 2011 fragoso et al 2016 but in our study only two argo profilers were used and they were restricted to the deep sap only therefore they contributed little to the cost function hf radar measurements contributed substantially to the cost function and their assimilation is carried out regularly in coastal regions zhang et al 2010 matthews et al 2012 sperrevik et al 2015 souza et al 2015 here hf radar measurements encompassed a relatively small marginal sub basin area but were used frequently in time at 30 min intervals similarly one glider crossed over the northern adriatic front that was poorly captured by the non assimilative model thereby contributing significantly to the cost function despite being restricted to just one assimilation cycle of 4 days the area characterized by the northern adriatic front has been recognized as important feature through a number of past efforts zore armanda 1983 lee et al 2005 kokkini et al 2017 vilibić et al 2018 clearly an extension of glider measurements over a longer period even during few weeks would greatly improve our understanding of the northern adriatic dynamics furthermore our study highlights the importance of in situ measurements for improving our understanding of ocean dynamics through the da the da model skill compared against background solution indicates the predictability skill of da for each of the assimilation 4 day windows this is defined as in zhang et al 2010 3 skill 1 rmse da rmse b where rmse da stands for data assimilation rmse and rmse b for background i e before data assimilation rmse all scaled with observation s errors by computing the skill for the different types of observations and observing platforms we can measure specifically where da is performing better i e having smaller rmse than the background simulation in our case the da skill was consistently better across glider observations 30 for temperature and 39 for salinity yo yo towed ctd 36 for temperature ctd stations 38 for salinity sst modis 27 l3 22 hf radar 30 for across and 36 for along basin surface current components and overall adcp average of 10 during the whole year long experiment additionally these results point to a potential operational capability of the da application as its skill outperforms non assimilative model configuration all the da corrections to the control vector atmospheric forcing initial state and boundary conditions appear physical and in the right location and direction overall results are in general agreement with the adriatic sea dynamics yet improving many fine scale features which could have profound implications on the long term climatology dense water formation in the northern regions deep water convection in the southern adriatic or inflow through the boundary conditions to quantify such an impact further research is foreseen credit authorship contribution statement i janeković conceptualization

23991,an ice shelf module is implemented into the unstructured grid three dimensional primitive equation finite volume community ocean model fvcom for studying ice shelf ocean interactions along the complex and irregular geometry of the coastal ocean pressure gradient errors associated with the representation of the ice shelf geometry in the model s terrain following vertical coordinate are investigated showing that locally increasing resolution efficiently reduces spurious currents near the steeply sloping grounding lines and ice fronts simulated basal melting and cavity circulation are compared within the framework of the on going 2nd ice shelf ocean model intercomparison project isomip sensitivity studies are carried out showing that the melt rate magnitude and distribution depends on properly resolving the slope at the ice base in combination with the choice of vertical mixing scheme idealized geometry simulations show that local effects of small scale topographic features at the ice base may dominate the melt rate distribution and buoyancy fluxes that drive the circulation inside the ice shelf cavity keywords fvcom ocean model ice shelf ocean interaction small scale basal features 1 introduction floating ice shelves at the coastline of greenland and antarctica constitute a key link between the ocean and the continental ice sheet they present a unique environment where several hundred meters of glacier ice overlay the ocean forming cavities with horizontal sizes ranging from a few square kilometers to the extents of coastal oceans their interaction with the underlying ocean has gained attention because basal melting of ice shelves may lead to ice flow acceleration and discharge due to reduced buttressing of the grounded inland ice shepherd et al 2002 gudmundsson 2013 in addition glacial meltwater is important for sea ice formation water mass transformation as well as deep water formation in the regional ocean and likely has an impact on the global ocean beckmann and goosse 2003 hellmer 2004 hellmer et al 2017 therefore understanding of ice shelf ocean interactions is necessary to explain past and current changes in ocean and ice sheets at high latitudes and to predict future changes as well as their impact on global sea level and the climate system direct investigations of water masses and dynamic processes beneath ice shelves are logistically challenging and numerical models are invaluable for understanding the processes governing basal melting several three dimensional primitive equation ocean models are nowadays incorporating ice shelf ocean interactions see dinniman et al 2016 and asay davis et al 2017 for an overview and many major ice shelf cavities and adjacent coastal oceans around antarctica and greenland have been simulated hellmer 2004 jenkins et al 2004 hattermann et al 2014 nakayama et al 2014 schodlok et al 2012 shroyer et al 2017 usually these models are run at spatial resolutions that focus on the regional to large scale circulations representing the ice draft as a whole smoothed piece and ignoring small scale features however recent studies show that kilometer scale and even meter scale variations in melt rates are a principal component of the ice ocean interactions langley et al 2014a berger et al 2017 channel like basal features are abundant on most ice shelves alley et al 2016 and impacts of small scale basal features on melt rates have been reported for prominent examples of rapidly melting ice shelves in west antarctica and northwestern greenland dutrieux et al 2013 as well as for colder cavities around east antarctica langley et al 2014b furthermore ice dynamically relevant thickness changes often occur in narrow regions near the steeply sloping grounding lines reese et al 2018 simulating the effects of those features on basal melting requires model resolution at hundred meter scale or smaller sergienko 2013 dutrieux et al 2013 which is still challenging even for dedicated regional simulations one way to address this problem is to use unstructured computational grids which allow to increase the resolution in selected regions of the model domain and accurately match complicated coastal and ice shelf geometries only a few unstructured grid models are presently capable of simulating the circulation within ice shelf cavities the finite element sea ice ocean model fesom provides large scale solutions with increased resolution in the antarctic timmermann et al 2012 while high resolution non hydrostatic fluidity icom simulations have been presented to investigate the overturning circulation in an idealized basal channel kimura et al 2013 jordan et al 2014 recently the ocean component of the energy exascale earth system model e3sm has been augmented to include ice shelf cavities petersen et al 2016 being the first unstructured finite volume code with that capability furthermore there exists generally little literature about the implementation of the ice shelf cavities within an unstructured grid model geometry in this study we incorporate ice shelf cavities into the unstructured grid finite volume community ocean model fvcom chen et al 2007 the aim is to develop a model that is capable of simulating ice shelf ocean interactions with particular focus on resolving small scale features of the basal topography and near the grounding line combining the finite volume approach with a horizontal mesh of non overlapping unstructured triangles fvcom has the advantages in geometric flexibility as well as computational efficiency the model has been successfully applied to studies of flow in a number of estuaries and coastal oceans that are characterized by complex irregular geometry and steeply sloping bottom topography see http fvcom smast umassd edu for an overview being originally designed for coastal applications the code incorporates many features that are useful for our purpose including routines for open boundary nesting as well as tidal and river runoff forcing it also features a non hydrostatic solver which will be suitable for high resolution studies of buoyant ice shelf water plumes in channel geometries and near the grounding lines an unstructured grid sea ice component is also available and has been applied and validated in the arctic chen et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 making the model suitable for polar applications in the vertical fvcom uses a generalized terrain following coordinate that allows for different stretching functions in different parts of the domain and accounts for changes in model morphology at runtime as part of a sediment module to incorporate the ice shelf cavities in this formulation we modified the coordinate transformation such that the model surface layer is subducted to a finite depth along ice shelf draft with the remaining layers being compressed accordingly this paper only presents results for ice shelf cavity geometries that are fixed in time however together with a robust wetting and drying scheme the architecture of fvcom provides an ideal starting point for fully coupled simulations of time evolving ice shelf cavities the terrain following coordinates come with the advantage of smoothly representing the sloping ice base and preserving vertical resolution in the deeper parts of the cavities both known problems when representing ice shelf cavities in z coordinate models losch 2008 at the same time the terrain following coordinate is limiting the capability of representing steeply sloping topography due to the occurrence of pressure gradient errors pges associated with the discretization of the vertical coordinate transformation beckmann 1998 while this is a severe limitation for simulating ice shelf cavities with regular grid models dinniman et al 2007 hattermann et al 2014 the unstructured grid method allows to partially compensate for pges near the virtually vertical ice front and at steep slopes by increasing the horizontal resolution albeit not negligible the additional computational cost is still smaller than for running a regular grid model at comparable resolution while often the relevant processes require increased resolution in the areas of steep topography anyways in addition to the derivation of the pressure gradient formulation that is used to include the effect of the ice shelf cavity in the unstructured grid finite volume method of fvcom this paper presents a set of idealized experiments that illustrate the capabilities of the new model implementation firstly a variation of the classical seamount experiment is used to compare the effect of pges due to sloping ice draft and bottom topography secondly the isomip idealized ice shelf cavity configuration asay davis et al 2016 is used to validate the dynamics and thermodynamics of the ice shelf code and to demonstrate the advantage of fvcom s variable grid resolution in accurately resolving the ice shelf geometry near the ice front and at the grounding line thirdly an idealized ice shelf basal channel configuration is used to explore the effects of small scale basal topography for the cavity circulation finally a model version that is augmented with the capability of including static ice shelf cavities is made freely available to everyone in the fvcom users community http dx doi org 10 17632 m6g4c3hm9m 1 the remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows section 2 describes the modifications necessary to include ice shelf dynamics into the standard fvcom code section 3 presents results of pges sensitivity tests for the inclusion of ice shelf cavities section 4 evaluates the model performance based on the isomip test experiments section 5 presents results of idealized modeling with small scale features conclusions and discussions are presented in section 6 2 model description ice shelf ocean interaction in an unstructured grid model 2 1 dynamics the weight of the ice shelf exerts an additional pressure on the water column and the main modification in fvcom s code infrastructure is to adjust the computation of the horizontal pressure gradient forces to account for the effect of the ice shelf topography as the terrain following layers subduct below the ice herein it is assumed that the depth of the ice ocean interface is prescribed e g an observed ice draft depth and that the ice is freely floating on the ocean i e that bridging stresses in the ice can be neglected at the ocean grid scale this approximation is commonly applied by other models and suffices for most applications although special cases have been reported where mechanical interactions through tidal bending become important rosier and gudmundsson 2018 for simplicity the derivation is presented in a classical σ layer formulation i e a vertically uniform layer thickness distribution although the method easily generalizes to any arbitrary stretching functions that can be applied in model the hydrostatic balance equation in the ocean is 1 p z ρ g with the hydrostatic pressure p the gravity acceleration g and the density of sea water ρ in the open ocean the hydrostatic pressure at a depth of z is obtained by integrating eq 1 from z to sea surface as 2 p z η ρ g d z with the sea surface elevation η while in the ice cavity the pressure at a depth of z is obtained by integrating eq 1 from z to the ice shelf base as 3 p p i z z i η ρ g d z where p i is the pressure at the ice shelf base exerted by the weight of the ice z i is the ice shelf draft which is the portion of the ice shelf below mean sea level and differs from the total ice shelf thickness due to the density difference between the ice shelf and the ocean water note that η is now the sea surface elevation with respect to a prescribed ice shelf draft this absolute pressure does not appear explicitly in fvcom instead a jacobian flux formulation is used to represent the horizontal pressure gradient force separating the contribution of the dynamic surface elevation 1 1 this separation is necessary in fvcom s explicit mode split method to compute the baroclininc and barotropic pressure gradient forces on different time steps since the same formulation is used also in the available semi implicit method both methods are capable of including the ice shelf cavities and applying the leibniz rule to differentiate the integral the pressure gradient can be expressed as 4 p ρ i o g η g z z i η ρ d z p i g ρ i o z i where ρ i o is the ocean density at the ice ocean interface for a rest state where the ice is in isostatic equilibrium with the ocean the two last terms on the right hand side cancel each other and the pressure gradient at the ice base vanishes floating condition however for a time evolving solution that deviates from the rest state a restoring force will arise that accelerates either the ice or the ocean through pressure gradients at the ice ocean interface assuming that these forces do not alter the ice shelf geometry they can be estimated following dinniman et al 2007 by approximating the water mass that is replaced by the ice in the rest state represented by the density at the top level of the ocean model ρ t o p minus an assumed constant linear dependence of the density with depth c ρ z with this approximation p i can be expressed as 5 p i g ρ t o p 0 5 c z i z i inserting eq 5 into eq 4 and assuming ρ i o ρ t o p gives 6 p ρ i o g η g z z i η ρ d z g z i ρ i o c g z i z i the term in parentheses is the additional pressure term apt induced from horizontal density gradients the accuracy of this formulation depends on the accuracy of the approximation of the ambient ocean by a constant density gradient c defining this constant requires a priori knowledge of the density distribution in the model solution and can be optimized for regional and idealized applications while other studies have suggested global constants that are representative from a large scale perspective dinniman et al 2007 mathiot et al 2017 to illustrate the formulation of the x direction component of the pressure gradient force under the terrain following coordinate transformation eq 6 can be written as 7 p x ρ i o g η x g z z i η ρ x d z g z i ρ i o x c g z i z i x note that the gradient operator in both eqs 6 and 7 is performed in z coordinates the σ transformation of the horizontal density gradients needs to be modified accordingly to take into account the correct slope of the σ layers relative to the geopotential surface due to the inclusion of the ice shelf topography the σ coordinate transformation in the ice shelf cavity can be expressed as 8 z h η z i σ z i η with the bathymetric depth h accordingly the x derivative of a variable casting in σ coordinate can be expressed as 9 x z x σ 1 h η z i σ h η z i x σ z i x η x σ performing eq 9 to all the x derivatives of eq 7 and rearranging gives 10 p x ρ 0 g η x g h η z i σ 0 ρ x d σ g h η z i x σ 0 σ ρ σ d σ g z i ρ i o x c g z i z i x g z i x σ 0 ρ σ d σ where ρ 0 is the reference density eq 10 describes the x direction pressure gradient force for the inclusion of ice shelf topography terms in the first brackets on the right hand side are already implemented in the fvcom code if we replace the water depth h η with the water column thickness h η z i the terms in the second brackets are related to the ice exerted pressure and need to be implemented into fvcom note that the first two terms in the second brackets represent the apt and disappear when the ocean is horizontally homogeneous while the third term accounts for the adjustment of the σ coordinate transformation inside the cavity the procedure is analogous in the y direction 2 2 discrete form of the ice exerted pressure gradient force in fvcom the governing equations in fvcom for momentum mass and tracers are expressed by their integral forms over individual control volumes for an illustration of the discretization see e g figure 1 in chen et al 2007 they are solved numerically by flux calculation through the volume boundaries by a finite volume scheme enforcing conservation laws in individual control volumes and the entire computational domain the horizontal velocity components are located at centroids that share the same control volume bounded by three sides of an individual triangle within a given terrain following layer the vertical velocity as well as all scalar variables are located at the nodes of the triangles sharing the same control volume enclosed by lines connecting centroids and middle points of triangle sides in surrounding triangles within a layer chen et al 2007 following the finite volume approach the terms in the second brackets of eq 10 should be integrated first vertically within a σ layer and then horizontally over a triangle element integrating the terms vertically within the σ layer from depth z k 1 to depth z k provides 11 z k 1 z k g z i ρ i o x c g z i z i x g z i x σ 0 ρ σ d σ d z 12 g d σ k σ k 1 z i ρ i o x c z i z i x ρ i o ρ k z i x where d h η z i and ρ k is the density within layer k integrating eq 12 horizontally over a

at the triangle center for a horizontally homogeneously stratified ocean eq 14 becomes 15 g d σ k σ k 1 ρ i o ρ k z i d y while the difference between eqs 14 and 15 accounts for the apt eq 14 is added to the baroclininc pressure gradient computation in fvcom the dynamic formulation is completed by a quadratic friction law that is applied for surface momentum boundary conditions inside the ice shelf cavity mirroring the bottom momentum boundary conditions at the seabed 2 3 thermodynamics thermodynamic forcing inside the ice shelf cavity is imposed by freezing and melting at the ice ocean interface assuming the ice shelf to be a perfect insulator between the ocean and the atmosphere this thermodynamic process can be parameterized by three fundamental equations hellmer and olbers 1989

coefficients which need case dependent tuning as will be discussed in more detail in section 4 the values of these parameters except γ t and γ s are given in table 1 the freshwater heat and salt

salinity and temperature dinniman et al 2016 3 sensitivity of pressure gradient errors the seamount and icemount experiments the terrain following coordinates used in fvcom are attractive for representing ice shelf cavities and allowing high vertical resolution near the grounding lines dinniman et al 2007 kimura et al 2013 however concerns are raised about the pges near steep topography in particular at the ice front galton fenzi 2009 the pges are essentially numerical truncation errors introduced during the coordinate transformation of the horizontal pressure gradient term mellor et al 1994 berntsen 2011 in addition to the slope of the interior layers inside the ice shelf cavity the pressure gradient force calculation also needs to account for significant slopes of the surface along the ice base which may increase the pges shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 dinniman et al 2007 3 1 geometry and model setup to assess the presence of pges related to the inclusion of ice shelf in fvcom we compare the traditional seamount experiment with a corresponding counterpart the icemount experiment the seamount experiment consists of a steep rise in bottom topography within an otherwise uniform domain that has been proven as a valuable test case for studying the sensitivity of pges in σ coordinate models beckmann and haidvogel 1993 berntsen and oey 2010 the icemount experiment imposes an ice draft that mirrors the seamount s topography over a flat bottom fig 1 shows cross sections of the geometries for both cases in the seamount case a steep symmetric mount is placed at the center of a closed domain that is 390 km long in the x direction and 290 km wide in the y direction the domain is covered by an ice shelf draft of constant thickness of 1 m and the bottom topography of the seamount is parameterized the same as that in berntsen and oey 2010 as 18 h x y h 0 1 0 0 9 e x 2 y 2 l 2 where h 0 4500 m and l 40 km in the icemount case right panel of fig 1 the bottom topography is flat and the ice draft is parameterized as 19 z i x y 0 9 h 0 e x 2 y 2 l 2 except for the geometries the two test cases use identical setups that are similar to the benchmark presented by berntsen and oey 2010 the horizontal grid resolution is 6 km defined by the distance between adjacent nodes within a uniform triangular grid and there are 40 uniformly spaced vertical σ layers the coriolis parameter is set to a constant value of 1 0 4 s 1 equivalent at a latitude of 43 3 n salinity is constant and set to 35 psu the initial temperature is prescribed as a linear function of depth as 20 t z t s t b t s z h 0 where t s 20 c and t b 5 c are the surface and bottom temperatures respectively also shown in fig 1 are cross sections of initial temperatures for both cases a linear equation of state eos is used 21 ρ ρ b 1 α t t b where ρ b 1028 kg m 3 and α 2 1161 1 0 4 c 1 although this stratification does not represent a realistic water mass distribution inside an ice shelf cavity it resembles other seamount experiments beckmann and haidvogel 1993 with c in eq 5 being chosen to yield a density difference between the surface and bottom of 3 263 kg m 3 that is close to that in berntsen and oey 2010 velocities are initialized with a white noise perturbation with a magnitude of 1 0 7 m s 1 horizontal viscosity is set to 100 m 2 s 1 while horizontal and vertical diffusivities as well as the vertical viscosity are set to zero in order to isolate the pges induced flow berntsen and oey 2010 there is no flux perpendicular to the model walls and ice shelf thermodynamics are turned off such that there is no physical forcing in addition to these two experiments an additional icemount test is performed which is identical to the standard icemount run but without the apt related to horizontally non homogeneous stratification included in the model the second parenthesis of eq 6 this allows to separate the effects of sloping geometry and the dynamic response of the restoring force by the ice shelf pressure under the terrain following coordinate transformation 3 2 results three diagnostic measures the maximum velocity v m a x the volume averaged kinetic energy e k i n and the sea surface elevation are monitored in the pges sensitivity tests throughout this study fig 2 displays time series of the log10 of v m a x a and e k i n b for the seamount case blue curves and the icemount case red curves during the first 5 days of the simulation v m a x and e k i n from the icemount case are several orders of magnitude larger compared to the seamount case however v m a x and e k i n also show a transient increase until they reach comparable values in both experiments when approaching a quasi steady state after about 25 days of the simulation although initial pges associated with the ice topography are larger it seems that they grow to similar magnitudes in fully developed simulations inside sloping ice shelf cavities and in simulations with comparable bottom slopes also presented in fig 2 are the results from the icemount case without the apt green curves although the experiment also reaches a quasi steady state after about 25 days the v m a x and e k i n grow much faster after the model initialization and converge to values that are several orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding results from the icemount case with the apt being included except during the first day of the simulation two things can be learned from this experiment firstly the results show that the pges perturbation arising from the terrain following coordinate transformation leads to a numerical instability under the ice shelf geometry while the homogeneous initial stratification should not lead to any circulation under the ice i e the apt vanishes and there are not pressure gradients at the ice base the pges related flow leads to anomalies in the hydrography amplifying the development of baroclinic currents that grow in absence of the stabilizing apt this development can be seen in fig 3 which shows the evolution of sea surface elevation in the first 10 days for all the three cases while the standard seamount icemount case develops a stable anti clockwise clockwise gyre circulation around the mount a multipolar circulation pattern quickly grows to large amplitudes around the icemount case without apt consistent with the results shown in fig 2 the gyre from the icemount case is stronger than that from the seamount case during this early phase of the simulation while both cases show gyres of similar magnitude that do not grow significantly with time after about 25 days not shown secondly the smaller initial noise prior to the unstable growth of the case without apt compared to the standard icemount case suggest that the additional terms due to the altered coordinate transformation eq 15 are not the dominant error source that cause the difference between the icemount and seamount solution instead the additional pges in the icemount case seem to stem from the discretization of the apt shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 pointed out the importance of accurately representing the surface layer density in the non aligned vertical coordinates and one difference between eqs 14 and 15 is the additional integration of the density at the ice ocean interface around the control volume first term in curly brackets in eq 14 in our implementation ρ io is taken to be the value of the uppermost σ layer which in the vertical discretization of fvcom is located in the center of the layer and not at the top of it shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 proposed a more accurate representation of the model surface density their eq a20 but we find that this method did not reduce the pges in our icemount experiments we assume that the initial difference in pges between the icemount experiments with and without apt may be related to inaccuracies of the horizontal representation of ρ io at the node centers in the integration in eq 14 but answering this question will require further investigations however since the pges in the icemount and seamount cases converge to similar magnitudes after an initial growth period we conclude that the pressure gradient formulation for a sloping ice base in the vertical coordinate transformation for fvcom provides robust results 4 fvcom isomip ocean0 experiments recently the ice shelf ocean model intercomparison project second phase isomip asay davis et al 2016 has become an international effort to systematically compare different ice shelf cavity ocean models within a prescribed set of idealized experiments providing a useful framework to validate and further test the behavior of the fvcom ice shelf cavity module while the full set of the fvcom isomip experiments will be presented in a separate study this section focuses on the proposed calibration experiment that is referred to as ocean0 in asay davis et al 2016 see also table 2 in asay davis et al 2016 for an overview of all experiments of the intercomparison in the following variations of the ocean0 setup will be used to explore the combined effects of varying resolution ice shelf slope and vertical mixing on the simulated basal melting using the fvcom ice shelf cavity module 4 1 model configuration the ocean0 setup features a rectangular domain of 340 km length in north south direction with x being defined pointing northward and 80 km width in east west direction with y being defined pointing westward on an f plane at a latitude of 75 s which is partially covered by a static ice draft with the grounding line at the southern boundary at x 0 km and the ice front at about x 180 km fig 4 ocean properties are initialized with velocities at rest and with horizontally homogeneous temperature and salinity profiles that are linear functions of the water depth 22 t t 0 t b t 0 z d and 23 s s 0 s b s 0 z d where t 0 1 9 c and s 0 33 8 psu are surface temperature and salinity respectively and t b 1 0 c and s b 34 7 psu are bottom temperature and salinity respectively d 720 m is the maximum water depth a linear eos is used to prescribe density as a function of salinity and temperature as 24 ρ ρ ref 1 α lin t t ref β lin s s ref where ρ ref and t ref s ref are the reference density and temperature salinity respectively α lin β lin is the temperature expansion salinity contraction coefficient respectively with parameter values provided in table 1 being forced with relatively warm ocean temperatures this experiment reaches a quasi equilibrium with strong melting within a few months simulation time asay davis et al 2016 which makes it well suited to sensitivity and parameters studies 4 1 1 mesh refinement and pges tests among different measures proposed to reduce pges in terrain following coordinate ocean models topographic smoothing is widely applied and perhaps most feasible as it does not require modifications to the model code chu and fan 1997 berntsen 2011 in particular it is a common practice to replace the topographic step at the ice shelf front by a smooth transition in terrain following σ coordinate models although this smoothing is expected to affect the results e g by artificially reducing the potential vorticity barrier that is limiting the exchange across the ice front beckmann et al 1999 another possibility for reducing pges over steep topographic slopes is to increase the horizontal model resolution with obvious advantages of the unstructured grid method this is useful because pges are often dominated by the discretization of the relative change in water column thickness between two neighboring grid points h i and h i 1 commonly measured by the grid stiffness r x 0 h i 1 h i h i 1 h i also referred to as beckman and haidvogel number 2 2 while r x 0 is defined based on the total water column thickness the haney number r x 1 is often used to measure relative change in vertical layer thickness but for uniform σ coordinates as considered here the two measures are proportional to each other beckmann and haidvogel 1993 to this end three different ocean0 grids were designed to explore the role of horizontal resolution and topographic slope in the pges and simulated melt rates the prescribed standard configuration combines a relatively coarse grid with 2 km uniform resolution and a relatively smooth topography that is required to minimize the pges on that grid results from this so called com grid will be compared to results from a typ2 grid that retains the original steepness of the isomip topography and uses local grid refinement to reduce the pges as well as to results of a typ1 grid with local grid refinement applied to the smooth topography to discriminate the effects of ice shelf basal slope and model resolution for comparability the com and typ1 grids use almost the same topography as the isomip com configuration of the romsutas the regional ocean modelling system from the university of tasmania participant pers comm d gwyther this topography was interpolated to the romsutas ocean mask from the prescribed isomip grid and smoothed with 4th order shapiro filter to reduce the r x 0 values to a maximum value of 0 1 in addition the vertical ice front was replaced in the fvcom configuration by a linear slope of 20 km width fig 5a shows the water column thickness and grid stiffness r x 0 values of this smoothed topography and fig 5c shows the r x 0 values of the original isomip geometry both computed on a regular 1 km grid for reasons of comparison the latter shows notably steeper slopes at the ice front and near the grounding lines these fields were also used to determine the resolution of the typ1 and typ2 meshes which varies from 200 m to 2000 m and scales inversely with the r x 0 values of the respective water column thickness fields shown in fig 5a and c fig 4 illustrates the horizontal meshes and table 2 lists numbers of triangle nodes for the typ1 and typ2 grids the horizontal discretizations of the typ1 and typ2 grids differ because of the different coastlines but both have comparably increased resolution near the ice front and grounding lines where the steepest slopes occur while the typ1 topography was obtained by simply interpolating the smoothed romsutas geometry onto the fvcom unstructured mesh the typ2 topography was derived directly from the isomip geometry via a weighted average smoothing method that preserves steeper slopes where model resolution is increased in this method the isomip topography is first interpolated onto two regular grids of 200 m resolution and 2 km resolution respectively next the interpolated topography on each grid is smoothed with a 3 3 two dimensional equal weight sliding window filter to remove any noise on the grid scale finally the smoothed topographies from the two grids are interpolated onto the typ2 fvcom mesh and combined as weighted average with the averaging weight being linearly scaled by the local grid resolution this step may seem somewhat redundant since the typ2 mesh refinement was readily derived from the topography but the process assures that steepness varies smoothly at the grid scale and its description may be instructive for other applications right panels of fig 5 show rx0 values of the resulting typ1 fig 5b and typ2 fig 5d geometries computed on their respective unstructured grids showing that the locally increased resolution efficiently reduces the grid stiffness all three grids have 36 uniformly spaced vertical layers and the com and typ1 grids have a minimum water column thickness of about 22 m at the grounding line while typ2 has a minimum water column thickness of about 4 m for all three grids 60 day long pges tests without physical forcing except friction at the bottom and the ice base are performed model settings and diagnostics are similar to the icemount and seamount experiments except that horizontal mixing of momentum is scaled according to the model resolution yielding a constant horizontal viscosity of 33 33 m 2 s 1 for the com grid and a resolution scaled values ranging from 3 33 m 2 s 1 to 33 33 m 2 s 1 for the typ1 and typ2 configurations 4 1 2 transfer coefficients and vertical mixing parameterization the next set of experiments explores the effect of basal steepness and interior vertical mixing on simulated basal melting when including the thermodynamics presented in section 2 to parameterize heat and salt fluxes at the ice ocean interface a large uncertainty in using this three equation formulation is to determine general turbulent transfer coefficients γ t γ s for scaling the heat and salt fluxes through the ice ocean boundary layer holland and jenkins 1999 empirical values have been proposed based on small number of observations jenkins 2010 suggesting a constant ratio between γ t and γ s but their validity for a wider range of applications has been questioned kimura et al 2015 furthermore jenkins 1991 showed that the heat transfer at the ice ocean boundary is directly related to the slope of ice base implying that simulated melt rates in general circulation models also depend on their capability to correctly represent the steepness of the ice shelf geometry finally the thermodynamics at the ice ocean interface also depend on the numerics through which the parameterized boundary layer fluxes are linked to the ocean interior physics gwyther et al 2015 such that transfer coefficients must be evaluated in combination with the applied vertical mixing scheme of the given ocean model the isomip protocol prescribes γ s γ t 35 and proposes to calibrate the values of heat and salt transfer coefficients by tuning the ocean0 experiment to achieve a target mean melt rate of 30 2 myr 1 averaged over ice draft deeper than 300 m and over the final 6 months of 1 year simulations to gain insights into the interplay of horizontal resolution basal slope and vertical mixing a set of such γ t sensitivity experiments is performed combining the com typ1 and typ2 configurations either with constant vertical viscosity diffusivity of 1 0 3 m 2 s 1 5 1 0 5 m 2 s 1 as prescribed by the isomip common experimental design or using the mellor and yamada level 2 5 my 2 5 mellor and yamada 1982 galperin et al 1988 turbulent closure model vertical prandtl number 1 together with a constant background viscosity and diffusivity of 1 0 5 m 2 s 1 table 2 lists the 28 experiments for each configuration with varying γ t values no open ocean surface forcing is included in these thermodynamically active simulations while temperature and salinity are restored to the initial profiles in a 10 km wide zone at the northern boundary to facilitate a quasi steady equilibrium state to be reached unless stated otherwise an eddy closure parameterization smagorinsky 1963 is used in which horizontal mixing of momentum viscosity and tracers diffusivity are computed as ν h 0 5 c p ω u u x 2 v y 2 0 5 u x v y 2 and κ h 0 5 c ω ξ u x 2 v y 2 0 5 u x v y 2 here c 0 1 is a scaling constant and p 0 1 is the horizontal prandtl number ω u and ω ξ refer to the respective control element area for momentum and tracers 4 2 results 4 2 1 pges tests with different model geometries fig 6 shows time series of log10 of v m a x and e k i n for the pges test runs of the three different model configurations in the 60 day simulations maximum velocities remain below 0 05 m s 1 for both the com and typ2 runs while they remain 0 005 m s 1 for the typ1 run this suggests that a combination of smoothing and grid refinement leads to the weakest pges induced flow while the grid refinement alone yields smaller errors than the smoothing topography alone the same holds true for the comparison of e k i n fig 6b as well as for snapshots of sea surface elevation fields at day 60 for the three runs not shown fig 7 presents barotropic flow field averaged 3 3 note that proper computations of streamfunctions on unstructured grids are challenging hence here we are using matlab s streamslice function to depict the depth averaged velocities over the last 30 days of the simulation for the pges test runs the com run has much stronger spurious circulation inside the ice shelf cavity than the typ1 run confirming grid refinement leads to weaker pges induced flow also for the steeper typ2 run the pges induced spurious currents are weak over most parts of the domain except along the nearly vertical ice front where the flow magnitudes are comparable to the com run nevertheless magnitudes of the pges induced spurious motions in all three runs are small compared to the buoyancy driven circulation that is found in our ocean0 simulations which are on the order of 1 0 2 m s 1 as a result of the physical forcing in the application not shown moreover the flow lines show that the ice shelf front refracts the flow in both the com run and the typ2 run whereas for the smooth and highly resolving typ1 run streamlines are connected undisturbed across the ice front while a proper assessment of the representation of the physics at this prominent feature of the ice shelf geometry is beyond the scope of this study the comparison illustrates the trade off being made between minimizing computational error associated with terrain following coordinates on the one hand and properly representing the potential vorticity barrier that the step change in water column thickness represents to the ocean flow inside and outside the ice shelf cavity on the other hand although the typ2 setup leads to weaker pges induced flow even with steeper topography when being compared to the com setup the higher resolution will also increase the computational cost of the model which often is an important factor for the design of a specific application when using the same explicit time step 5 s and the same number of processors 128 the computation time for the typ1 grid also typ2 increases nearly by a factor of 6 compared to the com run in our setup compared to an increase in computing points by a factor of 3 additionally the high resolution setup requires shorter time stepping but we do not know the maximum possible time step ratio between the com and typ grids since our runs were not optimized for efficiency on the other hand increasing the resolution to 200 m for the entire isomip ocean0 domain would require more than 660 000 computing points which is nearly 30 times as many as for the typ grids indicating that a uniform high resolution setup would have more than one order of magnitude larger computational demands than the typ grids 4 2 2 ocean0 com basal melt rates before exploring the sensitivity of basal melting in fvcom we briefly evaluate our implementation of the ice ocean thermodynamics and their effects on the cavity circulation by comparing the fvcom ocean0 com setup with isomip results from the romsutas model despite their different horizontal discretizations the two models share similarities in topography vertical coordinates and expression for the density of water replaced by the ice for the comparison fvcom was set up with the same horizontal mixing parameterization as the romsutas model using a constant eddy viscosity diffusivity of 6 0 m 2 s 1 1 0 m 2 s 1 both models use the prescribed constant interior vertical mixing coefficients and the same transfer coefficient γ t 0 05 for parameterizing fluxes at the ice ocean interface melt rate distributions from both models and barotropic streamfunctions inside the cavity 4 4 streamfunctions for fvcom were computed after interpolating the results onto a common regular grid as is part of the prescribed isomip post processing routines averaged over the last 6 months of 1 year simulations are shown in fig 8 the magnitude and spatial distribution of basal melt rates are generally comparable between the two models melting is strongest near the deepest part of the eastern flank of the cavity around x 0 km and x 20 km showing a pattern of melting and freezing that is asymmetric around y 40 km and reflects the geostrophically controlled cavity circulation with a colder melt water diluted outflow along the western flank of the cavity some differences remain with fvcom showing a somewhat larger magnitude of melting and freezing compared to romsutas however the spread is generally within the range of the participating isomip models and likely reflects differences in model numerics for instance the vertical layer distribution together with other analyses that were carried out to check for consistent water mass transformations due to melting and freezing and general mass conservation not shown the comparison with an established and widely used ice shelf cavity model such as roms dinniman et al 2007 provides confidence that our implementation of the ice shelf module was successful and can be used for further investigations of ice shelf ocean interactions 4 2 3 melt rate sensitivity to basal slope and vertical mixing fig 9 shows the results of the 28 γ t sensitivity experiments in all simulations melt rates generally increase with larger γ t values when constant vertical mixing is applied the com typ1 and typ2 configurations yield nearly indistinguishable results with melt rates saturating at about 20 5 myr 1 in those cases melting is limited by low mixing in the interior ocean that does not supply enough heat into the surface layer to maintain larger melt when γ t increases this changes when the my 2 5 closure vertical mixing scheme is used in those simulations the vertical shear induced by buoyant melt water rising along the ice base may enhance interior mixing and melt rates keep increasing for larger γ t values the results also diverge for the different geometrical configurations with highest melt rates of 34 myr 1 at γ t 0 1 obtained for the steep typ2 topography confirming that simulated basal melting is sensitive to the resolved steepness of the ice base the smooth com and typ1 configurations yield similar melt rates of about 29 myr 1 at γ t 0 1 despite the fact that typ1 has much higher grid resolution than the com configuration showing that the melt rate increase in the typ2 configuration is not an artifact of the increased horizontal resolution alone 5 idealized modeling of ice draft with small scale features in recent years the role on basal melting and ice shelf stability of local topographical features at the ice shelf underside such as basal channels and crevasses have attracted attention rignot and steffen 2008 vaughan et al 2012 dutrieux et al 2014 stanton et al 2013 channelized basal features are being observed beneath many ice shelves alley et al 2016 with heights ranging from tens to hundreds of meters with aspect ratios between unity and about ten times larger widths than heights some channels extend several tens of kilometers in longitudinal direction traversing the ice base along and across the ice flow direction intersecting bifurcating and rendering complex networks on the ice base topography langley et al 2014b while it is obvious that the ice shelf cavity circulation interacts with the rugged basal topography the effects of local features on melting and freezing patterns and in turn the role of the ocean for the channel evolution is still not fully understood it has been shown that the presence of basal channels and small scale features influences the melt rate distribution dutrieux et al 2013 feeding back onto the local ice dynamics sergienko 2013 idealized modeling studies have provided insights to specific configurations khazendar and jenkins 2003 gladish et al 2012 millgate et al 2013 jordan et al 2014 however more realistic regional ice shelf ocean models are typically not capable of explicitly resolving local basal topography instead representing the ice draft as one smoothed piece ignoring small scale features in this section we conduct a set of idealized simulations to demonstrate the advantage of the unstructured grid in fvcom for implementing basal channels of different sizes and to explore how their presence affects the melt rates and cavity circulation 5 1 model configuration although cast on a somewhat smaller domain for computational efficiency the idealized experiments presented in this section are largely inspired by the filchner ice shelf in the southern weddell sea its central part east of berkner island features an ice body of relatively uniform thickness that is confined within the channelized geometry of the filchner trough and the cavity circulation is dominated by strong semi diurnal tidal currents along the channel in a cold low melting regime nicholls et al 2009 basal features of various scales are abundant on the filchner ice shelf with lengths of up to hundred kilometers and widths ranging from several meters to a few kilometers li et al 2018 and with unknown effects on the cavity circulation the idealized model domain is a north south orientated bathymetric trough on an f plane at a latitude of 80 s with 100 km long in the along trough direction y direction and 25 km wide in the cross trough direction x direction featuring a parabolic bottom topography h x 1300 3 2 1 0 6 x 2 the entire domain is covered by floating ice with a mean depth of about 700 m in the northern half of the domain the ice is flat in the southern half of the domain systematic undulations basal channels are superimposed on the ice draft with vertical amplitude of 50 m and decreasing horizontal scales narrower and steeper channels from the southern boundary toward the middle of the domain fig 10 three types of systematic undulations are applied along trough channels cross trough channels and mixed channels the along trough channels are parameterized as east west oriented sinusoidal waves with decreasing wavelength from the southern boundary toward the middle of the domain 25 z i x y 700 a sin 2 π x l x e y 0 15 l y here l x 25 km and l y 100 km are the width and length of the domain a 50 m is the amplitude of the undulations the cross trough channels are parameterized as north south oriented sinusoidal waves uniform in the east west direction and with decreasing wavelength from the southern boundary toward the middle of the domain 26 z i x y 700 a sin 2 π y 0 5 l y e y 0 15 l y the mixed channels configuration is obtained as the product of the along trough and cross trough channels for all three types of channels the amplitude of the undulations linearly decreases from 50 m to zero between y 45 km and y 50 km ensuring a smooth transition from the basal undulations to the flat portion of the ice base in the northern half of the domain except for the ice draft geometry the model setup is identical for all three simulations in the southern half of the domain the horizontal grid resolution increases monotonously from about 2 km at the southern boundary to about 40 m in the middle of the domain at y 50 km ensuring that each channel is resolved by at least 12 nodes the grid resolution is mirrored at y 50 km to decrease symmetrically over the flat ice base toward the northern boundary in order to ensure that differences in circulation beneath the rugged ice base are not an artifact of the horizontal discretization the model has 31 vertical layers with increased resolution toward the surface interior vertical mixing is parameterized using the my 2 5 closure scheme described in section 4 in combination with a constant background diffusivity and viscosity of 1 0 6 m 2 s 1 in the horizontal the smagorinsky eddy closure parameterization described in section 4 is used a background circulation is introduced by a synthetic semi diurnal tidal forcing imposed by prescribing periodic 12 h excursions of the free surface with an amplitude of 1 m and of opposite phase at the southern and northern open boundaries which is comparable to tidal amplitudes observed on the filchner ice shelf the model is initialized with linear salinity temperature profiles as stated in eq 22 eq 23 with surface salinity temperature being 33 8 psu 2 4 c and bottom salinity temperature 34 7 psu 1 9 c respectively this yields a temperature regime below the ice that is comparable to observations inside the filchner ice shelf cavity nicholls et al 2009 the same linear eos as in section 4 is used 5 2 results all runs were integrated for 70 model days with fig 11 showing cross trough averaged x direction melt rate at model day 10 40 and 70 for each simulation basal melting gradually decreases with time with melt rates being highest at day 10 and lowest at day 70 in all three runs it is also noticed that the difference in melt rates between day 40 to day 70 is smaller than that between day 10 to day 40 indicating that the system approaches a stable solution although some drift remains as ocean heat is gradually being depleted unless stated otherwise all results discussed below are using time mean values of the last 30 days of the simulations for which average melt rates for the entire ice shelf of 3 68 myr 1 3 18 myr 1 and 3 36 myr 1 are obtained for the along though the cross though and the mix channel geometries respectively the red curves in fig 11 show the time averaged cross trough averaged melt rates processed by a spatial running mean filter with window size of 20 km in along trough direction a prominent feature of the spatial pattern is that melt rates are significantly higher at places with narrow and steep channels than at the smooth flat ice in all the three runs in detail melt rates from both the along trough channels and the mixed channels increase from about 2 myr 1 at y 10 km to more than 10 myr 1 at y 45 km and then drop quickly to less than 1 myr 1 beneath the flat portion of the ice draft between y 60 km and y 90 km although the highest melt rates also occur at the place with steep channels melt rates from the cross trough channels exhibit a different distribution than those from the other two channel geometries the melt rates first decrease from about 4 myr 1 at y 10 km to negative values freezing at about y 22 km before increasing to more than 10 myr 1 at y 45 km spatial melt rate distributions for the three types of channels are presented in fig 12 showing that the melt rate distribution mirrors the ice draft topography with higher lower melting at the deeper keels shallower apexes of the channels at the ice base due to the depression of the freezing temperature with increasing pressure and depth again melting increases as the channel width decreases supporting the hypothesis that smaller and hence steeper features lead to stronger vertical mixing which brings underlying warm water up to the ice base little et al 2009 cross sections of salinity and temperature along the center line x 0 km of the domain fig 13 reveal two regimes with different stratification for all three channel types a two layer stratified regime beneath the northern flat portion of the ice base and a gradually stratified regime with jagged isohalines isothermolines beneath the rugged ice base in the south in detail in the northern half of the domain cold less saline water is lingering in the upper layer and warm saline water is lingering in the lower layer this feature is most prominent around y 50 70 km for the along trough and the mixed channels fig 13 a b g h in the southern half of the domain isohalines and isothermolines are lifted up in the upper 800 m depth around y 20 45 km as the channels become narrower and steeper in northward direction the different vertical structures in the northern and southern part of the domain fig 13 c f i set up horizontal density gradients that drive a domain wide cyclonic gyre circulation fig 14 a domain scale cyclonic gyre exists in all the three simulations for the along trough and cross trough channels the gyre circulation spans the entire domain with centers located at about y 60 km and y 45 km in the respective runs in the mixed channels simulation a smaller separated cyclonic circulation is spun up in the southern part of the domain convergence of ekman transport of cold fresh water toward the center of the gyre in the frictional boundary layer beneath the ice further amplifies the two regime structure such that local effects of the basal features interact with the mean flow to affect the cavity wide circulation 6 conclusion and discussion we implemented an ice shelf cavity module within the finite volume community ocean model fvcom seeking to resolve steep basal features by locally refining the grid resolution the pressure gradient errors associated with the terrain following σ coordinates were examined using an icemount test case and are found to be acceptable when introducing the ice shelf topography into the model formulation the steady state basal melting pattern produced by fvcom is comparable with that produced by romsutas in the framework of isomip ocean0 experiment asay davis et al 2016 based on the framework of isomip ocean0 setup we explored the effects of basal topography grid refinement and vertical mixing scheme on basal melting with a set of heat transfer coefficient sensitivity experiments we found that basal melt rates are sensitive to properly resolving the steepness of the ice base together with realistically parameterizing vertical mixing that brings heat from the ocean interior toward the ice ocean interface we show that local grid refinement efficiently minimizes pressure gradient errors associated with steep ice shelf topographies in terrain following coordinate models hence offering a useful tool for accurately simulating ice shelf basal melt rates in the context of complex topography steep basal topography is not only related to the ice front but also to small scale basal features that are abundant on many ice shelves results from our set of idealized simulations with systematic basal channels suggest that steeper basal features increase net melting in agreement with millgate et al 2013 the simulations also showed that the effects of local basal features play an important role in setting the cavity wide circulation unstructured grid models such as fvcom http dx doi org 10 17632 m6g4c3hm9m 1 provide a useful framework for representing the rugged ice shelf

23991,an ice shelf module is implemented into the unstructured grid three dimensional primitive equation finite volume community ocean model fvcom for studying ice shelf ocean interactions along the complex and irregular geometry of the coastal ocean pressure gradient errors associated with the representation of the ice shelf geometry in the model s terrain following vertical coordinate are investigated showing that locally increasing resolution efficiently reduces spurious currents near the steeply sloping grounding lines and ice fronts simulated basal melting and cavity circulation are compared within the framework of the on going 2nd ice shelf ocean model intercomparison project isomip sensitivity studies are carried out showing that the melt rate magnitude and distribution depends on properly resolving the slope at the ice base in combination with the choice of vertical mixing scheme idealized geometry simulations show that local effects of small scale topographic features at the ice base may dominate the melt rate distribution and buoyancy fluxes that drive the circulation inside the ice shelf cavity keywords fvcom ocean model ice shelf ocean interaction small scale basal features 1 introduction floating ice shelves at the coastline of greenland and antarctica constitute a key link between the ocean and the continental ice sheet they present a unique environment where several hundred meters of glacier ice overlay the ocean forming cavities with horizontal sizes ranging from a few square kilometers to the extents of coastal oceans their interaction with the underlying ocean has gained attention because basal melting of ice shelves may lead to ice flow acceleration and discharge due to reduced buttressing of the grounded inland ice shepherd et al 2002 gudmundsson 2013 in addition glacial meltwater is important for sea ice formation water mass transformation as well as deep water formation in the regional ocean and likely has an impact on the global ocean beckmann and goosse 2003 hellmer 2004 hellmer et al 2017 therefore understanding of ice shelf ocean interactions is necessary to explain past and current changes in ocean and ice sheets at high latitudes and to predict future changes as well as their impact on global sea level and the climate system direct investigations of water masses and dynamic processes beneath ice shelves are logistically challenging and numerical models are invaluable for understanding the processes governing basal melting several three dimensional primitive equation ocean models are nowadays incorporating ice shelf ocean interactions see dinniman et al 2016 and asay davis et al 2017 for an overview and many major ice shelf cavities and adjacent coastal oceans around antarctica and greenland have been simulated hellmer 2004 jenkins et al 2004 hattermann et al 2014 nakayama et al 2014 schodlok et al 2012 shroyer et al 2017 usually these models are run at spatial resolutions that focus on the regional to large scale circulations representing the ice draft as a whole smoothed piece and ignoring small scale features however recent studies show that kilometer scale and even meter scale variations in melt rates are a principal component of the ice ocean interactions langley et al 2014a berger et al 2017 channel like basal features are abundant on most ice shelves alley et al 2016 and impacts of small scale basal features on melt rates have been reported for prominent examples of rapidly melting ice shelves in west antarctica and northwestern greenland dutrieux et al 2013 as well as for colder cavities around east antarctica langley et al 2014b furthermore ice dynamically relevant thickness changes often occur in narrow regions near the steeply sloping grounding lines reese et al 2018 simulating the effects of those features on basal melting requires model resolution at hundred meter scale or smaller sergienko 2013 dutrieux et al 2013 which is still challenging even for dedicated regional simulations one way to address this problem is to use unstructured computational grids which allow to increase the resolution in selected regions of the model domain and accurately match complicated coastal and ice shelf geometries only a few unstructured grid models are presently capable of simulating the circulation within ice shelf cavities the finite element sea ice ocean model fesom provides large scale solutions with increased resolution in the antarctic timmermann et al 2012 while high resolution non hydrostatic fluidity icom simulations have been presented to investigate the overturning circulation in an idealized basal channel kimura et al 2013 jordan et al 2014 recently the ocean component of the energy exascale earth system model e3sm has been augmented to include ice shelf cavities petersen et al 2016 being the first unstructured finite volume code with that capability furthermore there exists generally little literature about the implementation of the ice shelf cavities within an unstructured grid model geometry in this study we incorporate ice shelf cavities into the unstructured grid finite volume community ocean model fvcom chen et al 2007 the aim is to develop a model that is capable of simulating ice shelf ocean interactions with particular focus on resolving small scale features of the basal topography and near the grounding line combining the finite volume approach with a horizontal mesh of non overlapping unstructured triangles fvcom has the advantages in geometric flexibility as well as computational efficiency the model has been successfully applied to studies of flow in a number of estuaries and coastal oceans that are characterized by complex irregular geometry and steeply sloping bottom topography see http fvcom smast umassd edu for an overview being originally designed for coastal applications the code incorporates many features that are useful for our purpose including routines for open boundary nesting as well as tidal and river runoff forcing it also features a non hydrostatic solver which will be suitable for high resolution studies of buoyant ice shelf water plumes in channel geometries and near the grounding lines an unstructured grid sea ice component is also available and has been applied and validated in the arctic chen et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 making the model suitable for polar applications in the vertical fvcom uses a generalized terrain following coordinate that allows for different stretching functions in different parts of the domain and accounts for changes in model morphology at runtime as part of a sediment module to incorporate the ice shelf cavities in this formulation we modified the coordinate transformation such that the model surface layer is subducted to a finite depth along ice shelf draft with the remaining layers being compressed accordingly this paper only presents results for ice shelf cavity geometries that are fixed in time however together with a robust wetting and drying scheme the architecture of fvcom provides an ideal starting point for fully coupled simulations of time evolving ice shelf cavities the terrain following coordinates come with the advantage of smoothly representing the sloping ice base and preserving vertical resolution in the deeper parts of the cavities both known problems when representing ice shelf cavities in z coordinate models losch 2008 at the same time the terrain following coordinate is limiting the capability of representing steeply sloping topography due to the occurrence of pressure gradient errors pges associated with the discretization of the vertical coordinate transformation beckmann 1998 while this is a severe limitation for simulating ice shelf cavities with regular grid models dinniman et al 2007 hattermann et al 2014 the unstructured grid method allows to partially compensate for pges near the virtually vertical ice front and at steep slopes by increasing the horizontal resolution albeit not negligible the additional computational cost is still smaller than for running a regular grid model at comparable resolution while often the relevant processes require increased resolution in the areas of steep topography anyways in addition to the derivation of the pressure gradient formulation that is used to include the effect of the ice shelf cavity in the unstructured grid finite volume method of fvcom this paper presents a set of idealized experiments that illustrate the capabilities of the new model implementation firstly a variation of the classical seamount experiment is used to compare the effect of pges due to sloping ice draft and bottom topography secondly the isomip idealized ice shelf cavity configuration asay davis et al 2016 is used to validate the dynamics and thermodynamics of the ice shelf code and to demonstrate the advantage of fvcom s variable grid resolution in accurately resolving the ice shelf geometry near the ice front and at the grounding line thirdly an idealized ice shelf basal channel configuration is used to explore the effects of small scale basal topography for the cavity circulation finally a model version that is augmented with the capability of including static ice shelf cavities is made freely available to everyone in the fvcom users community http dx doi org 10 17632 m6g4c3hm9m 1 the remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows section 2 describes the modifications necessary to include ice shelf dynamics into the standard fvcom code section 3 presents results of pges sensitivity tests for the inclusion of ice shelf cavities section 4 evaluates the model performance based on the isomip test experiments section 5 presents results of idealized modeling with small scale features conclusions and discussions are presented in section 6 2 model description ice shelf ocean interaction in an unstructured grid model 2 1 dynamics the weight of the ice shelf exerts an additional pressure on the water column and the main modification in fvcom s code infrastructure is to adjust the computation of the horizontal pressure gradient forces to account for the effect of the ice shelf topography as the terrain following layers subduct below the ice herein it is assumed that the depth of the ice ocean interface is prescribed e g an observed ice draft depth and that the ice is freely floating on the ocean i e that bridging stresses in the ice can be neglected at the ocean grid scale this approximation is commonly applied by other models and suffices for most applications although special cases have been reported where mechanical interactions through tidal bending become important rosier and gudmundsson 2018 for simplicity the derivation is presented in a classical σ layer formulation i e a vertically uniform layer thickness distribution although the method easily generalizes to any arbitrary stretching functions that can be applied in model the hydrostatic balance equation in the ocean is 1 p z ρ g with the hydrostatic pressure p the gravity acceleration g and the density of sea water ρ in the open ocean the hydrostatic pressure at a depth of z is obtained by integrating eq 1 from z to sea surface as 2 p z η ρ g d z with the sea surface elevation η while in the ice cavity the pressure at a depth of z is obtained by integrating eq 1 from z to the ice shelf base as 3 p p i z z i η ρ g d z where p i is the pressure at the ice shelf base exerted by the weight of the ice z i is the ice shelf draft which is the portion of the ice shelf below mean sea level and differs from the total ice shelf thickness due to the density difference between the ice shelf and the ocean water note that η is now the sea surface elevation with respect to a prescribed ice shelf draft this absolute pressure does not appear explicitly in fvcom instead a jacobian flux formulation is used to represent the horizontal pressure gradient force separating the contribution of the dynamic surface elevation 1 1 this separation is necessary in fvcom s explicit mode split method to compute the baroclininc and barotropic pressure gradient forces on different time steps since the same formulation is used also in the available semi implicit method both methods are capable of including the ice shelf cavities and applying the leibniz rule to differentiate the integral the pressure gradient can be expressed as 4 p ρ i o g η g z z i η ρ d z p i g ρ i o z i where ρ i o is the ocean density at the ice ocean interface for a rest state where the ice is in isostatic equilibrium with the ocean the two last terms on the right hand side cancel each other and the pressure gradient at the ice base vanishes floating condition however for a time evolving solution that deviates from the rest state a restoring force will arise that accelerates either the ice or the ocean through pressure gradients at the ice ocean interface assuming that these forces do not alter the ice shelf geometry they can be estimated following dinniman et al 2007 by approximating the water mass that is replaced by the ice in the rest state represented by the density at the top level of the ocean model ρ t o p minus an assumed constant linear dependence of the density with depth c ρ z with this approximation p i can be expressed as 5 p i g ρ t o p 0 5 c z i z i inserting eq 5 into eq 4 and assuming ρ i o ρ t o p gives 6 p ρ i o g η g z z i η ρ d z g z i ρ i o c g z i z i the term in parentheses is the additional pressure term apt induced from horizontal density gradients the accuracy of this formulation depends on the accuracy of the approximation of the ambient ocean by a constant density gradient c defining this constant requires a priori knowledge of the density distribution in the model solution and can be optimized for regional and idealized applications while other studies have suggested global constants that are representative from a large scale perspective dinniman et al 2007 mathiot et al 2017 to illustrate the formulation of the x direction component of the pressure gradient force under the terrain following coordinate transformation eq 6 can be written as 7 p x ρ i o g η x g z z i η ρ x d z g z i ρ i o x c g z i z i x note that the gradient operator in both eqs 6 and 7 is performed in z coordinates the σ transformation of the horizontal density gradients needs to be modified accordingly to take into account the correct slope of the σ layers relative to the geopotential surface due to the inclusion of the ice shelf topography the σ coordinate transformation in the ice shelf cavity can be expressed as 8 z h η z i σ z i η with the bathymetric depth h accordingly the x derivative of a variable casting in σ coordinate can be expressed as 9 x z x σ 1 h η z i σ h η z i x σ z i x η x σ performing eq 9 to all the x derivatives of eq 7 and rearranging gives 10 p x ρ 0 g η x g h η z i σ 0 ρ x d σ g h η z i x σ 0 σ ρ σ d σ g z i ρ i o x c g z i z i x g z i x σ 0 ρ σ d σ where ρ 0 is the reference density eq 10 describes the x direction pressure gradient force for the inclusion of ice shelf topography terms in the first brackets on the right hand side are already implemented in the fvcom code if we replace the water depth h η with the water column thickness h η z i the terms in the second brackets are related to the ice exerted pressure and need to be implemented into fvcom note that the first two terms in the second brackets represent the apt and disappear when the ocean is horizontally homogeneous while the third term accounts for the adjustment of the σ coordinate transformation inside the cavity the procedure is analogous in the y direction 2 2 discrete form of the ice exerted pressure gradient force in fvcom the governing equations in fvcom for momentum mass and tracers are expressed by their integral forms over individual control volumes for an illustration of the discretization see e g figure 1 in chen et al 2007 they are solved numerically by flux calculation through the volume boundaries by a finite volume scheme enforcing conservation laws in individual control volumes and the entire computational domain the horizontal velocity components are located at centroids that share the same control volume bounded by three sides of an individual triangle within a given terrain following layer the vertical velocity as well as all scalar variables are located at the nodes of the triangles sharing the same control volume enclosed by lines connecting centroids and middle points of triangle sides in surrounding triangles within a layer chen et al 2007 following the finite volume approach the terms in the second brackets of eq 10 should be integrated first vertically within a σ layer and then horizontally over a triangle element integrating the terms vertically within the σ layer from depth z k 1 to depth z k provides 11 z k 1 z k g z i ρ i o x c g z i z i x g z i x σ 0 ρ σ d σ d z 12 g d σ k σ k 1 z i ρ i o x c z i z i x ρ i o ρ k z i x where d h η z i and ρ k is the density within layer k integrating eq 12 horizontally over a triangle element gives 13 g σ k σ k 1 d z i ρ i o x c z i z i x ρ i o ρ k z i x d x d y applying green s theorem to eq 13 gives 14 g d σ k σ k 1 z i ρ i o d y ρ i o ρ k c z i z i d y here is the value at the triangle center for a horizontally homogeneously stratified ocean eq 14 becomes 15 g d σ k σ k 1 ρ i o ρ k z i d y while the difference between eqs 14 and 15 accounts for the apt eq 14 is added to the baroclininc pressure gradient computation in fvcom the dynamic formulation is completed by a quadratic friction law that is applied for surface momentum boundary conditions inside the ice shelf cavity mirroring the bottom momentum boundary conditions at the seabed 2 3 thermodynamics thermodynamic forcing inside the ice shelf cavity is imposed by freezing and melting at the ice ocean interface assuming the ice shelf to be a perfect insulator between the ocean and the atmosphere this thermodynamic process can be parameterized by three fundamental equations hellmer and olbers 1989 holland and jenkins 1999 jenkins et al 2010 as 16 ρ f w m w l ρ s w c w u γ t t b t w t b λ 1 s b λ 2 λ 3 p b ρ f w m w s b ρ s w u γ s s b s w here m w is the melt rate expressed in water equivalent and l is the latent heat of fusion of ice u is the friction velocity defined as u 2 c d u w 2 u r e s 2 with u w being the velocity magnitude some distance below the ice shelf interface and u r e s referring to small sub grid scale residual currents e g due to unresolved tides that facilitate a finite local heat flux in the absence of a large scale flow asay davis et al 2016 t b s b and p b are the potential temperature salinity and pressure at the interface respectively ρ f w and ρ s w are fresh water density and sea water density respectively t w and s w are the potential temperature and salinity some distance below the ice shelf interface respectively note that the values of t w s w and u w are taken from the uppermost model grid cell γ t and γ s are heat and salt transfer coefficients which need case dependent tuning as will be discussed in more detail in section 4 the values of these parameters except γ t and γ s are given in table 1 the freshwater heat and salt fluxes are computed following jenkins et al 2001 as 17 f f w 0 f h c w ρ s w u γ t ρ f w m w t b t w f s ρ s w u γ s ρ f w m w s b s w this parameterization yields an effective heat flux and a virtual salt flux i e a freshwater flux without volume change in the ocean between ice shelf and water these fluxes can conveniently be applied at the base of the ice shelf as boundary conditions for the salinity and temperature dinniman et al 2016 3 sensitivity of pressure gradient errors the seamount and icemount experiments the terrain following coordinates used in fvcom are attractive for representing ice shelf cavities and allowing high vertical resolution near the grounding lines dinniman et al 2007 kimura et al 2013 however concerns are raised about the pges near steep topography in particular at the ice front galton fenzi 2009 the pges are essentially numerical truncation errors introduced during the coordinate transformation of the horizontal pressure gradient term mellor et al 1994 berntsen 2011 in addition to the slope of the interior layers inside the ice shelf cavity the pressure gradient force calculation also needs to account for significant slopes of the surface along the ice base which may increase the pges shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 dinniman et al 2007 3 1 geometry and model setup to assess the presence of pges related to the inclusion of ice shelf in fvcom we compare the traditional seamount experiment with a corresponding counterpart the icemount experiment the seamount experiment consists of a steep rise in bottom topography within an otherwise uniform domain that has been proven as a valuable test case for studying the sensitivity of pges in σ coordinate models beckmann and haidvogel 1993 berntsen and oey 2010 the icemount experiment imposes an ice draft that mirrors the seamount s topography over a flat bottom fig 1 shows cross sections of the geometries for both cases in the seamount case a steep symmetric mount is placed at the center of a closed domain that is 390 km long in the x direction and 290 km wide in the y direction the domain is covered by an ice shelf draft of constant thickness of 1 m and the bottom topography of the seamount is parameterized the same as that in berntsen and oey 2010 as 18 h x y h 0 1 0 0 9 e x 2 y 2 l 2 where h 0 4500 m and l 40 km in the icemount case right panel of fig 1 the bottom topography is flat and the ice draft is parameterized as 19 z i x y 0 9 h 0 e x 2 y 2 l 2 except for the geometries the two test cases use identical setups that are similar to the benchmark presented by berntsen and oey 2010 the horizontal grid resolution is 6 km defined by the distance between adjacent nodes within a uniform triangular grid and there are 40 uniformly spaced vertical σ layers the coriolis parameter is set to a constant value of 1 0 4 s 1 equivalent at a latitude of 43 3 n salinity is constant and set to 35 psu the initial temperature is prescribed as a linear function of depth as 20 t z t s t b t s z h 0 where t s 20 c and t b 5 c are the surface and bottom temperatures respectively also shown in fig 1 are cross sections of initial temperatures for both cases a linear equation of state eos is used 21 ρ ρ b 1 α t t b where ρ b 1028 kg m 3 and α 2 1161 1 0 4 c 1 although this stratification does not represent a realistic water mass distribution inside an ice shelf cavity it resembles other seamount experiments beckmann and haidvogel 1993 with c in eq 5 being chosen to yield a density difference between the surface and bottom of 3 263 kg m 3 that is close to that in berntsen and oey 2010 velocities are initialized with a white noise perturbation with a magnitude of 1 0 7 m s 1 horizontal viscosity is set to 100 m 2 s 1 while horizontal and vertical diffusivities as well as the vertical viscosity are set to zero in order to isolate the pges induced flow berntsen and oey 2010 there is no flux perpendicular to the model walls and ice shelf thermodynamics are turned off such that there is no physical forcing in addition to these two experiments an additional icemount test is performed which is identical to the standard icemount run but without the apt related to horizontally non homogeneous stratification included in the model the second parenthesis of eq 6 this allows to separate the effects of sloping geometry and the dynamic response of the restoring force by the ice shelf pressure under the terrain following coordinate transformation 3 2 results three diagnostic measures the maximum velocity v m a x the volume averaged kinetic energy e k i n and the sea surface elevation are monitored in the pges sensitivity tests throughout this study fig 2 displays time series of the log10 of v m a x a and e k i n b for the seamount case blue curves and the icemount case red curves during the first 5 days of the simulation v m a x and e k i n from the icemount case are several orders of magnitude larger compared to the seamount case however v m a x and e k i n also show a transient increase until they reach comparable values in both experiments when approaching a quasi steady state after about 25 days of the simulation although initial pges associated with the ice topography are larger it seems that they grow to similar magnitudes in fully developed simulations inside sloping ice shelf cavities and in simulations with comparable bottom slopes also presented in fig 2 are the results from the icemount case without the apt green curves although the experiment also reaches a quasi steady state after about 25 days the v m a x and e k i n grow much faster after the model initialization and converge to values that are several orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding results from the icemount case with the apt being included except during the first day of the simulation two things can be learned from this experiment firstly the results show that the pges perturbation arising from the terrain following coordinate transformation leads to a numerical instability under the ice shelf geometry while the homogeneous initial stratification should not lead to any circulation under the ice i e the apt vanishes and there are not pressure gradients at the ice base the pges related flow leads to anomalies in the hydrography amplifying the development of baroclinic currents that grow in absence of the stabilizing apt this development can be seen in fig 3 which shows the evolution of sea surface elevation in the first 10 days for all the three cases while the standard seamount icemount case develops a stable anti clockwise clockwise gyre circulation around the mount a multipolar circulation pattern quickly grows to large amplitudes around the icemount case without apt consistent with the results shown in fig 2 the gyre from the icemount case is stronger than that from the seamount case during this early phase of the simulation while both cases show gyres of similar magnitude that do not grow significantly with time after about 25 days not shown secondly the smaller initial noise prior to the unstable growth of the case without apt compared to the standard icemount case suggest that the additional terms due to the altered coordinate transformation eq 15 are not the dominant error source that cause the difference between the icemount and seamount solution instead the additional pges in the icemount case seem to stem from the discretization of the apt shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 pointed out the importance of accurately representing the surface layer density in the non aligned vertical coordinates and one difference between eqs 14 and 15 is the additional integration of the density at the ice ocean interface around the control volume first term in curly brackets in eq 14 in our implementation ρ io is taken to be the value of the uppermost σ layer which in the vertical discretization of fvcom is located in the center of the layer and not at the top of it shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 proposed a more accurate representation of the model surface density their eq a20 but we find that this method did not reduce the pges in our icemount experiments we assume that the initial difference in pges between the icemount experiments with and without apt may be related to inaccuracies of the horizontal representation of ρ io at the node centers in the integration in eq 14 but answering this question will require further investigations however since the pges in the icemount and seamount cases converge to similar magnitudes after an initial growth period we conclude that the pressure gradient formulation for a sloping ice base in the vertical coordinate transformation for fvcom provides robust results 4 fvcom isomip ocean0 experiments recently the ice shelf ocean model intercomparison project second phase isomip asay davis et al 2016 has become an international effort to systematically compare different ice shelf cavity ocean models within a prescribed set of idealized experiments providing a useful framework to validate and further test the behavior of the fvcom ice shelf cavity module while the full set of the fvcom isomip experiments will be presented in a separate study this section focuses on the proposed calibration experiment that is referred to as ocean0 in asay davis et al 2016 see also table 2 in asay davis et al 2016 for an overview of all experiments of the intercomparison in the following variations of the ocean0 setup will be used to explore the combined effects of varying resolution ice shelf slope and vertical mixing on the simulated basal melting using the fvcom ice shelf cavity module 4 1 model configuration the ocean0 setup features a rectangular domain of 340 km length in north south direction with x being defined pointing northward and 80 km width in east west direction with y being defined pointing westward on an f plane at a latitude of 75 s which is partially covered by a static ice draft with the grounding line at the southern boundary at x 0 km and the ice front at about x 180 km fig 4 ocean properties are initialized with velocities at rest and with horizontally homogeneous temperature and salinity profiles that are linear functions of the water depth 22 t t 0 t b t 0 z d and 23 s s 0 s b s 0 z d where t 0 1 9 c and s 0 33 8 psu are surface temperature and salinity respectively and t b 1 0 c and s b 34 7 psu are bottom temperature and salinity respectively d 720 m is the maximum water depth a linear eos is used to prescribe density as a function of salinity and temperature as 24 ρ ρ ref 1 α lin t t ref β lin s s ref where ρ ref and t ref s ref are the reference density and temperature salinity respectively α lin β lin is the temperature expansion salinity contraction coefficient respectively with parameter values provided in table 1 being forced with relatively warm ocean temperatures this experiment reaches a quasi equilibrium with strong melting within a few months simulation time asay davis et al 2016 which makes it well suited to sensitivity and parameters studies 4 1 1 mesh refinement and pges tests among different measures proposed to reduce pges in terrain following coordinate ocean models topographic smoothing is widely applied and perhaps most feasible as it does not require modifications to the model code chu and fan 1997 berntsen 2011 in particular it is a common practice to replace the topographic step at the ice shelf front by a smooth transition in terrain following σ coordinate models although this smoothing is expected to affect the results e g by artificially reducing the potential vorticity barrier that is limiting the exchange across the ice front beckmann et al 1999 another possibility for reducing pges over steep topographic slopes is to increase the horizontal model resolution with obvious advantages of the unstructured grid method this is useful because pges are often dominated by the discretization of the relative change in water column thickness between two neighboring grid points h i and h i 1 commonly measured by the grid stiffness r x 0 h i 1 h i h i 1 h i also referred to as beckman and haidvogel number 2 2 while r x 0 is defined based on the total water column thickness the haney number r x 1 is often used to measure relative change in vertical layer thickness but for uniform σ coordinates as considered here the two measures are proportional to each other beckmann and haidvogel 1993 to this end three different ocean0 grids were designed to explore the role of horizontal resolution and topographic slope in the pges and simulated melt rates the prescribed standard configuration combines a relatively coarse grid with 2 km uniform resolution and a relatively smooth topography that is required to minimize the pges on that grid results from this so called com grid will be compared to results from a typ2 grid that retains the original steepness of the isomip topography and uses local grid refinement to reduce the pges as well as to results of a typ1 grid with local grid refinement applied to the smooth topography to discriminate the effects of ice shelf basal slope and model resolution for comparability the com and typ1 grids use almost the same topography as the isomip com configuration of the romsutas the regional ocean modelling system from the university of tasmania participant pers comm d gwyther this topography was interpolated to the romsutas ocean mask from the prescribed isomip grid and smoothed with 4th order shapiro filter to reduce the r x 0 values to a maximum value of 0 1 in addition the vertical ice front was replaced in the fvcom configuration by a linear slope of 20 km width fig 5a shows the water column thickness and grid stiffness r x 0 values of this smoothed topography and fig 5c shows the r x 0 values of the original isomip geometry both computed on a regular 1 km grid for reasons of comparison the latter shows notably steeper slopes at the ice front and near the grounding lines these fields were also used to determine the resolution of the typ1 and typ2 meshes which varies from 200 m to 2000 m and scales inversely with the r x 0 values of the respective water column thickness fields shown in fig 5a and c fig 4 illustrates the horizontal meshes and table 2 lists numbers of triangle nodes for the typ1 and typ2 grids the horizontal discretizations of the typ1 and typ2 grids differ because of the different coastlines but both have comparably increased resolution near the ice front and grounding lines where the steepest slopes occur while the typ1 topography was obtained by simply interpolating the smoothed romsutas geometry onto the fvcom unstructured mesh the typ2 topography was derived directly from the isomip geometry via a weighted average smoothing method that preserves steeper slopes where model resolution is increased in this method the isomip topography is first interpolated onto two regular grids of 200 m resolution and 2 km resolution respectively next the interpolated topography on each grid is smoothed with a 3 3 two dimensional equal weight sliding window filter to remove any noise on the grid scale finally the smoothed topographies from the two grids are interpolated onto the typ2 fvcom mesh and combined as weighted average with the averaging weight being linearly scaled by the local grid resolution this step may seem somewhat redundant since the typ2 mesh refinement was readily derived from the topography but the process assures that steepness varies smoothly at the grid scale and its description may be instructive for other applications right panels of fig 5 show rx0 values of the resulting typ1 fig 5b and typ2 fig 5d geometries computed on their respective unstructured grids showing that the locally increased resolution efficiently reduces the grid stiffness all three grids have 36 uniformly spaced vertical layers and the com and typ1 grids have a minimum water column thickness of about 22 m at the grounding line while typ2 has a minimum water column thickness of about 4 m for all three grids 60 day long pges tests without physical forcing except friction at the bottom and the ice base are performed model settings and diagnostics are similar to the icemount and seamount experiments except that horizontal mixing of momentum is scaled according to the model resolution yielding a constant horizontal viscosity of 33 33 m 2 s 1 for the com grid and a resolution scaled values ranging from 3 33 m 2 s 1 to 33 33 m 2 s 1 for the typ1 and typ2 configurations 4 1 2 transfer coefficients and vertical mixing parameterization the next set of experiments explores the effect of basal steepness and interior vertical mixing on simulated basal melting when including the thermodynamics presented in section 2 to parameterize heat and salt fluxes at the ice ocean interface a large uncertainty in using this three equation formulation is to determine general turbulent transfer coefficients γ t γ s for scaling the heat and salt fluxes through the ice ocean boundary layer holland and jenkins 1999 empirical values have been proposed based on small number of observations jenkins 2010 suggesting a constant ratio between γ t and γ s but their validity for a wider range of applications has been questioned kimura et al 2015 furthermore jenkins 1991 showed that the heat transfer at the ice ocean boundary is directly related to the slope of ice base implying that simulated melt rates in general circulation models also depend on their capability to correctly represent the steepness of the ice shelf geometry finally the thermodynamics at the ice ocean interface also depend on the numerics through which the parameterized boundary layer fluxes are linked to the ocean interior physics gwyther et al 2015 such that transfer coefficients must be evaluated in combination with the applied vertical mixing scheme of the given ocean model the isomip protocol prescribes γ s γ t 35 and proposes to calibrate the values of heat and salt transfer coefficients by tuning the ocean0 experiment to achieve a target mean melt rate of 30 2 myr 1 averaged over ice draft deeper than 300 m and over the final 6 months of 1 year simulations to gain insights into the interplay of horizontal resolution basal slope and vertical mixing a set of such γ t sensitivity experiments is performed combining the com typ1 and typ2 configurations either with constant vertical viscosity diffusivity of 1 0 3 m 2 s 1 5 1 0 5 m 2 s 1 as prescribed by the isomip common experimental design or using the mellor and yamada level 2 5 my 2 5 mellor and yamada 1982 galperin et al 1988 turbulent closure model vertical prandtl number 1 together with a constant background viscosity and diffusivity of 1 0 5 m 2 s 1 table 2 lists the 28 experiments for each configuration with varying γ t values no open ocean surface forcing is included in these thermodynamically active simulations while temperature and salinity are restored to the initial profiles in a 10 km wide zone at the northern boundary to facilitate a quasi steady equilibrium state to be reached unless stated otherwise an eddy closure parameterization smagorinsky 1963 is used in which horizontal mixing of momentum viscosity and tracers diffusivity are computed as ν h 0 5 c p ω u u x 2 v y 2 0 5 u x v y 2 and κ h 0 5 c ω ξ u x 2 v y 2 0 5 u x v y 2 here c 0 1 is a scaling constant and p 0 1 is the horizontal prandtl number ω u and ω ξ refer to the respective control element area for momentum and tracers 4 2 results 4 2 1 pges tests with different model geometries fig 6 shows time series of log10 of v m a x and e k i n for the pges test runs of the three different model configurations in the 60 day simulations maximum velocities remain below 0 05 m s 1 for both the com and typ2 runs while they remain 0 005 m s 1 for the typ1 run this suggests that a combination of smoothing and grid refinement leads to the weakest pges induced flow while the grid refinement alone yields smaller errors than the smoothing topography alone the same holds true for the comparison of e k i n fig 6b as well as for snapshots of sea surface elevation fields at day 60 for the three runs not shown fig 7 presents barotropic flow field averaged 3 3 note that proper computations of streamfunctions on unstructured grids are challenging hence here we are using matlab s streamslice function to depict the depth averaged velocities over the last 30 days of the simulation for the pges test runs the com run has much stronger spurious circulation inside the ice shelf cavity than the typ1 run confirming grid refinement leads to weaker pges induced flow also for the steeper typ2 run the pges induced spurious currents are weak over most parts of the domain except along the nearly vertical ice front where the flow magnitudes are comparable to the com run nevertheless magnitudes of the pges induced spurious motions in all three runs are small compared to the buoyancy driven circulation that is found in our ocean0 simulations which are on the order of 1 0 2 m s 1 as a result of the physical forcing in the application not shown moreover the flow lines show that the ice shelf front refracts the flow in both the com run and the typ2 run whereas for the smooth and highly resolving typ1 run streamlines are connected undisturbed across the ice front while a proper assessment of the representation of the physics at this prominent feature of the ice shelf geometry is beyond the scope of this study the comparison illustrates the trade off being made between minimizing computational error associated with terrain following coordinates on the one hand and properly representing the potential vorticity barrier that the step change in water column thickness represents to the ocean flow inside and outside the ice shelf cavity on the other hand although the typ2 setup leads to weaker pges induced flow even with steeper topography when being compared to the com setup the higher resolution will also increase the computational cost of the model which often is an important factor for the design of a specific application when using the same explicit time step 5 s and the same number of processors 128 the computation time for the typ1 grid also typ2 increases nearly by a factor of 6 compared to the com run in our setup compared to an increase in computing points by a factor of 3 additionally the high resolution setup requires shorter time stepping but we do not know the maximum possible time step ratio between the com and typ grids since our runs were not optimized for efficiency on the other hand increasing the resolution to 200 m for the entire isomip ocean0 domain would require more than 660 000 computing points which is nearly 30 times as many as for the typ grids indicating that a uniform high resolution setup would have more than one order of magnitude larger computational demands than the typ grids 4 2 2 ocean0 com basal melt rates before exploring the sensitivity of basal melting in fvcom we briefly evaluate our implementation of the ice ocean thermodynamics and their effects on the cavity circulation by comparing the fvcom ocean0 com setup with isomip results from the romsutas model despite their different horizontal discretizations the two models share similarities in topography vertical coordinates and expression for the density of water replaced by the ice for the comparison fvcom was set up with the same horizontal mixing parameterization as the romsutas model using a constant eddy viscosity diffusivity of 6 0 m 2 s 1 1 0 m 2 s 1 both models use the prescribed constant interior vertical mixing coefficients and the same transfer coefficient γ t 0 05 for parameterizing fluxes at the ice ocean interface melt rate distributions from both models and barotropic streamfunctions inside the cavity 4 4 streamfunctions for fvcom were computed after interpolating the results onto a common regular grid as is part of the prescribed isomip post processing routines averaged over the last 6 months of 1 year simulations are shown in fig 8 the magnitude and spatial distribution of basal melt rates are generally comparable between the two models melting is strongest near the deepest part of the eastern flank of the cavity around x 0 km and x 20 km showing a pattern of melting and freezing that is asymmetric around y 40 km and reflects the geostrophically controlled cavity circulation with a colder melt water diluted outflow along the western flank of the cavity some differences remain with fvcom showing a somewhat larger magnitude of melting and freezing compared to romsutas however the spread is generally within the range of the participating isomip models and likely reflects differences in model numerics for instance the vertical layer distribution together with other analyses that were carried out to check for consistent water mass transformations due to melting and freezing and general mass conservation not shown the comparison with an established and widely used ice shelf cavity model such as roms dinniman et al 2007 provides confidence that our implementation of the ice shelf module was successful and can be used for further investigations of ice shelf ocean interactions 4 2 3 melt rate sensitivity to basal slope and vertical mixing fig 9 shows the results of the 28 γ t sensitivity experiments in all simulations melt rates generally increase with larger γ t values when constant vertical mixing is applied the com typ1 and typ2 configurations yield nearly indistinguishable results with melt rates saturating at about 20 5 myr 1 in those cases melting is limited by low mixing in the interior ocean that does not supply enough heat into the surface layer to maintain larger melt when γ t increases this changes when the my 2 5 closure vertical mixing scheme is used in those simulations the vertical shear induced by buoyant melt water rising along the ice base may enhance interior mixing and melt rates keep increasing for larger γ t values the results also diverge for the different geometrical configurations with highest melt rates of 34 myr 1 at γ t 0 1 obtained for the steep typ2 topography confirming that simulated basal melting is sensitive to the resolved steepness of the ice base the smooth com and typ1 configurations yield similar melt rates of about 29 myr 1 at γ t 0 1 despite the fact that typ1 has much higher grid resolution than the com configuration showing that the melt rate increase in the typ2 configuration is not an artifact of the increased horizontal resolution alone 5 idealized modeling of ice draft with small scale features in recent years the role on basal melting and ice shelf stability of local topographical features at the ice shelf underside such as basal channels and crevasses have attracted attention rignot and steffen 2008 vaughan et al 2012 dutrieux et al 2014 stanton et al 2013 channelized basal features are being observed beneath many ice shelves alley et al 2016 with heights ranging from tens to hundreds of meters with aspect ratios between unity and about ten times larger widths than heights some channels extend several tens of kilometers in longitudinal direction traversing the ice base along and across the ice flow direction intersecting bifurcating and rendering complex networks on the ice base topography langley et al 2014b while it is obvious that the ice shelf cavity circulation interacts with the rugged basal topography the effects of local features on melting and freezing patterns and in turn the role of the ocean for the channel evolution is still not fully understood it has been shown that the presence of basal channels and small scale features influences the melt rate distribution dutrieux et al 2013 feeding back onto the local ice dynamics sergienko 2013 idealized modeling studies have provided insights to specific configurations khazendar and jenkins 2003 gladish et al 2012 millgate et al 2013 jordan et al 2014 however more realistic regional ice shelf ocean models are typically not capable of explicitly resolving local basal topography instead representing the ice draft as one smoothed piece ignoring small scale features in this section we conduct a set of idealized simulations to demonstrate the advantage of the unstructured grid in fvcom for implementing basal channels of different sizes and to explore how their presence affects the melt rates and cavity circulation 5 1 model configuration although cast on a somewhat smaller domain for computational efficiency the idealized experiments presented in this section are largely inspired by the filchner ice shelf in the southern weddell sea its central part east of berkner island features an ice body of relatively uniform thickness that is confined within the channelized geometry of the filchner trough and the cavity circulation is dominated by strong semi diurnal tidal currents along the channel in a cold low melting regime nicholls et al 2009 basal features of various scales are abundant on the filchner ice shelf with lengths of up to hundred kilometers and widths ranging from several meters to a few kilometers li et al 2018 and with unknown effects on the cavity circulation the idealized model domain is a north south orientated bathymetric trough on an f plane at a latitude of 80 s with 100 km long in the along trough direction y direction and 25 km wide in the cross trough direction x direction featuring a parabolic bottom topography h x 1300 3 2 1 0 6 x 2 the entire domain is covered by floating ice with a mean depth of about 700 m in the northern half of the domain the ice is flat in the southern half of the domain systematic undulations basal channels are superimposed on the ice draft with vertical amplitude of 50 m and decreasing horizontal scales narrower and steeper channels from the southern boundary toward the middle of the domain fig 10 three types of systematic undulations are applied along trough channels cross trough channels and mixed channels the along trough channels are parameterized as east west oriented sinusoidal waves with decreasing wavelength from the southern boundary toward the middle of the domain 25 z i x y 700 a sin 2 π x l x e y 0 15 l y here l x 25 km and l y 100 km are the width and length of the domain a 50 m is the amplitude of the undulations the cross trough channels are parameterized as north south oriented sinusoidal waves uniform in the east west direction and with decreasing wavelength from the southern boundary toward the middle of the domain 26 z i x y 700 a sin 2 π y 0 5 l y e y 0 15 l y the mixed channels configuration is obtained as the product of the along trough and cross trough channels for all three types of channels the amplitude of the undulations linearly decreases from 50 m to zero between y 45 km and y 50 km ensuring a smooth transition from the basal undulations to the flat portion of the ice base in the northern half of the domain except for the ice draft geometry the model setup is identical for all three simulations in the southern half of the domain the horizontal grid resolution increases monotonously from about 2 km at the southern boundary to about 40 m in the middle of the domain at y 50 km ensuring that each channel is resolved by at least 12 nodes the grid resolution is mirrored at y 50 km to decrease symmetrically over the flat ice base toward the northern boundary in order to ensure that differences in circulation beneath the rugged ice base are not an artifact of the horizontal discretization the model has 31 vertical layers with increased resolution toward the surface interior vertical mixing is parameterized using the my 2 5 closure scheme described in section 4 in combination with a constant background diffusivity and viscosity of 1 0 6 m 2 s 1 in the horizontal the smagorinsky eddy closure parameterization described in section 4 is used a background circulation is introduced by a synthetic semi diurnal tidal forcing imposed by prescribing periodic 12 h excursions of the free surface with an amplitude of 1 m and of opposite phase at the southern and northern open boundaries which is comparable to tidal amplitudes observed on the filchner ice shelf the model is initialized with linear salinity temperature profiles as stated in eq 22 eq 23 with surface salinity temperature being 33 8 psu 2 4 c and bottom salinity temperature 34 7 psu 1 9 c respectively this yields a temperature regime below the ice that is comparable to observations inside the filchner ice shelf cavity nicholls et al 2009 the same linear eos as in section 4 is used 5 2 results all runs were integrated for 70 model days with fig 11 showing cross trough averaged x direction melt rate at model day 10 40 and 70 for each simulation basal melting gradually decreases with time with melt rates being highest at day 10 and lowest at day 70 in all three runs it is also noticed that the difference in melt rates between day 40 to day 70 is smaller than that between day 10 to day 40 indicating that the system approaches a stable solution although some drift remains as ocean heat is gradually being depleted unless stated otherwise all results discussed below are using time mean values of the last 30 days of the simulations for which average melt rates for the entire ice shelf of 3 68 myr 1 3 18 myr 1 and 3 36 myr 1 are obtained for the along though the cross though and the mix channel geometries respectively the red curves in fig 11 show the time averaged cross trough averaged melt rates processed by a spatial running mean filter with window size of 20 km in along trough direction a prominent feature of the spatial pattern is that melt rates are significantly higher at places with narrow and steep channels than at the smooth flat ice in all the three runs in detail melt rates from both the along trough channels and the mixed channels increase from about 2 myr 1 at y 10 km to more than 10 myr 1 at y 45 km and then drop quickly to less than 1 myr 1 beneath the flat portion of the ice draft between y 60 km and y 90 km although the highest melt rates also occur at the place with steep channels melt rates from the cross trough channels exhibit a different distribution than those from the other two channel geometries the melt rates first decrease from about 4 myr 1 at y 10 km to negative values freezing at about y 22 km before increasing to more than 10 myr 1 at y 45 km spatial melt rate distributions for the three types of channels are presented in fig 12 showing that the melt rate distribution mirrors the ice draft topography with higher lower melting at the deeper keels shallower apexes of the channels at the ice base due to the depression of the freezing temperature with increasing pressure and depth again melting increases as the channel width decreases supporting the hypothesis that smaller and hence steeper features lead to stronger vertical mixing which brings underlying warm water up to the ice base little et al 2009 cross sections of salinity and temperature along the center line x 0 km of the domain fig 13 reveal two regimes with different stratification for all three channel types a two layer stratified regime beneath the northern flat portion of the ice base and a gradually stratified regime with jagged isohalines isothermolines beneath the rugged ice base in the south in detail in the northern half of the domain cold less saline water is lingering in the upper layer and warm saline water is lingering in the lower layer this feature is most prominent around y 50 70 km for the along trough and the mixed channels fig 13 a b g h in the southern half of the domain isohalines and isothermolines are lifted up in the upper 800 m depth around y 20 45 km as the channels become narrower and steeper in northward direction the different vertical structures in the northern and southern part of the domain fig 13 c f i set up horizontal density gradients that drive a domain wide cyclonic gyre circulation fig 14 a domain scale cyclonic gyre exists in all the three simulations for the along trough and cross trough channels the gyre circulation spans the entire domain with centers located at about y 60 km and y 45 km in the respective runs in the mixed channels simulation a smaller separated cyclonic circulation is spun up in the southern part of the domain convergence of ekman transport of cold fresh water toward the center of the gyre in the frictional boundary layer beneath the ice further amplifies the two regime structure such that local effects of the basal features interact with the mean flow to affect the cavity wide circulation 6 conclusion and discussion we implemented an ice shelf cavity module within the finite volume community ocean model fvcom seeking to resolve steep basal features by locally refining the grid resolution the pressure gradient errors associated with the terrain following σ coordinates were examined using an icemount test case and are found to be acceptable when introducing the ice shelf topography into the model formulation the steady state basal melting pattern produced by fvcom is comparable with that produced by romsutas in the framework of isomip ocean0 experiment asay davis et al 2016 based on the framework of isomip ocean0 setup we explored the effects of basal topography grid refinement and vertical mixing scheme on basal melting with a set of heat transfer coefficient sensitivity experiments we found that basal melt rates are sensitive to properly resolving the steepness of the ice base together with realistically parameterizing vertical mixing that brings heat from the ocean interior toward the ice ocean interface we show that local grid refinement efficiently minimizes pressure gradient errors associated with steep ice shelf topographies in terrain following coordinate models hence offering a useful tool for accurately simulating ice shelf basal melt rates in the context of complex topography steep basal topography is not only related to the ice front but also to small scale basal features that are abundant on many ice shelves results from our set of idealized simulations with systematic basal channels suggest that steeper basal features increase net melting in agreement with millgate et al 2013 the simulations also showed that the effects of local basal features play an important role in setting the cavity wide circulation unstructured grid models such as fvcom http dx doi org 10 17632 m6g4c3hm9m 1 provide a useful framework for representing the rugged ice shelf

23992,we investigate the stability of a composite cyclone representative of arabian sea eddies using a high resolution primitive equation model we observe that the eddy is unstable with respect to a mixed barotropic baroclinic instability leading to the growth of an azimuthal mode 2 perturbation the latter deforms the eddy which eventually evolves into a tripole after about 4 months of simulation the presence of a critical level for the most unstable mode generates sharp fronts in the surface mixed layer where the rossby number is large these fronts then become unstable and this generates submesoscale cyclones and filaments near these fronts diapycnal mixing occurs causing the potential vorticity to change sign locally and symmetric instability to develop in the core of the cyclonic eddy despite the instabilities the eddy is not destroyed and remains a large scale coherent structure for the last 6 months of the simulation looking at sea surface height only the composite eddy evolves little and fairly represents the eddy observed in the altimetry which can live for several months the study of this simulation thus illustrates the numerous kinds of instabilities which may occur in large cyclonic eddies but cannot be captured directly by altimetric data keywords mesoscale eddy instability submesoscale vortex 1 introduction mesoscale eddies are a prominent feature of the ocean circulation they have a strong influence on biological activity chelton et al 2011 tracer transport zhang et al 2014 and physical and chemical properties of the water column dong et al 2014

current eddies in the gulf of mexico meunier et al 2018 the ras al hadd dipole in the northern arabian sea l hégaret et al 2015 2016 all play an important role in the transport of heat and salt mesoscale eddies have been intensively studied over the past 60 years in particular many studies have focused on their stability properties using linear stability analysis gent and mcwilliams 1986 mcwilliams et al 1986 nguyen et al 2012 yim and billant 2015 and numerical models to study the finite amplitude evolution of unstable perturbations carton and mcwilliams 1989 stegner and dritschel

mcwilliams 1985 or lorentzian vortices hua et al 2013 meunier et al 2018 assuming that they represent a large range of observed eddies le vu et al 2018 the result of these stability analyses is strongly dependent on the initial profile imposed in most cases the eddy profiles are unstable and can lead to the destruction of the eddy the formation of dipoles tripoles or the long time decay of the eddy carton et al 1989 stegner and dritschel 2000 the increase of computational capabilities has led recent studies to implement very high resolution stability analyses in a 3d context this allows the study of vortex stability beyond balanced mesoscale processes and to observe how submesoscale features can emerge from the destabilization of mesoscale structures brannigan et al 2017 ménesguen et al 2018 such studies highlight a possible mechanism for the forward cascade of energy toward small scales in the past few years it has become possible to determine the actual shape of oceanic eddies with a fairly good spatio temporal resolution gridded multi satellite altimetric products provide increased horizontal resolution up to 1 8 and resolve more accurately eddies with radii two or three times the first baroclinic rossby radius of deformation r d hereafter than older products with coarser horizontal resolution 1 3 or 1 4 the rapid growth of the argo database as well as the increase of the resolution of the vertical profiles significantly improved the sampling of the vertical structure of the global ocean combining the argo and altimetry datasets chaigneau et al 2011 have shown that composite methods are efficient in determining the average 3d shape of eddies and isolating classes of eddies in given areas this effort has been made in several regions e g chaigneau et al 2011 in the eastern south pacific ocean keppler et al 2018 in the southwest tropical pacific ocean and de marez et al 2019 in the arabian sea in the latter study the authors computed a composite eddy without a priori assumptions e g a gaussian pressure velocity profile and only from in situ measurements because the composite is a mean of a very varied population it may not in fact be representative of all individual elements of the population however through comparison with altimetric and in situ drifters floats and ship measurements authors showed that the composite cyclonic eddy is fairly representative of the arabian sea s mesoscale cyclones already observed in this paper we investigate the stability of a composite eddy by running a high resolution primitive equation model initialized with a composite cyclone computed in the arabian sea contrary to previous studies we do not use analytical initial conditions the arabian sea in the northern indian ocean between the african and asian landmasses is a region dominated by the monsoon wind regime this regime leads to seasonal along shore current reversals the alongshore currents destabilize and form meanders with 100 200 km wavelengths which eventually detach to form eddies with similar diameters schott and mccreary 2001 wind forcing and baroclinic rossby waves generated at the eastern boundary of the arabian sea can strengthen the eddies and contribute to their propagation al saafani et al 2007 eddies have a strong influence on the regional circulation mesoscale activity is reflected by high values of eddy kinetic energy scharffenberg and stammer 2010 and eddy available potential energy roullet et al 2014 nearly reaching the values in the antarctic circumpolar current or the agulhas current we refer the reader to fig 1 in l hégaret et al 2018 which presents the mean surface circulation in this area and fig 2 in vic et al 2014 for a description of the mean standing eddies there such as the great whirl and the dipole of ra s al hadd this is the first time to our knowledge that the non linear stability study of an isolated eddy is performed using in situ and satellite observed initial conditions here we focus on physical processes underlying the long time evolution of the composite eddy we address the following questions 1 is the composite cyclone stable in the primitive equation framework 2 what are the physical mechanisms involved in the destabilization of the eddy 3 can the destabilization process and the shape of the eddy after destabilization be observed using altimetry and argo data the paper is organized as follows we present the composite eddy and describe the numerical setup and tools used to study the simulation in section 2 we present the results of the simulations and describe the diagnostics performed to analyze the possible sources of instability in section 3 we discuss sensitivity tests of our simulations in section 4 finally the results are discussed in section 5 2 context and methods 2 1 the composite eddy and its environment the composite eddy was extracted using the following procedure 1 mesoscale eddies are detected from a 1 8 altimetric product using the ameda algorithm le vu et al 2018 for the period 2000 2015 2 a colocalization algorithm is then used to detect if an argo float is located in or out of an eddy 3 the background stratification of the region fig 1 is computed by averaging argo profiles located outside the eddies 7885 profiles 4 531 argo profiles collected inside surface intensified cyclonic eddies of radius r d r 3 r d are isolated r d 47 km is the average first baroclinic rossby radius of deformation in the area chelton et al 1998 5 density profiles are computed from argo profiles and density anomalies are obtained by subtracting the background density in the area 6 a dimensionless radial position r d r r is computed for each profile where d r is the distance between the center of the eddy and the position of the colocalized profile d r and r is the radius of the eddy 7 the profiles are averaged depending on their value of r in bins of width δ r 0 05 yielding a composite vertical section of density anomaly ρ r z 8 for each depth the density anomaly ρ r z is smoothed using a gaussian kernel of width 0 3 9 finally this composite is extrapolated into a 3d structure by assuming azimuthal symmetry the horizontal extent of the composite is re dimensionalized by the mean radius of all eddies used for the computation of the composite r 100 km the structure of the composite cyclonic eddy is thus defined in terms of a density anomaly distribution the sum of the density anomaly of the composite and the background stratification is shown in fig 2 following the same procedure a composite structure of salinity anomaly is computed fig 2b de marez et al 2019 show that these structures are representative of the typical mesoscale eddies observed in the arabian sea details of the composite cyclonic eddy calculation and the associated validation are fully described in de marez et al 2019 we compute the temperature anomaly field from the composite salinity and density using the gibbs seawater gsw oceanographic toolbox mcdougall and barker 2011 which uses the teos 10 equation of state for seawater fig 2 a the background profiles shown in fig 1 a are then added to the temperature and salinity anomaly fields note that the surface mixed layer is initially not present the velocity field is obtained via the cyclogeostrophic balance following the procedure described in penven et al 2014 see fig 2 right the numerical simulations are initialized with the temperature salinity and velocity fields corresponding to the composite eddy it is worth mentioning that by definition the composite eddy has a coarse resolution 1 on the horizontal direction the averages of argo collected density profiles are made in bins of size δ r 0 05 once re dimensionalized this corresponds to a horizontal resolution of the composite eddy of 5 km since we perform high resolution numerical simulations the composite eddy is interpolated on the fine grid of the simulation using a cubic interpolation 2 on the vertical direction while the vertical resolution of argo float profiles is irregular and o 10 m they were interpolated on a regularly spaced vertical grid with a vertical spacing of 4 4 m the composite is then linearly interpolated on the finer vertical grid of the simulation in the simulation we will discuss small scale variations of density and velocity are of o 5 km on the horizontal and o 10 m on the vertical such small scale features thus occur at scales that the composite computation could not capture the eddy is intensified at the surface but has a deep reaching influence down to about 1000 m depth its horizontal shape corresponds to a shielded vorticity monopole a positive core of vorticity and a shield of negative vorticity see inset in fig 2 its radius r 100 km is large compared to the mean regional r d 47 km the burger number defined as b u r d r 2 scales as b u 47 100 2 0 25 1 in the following mentions to submesoscale refer to features and processes occurring at scales that are small compared to r d i e b u 1 typically the fronts and vortices generated around the eddy have a typical scale of o 10 km they are submesoscale features the coriolis parameter is kept constant in the simulations f plane using the regional average value latitude of 23 n f 0 5 2 1 0 5 s 1 the initial condition s rossby number is small r o u max f 0 r max 0 13 with u max the maximal velocity at r max thus r o b u is finite and the eddy is frontal stegner and dritschel 2000 however it has been shown that the dynamical rossby number ϵ ζ f 0 with ζ the relative vorticity is a more pertinent parameter to study geostrophic and ageostrophic dynamics in vortices stegner and dritschel 2000 in our case ϵ 0 3 in the core of the eddy at initialization finally the froude number is f r ϵ b u 0 6 2 2 numerical setup to study the dynamics of the composite cyclonic eddy described in section 2 1 we perform spindown idealized simulations with the surface fluxes set to zero using the coastal and regional ocean community model croco shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 it solves the hydrostatic primitive equations pe for the velocity u u v w temperature t and salinity s using a full equation of state for seawater shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2011 the potential density referenced at the surface ρ is computed offline from t and s using the teos 10 equation of state for seawater from the potential density we also compute the brunt väisälä frequency defined by n g ρ 0 ρ z with g 9 81 m s 2 and ρ 0 the mean density in the domain the simulations performed integrate the pe for about 300 days on the f plane with a time step d t 120 s respecting the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion the numerical settings are similar to previous simulations performed in idealized contexts ménesguen et al 2018 horizontal advection terms for tracers and momentum are discretized with fifth order upwind advection schemes up5 the horizontal viscosity and diffusivity are set to zero since the up5 scheme damps dispersive errors the vertical advection is discretized with a fourth order centered parabolic spline reconstruction splines scheme the vertical closure is done by adding a small vertical diffusion in the interior using a k profile parameterization kpp large et al 1994 further discussion about these parameterizations can be found in klein et al 2008 or ménesguen et al 2018 the kpp scheme generates a thin surface mixed layer during the first days of the simulation the latter is not present in the background stratification at initialization because it is computed as an average throughout the whole year once created from t 20 days the surface mixed layer does not evolve and it is consistent with the surface mixed layer observed in the density profiles of the arabian sea except during the winter it has a vertical extension of about 30 m depth and can be seen in fig 1 the domain size is 500 500 km on the horizontal taking a flat bottom at a depth of 1500 m is enough because the eddy has a vertical extension of about 1000 m we set open boundary conditions at the edges of the domain this allows the radiation of gravity waves generated during the initial adjustment of the eddy these waves are evacuated out of the domain at t 1 day the vertical and horizontal resolutions are chosen to accurately resolve the frontal dynamics and the forward energy cascade at the surface the simulation has 256 vertical levels stretched at the surface such that the vertical resolution is δ z 2 m from the surface to about 400 m depth deeper the vertical resolution decreases with δ z 60 m at the bottom this choice was made to observe the vertical structure of the surface dynamics at high resolution the stretching of the vertical levels can be seen in fig 1 right different horizontal resolutions were tested δ x 10 5 2 1 and 0 5 km the primary destabilization of the eddy studied in section 3 2 depends relatively little on the horizontal resolution since it is observed in all simulations for the range of values of δ x considered the diagnosis performed to analyze this primary instability were all done on the δ x 1 km simulation secondary instabilities are observed for the simulations with δ x 2 1 and 0 5 km however the time of apparition and the size of the small scale features e g the submesoscale vortices differ in these simulations to ensure that the model correctly resolves the frontal processes occurring at t 100 days and to fully resolve the o 10 km structure the diagnosis of the secondary instabilities see section 3 3 are performed on the δ x 0 5 km simulation for this one the δ x δ z ratio is close to n f 0 near the surface see fig 1 right this avoids the presence of spurious gravity waves associated with intense frontal processes and allows a better resolution of the forward energy cascade snyder et al 1993 nadiga 2014 ménesguen et al 2018 for the study of the primary instability discussed in section 3 2 the eddy is disturbed using two different methods in the first one the only source of perturbation is the numerical noise due to the round off errors at grid scale in the second configuration we add a random noise this noise is not spatially symmetric to avoid the dominant growth of specific azimuthal modes the noise is introduced as a perturbation in the initial density and velocity fields we define the random 2d perturbation p x y as a sum of 5000 random gaussian functions in the horizontal plane p x y i 0 5000 a i e x x 0 i 2 2 σ x i 2 y y 0 i 2 2 σ y i 2 where a i x 0 i y 0 i σ x i and σ y i are chosen randomly and independently for each i with 1 a i 1 50 x 0 i y 0 i 450 km and 5 σ x i σ y i 40 km then the initial density perturbation is computed as ρ n x y z ρ n 0 p x y e z h n with ρ n 0 0 01 kg m 3 and h n 500 m the depth h n 500 m is chosen so that the vertical extent of the perturbation is similar to the vertical extent of the perturbation at t 7 days in the simulation without noise the velocity perturbation is in cyclogeostrophic balance with the ρ n field this avoids the radiation of gravity waves during the first days of the simulation the values of ρ n 0 are chosen so that the domain integral of the random perturbation s kinetic energy e k is about 10 times larger than the kinetic energy of the perturbation at t 7 days in the simulation without noise thus e k t 7 days no noise 1 9 1 0 7 m 5 s 2 and e k t 7 days noise 29 1 0 7 m 5 s 2 notice that the energy of the perturbation is very weak compared to the total kinetic energy in the domain which is about 1 8 1 0 11 m 5 s 2 at the initialization 2 3 definitions and tools for the study of the simulation in this section we describe the diagnostics performed they allow us to characterize the dynamical processes involved in the destabilization of the eddy 2 3 1 different kinds of instabilities the different instabilities which may occur in geophysical flow can be inferred from the potential vorticity structure in the primitive equation framework the relevant definition of potential vorticity is the ertel potential vorticity hereafter pv it is materially conserved in the absence of friction or diapycnal processes hoskins et al 1985 vallis 2017 and is defined as 1 q ω b where b g ρ ρ 0 is the buoyancy and ω is the 3d absolute vorticity of the flow approximated here by ω z v z u ζ f 0 with ζ x v y u its z component relative vorticity hereafter in the following we will use the fully developed expression of the pv 2 q f 0 ζ z b z v x b z u y b an eddy with no vertical shear can be unstable with respect to barotropic bt instability a necessary condition is that its radial gradient of pv r q changes sign on the horizontal i e within a layer of constant density also an eddy can be unstable with respect to baroclinic bc instability the necessary condition is that its radial gradient of pv r q changes sign on the vertical i e between different layers this latter change of sign can occur in the fluid interior phillips type bc instability if isopycnals outcrop surface density gradients generate pv sheets bretherton 1966 which in turn induce sharp pv gradients localized at the surface morel et al 2006 the change of sign of the pv gradient can thus also occur between the surface and the interior charney type bc instability or between two sheet type pv anomalies at the surface and at the bottom eady type instability hoskins et al 1985 in the mixed layer the conditions for bc instability are changed and the theory described above is rather unsatisfactory we refer the reader to young and chen 1995 for further description in geophysical flows symmetric instability si may also occur when the product of planetary vorticity and potential vorticity becomes negative f q 0 fjørtoft 1950 hoskins 1974 bell 2018 this is an overturning instability occurring in baroclinic currents which results from an imbalance between the pressure gradients and the inertial forces thomas et al 2013 it occurs where the dynamic is frontal and where the pv of the flow is negative in the northern hemisphere because of the second and or the third term of its expression eq 2 following thomas et al 2013 a necessary condition for si instability can be derived first we define the balanced richardson number of the flow 3 r i f 0 2 n 2 b 2 and the critical richardson number 4 r i c f 0 ζ g where ζ g is the absolute vorticity of the geostrophic flow such as 5 ζ g f 0 x v g y u g where u g and v g are the zonal and meridional components of the geostrophic velocity in the simulation pv of a geostrophic flow is negative when r i r i c when this condition is met si can develop 2 3 2 energy transfer terms the nature of the instabilities occurring in the flow may be investigated by studying the energy transfers we assume that the flow may be decomposed as u u u where the brackets denote a mean state and the prime is the perturbation relative to this mean state first the transfer from the mean kinetic energy mke to the kinetic energy of the perturbation eke may be expressed as 6 m k e e k e h r s v r s where 7 h r s u 2 x u u v y u v 2 y v u v x v is the contribution from the horizontal reynolds stress and 8 v r s u w z u v w z v is the contribution of the vertical reynolds stress note that eq 6 is obtained by integrating over the whole domain thus formally there are transport terms at the boundaries of the domain in our simulations these terms are null second the transfer from the potential energy of the perturbation to the eke is the vertical buoyancy flux 9 v b f w b the predominance of hrs vrs or vbf 0 in a region indicates a bt kelvin helmholtz type or a bc instability respectively more details on this decomposition and applications to the case of instabilities in the path of the gulf stream can be found in gula et al 2015 2016 in our study we use this decomposition to study 1 the primary instability of the eddy figs 7 and a 17 and 2 the secondary instabilities occurring in the fronts around the eddy figs a 18 and a 19 in the first case the mean flow defined by the variables u v w b is assumed to be the initial state of the eddy this choice allows to study the transfers of energy from the axisymmetric eddy to the perturbation the perturbations u v w b are computed with respect to this initial state then all time averaged products are performed using a rolling time mean average over a 1 month window the growth time of the primary instability see the following section in the second case where we study the energy transfer to small scale structures fronts and submesoscale vortices rotating around the eddy we project the variables in the frame of reference of the perturbation rotating at a constant azimuthal velocity is defined as a rolling time mean average over a 10 days period in the rotating frame the typical timescale of destabilization of the fronts perturbations are computed with respect to this rolling time mean average 2 3 3 normal mode decomposition perturbations are projected into azimuthal normal modes gent and mcwilliams 1986 hereafter the primed quantities denote the perturbation of a with respect to its initial value such as a t x y z a t x y z a t 0 x y z also a m is the decomposition of a into azimuthal normal modes this decomposition is defined as follows 10 a t r θ m 0 m a m t r θ in the polar coordinates referenced at the center of the eddy r θ where 11 a m t r θ a m t r cos m θ ϕ m t r m is the azimuthal wavenumber and a m and ϕ m the amplitude and the phase of the mode respectively the phase velocity of the perturbation for the mode m is 12 c ϕ m t r t ϕ m t r the kinetic energy of the perturbation is defined as 13 e k t 1 2 d x d y d z u r 2 u θ 2 where u r and u θ are the radial and azimuthal velocity perturbations similarly the kinetic energy of the mode m perturbation is 14 e k m t 1 2 d x d y d z u r m 2 u θ m 2 in these two expressions the integrals are performed over the whole domain of the simulation using exponential notation time evolution of normal mode perturbation velocity reads 15 u m t u 0 m e i m θ c t which yields an exponential form for the energy growth 16 e k m t e k 0 m e 2 σ t where e k 0 m is the initial perturbation and σ r e i m c is the growth rate in our case we choose to set e k 0 m e k t 7 days this reference is chosen as close as possible from the beginning of the simulation without having problem with division by zero when computing the growth time in the simulations perturbation growth rates are inferred from the amplification factor λ 17 λ e k m e k m t e k 0 m the growth time is defined as τ e k m σ e k m 1 with 18 σ e k m 1 2 t ln λ e k m then 19 τ e k m t 2 t ln e k m t e k 0 m when τ e k m is small the growth of the perturbation is rapid 2 3 4 critical level computation the position of the critical level for azimuthal mode 2 at the surface is found by seeking the position where the phase speed of the mode 2 perturbations is equal to the angular velocity of the eddy this latter is here an azimuthal average of the azimuthal velocity u θ of the eddy at each time we thus obtain the position of the critical level for the mode 2 we then average this position during the period t 50 70 days to obtain the typical position of the critical level during the linear phase of the perturbation the energy of normal modes can concentrate within the critical level as further described in nguyen et al 2012 or riedinger and gilbert 2014 in our study we show that the presence of the critical level for mode 2 induces an intense stretching of the flow s the latter is defined as the sum of the strain and the shear s x u y v strain x v y u shear it describes the tendency of the water parcels to be deformed by the ambient flow buoyancy gradients are steepened by this stretching to describe the evolution of buoyancy gradients we use the frontogenesis function f associated with the buoyancy it is calculated using its standard definition as follows hoskins 1982 20 f u b x u x b 2 x v y u x b y b y v y b 2 the opposite of f indicates the tendency of the buoyancy gradients to steepen f u b d d t b 2 3 results 3 1 overall course of the simulation we present here the overall course of the simulation and we separate the different stages of the eddy evolution that we will discuss in the following sections fig 3 shows the evolution of relative vorticity after 70 100 180 and 300 days of simulation panels a b c and d respectively during the first part of the simulation for 0 t 100 days a mixed bt bc instability causes the eddy core to deform as spiral arms grow around it see fig 3 a azimuthal mode 2 dominates and the growth rate of the perturbation is roughly constant the bc component of the instability leads to an intense frontogenesis at the edge of the eddy and in the spiral arms see fig 3 b then secondary instabilities occur in the surface mixed layer see fig 3 c in particular shear instability develops in the spiral arms generating series of small vortices of o 10 km the steepening of buoyancy gradients at the edge of the eddy also induces diapycnal mixing this causes pv to change sign and yields si the latter erodes the edge of the eddy by creating fine scale structures of o 2 km which are then ejected far away from the eddy see fig 3 d while secondary instabilities occur the deepest part of the eddy z 50 m remains a mesoscale tripole it remains coherent during the last 6 months of the simulation in section 3 2 we describe the evolution of the cyclone from t 0 to t 100 days then we present the secondary instabilities which occur in the surface mixed layer in section 3 3 3 2 primary instability the monopole becomes a tripole 3 2 1 growth of normal modes during the first 100 days of the simulation the eddy destabilizes with a domination of even azimuthal modes to study the evolution of the perturbation we compute its total kinetic energy at all times following eq 13 and for each azimuthal mode following eq 14 see fig 4 the simulation without initial noise is compared to the simulation with a random noise no difference is discernible in terms of growth of the perturbation between the two cases showing that the structure is intrinsically unstable regardless of the initial perturbations the total kinetic energy of the perturbation increases slowly at the first days of simulations it then grows exponentially after t 50 days and tends to a plateau at t 150 days the even modes have similar growth rates in the two simulations in particular the azimuthal mode 2 dominates with values of energy close to the total energy of the perturbation in the simulation where initial conditions are initially perturbed by a random noise odd azimuthal modes are present at the initialization these modes do not grow during the primary stage of the instability meaning that they are stable the processes involved in the primary destabilization of the eddy are well captured by the simulation without noise in the following we focus on the simulations performed without random noise the growth time of the perturbation is computed using eq 19 for the total kinetic energy of the perturbation for modes 2 4 and 6 fig 5 the growth time of the total kinetic energy of the perturbation i e for all modes is on average around 30 days from the beginning of the simulation the growth time of mode 2 is almost equal to the growth time of the total perturbation confirming that the instability is controlled by mode 2 its growth time is roughly constant between day 50 and day 90 indicating that during this stage mode 2 growth is exponential and evolves independently of the other modes gent and mcwilliams 1986 at the beginning of the simulation transient perturbations occur in the core of the eddy mostly stemming from the initial adjustment of the eddy they are evanescent and rapidly decay riedinger and gilbert 2014 however during the first 20 days their energy has similar magnitude to that of the unstable mode 2 they are believed to trigger mode 2 we next focus on the evolution of mode 2 since it dominates the instability one can mention that for higher modes nonlinear interactions most likely occur their growth rates are not constant and have a similar evolution between each other 3 2 2 instability mechanism the radial pv gradient r q is shown in fig 6 the horizontal change of sign of r q in the whole water column indicates that the structure may be barotropically unstable at the center of the eddy isopycnals outcrop not shown thus creating regions of high pv intersection lines between the surface and outcropping isopycnals are places of strong horizontal pv gradients it can be seen in fig 6 at z 3 m this leads to a change of sign of r q in the vertical direction between the surface and the interior pv gradients the necessary condition for a charney type bc instability the general stability conditions described by pedlosky 1964 eliassen 1983 hoskins et al 1985 and ripa 1991 stating that u θ α r q 0 and n 2 δ z ρ 2 u θ α 2 in the whole domain for any α with δ z ρ the vertical displacement of isopycnals are also not respected in the whole domain not shown all necessary conditions for bt or bc instabilities to occur are thus met such mixed bt bc instabilities have already been observed in high resolution numerical simulations in particular in the case of meddy like eddies see for instance ménesguen et al 2018 here while the instability is mainly bt it is strengthened by a small baroclinic mode near the surface the energy transfer terms hrs vrs and vbf integrated along the horizontal directions are shown in fig 7 during the growth of the instability hrs and vbf dominate confirming that the instability is both bt and bc as predicted by the structure of the pv profile fig 6 the hrs term is deep reaching and shows that the bt instability dominates the formation of the tripole this instability penetrates deeply and drives the formation of the tripole in the whole water column during the first 100 days of the simulation the structure of the tripole at depth can be seen in fig 3 d with a strong barotropic component of the positive and negative poles and an outer ring of positive vorticity i e the spiral arms the vbf term is maximum near the surface at the interface between the sml and the interior this suggests that the instability is intensified by a bc component at the surface maps of vertically integrated transfer terms are presented in appendix a in fig a 17 in summary together figs 7 and a 17 show that the bc instability participates in forming intense spiral arms in the sml while the bt instability leads to the deformation of the core of the eddy to understand the destabilization of the eddy one can notice that the propagation of the unstable mode 2 is that of a vortex rossby wave vrw rotating around the eddy this wave is supported by the radial gradient of pv of the eddy this process is similar to planetary rossby waves in the ocean supported by the meridional pv gradient induced by the β effect the signature of the vrw in the simulation can be seen in the mode 2 component of the ssh the vrw rotates about a quarter turn in 30 days fig 8 giving c v r w 0 05 rad days 1 this value is consistent with the estimation of the phase speed of a baroclinic perturbation rotating around a unstable barotropic eddy in the quasi geostrophic framework see appendix b the mode 2 vrw exhibits different patterns depending on its position from the center of the eddy see fig 9 it can be separated into two vrw rotating around the eddy at the same speed an outer vrw ovrw at r 100 km and an inner vrw ivrw at r 100 km they are phase shifted the ovrw is in advance compared to the ivrw as these two waves interact they amplify mutually and the total perturbation rotating around the eddy grows flierl 1988 3 2 3 critical level consequences the presence of a critical level cl for mode 2 leads to an important frontogenesis at the edge of the eddy and in the spiral arms as discussed in nguyen et al 2012 the azimuthal speed of the vrw which carry the perturbation is small compared to the maximal swirl angular velocity of the eddy the critical level is thus located far from the center of the eddy where its swirl velocity decreases outward here on average at r 120 km this value was obtained during the linear stage following the method described in section 2 3 4 at the initial stage of the instability for t 40 60 days the perturbation is wrapped around the eddy in the form of long vorticity filaments near the critical level position fig 10 at this time the eddy is still mostly circular since the radial velocity is weak then the mode 2 component of radial velocity u r grows it reaches a value of several kilometer per day see fig 10 since it is nearly in phase quadrature with the vorticity this radial velocity perturbation leads to the ellipticization of the eddy and to the creation of spiral arms around the eddy at t 100 days after the linear stage of the mode 2 perturbation the eddy becomes elliptical and two spiral arms form these arms are very thin since they were initially elongated around the cl stretching dominates the flow at the edge of the eddy and in the spiral arms fig 11 a the flow generated by the primary instability thus forces the gradients to steepen in particular the buoyancy gradients the frontogenesis function f associated with the buoyancy is computed at the surface and it is shown in fig 11 b in the spiral arms and at the edges of the eddy f is large it reflects the steepening of the buoyancy gradients with time thus the flow follows a frontal dynamic in these areas the isopycnals outcrop and are very steep furthermore the dynamical rossby number ϵ ζ f 0 becomes locally larger than 1 see fig 3 indicating that the circulation is mostly ageostrophic in these regions stegner and dritschel 2000 these observations are in agreement with the results of nguyen et al 2012 and hua et al 2013 who show that density gradients are enhanced at critical levels 3 3 secondary instabilities and their impact on small scale structures the primary bt bc instability saturates at t 120 days after the initial monopole has evolved into a stable tripole this tripole remains stable during the next 6 months of the simulation below the surface mixed layer inside the surface mixed layer the intense frontogenesis leads to sharp fronts near the surface the small scale structures located in the surface mixed layer follow a surface quasi geostrophic sqg dynamic because they have a small horizontal size these surface features have a small vertical influence indeed in the framework of the sqg model following isern fontanet et al 2008 the streamfunction is ψ s q g e n 0 k f 0 z where k is the horizontal wavenumber at the surface the smaller horizontal scales decay in the vertical faster than larger ones the vertical extension of surface structures scales as l z f 0 l 2 π n 0 f 0 where l is the horizontal size of surface features and n 0 1 0 2 s 1 the typical stratification leading to l z 1 0 3 l in our case filaments and submesoscale vortices which evolve at the surface have a size of o 10 km therefore they have a vertical influence over o 10 m this vertical scale applies to the stratified fluid below the surface mixed layer it shows that the submesoscale is largely confined to the mixed layer as it can be seen in fig 3 at t 100 days 3 3 1 barotropic instability at the surface as a source of submesoscale in the spiral arms the steep pv gradients create favorable conditions for bt instability bt instability occurs in a thin surface mixed layer in which the flow is confined and leads to the destabilization of the spiral arms at t 110 days a mean pv section of a spiral arm fig 12 b was computed by averaging 10 vertical sections at t 110 days fig 12 a the pv anomaly of the spiral arm is confined in the upper 10 m the cross filament derivative of the pv l q changes sign along the section signature of bt instability fig 12 c small ambient perturbations trigger instability forming a row of small vortices of positive relative vorticity the first ones appear at t 110 days at the tip of the arms at t 130 days the whole arms destabilize fig 12 a and evolve into a row of submesoscale vortices surrounding the main eddy fig 3 c a few of the satellite vortices remain coherent for about 6 months the energy transfer terms in the spiral arm are shown in fig a 18 see the calculation method in section 2 3 2 it shows a strong signature of positive hrs in the arm when it becomes unstable confirming that destabilization is due to a purely bt instability in the surface mixed layer these observations show that bt instability of the spiral arms of a large unstable eddy is an efficient mechanism for the formation of submesoscale vortices to investigate the possibility of secondary instability to be triggered by grid scale numerical noise a sensitivity test was performed adding a random noise in the simulation at t 90 days in this case the arms destabilize slightly earlier at t 105 days but in a similar way still forming a row of small vortices as for the primary instability of the vortex the vorticity arms are intrinsically unstable at the edge of the eddy core the cross front pv gradient changes sign on the horizontal as well as on the vertical not shown thus the edge of the eddy is unstable with respect to a mixed bt bc instability because the pv gradients are weaker growth rates are slower than observed in the arms however at t 150 days the small vortices generated around the eddy start to merge with the vortex edge triggering instability this is confirmed by large values of hrs and vbf at the edge where the small eddies interact with the larger one fig a 19 then a short wavelength elliptical vrw propagates around the eddy see the deformation of the eddy s edge in fig 3 c 3 3 2 evidence of symmetric instability at the edge of the eddy a second phase of frontogenesis is triggered as the small scale vrw deforms the front at the edge of the eddy through intense stretching time evolution of the mean f at the surface is shown in fig 13 top at t 160 days steepening of the buoyancy gradient starts to increase for a second time the second and third terms of the pv in eq 2 become very intense locally see e g fig 14 bottom indeed the variations of velocity are localized at the surface and variations of buoyancy occur at scales of o 1 km these terms are negative and of the same order of magnitude as the first term of the pv see fig 14 middle leading to a pv close to zero where the fronts are sharp fig 14 top the horizontal buoyancy variations occur at very fine scales see the contours of f at t 180 days in fig 14 bottom the circulation at the edge of the eddy becomes strongly ageostrophic from t 160 days leading to diapycnal mixing at the edge of the eddy the latter acts in decreasing stratification leading to a pv sign change in our model since diapycnal mixing is parameterized through the kpp scheme we do not attempt to characterize it and rather focus our attention on the dynamical processes resulting of the diapycnal mixing a first explanation for the decrease of the pv due to diapycnal mixing can be found by introducing changes of buoyancy in the expression of the pv we present in appendix c how the pv sign can change if it is initially close to zero a second explanation can be found in the integral formulation of the impermeability theorem derived in haynes and mcintyre 1990 and discussed in morel and mcwilliams 2001 21 d d t ω d ω δ q f d ω d t where ω is a domain with periodic boundary conditions or with no normal flow our case here d ω a volume element δ q the pv anomaly with respect to the pv background and d ω d t the volume variations of the layer this formulation states that the bulk integral of the pv anomaly can only be changed by a loss or a gain of the volume inside a layer comprised between two isopycnals at t 120 days the frontogenesis at the edge of the eddy has led to an isopycnal steepening at the surface in particular the layer between the ρ 1024 4 kg m 3 and the ρ 1024 5 kg m 3 isopycnals is thin and slopes very steeply toward the surface this specific layer is chosen because it represents isopycnals outcropping at the edge of the eddy then after the destabilization of the eddy edge and diapycnal mixing this layer has become thicker and the front is less steep see appendix d fig d 20 following eq 21 this change of thickness leads to the decrease of the bulk integral of the pv which explains the decrease of local pv and the formation of negative pv in fig 13 we present the time evolution of this layer volume it is fairly consistent with the appearance of negative pv the presence of locally negative pv along with an examination of the richardson number show that the edge of the eddy is subject to si the area where r i r i c is indicated in fig 14 top in this area the pv of the geostrophic flow is negative when the pv changes sign due to the second and third terms in eq 2 si develops from t 160 days the edge of the eddy thus becomes strongly deformed by vorticity changes over scales of o 1 km si then propagates inward at the end of the simulation at t 300 days the si pattern is present in the whole core of the eddy at the surface see fig 3 d 4 sensitivity study we have performed other simulations to study the sensitivity of our results to the numerical setup hereafter the reference simulation refers to the simulation on the f plane with a cyclonic eddy δ x 1 km 256 vertical levels and the numerical settings discussed in section 2 2 all the sensitivity tests are performed by varying one or several of these parameters the details of these simulations are not shown in this paper but we mention their most salient features firstly we changed the numerical settings of the model changing the horizontal advection scheme to a third order upwind advection scheme up3 leads to a larger implicit viscosity and the fronts at the surface are less intense and become unstable later than in the reference run fewer small vortices result from the instability and they are less intense if we remove the kpp scheme parameterization in the interior an important noise appears at t 30 days because of a lack of vertical turbulent closure the sensitivity on the boundary conditions has been tested by running the model in a larger domain 1000 2000 km with the eddy initialized at x 0 y 0 400 300 km this does not affect the dynamics of the eddy secondly we performed the reference simulation with a flat bottom at 4000 m with the same number and stretching of vertical levels this does not affect the primary instabilities the growth of mode 2 and the formation of row of small vortices showing that a bottom at 1500 m is sufficient to describe the dynamic of the eddy however the si occurs 30 days earlier this is due to the fact that the spacing between the vertical levels is larger than in the reference run the δ x δ z ratio is not close enough to n f 0 and the frontal dynamic is not well resolved thirdly we tested the cyclone anticyclone asymmetry we initialized the opposite composite density anomaly and recalculated the temperature and the velocity fields associated with it this produces a warm core anticyclonic eddy we put this structure in the same stratification as for the reference simulation and we ran the model we observed a different evolution than for the cyclonic case at t 100 days the anticyclone was still stable and its horizontal shape was similar to its initial shape an azimuthal mode 2 then grew as in the cyclonic case it led to the formation of a tripole with spiral arms at t 280 days then the arms also became unstable and formed submesoscale vortices of negative relative vorticity for the anticyclone the growth of the perturbation was much slower than for the cyclone furthermore the two satellites in the formed tripole were smaller than in the reference simulation this asymmetry can be explained as follows considering the cyclogeostrophic balance a cyclone and an anticyclone cannot have both antisymmetric velocity and density anomalies here we initialized the anticyclone with the density anomaly thus its swirling velocity was smaller than that of the cyclone and the initial anticyclone had a weaker kinetic energy in stegner and dritschel 2000 a comparison between the shape of tripoles obtained from the destabilization of a cyclone and an anticyclone can be seen in their fig 7 finally we performed the reference simulation but now on a β plane with β 2 1 1 0 11 m 1 s 1 the mean value of β in the area of the composite eddy the primary instability of the eddy strongly differs from the f plane simulations after 20 days of simulation the eddy starts drifting northwestward with a trailing rossby wave wake the evolution of the eddy is similar to that shown in fig 3 of mcwilliams et al 1986 then mode 2 grows at t 70 days two asymmetric arms are present around the initial eddy they become unstable similarly as in the reference simulation creating submesoscale vortices around the initial eddy 5 discussion 5 1 on the stability of the composite eddy in this paper we studied the stability of a composite cyclone as revealed by argo floats in the northern arabian sea with this simulation we were able to study numerous kinds of instabilities thanks to very high horizontal and vertical resolutions first we observed that a deep azimuthal mode 2 barotropic instability deforms the eddy which eventually evolves into a tripole after about 4 months of simulation this kind of instability has already been observed for specific 2d analytical barotropic shielded vortices carton and mcwilliams 1989 stegner and dritschel 2000 3d meddy like eddies yim and billant 2015 meunier et al 2015 ménesguen et al 2018 or surface eddies meunier et al 2019 we show that in the vicinity of a realistic eddy intensified at the surface azimuthal mode 2 perturbation is the main driver for its deformation second we showed that a baroclinic instability together with the presence of a critical level for the most unstable mode is the main cause for the generation of a highly ageostrophic flow around the eddy this generates sharp fronts in the surface mixed layer where the rossby number is large ϵ 1 third these fronts become unstable to a barotropic instability in the surface mixed layer this leads to the generation of submesoscale cyclones and filaments this highlights the predominance of secondary instabilities in the evolution of isolated eddies finally our results indicate that symmetric instability may be ubiquitous in large oceanic vortices even cyclonic ones indeed for small b u vortices the critical level is located near the edge of the eddy nguyen et al 2012 where energy is concentrated this leads to the formation of intense fronts near these fronts a strongly imbalanced circulation occurs and yields diapycnal mixing as previously observed in the context of idealized simulations nadiga 2014 brannigan et al 2017 this causes pv to change sign locally and si develops at the edge of the cyclonic eddy this happens when the edge of the eddy becomes unstable due to the interaction between submesoscale vortices and the large eddy it highlights the fact that in the real ocean the interactions between small scale features and large mesoscale eddies may play a key role in the stability of the latter previous studies considering analytical vortices showed that when a vortex is unstable it may break into smaller vortices depending on its initial profile carton et al 1989 stegner and dritschel 2000 a major result of this study is that even if instabilities occur the composite eddy is not destroyed and remains as a large scale coherent structure for the last 6 months of the simulation similar to specific kind of analytical vortices hua et al 2013 ménesguen et al 2018 the composite re stabilizes into a tripolar structure for which the positive vorticity pole is slightly elliptical but coherent 5 2 on the detectability of eddy instabilities to infer the detectability in altimeter products of the series of instabilities described in this paper we computed the ssh signature of the eddy at the beginning and at the end of the simulation using a downgraded resolution similar to the one of the altimetric product fig 15 the signature of the tripole at the end of the simulation is that of an elliptical cyclonic eddy of ellipticity e 0 72 the difference between the tripole and the initial cyclone is very weak with variations of ssh of o 1 cm which is of the order of magnitude of the formal error induced by the spatio temporal interpolation of altimetric products see appendix a in de marez et al 2019 this indicates that the tripolar structures often observed in numerical studies may be present in the ocean but may not be observed due to the coarse resolution of the altimetry the mean ellipticity of eddies used to compute the composite was on average 0 75 the cyclone at the end of the simulation thus has an ellipticity comparable with the ellipticity of eddies observed in altimetric products which were used to compute the composite since the composite was computed assuming axisymetry it is of interest to assess the impact of this hypothesis on the final state of the modeled eddy by computing an azimuthal average fig 16 the differences between the initialization and the final form act over scale of o 10 km on the horizontal and o 10 m on the vertical considering the very coarse resolution of the dataset available to study the 3d structure of eddies e g o 10 km for the altimetric product and o 10 m for argo floats and the error implied by the composite method o 1 5 km chaigneau et al 2011 these differences cannot be seen with in situ data the small scale features we observe during the secondary instabilities can be observed qualitatively on snapshots of true color lévy et al 2018 or of sea surface temperature buckingham et al 2017 however no altimetric product allowing to predict the dynamical quantities at this resolution is currently available this means that neither the primary instability nor the secondary instabilities can be clearly captured in a systematic way using the currently available altimetric and floats data considering ssh only the composite eddy we studied evolves little and fairly represents the eddy observed in the altimetry which can live for several months credit authorship contribution statement charly de marez

improved the contents of this paper model output is available upon request appendix a maps of energy transfer terms see figs a 17 a 19 appendix b estimating the phase velocity of the perturbation in the qg approximation to estimate the value of the phase velocity of the mode 2 perturbation one can use the framework of the continuously stratified quasi geostrophic qg model vallis 2017 we consider a mean state which is a circular barotropic eddy of azimuthal velocity u θ and potential vorticity q we introduce a perturbation in the form of a normal mode of potential vorticity q and current function ψ linearizing the system around the mean state gives pedlosky 2013 b 1 u θ c q ψ q r 0 where c is the azimuthal velocity of the perturbation and q r is the radial derivative of q the potential vorticity of the perturbation is b 2 q δ ψ f 0 2 n 0 2 z ψ l ψ n 0 is the ambient stratification of the flow which is in our case 1 0 2 s 1 using b 1 and b 2 the azimuthal velocity of the perturbation can be expressed as b 3 c u θ ψ q r l ψ for our purpose we only discuss the order of magnitude of the velocity of the perturbation which is b 4 c u θ q r α where α approximates the operator l such as b 5 α 4 π 2 r 2 m r 2 α b t f 0 2 h n 0 2 α b c with m the azimuthal mode of the perturbation r 100 km the radius of the eddy and h 50 m the typical scale of variation of the perturbation the first two terms α b t represent the barotropic perturbation while the third one α b c corresponds to the vortex stretching induced by the baroclinicity of the flow in the case we study here q r u θ m a x r 2 2 with u θ m a x 0 5 m s 1 the value of u θ at r 2 this gives q r 2 1 0 10 m 1 s 1 α b t 1 4 1 0 9 m 2 and α b c 5 1 0 9 m 2 at the edge of the eddy u θ 0 1 m s 1 using eq b 4 gives an estimation of the phase velocity c 0 06 m s 1 this corresponds to a velocity of 0 06 rad days 1 which is in fairly good agreement with the phase velocity computed in the simulation and seen in fig 8 notice that this estimation of the phase velocity depends on the values chosen for each quantity and does not take into account the baroclinicity of the mean flow however it shows that to obtain a proper estimation we need to consider both the bt and the bc components of the perturbation appendix c how can diapycnal mixing change the sign of the pv as pointed in morel and mcwilliams 2001 when mixing does occur it is not easy to predict the change of the pv for a fluid parcel using the ertel form of the pv we assess here how can diapycnal mixing change the sign of the pv in the case of a front localized at the edge of an axisymmetric eddy with no radial velocity one can write the pv in polar coordinates as q ζ a z b z u θ r b with ζ a ζ f 0 if we consider the thermal wind balance this becomes q ζ a z b f 1 r b 2 we study the variations of pv when the buoyancy is modified by diapycnal mixing we introduce δ z b and δ r b the variations of buoyancy respectively along the z and r axis the value of q may thus be approximated by c 1 q δ z b δ z ζ a f 1 δ r b δ r 2 if diapycnal mixing occurs the gradients of buoyancy diminish along the z axis and or the r axis in terms of variations of buoyancy we thus have c 2 δ z b δ z b b z δ r b δ r b b r where b r 0 and b z 0 are the variations of buoyancy induced by the diapycnal mixing they are positive since diapycnal mixing leads to a decrease of the variations of buoyancy we assume here that during the time in which diapycnal mixing occurs the flow does not vary and ζ a thus remains constant this strong assumption is not true at long times when the new circulation is adjusted but it allows to keep the calculation and the reasoning simple we define q as the pv value after the diapycnal mixing introducing the new buoyancy variations c 2 in the expression of the pv c 1 gives q δ z b δ z ζ a f 1 δ r b δ r 2 q b z δ z ζ a f 1 b r δ r 2 2 f 1 δ r b b r δ r 2 the two first terms on the right hand side are the pv before the diapycnal mixing we then define δ q q q the variation of pv during the diapycnal mixing it is expressed such as δ q b z δ z ζ a δ q 1 f 1 b r δ r 2 δ q 2 2 f 1 δ r b b r δ r 2 δ q 3 if the vorticity in the flow is positive and if it is located in the northern hemisphere ζ a 0 thus both δ q 1 and δ q 2 are strictly negative the sign of δ q 3 depends on the sign of δ r b in the case of a front leading to a positive velocity along the θ axis e g at the edge of a cyclone the buoyancy gradients along the r direction are positive then δ q 3 0 and the sign of δ q thus depends on the relative importance of its terms the sign of δ q thus depends on the scale of variations and the values of the gradients for instance in a case where the mixing only occurs on the vertical b r 0 the variation of pv thus reduces to δ q δ q 1 0 in this case the pv decreases if before the mixing it was already close to 0 the decrease of the pv can thus lead to the generation of negative pv where the fluid has been mixed a summary of the possible sign that δ q can take depending on the direction of the current and the direction of the mixing is shown in table c 1 appendix d section of the front at the edge of the eddy see fig d 20 
23992,we investigate the stability of a composite cyclone representative of arabian sea eddies using a high resolution primitive equation model we observe that the eddy is unstable with respect to a mixed barotropic baroclinic instability leading to the growth of an azimuthal mode 2 perturbation the latter deforms the eddy which eventually evolves into a tripole after about 4 months of simulation the presence of a critical level for the most unstable mode generates sharp fronts in the surface mixed layer where the rossby number is large these fronts then become unstable and this generates submesoscale cyclones and filaments near these fronts diapycnal mixing occurs causing the potential vorticity to change sign locally and symmetric instability to develop in the core of the cyclonic eddy despite the instabilities the eddy is not destroyed and remains a large scale coherent structure for the last 6 months of the simulation looking at sea surface height only the composite eddy evolves little and fairly represents the eddy observed in the altimetry which can live for several months the study of this simulation thus illustrates the numerous kinds of instabilities which may occur in large cyclonic eddies but cannot be captured directly by altimetric data keywords mesoscale eddy instability submesoscale vortex 1 introduction mesoscale eddies are a prominent feature of the ocean circulation they have a strong influence on biological activity chelton et al 2011 tracer transport zhang et al 2014 and physical and chemical properties of the water column dong et al 2014 examples of long lived coherent and recurrent mesoscale eddies can be found in every oceanic basin gulf stream rings in the western north atlantic richardson 1983 meddies in the eastern north atlantic

current eddies in the gulf of mexico meunier et al 2018 the ras al hadd dipole in the northern arabian sea l hégaret et al 2015 2016 all play an important role in the transport of heat and salt mesoscale eddies have been intensively studied over the past 60 years in particular many studies have focused on their stability properties using linear stability analysis gent and mcwilliams 1986 mcwilliams et al 1986 nguyen et al 2012 yim and billant 2015 and numerical models to study the finite amplitude evolution of unstable perturbations carton and mcwilliams 1989 stegner and dritschel 2000 ménesguen et al 2018 in these studies eddies are modeled using analytical profiles e g shielded vortices rankine vortices carton and mcwilliams 1989 stegner and dritschel 2000 gaussian vortices mcwilliams 1985 or lorentzian vortices hua et al 2013 meunier et al 2018 assuming that they represent a large range of observed eddies le vu et al 2018 the result of these stability analyses is strongly dependent on the initial profile imposed in most cases the eddy profiles are unstable and can lead to the destruction of the eddy the formation of dipoles tripoles or the long time decay of the eddy carton et al 1989 stegner and dritschel 2000 the increase of computational capabilities has led recent studies to implement very high resolution stability analyses in a 3d context this allows the study of vortex stability beyond balanced mesoscale processes and to observe how submesoscale features can emerge from the destabilization of mesoscale structures brannigan et al 2017 ménesguen et al 2018 such studies highlight a possible mechanism for the forward cascade of energy toward small scales in the past few years it has become possible to determine the actual shape of oceanic eddies with a fairly good spatio temporal resolution gridded multi satellite altimetric products provide increased horizontal resolution up to 1 8 and resolve more accurately eddies with radii two or three times the first baroclinic rossby radius of deformation r d hereafter than older products with coarser horizontal resolution 1 3 or 1 4 the rapid growth of the argo database as well as the increase of the resolution of the vertical profiles significantly improved the sampling of the vertical structure of the global ocean combining the argo and altimetry datasets chaigneau et al 2011 have shown that composite methods are efficient in determining the average 3d shape of eddies and isolating classes of eddies in given areas this effort has been made in several regions e g chaigneau et al 2011 in the eastern south pacific ocean keppler et al 2018 in the southwest tropical pacific ocean and de marez et al 2019 in the arabian sea in the latter study the authors computed a composite eddy without a priori assumptions e g a gaussian pressure velocity profile and only from in situ measurements because the composite is a mean of a very varied population it may not in fact be representative of all individual elements of the population however through comparison with altimetric and in situ drifters floats and ship measurements authors showed that the composite cyclonic eddy is fairly representative of the arabian sea s mesoscale cyclones already observed in this paper we investigate the stability of a composite eddy by running a high resolution primitive equation model initialized with a composite cyclone computed in the arabian sea contrary to previous studies we do not use analytical initial conditions the arabian sea in the northern indian ocean between the african and asian landmasses is a region dominated by the monsoon wind regime this regime leads to seasonal along shore current reversals the alongshore currents destabilize and form meanders with 100 200 km wavelengths which eventually detach to form eddies with similar diameters schott and mccreary 2001 wind forcing and baroclinic rossby waves generated at the eastern boundary of the arabian sea can strengthen the eddies and contribute to their propagation al saafani et al 2007 eddies have a strong influence on the regional circulation mesoscale activity is reflected by high values of eddy kinetic energy scharffenberg and stammer 2010 and eddy available potential energy roullet et al 2014 nearly reaching the values in the antarctic circumpolar current or the agulhas current we refer the reader to fig 1 in l hégaret et al 2018 which presents the mean surface circulation in this area and fig 2 in vic et al 2014 for a description of the mean standing eddies there such as the great whirl and the dipole of ra s al hadd this is the first time to our knowledge that the non linear stability study of an isolated eddy is performed using in situ and satellite observed initial conditions here we focus on physical processes underlying the long time evolution of the composite eddy we address the following questions 1 is the composite cyclone stable in the primitive equation framework 2 what are the physical mechanisms involved in the destabilization of the eddy 3 can the destabilization process and the shape of the eddy after destabilization be observed using altimetry and argo data the paper is organized as follows we present the composite eddy and describe the numerical setup and tools used to study the simulation in section 2 we present the results of the simulations and describe the diagnostics performed to analyze the possible sources of instability in section 3 we discuss sensitivity tests of our simulations in section 4 finally the results are discussed in section 5 2 context and methods 2 1 the composite eddy and its environment the composite eddy was extracted using the following procedure 1 mesoscale eddies are detected from a 1 8 altimetric product using the ameda algorithm le vu et al 2018 for the period 2000 2015 2 a colocalization algorithm is then used to detect if an argo float is located in or out of an eddy 3 the background stratification of the region fig 1 is computed by averaging argo profiles located outside the eddies 7885 profiles 4 531 argo profiles collected inside surface intensified cyclonic eddies of radius r d r 3 r d are isolated r d 47 km is the average first baroclinic rossby radius of deformation in the area chelton et al 1998 5 density profiles are computed from argo profiles and density anomalies are obtained by subtracting the background density in the area 6 a dimensionless radial position r d r r is computed for each profile where d r is the distance between the center of the eddy and the position of the colocalized profile d r and r is the radius of the eddy 7 the profiles are averaged depending on their value of r in bins of width δ r 0 05 yielding a composite vertical section of density anomaly ρ r z 8 for each depth the density anomaly ρ r z is smoothed using a gaussian kernel of width 0 3 9 finally this composite is extrapolated into a 3d structure by assuming azimuthal symmetry the horizontal extent of the composite is re dimensionalized by the mean radius of all eddies used for the computation of the composite r 100 km the structure of the composite cyclonic eddy is thus defined in terms of a density anomaly distribution the sum of the density anomaly of the composite and the background stratification is shown in fig 2 following the same procedure a composite structure of salinity anomaly is computed fig 2b de marez et al 2019 show that these structures are representative of the typical mesoscale eddies observed in the arabian sea details of the composite cyclonic eddy calculation and the associated validation are fully described in de marez et al 2019 we compute the temperature anomaly field from the composite salinity and density using the gibbs seawater gsw oceanographic toolbox mcdougall and barker 2011 which uses the teos 10 equation of state for seawater fig 2 a the background profiles shown in fig 1 a are then added to the temperature and salinity anomaly fields note that the surface mixed layer is initially not present the velocity field is obtained via the cyclogeostrophic balance following the procedure described in penven et al 2014 see fig 2 right the numerical simulations are initialized with the temperature salinity and velocity fields corresponding to the composite eddy it is worth mentioning that by definition the composite eddy has a coarse resolution 1 on the horizontal direction the averages of argo collected density profiles are made in bins of size δ r 0 05 once re dimensionalized this corresponds to a horizontal resolution of the composite eddy of 5 km since we perform high resolution numerical simulations the composite eddy is interpolated on the fine grid of the simulation using a cubic interpolation 2 on the vertical direction while the vertical resolution of argo float profiles is irregular and o 10 m they were interpolated on a regularly spaced vertical grid with a vertical spacing of 4 4 m the composite is then linearly interpolated on the finer vertical grid of the simulation in the simulation we will discuss small scale variations of density and velocity are of o 5 km on the horizontal and o 10 m on the vertical such small scale features thus occur at scales that the composite computation could not capture the eddy is intensified at the surface but has a deep reaching influence down to about 1000 m depth its horizontal shape corresponds to a shielded vorticity monopole a positive core of vorticity and a shield of negative vorticity see inset in fig 2 its radius r 100 km is large compared to the mean regional r d 47 km the burger number defined as b u r d r 2 scales as b u 47 100 2 0 25 1 in the following mentions to submesoscale refer to features and processes occurring at scales that are small compared to r d i e b u 1 typically the fronts and vortices generated around the eddy have a typical scale of o 10 km they are submesoscale features the coriolis parameter is kept constant in the simulations f plane using the regional average value latitude of 23 n f 0 5 2 1 0 5 s 1 the initial condition s rossby number is small r o u max f 0 r max 0 13 with u max the maximal velocity at r max thus r o b u is finite and the eddy is frontal stegner and dritschel 2000 however it has been shown that the dynamical rossby number ϵ ζ f 0 with ζ the relative vorticity is a more pertinent parameter to study geostrophic and ageostrophic dynamics in vortices stegner and dritschel 2000 in our case ϵ 0 3 in the core of the eddy at initialization finally the froude number is f r ϵ b u 0 6 2 2 numerical setup to study the dynamics of the composite cyclonic eddy described in section 2 1 we perform spindown idealized simulations with the surface fluxes set to zero using the coastal and regional ocean community model croco shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 it solves the hydrostatic primitive equations pe for the velocity u u v w temperature t and salinity s using a full equation of state for seawater shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2011 the potential density referenced at the surface ρ is computed offline from t and s using the teos 10 equation of state for seawater from the potential density we also compute the brunt väisälä frequency defined by n g ρ 0 ρ z with g 9 81 m s 2 and ρ 0 the mean density in the domain the simulations performed integrate the pe for about 300 days on the f plane with a time step d t 120 s respecting the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion the numerical settings are similar to previous simulations performed in idealized contexts ménesguen et al 2018 horizontal advection terms for tracers and momentum are discretized with fifth order upwind advection schemes up5 the horizontal viscosity and diffusivity are set to zero since the up5 scheme damps dispersive errors the vertical advection is discretized with a fourth order centered parabolic spline reconstruction splines scheme the vertical closure is done by adding a small vertical diffusion in the interior using a k profile parameterization kpp large et al 1994 further discussion about these parameterizations can be found in klein et al 2008 or ménesguen et al 2018 the kpp scheme generates a thin surface mixed layer during the first days of the simulation the latter is not present in the background stratification at initialization because it is computed as an average throughout the whole year once created from t 20 days the surface mixed layer does not evolve and it is consistent with the surface mixed layer observed in the density profiles of the arabian sea except during the winter it has a vertical extension of about 30 m depth and can be seen in fig 1 the domain size is 500 500 km on the horizontal taking a flat bottom at a depth of 1500 m is enough because the eddy has a vertical extension of about 1000 m we set open boundary conditions at the edges of the domain this allows the radiation of gravity waves generated during the initial adjustment of the eddy these waves are evacuated out of the domain at t 1 day the vertical and horizontal resolutions are chosen to accurately resolve the frontal dynamics and the forward energy cascade at the surface the simulation has 256 vertical levels stretched at the surface such that the vertical resolution is δ z 2 m from the surface to about 400 m depth deeper the vertical resolution decreases with δ z 60 m at the bottom this choice was made to observe the vertical structure of the surface dynamics at high resolution the stretching of the vertical levels can be seen in fig 1 right different horizontal resolutions were tested δ x 10 5 2 1 and 0 5 km the primary destabilization of the eddy studied in section 3 2 depends relatively little on the horizontal resolution since it is observed in all simulations for the range of values of δ x considered the diagnosis performed to analyze this primary instability were all done on the δ x 1 km simulation secondary instabilities are observed for the simulations with δ x 2 1 and 0 5 km however the time of apparition and the size of the small scale features e g the submesoscale vortices differ in these simulations to ensure that the model correctly resolves the frontal processes occurring at t 100 days and to fully resolve the o 10 km structure the diagnosis of the secondary instabilities see section 3 3 are performed on the δ x 0 5 km simulation for this one the δ x δ z ratio is close to n f 0 near the surface see fig 1 right this avoids the presence of spurious gravity waves associated with intense frontal processes and allows a better resolution of the forward energy cascade snyder et al 1993 nadiga 2014 ménesguen et al 2018 for the study of the primary instability discussed in section 3 2 the eddy is disturbed using two different methods in the first one the only source of perturbation is the numerical noise due to the round off errors at grid scale in the second configuration we add a random noise this noise is not spatially symmetric to avoid the dominant growth of specific azimuthal modes the noise is introduced as a perturbation in the initial density and velocity fields we define the random 2d perturbation p x y as a sum of 5000 random gaussian functions in the horizontal plane p x y i 0 5000 a i e x x 0 i 2 2 σ x i 2 y y 0 i 2 2 σ y i 2 where a i x 0 i y 0 i σ x i and σ y i are chosen randomly and independently for each i with 1 a i 1 50 x 0 i y 0 i 450 km and 5 σ x i σ y i 40 km then the initial density perturbation is computed as ρ n x y z ρ n 0 p x y e z h n with ρ n 0 0 01 kg m 3 and h n 500 m the depth h n 500 m is chosen so that the vertical extent of the perturbation is similar to the vertical extent of the perturbation at t 7 days in the simulation without noise the velocity perturbation is in cyclogeostrophic balance with the ρ n field this avoids the radiation of gravity waves during the first days of the simulation the values of ρ n 0 are chosen so that the domain integral of the random perturbation s kinetic energy e k is about 10 times larger than the kinetic energy of the perturbation at t 7 days in the simulation without noise thus e k t 7 days no noise 1 9 1 0 7 m 5 s 2 and e k t 7 days noise 29 1 0 7 m 5 s 2 notice that the energy of the perturbation is very weak compared to the total kinetic energy in the domain which is about 1 8 1 0 11 m 5 s 2 at the initialization 2 3 definitions and tools for the study of the simulation in this section we describe the diagnostics performed they allow us to characterize the dynamical processes involved in the destabilization of the eddy 2 3 1 different kinds of instabilities the different instabilities which may occur in geophysical flow can be inferred from the potential vorticity structure in the primitive equation framework the relevant definition of potential vorticity is the ertel potential vorticity hereafter pv it is materially conserved in the absence of friction or diapycnal processes hoskins et al 1985 vallis 2017 and is defined as 1 q ω b where b g ρ ρ 0 is the buoyancy and ω is the 3d absolute vorticity of the flow approximated here by ω z v z u ζ f 0 with ζ x v y u its z component relative vorticity hereafter in the following we will use the fully developed expression of the pv 2 q f 0 ζ z b z v x b z u y b an eddy with no vertical shear can be unstable with respect to barotropic bt instability a necessary condition is that its radial gradient of pv r q changes sign on the horizontal i e within a layer of constant density also an eddy can be unstable with respect to baroclinic bc instability the necessary condition is that its radial gradient of pv r q changes sign on the vertical i e between different layers this latter change of sign can occur in the fluid interior phillips type bc instability if isopycnals outcrop surface density gradients generate pv sheets bretherton 1966 which in turn induce sharp pv gradients localized at the surface morel et al 2006 the change of sign of the pv gradient can thus also occur between the surface and the interior charney type bc instability or between two sheet type pv anomalies at the surface and at the bottom eady type instability hoskins et al 1985 in the mixed layer the conditions for bc instability are changed and the theory described above is rather unsatisfactory we refer the reader to young and chen 1995 for further description in geophysical flows symmetric instability si may also occur when the product of planetary vorticity and potential vorticity becomes negative f q 0 fjørtoft 1950 hoskins 1974 bell 2018 this is an overturning instability occurring in baroclinic currents which results from an imbalance between the pressure gradients and the inertial forces thomas et al 2013 it occurs where the dynamic is frontal and where the pv of the flow is negative in the northern hemisphere because of the second and or the third term of its expression eq 2 following thomas et al 2013 a necessary condition for si instability can be derived first we define the balanced richardson number of the flow 3 r i f 0 2 n 2 b 2 and the critical richardson number 4 r i c f 0 ζ g where ζ g is the absolute vorticity of the geostrophic flow such as 5 ζ g f 0 x v g y u g where u g and v g are the zonal and meridional components of the geostrophic velocity in the simulation pv of a geostrophic flow is negative when r i r i c when this condition is met si can develop 2 3 2 energy transfer terms the nature of the instabilities occurring in the flow may be investigated by studying the energy transfers we assume that the flow may be decomposed as u u u where the brackets denote a mean state and the prime is the perturbation relative to this mean state first the transfer from the mean kinetic energy mke to the kinetic energy of the perturbation eke may be expressed as 6 m k e e k e h r s v r s where 7 h r s u 2 x u u v y u v 2 y v u v x v is the contribution from the horizontal reynolds stress and 8 v r s u w z u v w z v is the contribution of the vertical reynolds stress note that eq 6 is obtained by integrating over the whole domain thus formally there are transport terms at the boundaries of the domain in our simulations these terms are null second the transfer from the potential energy of the perturbation to the eke is the vertical buoyancy flux 9 v b f w b the predominance of hrs vrs or vbf 0 in a region indicates a bt kelvin helmholtz type or a bc instability respectively more details on this decomposition and applications to the case of instabilities in the path of the gulf stream can be found in gula et al 2015 2016 in our study we use this decomposition to study 1 the primary instability of the eddy figs 7 and a 17 and 2 the secondary instabilities occurring in the fronts around the eddy figs a 18 and a 19 in the first case the mean flow defined by the variables u v w b is assumed to be the initial state of the eddy this choice allows to study the transfers of energy from the axisymmetric eddy to the perturbation the perturbations u v w b are computed with respect to this initial state then all time averaged products are performed using a rolling time mean average over a 1 month window the growth time of the primary instability see the following section in the second case where we study the energy transfer to small scale structures fronts and submesoscale vortices rotating around the eddy we project the variables in the frame of reference of the perturbation rotating at a constant azimuthal velocity is defined as a rolling time mean average over a 10 days period in the rotating frame the typical timescale of destabilization of the fronts perturbations are computed with respect to this rolling time mean average 2 3 3 normal mode decomposition perturbations are projected into azimuthal normal modes gent and mcwilliams 1986 hereafter the primed quantities denote the perturbation of a with respect to its initial value such as a t x y z a t x y z a t 0 x y z also a m is the decomposition of a into azimuthal normal modes this decomposition is defined as follows 10 a t r θ m 0 m a m t r θ in the polar coordinates referenced at the center of the eddy r θ where 11 a m t r θ a m t r cos m θ ϕ m t r m is the azimuthal wavenumber and a m and ϕ m the amplitude and the phase of the mode respectively the phase velocity of the perturbation for the mode m is 12 c ϕ m t r t ϕ m t r the kinetic energy of the perturbation is defined as 13 e k t 1 2 d x d y d z u r 2 u θ 2 where u r and u θ are the radial and azimuthal velocity perturbations similarly the kinetic energy of the mode m perturbation is 14 e k m t 1 2 d x d y d z u r m 2 u θ m 2 in these two expressions the integrals are performed over the whole domain of the simulation using exponential notation time evolution of normal mode perturbation velocity reads 15 u m t u 0 m e i m θ c t which yields an exponential form for the energy growth 16 e k m t e k 0 m e 2 σ t where e k 0 m is the initial perturbation and σ r e i m c is the growth rate in our case we choose to set e k 0 m e k t 7 days this reference is chosen as close as possible from the beginning of the simulation without having problem with division by zero when computing the growth time in the simulations perturbation growth rates are inferred from the amplification factor λ 17 λ e k m e k m t e k 0 m the growth time is defined as τ e k m σ e k m 1 with 18 σ e k m 1 2 t ln λ e k m then 19 τ e k m t 2 t ln e k m t e k 0 m when τ e k m is small the growth of the perturbation is rapid 2 3 4 critical level computation the position of the critical level for azimuthal mode 2 at the surface is found by seeking the position where the phase speed of the mode 2 perturbations is equal to the angular velocity of the eddy this latter is here an azimuthal average of the azimuthal velocity u θ of the eddy at each time we thus obtain the position of the critical level for the mode 2 we then average this position during the period t 50 70 days to obtain the typical position of the critical level during the linear phase of the perturbation the energy of normal modes can concentrate within the critical level as further described in nguyen et al 2012 or riedinger and gilbert 2014 in our study we show that the presence of the critical level for mode 2 induces an intense stretching of the flow s the latter is defined as the sum of the strain and the shear s x u y v strain x v y u shear it describes the tendency of the water parcels to be deformed by the ambient flow buoyancy gradients are steepened by this stretching to describe the evolution of buoyancy gradients we use the frontogenesis function f associated with the buoyancy it is calculated using its standard definition as follows hoskins 1982 20 f u b x u x b 2 x v y u x b y b y v y b 2 the opposite of f indicates the tendency of the buoyancy gradients to steepen f u b d d t b 2 3 results 3 1 overall course of the simulation we present here the overall course of the simulation and we separate the different stages of the eddy evolution that we will discuss in the following sections fig 3 shows the evolution of relative vorticity after 70 100 180 and 300 days of simulation panels a b c and d respectively during the first part of the simulation for 0 t 100 days a mixed bt bc instability causes the eddy core to deform as spiral arms grow around it see fig 3 a azimuthal mode 2 dominates and the growth rate of the perturbation is roughly constant the bc component of the instability leads to an intense frontogenesis at the edge of the eddy and in the spiral arms see fig 3 b then secondary instabilities occur in the surface mixed layer see fig 3 c in particular shear instability develops in the spiral arms generating series of small vortices of o 10 km the steepening of buoyancy gradients at the edge of the eddy also induces diapycnal mixing this causes pv to change sign and yields si the latter erodes the edge of the eddy by creating fine scale structures of o 2 km which are then ejected far away from the eddy see fig 3 d while secondary instabilities occur the deepest part of the eddy z 50 m remains a mesoscale tripole it remains coherent during the last 6 months of the simulation in section 3 2 we describe the evolution of the cyclone from t 0 to t 100 days then we present the secondary instabilities which occur in the surface mixed layer in section 3 3 3 2 primary instability the monopole becomes a tripole 3 2 1 growth of normal modes during the first 100 days of the simulation the eddy destabilizes with a domination of even azimuthal modes to study the evolution of the perturbation we compute its total kinetic energy at all times following eq 13 and for each azimuthal mode following eq 14 see fig 4 the simulation without initial noise is compared to the simulation with a random noise no difference is discernible in terms of growth of the perturbation between the two cases showing that the structure is intrinsically unstable regardless of the initial perturbations the total kinetic energy of the perturbation increases slowly at the first days of simulations it then grows exponentially after t 50 days and tends to a plateau at t 150 days the even modes have similar growth rates in the two simulations in particular the azimuthal mode 2 dominates with values of energy close to the total energy of the perturbation in the simulation where initial conditions are initially perturbed by a random noise odd azimuthal modes are present at the initialization these modes do not grow during the primary stage of the instability meaning that they are stable the processes involved in the primary destabilization of the eddy are well captured by the simulation without noise in the following we focus on the simulations performed without random noise the growth time of the perturbation is computed using eq 19 for the total kinetic energy of the perturbation for modes 2 4 and 6 fig 5 the growth time of the total kinetic energy of the perturbation i e for all modes is on average around 30 days from the beginning of the simulation the growth time of mode 2 is almost equal to the growth time of the total perturbation confirming that the instability is controlled by mode 2 its growth time is roughly constant between day 50 and day 90 indicating that during this stage mode 2 growth is exponential and evolves independently of the other modes gent and mcwilliams 1986 at the beginning of the simulation transient perturbations occur in the core of the eddy mostly stemming from the initial adjustment of the eddy they are evanescent and rapidly decay riedinger and gilbert 2014 however during the first 20 days their energy has similar magnitude to that of the unstable mode 2 they are believed to trigger mode 2 we next focus on the evolution of mode 2 since it dominates the instability one can mention that for higher modes nonlinear interactions most likely occur their growth rates are not constant and have a similar evolution between each other 3 2 2 instability mechanism the radial pv gradient r q is shown in fig 6 the horizontal change of sign of r q in the whole water column indicates that the structure may be barotropically unstable at the center of the eddy isopycnals outcrop not shown thus creating regions of high pv intersection lines between the surface and outcropping isopycnals are places of strong horizontal pv gradients it can be seen in fig 6 at z 3 m this leads to a change of sign of r q in the vertical direction between the surface and the interior pv gradients the necessary condition for a charney type bc instability the general stability conditions described by pedlosky 1964 eliassen 1983 hoskins et al 1985 and ripa 1991 stating that u θ α r q 0 and n 2 δ z ρ 2 u θ α 2 in the whole domain for any α with δ z ρ the vertical displacement of isopycnals are also not respected in the whole domain not shown all necessary conditions for bt or bc instabilities to occur are thus met such mixed bt bc instabilities have already been observed in high resolution numerical simulations in particular in the case of meddy like eddies see for instance ménesguen et al 2018 here while the instability is mainly bt it is strengthened by a small baroclinic mode near the surface the energy transfer terms hrs vrs and vbf integrated along the horizontal directions are shown in fig 7 during the growth of the instability hrs and vbf dominate confirming that the instability is both bt and bc as predicted by the structure of the pv profile fig 6 the hrs term is deep reaching and shows that the bt instability dominates the formation of the tripole this instability penetrates deeply and drives the formation of the tripole in the whole water column during the first 100 days of the simulation the structure of the tripole at depth can be seen in fig 3 d with a strong barotropic component of the positive and negative poles and an outer ring of positive vorticity i e the spiral arms the vbf term is maximum near the surface at the interface between the sml and the interior this suggests that the instability is intensified by a bc component at the surface maps of vertically integrated transfer terms are presented in appendix a in fig a 17 in summary together figs 7 and a 17 show that the bc instability participates in forming intense spiral arms in the sml while the bt instability leads to the deformation of the core of the eddy to understand the destabilization of the eddy one can notice that the propagation of the unstable mode 2 is that of a vortex rossby wave vrw rotating around the eddy this wave is supported by the radial gradient of pv of the eddy this process is similar to planetary rossby waves in the ocean supported by the meridional pv gradient induced by the β effect the signature of the vrw in the simulation can be seen in the mode 2 component of the ssh the vrw rotates about a quarter turn in 30 days fig 8 giving c v r w 0 05 rad days 1 this value is consistent with the estimation of the phase speed of a baroclinic perturbation rotating around a unstable barotropic eddy in the quasi geostrophic framework see appendix b the mode 2 vrw exhibits different patterns depending on its position from the center of the eddy see fig 9 it can be separated into two vrw rotating around the eddy at the same speed an outer vrw ovrw at r 100 km and an inner vrw ivrw at r 100 km they are phase shifted the ovrw is in advance compared to the ivrw as these two waves interact they amplify mutually and the total perturbation rotating around the eddy grows flierl 1988 3 2 3 critical level consequences the presence of a critical level cl for mode 2 leads to an important frontogenesis at the edge of the eddy and in the spiral arms as discussed in nguyen et al 2012 the azimuthal speed of the vrw which carry the perturbation is small compared to the maximal swirl angular velocity of the eddy the critical level is thus located far from the center of the eddy where its swirl velocity decreases outward here on average at r 120 km this value was obtained during the linear stage following the method described in section 2 3 4 at the initial stage of the instability for t 40 60 days the perturbation is wrapped around the eddy in the form of long vorticity filaments near the critical level position fig 10 at this time the eddy is still mostly circular since the radial velocity is weak then the mode 2 component of radial velocity u r grows it reaches a value of several kilometer per day see fig 10 since it is nearly in phase quadrature with the vorticity this radial velocity perturbation leads to the ellipticization of the eddy and to the creation of spiral arms around the eddy at t 100 days after the linear stage of the mode 2 perturbation the eddy becomes elliptical and two spiral arms form these arms are very thin since they were initially elongated around the cl stretching dominates the flow at the edge of the eddy and in the spiral arms fig 11 a the flow generated by the primary instability thus forces the gradients to steepen in particular the buoyancy gradients the frontogenesis function f associated with the buoyancy is computed at the surface and it is shown in fig 11 b in the spiral arms and at the edges of the eddy f is large it reflects the steepening of the buoyancy gradients with time thus the flow follows a frontal dynamic in these areas the isopycnals outcrop and are very steep furthermore the dynamical rossby number ϵ ζ f 0 becomes locally larger than 1 see fig 3 indicating that the circulation is mostly ageostrophic in these regions stegner and dritschel 2000 these observations are in agreement with the results of nguyen et al 2012 and hua et al 2013 who show that density gradients are enhanced at critical levels 3 3 secondary instabilities and their impact on small scale structures the primary bt bc instability saturates at t 120 days after the initial monopole has evolved into a stable tripole this tripole remains stable during the next 6 months of the simulation below the surface mixed layer inside the surface mixed layer the intense frontogenesis leads to sharp fronts near the surface the small scale structures located in the surface mixed layer follow a surface quasi geostrophic sqg dynamic because they have a small horizontal size these surface features have a small vertical influence indeed in the framework of the sqg model following isern fontanet et al 2008 the streamfunction is ψ s q g e n 0 k f 0 z where k is the horizontal wavenumber at the surface the smaller horizontal scales decay in the vertical faster than larger ones the vertical extension of surface structures scales as l z f 0 l 2 π n 0 f 0 where l is the horizontal size of surface features and n 0 1 0 2 s 1 the typical stratification leading to l z 1 0 3 l in our case filaments and submesoscale vortices which evolve at the surface have a size of o 10 km therefore they have a vertical influence over o 10 m this vertical scale applies to the stratified fluid below the surface mixed layer it shows that the submesoscale is largely confined to the mixed layer as it can be seen in fig 3 at t 100 days 3 3 1 barotropic instability at the surface as a source of submesoscale in the spiral arms the steep pv gradients create favorable conditions for bt instability bt instability occurs in a thin surface mixed layer in which the flow is confined and leads to the destabilization of the spiral arms at t 110 days a mean pv section of a spiral arm fig 12 b was computed by averaging 10 vertical sections at t 110 days fig 12 a the pv anomaly of the spiral arm is confined in the upper 10 m the cross filament derivative of the pv l q changes sign along the section signature of bt instability fig 12 c small ambient perturbations trigger instability forming a row of small vortices of positive relative vorticity the first ones appear at t 110 days at the tip of the arms at t 130 days the whole arms destabilize fig 12 a and evolve into a row of submesoscale vortices surrounding the main eddy fig 3 c a few of the satellite vortices remain coherent for about 6 months the energy transfer terms in the spiral arm are shown in fig a 18 see the calculation method in section 2 3 2 it shows a strong signature of positive hrs in the arm when it becomes unstable confirming that destabilization is due to a purely bt instability in the surface mixed layer these observations show that bt instability of the spiral arms of a large unstable eddy is an efficient mechanism for the formation of submesoscale vortices to investigate the possibility of secondary instability to be triggered by grid scale numerical noise a sensitivity test was performed adding a random noise in the simulation at t 90 days in this case the arms destabilize slightly earlier at t 105 days but in a similar way still forming a row of small vortices as for the primary instability of the vortex the vorticity arms are intrinsically unstable at the edge of the eddy core the cross front pv gradient changes sign on the horizontal as well as on the vertical not shown thus the edge of the eddy is unstable with respect to a mixed bt bc instability because the pv gradients are weaker growth rates are slower than observed in the arms however at t 150 days the small vortices generated around the eddy start to merge with the vortex edge triggering instability this is confirmed by large values of hrs and vbf at the edge where the small eddies interact with the larger one fig a 19 then a short wavelength elliptical vrw propagates around the eddy see the deformation of the eddy s edge in fig 3 c 3 3 2 evidence of symmetric instability at the edge of the eddy a second phase of frontogenesis is triggered as the small scale vrw deforms the front at the edge of the eddy through intense stretching time evolution of the mean f at the surface is shown in fig 13 top at t 160 days steepening of the buoyancy gradient starts to increase for a second time the second and third terms of the pv in eq 2 become very intense locally see e g fig 14 bottom indeed the variations of velocity are localized at the surface and variations of buoyancy occur at scales of o 1 km these terms are negative and of the same order of magnitude as the first term of the pv see fig 14 middle leading to a pv close to zero where the fronts are sharp fig 14 top the horizontal buoyancy variations occur at very fine scales see the contours of f at t 180 days in fig 14 bottom the circulation at the edge of the eddy becomes strongly ageostrophic from t 160 days leading to diapycnal mixing at the edge of the eddy the latter acts in decreasing stratification leading to a pv sign change in our model since diapycnal mixing is parameterized through the kpp scheme we do not attempt to characterize it and rather focus our attention on the dynamical processes resulting of the diapycnal mixing a first explanation for the decrease of the pv due to diapycnal mixing can be found by introducing changes of buoyancy in the expression of the pv we present in appendix c how the pv sign can change if it is initially close to zero a second explanation can be found in the integral formulation of the impermeability theorem derived in haynes and mcintyre 1990 and discussed in morel and mcwilliams 2001 21 d d t ω d ω δ q f d ω d t where ω is a domain with periodic boundary conditions or with no normal flow our case here d ω a volume element δ q the pv anomaly with respect to the pv background and d ω d t the volume variations of the layer this formulation states that the bulk integral of the pv anomaly can only be changed by a loss or a gain of the volume inside a layer comprised between two isopycnals at t 120 days the frontogenesis at the edge of the eddy has led to an isopycnal steepening at the surface in particular the layer between the ρ 1024 4 kg m 3 and the ρ 1024 5 kg m 3 isopycnals is thin and slopes very steeply toward the surface this specific layer is chosen because it represents isopycnals outcropping at the edge of the eddy then after the destabilization of the eddy edge and diapycnal mixing this layer has become thicker and the front is less steep see appendix d fig d 20 following eq 21 this change of thickness leads to the decrease of the bulk integral of the pv which explains the decrease of local pv and the formation of negative pv in fig 13 we present the time evolution of this layer volume it is fairly consistent with the appearance of negative pv the presence of locally negative pv along with an examination of the richardson number show that the edge of the eddy is subject to si the area where r i r i c is indicated in fig 14 top in this area the pv of the geostrophic flow is negative when the pv changes sign due to the second and third terms in eq 2 si develops from t 160 days the edge of the eddy thus becomes strongly deformed by vorticity changes over scales of o 1 km si then propagates inward at the end of the simulation at t 300 days the si pattern is present in the whole core of the eddy at the surface see fig 3 d 4 sensitivity study we have performed other simulations to study the sensitivity of our results to the numerical setup hereafter the reference simulation refers to the simulation on the f plane with a cyclonic eddy δ x 1 km 256 vertical levels and the numerical settings discussed in section 2 2 all the sensitivity tests are performed by varying one or several of these parameters the details of these simulations are not shown in this paper but we mention their most salient features firstly we changed the numerical settings of the model changing the horizontal advection scheme to a third order upwind advection scheme up3 leads to a larger implicit viscosity and the fronts at the surface are less intense and become unstable later than in the reference run fewer small vortices result from the instability and they are less intense if we remove the kpp scheme parameterization in the interior an important noise appears at t 30 days because of a lack of vertical turbulent closure the sensitivity on the boundary conditions has been tested by running the model in a larger domain 1000 2000 km with the eddy initialized at x 0 y 0 400 300 km this does not affect the dynamics of the eddy secondly we performed the reference simulation with a flat bottom at 4000 m with the same number and stretching of vertical levels this does not affect the primary instabilities the growth of mode 2 and the formation of row of small vortices showing that a bottom at 1500 m is sufficient to describe the dynamic of the eddy however the si occurs 30 days earlier this is due to the fact that the spacing between the vertical levels is larger than in the reference run the δ x δ z ratio is not close enough to n f 0 and the frontal dynamic is not well resolved thirdly we tested the cyclone anticyclone asymmetry we initialized the opposite composite density anomaly and recalculated the temperature and the velocity fields associated with it this produces a warm core anticyclonic eddy we put this structure in the same stratification as for the reference simulation and we ran the model we observed a different evolution than for the cyclonic case at t 100 days the anticyclone was still stable and its horizontal shape was similar to its initial shape an azimuthal mode 2 then grew as in the cyclonic case it led to the formation of a tripole with spiral arms at t 280 days then the arms also became unstable and formed submesoscale vortices of negative relative vorticity for the anticyclone the growth of the perturbation was much slower than for the cyclone furthermore the two satellites in the formed tripole were smaller than in the reference simulation this asymmetry can be explained as follows considering the cyclogeostrophic balance a cyclone and an anticyclone cannot have both antisymmetric velocity and density anomalies here we initialized the anticyclone with the density anomaly thus its swirling velocity was smaller than that of the cyclone and the initial anticyclone had a weaker kinetic energy in stegner and dritschel 2000 a comparison between the shape of tripoles obtained from the destabilization of a cyclone and an anticyclone can be seen in their fig 7 finally we performed the reference simulation but now on a β plane with β 2 1 1 0 11 m 1 s 1 the mean value of β in the area of the composite eddy the primary instability of the eddy strongly differs from the f plane simulations after 20 days of simulation the eddy starts drifting northwestward with a trailing rossby wave wake the evolution of the eddy is similar to that shown in fig 3 of mcwilliams et al 1986 then mode 2 grows at t 70 days two asymmetric arms are present around the initial eddy they become unstable similarly as in the reference simulation creating submesoscale vortices around the initial eddy 5 discussion 5 1 on the stability of the composite eddy in this paper we studied the stability of a composite cyclone as revealed by argo floats in the northern arabian sea with this simulation we were able to study numerous kinds of instabilities thanks to very high horizontal and vertical resolutions first we observed that a deep azimuthal mode 2 barotropic instability deforms the eddy which eventually evolves into a tripole after about 4 months of simulation this kind of instability has already been observed for specific 2d analytical barotropic shielded vortices carton and mcwilliams 1989 stegner and dritschel 2000 3d meddy like eddies yim and billant 2015 meunier et al 2015 ménesguen et al 2018 or surface eddies meunier et al 2019 we show that in the vicinity of a realistic eddy intensified at the surface azimuthal mode 2 perturbation is the main driver for its deformation second we showed that a baroclinic instability together with the presence of a critical level for the most unstable mode is the main cause for the generation of a highly ageostrophic flow around the eddy this generates sharp fronts in the surface mixed layer where the rossby number is large ϵ 1 third these fronts become unstable to a barotropic instability in the surface mixed layer this leads to the generation of submesoscale cyclones and filaments this highlights the predominance of secondary instabilities in the evolution of isolated eddies finally our results indicate that symmetric instability may be ubiquitous in large oceanic vortices even cyclonic ones indeed for small b u vortices the critical level is located near the edge of the eddy nguyen et al 2012 where energy is concentrated this leads to the formation of intense fronts near these fronts a strongly imbalanced circulation occurs and yields diapycnal mixing as previously observed in the context of idealized simulations nadiga 2014 brannigan et al 2017 this causes pv to change sign locally and si develops at the edge of the cyclonic eddy this happens when the edge of the eddy becomes unstable due to the interaction between submesoscale vortices and the large eddy it highlights the fact that in the real ocean the interactions between small scale features and large mesoscale eddies may play a key role in the stability of the latter previous studies considering analytical vortices showed that when a vortex is unstable it may break into smaller vortices depending on its initial profile carton et al 1989 stegner and dritschel 2000 a major result of this study is that even if instabilities occur the composite eddy is not destroyed and remains as a large scale coherent structure for the last 6 months of the simulation similar to specific kind of analytical vortices hua et al 2013 ménesguen et al 2018 the composite re stabilizes into a tripolar structure for which the positive vorticity pole is slightly elliptical but coherent 5 2 on the detectability of eddy instabilities to infer the detectability in altimeter products of the series of instabilities described in this paper we computed the ssh signature of the eddy at the beginning and at the end of the simulation using a downgraded resolution similar to the one of the altimetric product fig 15 the signature of the tripole at the end of the simulation is that of an elliptical cyclonic eddy of ellipticity e 0 72 the difference between the tripole and the initial cyclone is very weak with variations of ssh of o 1 cm which is of the order of magnitude of the formal error induced by the spatio temporal interpolation of altimetric products see appendix a in de marez et al 2019 this indicates that the tripolar structures often observed in numerical studies may be present in the ocean but may not be observed due to the coarse resolution of the altimetry the mean ellipticity of eddies used to compute the composite was on average 0 75 the cyclone at the end of the simulation thus has an ellipticity comparable with the ellipticity of eddies observed in altimetric products which were used to compute the composite since the composite was computed assuming axisymetry it is of interest to assess the impact of this hypothesis on the final state of the modeled eddy by computing an azimuthal average fig 16 the differences between the initialization and the final form act over scale of o 10 km on the horizontal and o 10 m on the vertical considering the very coarse resolution of the dataset available to study the 3d structure of eddies e g o 10 km for the altimetric product and o 10 m for argo floats and the error implied by the composite method o 1 5 km chaigneau et al 2011 these differences cannot be seen with in situ data the small scale features we observe during the secondary instabilities can be observed qualitatively on snapshots of true color lévy et al 2018 or of sea surface temperature buckingham et al 2017 however no altimetric product allowing to predict the dynamical quantities at this resolution is currently available this means that neither the primary instability nor the secondary instabilities can be clearly captured in a systematic way using the currently available altimetric and floats data considering ssh only the composite eddy we studied evolves little and fairly represents the eddy observed in the altimetry which can live for several months credit authorship contribution statement charly de marez

improved the contents of this paper model output is available upon request appendix a maps of energy transfer terms see figs a 17 a 19 appendix b estimating the phase velocity of the perturbation in the qg approximation to estimate the value of the phase velocity of the mode 2 perturbation one can use the framework of the continuously stratified quasi geostrophic qg model vallis 2017 we consider a mean state which is a circular barotropic eddy of azimuthal velocity u θ and potential vorticity q we introduce a perturbation in the form of a normal mode of potential vorticity q and current function ψ linearizing the system around the mean state gives pedlosky 2013 b 1 u θ c q ψ q r 0 where c is the azimuthal velocity of the perturbation and q r is the radial derivative of q the potential vorticity of the perturbation is b 2 q δ ψ f 0 2 n 0 2 z ψ l ψ n 0 is the ambient stratification of the flow which is in our case 1 0 2 s 1 using b 1 and b 2 the azimuthal velocity of the perturbation can be expressed as b 3 c u θ ψ q r l ψ for our purpose we only discuss the order of magnitude of the velocity of the perturbation which is b 4 c u θ q r α where α approximates the operator l such as b 5 α 4 π 2 r 2 m r 2 α b t f 0 2 h n 0 2 α b c with m the azimuthal mode of the perturbation r 100 km the radius of the eddy and h 50 m the typical scale of variation of the perturbation the first two terms α b t represent the barotropic perturbation while the third one α b c corresponds to the vortex stretching induced by the baroclinicity of the flow in the case we study here q r u θ m a x r 2 2 with u θ m a x 0 5 m s 1 the value of u θ at r 2 this gives q r 2 1 0 10 m 1 s 1 α b t 1 4 1 0 9 m 2 and α b c 5 1 0 9 m 2 at the edge of the eddy u θ 0 1 m s 1 using eq b 4 gives an estimation of the phase velocity c 0 06 m s 1 this corresponds to a velocity of 0 06 rad days 1 which is in fairly good agreement with the phase velocity computed in the simulation and seen in fig 8 notice that this estimation of the phase velocity depends on the values chosen for each quantity and does not take into account the baroclinicity of the mean flow however it shows that to obtain a proper estimation we need to consider both the bt and the bc components of the perturbation appendix c how can diapycnal mixing change the sign of the pv as pointed in morel and mcwilliams 2001 when mixing does occur it is not easy to predict the change of the pv for a fluid parcel using the ertel form of the pv we assess here how can diapycnal mixing change the sign of the pv in the case of a front localized at the edge of an axisymmetric eddy with no radial velocity one can write the pv in polar coordinates as q ζ a z b z u θ r b with ζ a ζ f 0 if we consider the thermal wind balance this becomes q ζ a z b f 1 r b 2 we study the variations of pv when the buoyancy is modified by diapycnal mixing we introduce δ z b and δ r b the variations of buoyancy respectively along the z and r axis the value of q may thus be approximated by c 1 q δ z b δ z ζ a f 1 δ r b δ r 2 if diapycnal mixing occurs the gradients of buoyancy diminish along the z axis and or the r axis in terms of variations of buoyancy we thus have c 2 δ z b δ z b b z δ r b δ r b b r where b r 0 and b z 0 are the variations of buoyancy induced by the diapycnal mixing they are positive since diapycnal mixing leads to a decrease of the variations of buoyancy we assume here that during the time in which diapycnal mixing occurs the flow does not vary and ζ a thus remains constant this strong assumption is not true at long times when the new circulation is adjusted but it allows to keep the calculation and the reasoning simple we define q as the pv value after the diapycnal mixing introducing the new buoyancy variations c 2 in the expression of the pv c 1 gives q δ z b δ z ζ a f 1 δ r b δ r 2 q b z δ z ζ a f 1 b r δ r 2 2 f 1 δ r b b r δ r 2 the two first terms on the right hand side are the pv before the diapycnal mixing we then define δ q q q the variation of pv during the diapycnal mixing it is expressed such as δ q b z δ z ζ a δ q 1 f 1 b r δ r 2 δ q 2 2 f 1 δ r b b r δ r 2 δ q 3 if the vorticity in the flow is positive and if it is located in the northern hemisphere ζ a 0 thus both δ q 1 and δ q 2 are strictly negative the sign of δ q 3 depends on the sign of δ r b in the case of a front leading to a positive velocity along the θ axis e g at the edge of a cyclone the buoyancy gradients along the r direction are positive then δ q 3 0 and the sign of δ q thus depends on the relative importance of its terms the sign of δ q thus depends on the scale of variations and the values of the gradients for instance in a case where the mixing only occurs on the vertical b r 0 the variation of pv thus reduces to δ q δ q 1 0 in this case the pv decreases if before the mixing it was already close to 0 the decrease of the pv can thus lead to the generation of negative pv where the fluid has been mixed a summary of the possible sign that δ q can take depending on the direction of the current and the direction of the mixing is shown in table c 1 appendix d section of the front at the edge of the eddy see fig d 20 
23993,we present an analysis of annual and seasonal mean characteristics of the indian ocean circulation and water masses from 16 global ocean sea ice model simulations that follow the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments core interannual protocol core ii all simulations show a similar large scale tropical current system but with differences in the equatorial undercurrent most core ii models simulate the structure of the cross equatorial cell cec in the indian ocean we uncover a previously unidentified secondary pathway of northward cross equatorial transport along 75 e thus complementing the pathway near the somali coast this secondary pathway is most prominent in the models which represent topography realistically thus suggesting a need for realistic bathymetry in climate models when probing the water mass structure in the upper ocean we find that the salinity profiles are closer to observations in geopotential level models than in isopycnal models more generally we find that biases are model dependent thus suggesting a grouping into model lineage formulation of the surface boundary vertical coordinate and surface salinity restoring refinement in model horizontal resolution one degree versus 1 4 degree does not significantly improve simulations though there are some marginal improvements in the salinity and barrier layer results the results in turn suggest that a focus on improving physical parameterizations e g boundary layer processes may offer more near term advances in indian ocean simulations than refined grid resolution 1 introduction the tropical indian ocean covers the largest part of the warm pool in the global ocean apart from the west pacific it is a key ingredient in the asian monsoons which are a lifeline for billions of people in the rim countries webster et al 1998 the indian ocean has unique features compared to the pacific and atlantic oceans most notably it is bounded to the north by the asian continent thus preventing the northward export of heat into the extratropical region between 30 and 60 n this geographical constraint leads to a basin wide meridional overturning circulation moc a full list of abbreviations is presented in the appendix and a corresponding transport of heat and mass that play a distinctive role in variability of the global climate system chirokova and webster 2006 schott and mccreary 2001 and then schott et al 2009 provided systematic reviews of indian ocean circulation in particular schott et al 2009 noted that much of the literature pertaining to simulations of the indian ocean is focused on specific aspects rather than unifying across the range of features they also pointed out that one hindrance to progress is that existing models are deficient in a number of ways such as the existence of spurious convective overturning enhanced numerical mixing and unrealistic horizontal diffusion if subsurface mixing is not adequately parameterized the simulated thermocline becomes too diffuse this error affects the temperature of the water that upwells and hence the sea surface temperature sst during recent years increases in observational data have been available under the indian ocean observing system indoos program http www clivar org clivar panels indian indoos this is a sustained observing system operated and supported by various national agencies and coordinated internationally through the climate variability and predictability clivar intergovernmental oceanographic commission ioc global ocean observing system goos indian ocean regional panel unlike for the observations a comprehensive analysis of the basin scale oceanographic features from a suite of ocean models for the indian ocean has not been documented the historical simulations using a suite of 16 global ocean ice models forced by the coordinated ocean reference experiments core ii provide an opportunity to study the dynamics of indian ocean under a coordinated modeling framework this manuscript endeavors to describe and evaluate the mean state and seasonal variations of important oceanographic features such as the sst sea surface salinity sss currents thermocline and barrier layer bl we do so with a suite of 16 state of the art global ocean sea ice model simulations with bulk formula based boundary forcing generated from the same atmospheric state there are examples of a number of successful inter comparison activities for the pacific atlantic arctic and southern oceans tseng et al 2017 danabasoglu et al 2014 2016 farneti et al 2015 ilicak et al 2016 however such coordinated modeling efforts have generally been lacking for the indian ocean we therefore aim here at assessing the simulations from forced global ocean models for the indian ocean sst is one of the most important parameters for the evolution and prediction of the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr as it represents the integrated ocean response to the atmosphere in terms of various feedbacks sahai et al 2007 rajeevan et al 2007 2012 yang et al 2007 accurate simulations of indian ocean sst are challenging given the wide variety of intraseasonal seasonal and interannual variability schott and mccreary 2001 schott et al 2009 in addition to variability intrinsic to the indian ocean there are impacts from el niño southern oscillation enso that connect from the pacific ocean annamalai et al 2005 in the north indian ocean nio hereafter enso affects sst variability through an atmospheric bridge that changes cloud cover and thus modifies surface heat fluxes e g klein et al 1999 murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 over the southwestern indian ocean enso forced sst variability arises from oceanic rossby waves generated by anomalous easterly winds that propagate from the east e g xie et al 2002 huang and kinter iii 2002 errors in simulated indian ocean sst adversely affect the ability of coupled prediction models to accurately forecast ismr chowdary et al 2015 2016 chaudhari et al 2013 levine and turner 2012 the core ii simulations do not use explicit relaxation to observed sst however since air temperature is specified as part of the core ii atmospheric state there is an effective restoring flux haney 1971 murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 griffies et al 2009 hence the core ii simulations are more constrained than coupled climate models our analysis of core ii sst biases thus offers a means to determine that portion of the coupled climate model errors that can be attributed to ocean components sss and subsurface salinities strongly affect the surface buoyancy and hence the surface and subsurface water mass structures weller and anderson 1996 murtugudde et al 1998 salinity can thus have a strong influence on the thermodynamic structure of the mixed layer thermocline and their interactions mignot et al 2007 apart from rainfall salinity distributions in the indian ocean are driven by river inflows especially in the bay of bengal bob which receives nearly as much riverine input as rainfall e g shetye et al 1996 howden and murtugudde 2001 vinayachandran et al 2002 sengupta et al 2006 the influx of freshwater fw through the indonesian through flow itf and the influx of saltier water from the persian gulf and red sea also imprint clear signatures on the dynamics and thermodynamics of the indian ocean murtugudde et al 1998 gordon et al 2010 gordon and fine 1996 mccreary et al 2001 1993 bray et al 1997 many indian ocean modeling studies use regional configurations with closed sponge boundaries at the east and south kurian and vinayachandran 2007 han et al 2001 han and mccreary 2001 often leading to unrealistic salinity properties similarly better representation of bob freshwater influx is essential for studying the salinity distribution sitz et al 2017 the near surface salinity distribution study by zhang and marotzke 1999 using a model configured with open boundaries showed an unrealistic local minimum of salinity in the north western bob due to the lack of inclusion of runoff from ganges and brahmaputra the freshwater forcing affects mixed layer depths and surface currents which can advect the freshwater input away from the rivers howden and murtugudde 2001 sengupta et al 2006 han et al 2001 rahaman et al 2014 showed an improvement in sss simulations with a nested regional model with salinity bias less than 1 psu in the northern bob however coupled models still show large biases 1 5 psu over the bob as well as the nio vinayachandran and nanjundiah 2009 fathrio et al 2017b in general the subsurface salinity bias in models is not documented for the indian ocean from a suite of global model simulations in this study apart from surface salinity we also evaluated the subsurface salinity from the suite of 16 model simulations the indian ocean circulation is dominated by the dramatic seasonally reversing monsoon winds e g webster et al 1998 the low latitude landmass of the indian subcontinent drives the strong monsoon thus causing ocean currents and winds to seasonally reverse in the nio gadgil et al 2005 gadgil 2003 schott et al 2009 seasonally reversing monsoon winds southwesterly during summer and northeasterly during winter give rise to seasonally reversing current systems in the nio the semi annual cycle in the indian ocean is also related to the seasonally reversing monsoonal winds fig 1a provides a schematic of the horizontal circulation patterns in the indian ocean including the circulations forced by the asian monsoon the major nio current systems exhibiting a reversal in direction with the monsoons see fig 1a include the somali current sc southwest and northeast monsoon currents smc and nmc west india coastal current wicc and east india coastal current eicc though the indian ocean does not possess an equatorial upwelling system similar to the pacific or atlantic major upwelling regions do occur off the coast of somalia and sumatra in the north and southeastern equatorial indian ocean respectively green shaded portions of fig 1a another unique feature is the open ocean upwelling dome or seychelles dome in the southwest of the indian ocean satellite color images clearly reveal the existence of an open ocean upwelling zone between 5 s to 12 s over the southwest indian ocean xie et al 2002 the north and south current systems are separated around 10 12 s by a nearly zonal annually prevailing south equatorial current sec the zonal structure of the sec is maintained by the zero wind stress curl around 10 s which is a consequence of the annually prevailing southeasterly winds to the south of 10 s and the seasonally reversing monsoon winds to the north this sec plays a fundamental role in transporting warm and fresh western pacific waters westward across the indian ocean through itf the sec after reaching the northern tip of madagascar bifurcates into the northeast and southeast madagascar current semc and nemc e g chen et al 2014 yamagami and tozuka 2015 the semc feeds into the agulhas current ac which is part of the anticyclonic subtropical gyre similar to those in other ocean basins however unlike other basins this western boundary current overshoots the southern extent of the african continent with a portion extending westward into the south atlantic ocean a k a agulhas leakage and a portion retroflecting and flowing eastward along the equatorward edge of the antarctic circumpolar current lutjeharms 2006 the leeuwin current waite et al 2007 is an eastern boundary current along the west coast of australia interestingly its southward flow is counter to what is expected from the predominant winds along the eastern boundary at low latitudes the indian ocean receives additional heat and mass from the pacific ocean through the itf godfrey 1996 gordon and fine 1996 murtugudde et al 1998 the itf allows the water from the pacific ocean to reach the indian ocean these waters are then transported westward across the indian ocean by the westward flowing sec in the southern tip of madagascar the semc breaks into a series of dipole eddies that propagate downstream into the agulhas current system and enters the atlantic ocean south of south africa han et al 2014 durgadoo et al 2017 nauw et al 2008 palastanga et al 2006 ponsoni et al 2016 ridderinkhof et al 2013 some part of this water then retroflects eastward back into the southern indian ocean sio to feed the south indian ocean counter current sicc palastanga et al 2007 siedler et al 2009 in this study we show how the core ii models are able to simulate these circulation features with respect to observations in addition to the annual monsoonal cycle the circulation varies semiannually along the equator with a strong surface eastward current named wyrtki jet wj wyrtki 1973 wj appears as a narrow band trapped within 2 3 of the equator during the two transition periods of monsoons april may and october november driven by the equatorial westerly winds this wj plays an important role in the large scale heat and freshwater transports in the tropical indian ocean wyrtki 1973 reverdin 1985 schott and mccreary 2001 schott et al 2009 the subsurface currents also show seasonal variations in the equatorial indian ocean observations show the presence of subsurface equatorial under current euc which is reported in various studies e g knox 1976 1981 reppin et al 1999 schott and mccreary 2001 iskandar et al 2009 in the pacific and atlantic oceans the euc is a quasi permanent feature because of the prevailing easterly trade winds philander 1973 philander and pacanowski 1980 mcphaden 1986 seidel and giese 1999 in the equatorial indian ocean however it is transient and depends on winds and pressure gradient variations associated with the distinct seasonal cycle due to the asian monsoon it is most pronounced in northern hemisphere winter iskandar et al 2009 with its presence and absence mainly determined by the weaker and stronger easterlies in late winter and early spring cane 1980 reppin et al 1999 the euc is also present during the southwest monsoon reppin et al 1999 it is associated with equatorial waves driven by the strong seasonally varying surface winds schott and mccreary 2001 the core of this eastward undercurrent is located in the thermocline region above 300 m beneath which a weak westward counter flow exists and can last for at least a month during winter and spring observations show that the magnitude of the eastward undercurrent can exceed 1 2 m s during march june and is comparable to the pacific ocean undercurrent magnitude swallow 1964 1967 previous studies show that forced model simulations are able to capture the undercurrent reasonably well iskandar et al 2009 chen et al 2015 a comprehensive evaluation of how wj and euc are represented in global models is still lacking in this study we also assessed in detail about how the core ii models perform in simulating them apart from the surface circulations and equatorial currents discussed in the previous paragraphs two cells are active in the indian ocean the cross equatorial cell cec and the southern subtropical cell sstc lee 2004 schott et al 2004 the cec is a shallow 500 m meridional overturning circulation consisting of the northward flow of southern hemisphere thermocline water upwelling in the northern hemisphere and a return flow of surface water miyama et al 2003 a schematic of the meridional circulation of the indian ocean in the upper ocean 0 500 m is given in fig 1b from lee 2004 the upper indian ocean heat balance is achieved by cec and sstc miyama et al 2003 schott et al 2004 the cec connects upwelling zones in the nio to subduction zones in the southeastern indian ocean via a southward cross equatorial branch concentrated in the upper 50 m and a northward bulk flow of cooler thermocline water miyama et al 2003 have shown that the sources of water for the subsurface branch of the cross equatorial cell are the subduction zones in the southeastern indian ocean the itf and flow into the basin across the southern boundary this subduction seems to occur predominantly in the southern subtropical indian ocean as shown in fig 1a blue shading a small subduction site also exists in the as however the exact location of this northward thermocline flow is not yet known both poor sampling of deeper layers and relatively coarse resolution models used to study the dynamics of indian ocean have contributed to poor understanding of the subsurface thermocline northward flow in the indian ocean the suite of global ocean circulation models including relatively fine resolution models that participated in the core ii simulations danabasoglu et al 2014 used in this paper made it possible to document simulated pathways of the thermocline water into the nio the cec variability accounts for a significant portion of indian ocean cross equatorial heat transport which is hypothesized to be associated with the asian monsoon chirokova and webster 2006 swapna et al 2017 the indian ocean circulation is mainly driven by the seasonal reversal of the monsoon wind thus the mean and variability of wind forcing has a large impact on indian ocean simulations parekh et al 2011 more generally the heat water and momentum balances are affected by uncertainties in turbulent and radiative heat fluxes these uncertainties in the forcing fields can have a major role in the fidelity of ogcm simulations on intra seasonal seasonal inter annual and longer time scales mcwilliams 1996 hence accurate near surface atmospheric fields are essential for realistic simulations in a forced ocean model here we offer a brief overview of how the core ii atmospheric state compares to observational based measures however a full assessment of these impacts requires comparisons to simulations run with other atmospheric products such as japanese 55 year atmospheric reanalysis jra 55 based surface dataset for driving ocean sea ice models jra55 do tsujino et al 2018 and drakkar brodeau et al 2010 forcing the analysis presented in this paper provides a necessary starting point for that assessment our study is motivated by the important role of the indian ocean in regional and global climate variability especially in the tropics this role in turn prompts the need for improved understanding of indian ocean circulation dynamics including its mean state and variability in support of improved simulations of regional and global climate e g swapna et al 2014 we are motivated to perform systematic assessments of indian ocean features found in global climate model simulations increased awareness of the role of the indian ocean for regional and global climate including its importance for the billions of humans living along its coasts and nearby regions prompts the need to systematically articulate the problems and prospects with global model simulations for this region the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the core ii simulations and the main goal of the study section 3 describes models and observational datasets section 4 contains main results and discussions organized as i the evaluation of core ii wind speed with in situ observation section 4 1 ii the time mean features of sst and its seasonal cycle over the key regions of the indian ocean

the impact of increased model resolutions is described in section 5 major findings from our analysis and its future implications are finally summarized in section 6 2 core ii simulations and the goals of this paper the first phase of the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments core project core i made use of a synthetically constructed normal year forcing nyf large and yeager 2004 with seven modeling groups participated in the study of griffies et al 2009 an underlying question pursued with core is whether models using the same atmospheric state atmospheric state is prescribed over a fixed annual cycle will produce broadly similar simulation features however analyses showed many differences in the simulated results for example models are unable to simulate the realistic moc also models are unable to reach an equilibrium state after a transient phase that in turn prompted further model development and improvement see more details in griffies et al 2009 the second phase core ii makes use of the interannually varying atmospheric forcing iaf of large and yeager 2009 over the 60 year period from 1948 to 2007 details of the core ii protocol are given by danabasoglu et al 2014 the core ii project is the largest coordinated effort to assess the scientific integrity of global ocean sea ice simulations it is now included as phase i of the ocean model inter comparison project omip a part of the world climate research programme coupled model inter comparison project phase 6 cmip6 eyring et al 2016 as documented by griffies et al 2016 core ii simulations are readily comparable to historical observations given their historical forcing hence core ii experiments facilitate the assessment of global ocean sea ice simulations and allow one to probe ocean processes active on sub seasonal to decadal time scales e g danabasoglu et al 2014 2016 griffies et al 2014 at present there are nine core ii assessment papers published in the journal ocean modeling that provide detailed analyses over the pacific atlantic southern and arctic oceans we here focus on the indian ocean since the ismr prediction is dependent on the mean oceanic and atmospheric conditions the central question addressed in this paper is how well do global ocean sea ice models capture the mean state and seasonal cycle of the indian ocean most models employ one to two degrees horizontal grid spacing though there are two that use finer spacing 0 25 degree thus admitting mesoscale eddies in the low latitudes and correspondingly fine scale currents 3 model and observational data used in this study 3 1 models we provide a summary of 16 global ocean sea ice model configurations in table 1 with further details provided in the core ii papers of danabasoglu et al 2014 and farneti et al 2015 we focus on the 5th core ii forcing cycle and use model years corresponding to years of available observations for 1982 2007 the surface fluxes of heat freshwater salt and momentum are determined using the core ii inter annual forcing iaf atmospheric datasets the model s prognostic sst and surface currents and the bulk formulae described in large and yeager 2004 2009 there is no restoring term applied to sst sss restoring is used to prevent unbounded salinity trends in all the model simulations used for this study the nemo based models convert sss restoring to a freshwater flux all the other models apply sss restoring as a salt flux the restoring time scales vary considerably by days to years between the groups weak restoring with time scales of about 4 years were used in fsu kiel and ncar moderate restoring with time scales of 9 12 months were used in awi bergen cerfacs cmcc cnrm gfdl mom ictp and mri strong restoring with time scales of 50 150 days were used in access and gfdl gold see appendix c in danabasoglu et al 2014 for more details on sss restoring technique the vertical mixing scheme used in different models is detailed in appendix a of danabasoglu et al 2014 for sst we also make use of nine corresponding climate models table 2 from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 utilizing historical runs forced with natural and anthropogenic radiative gases to simulate climate over years 1850 2005 we use cmip5 simulations from january 1982 to december 2005 for generating a monthly climatology there are many studies which show that ismr variability is mainly governed by the mean state sst in the indian ocean lee et al 2010 li et al 2001 most of the coupled models show large cold biases in sst in the indian ocean especially in the as the cold bias will have large impacts on the coupled feedbacks and thus the monsoon sujith et al 2019 showed that improvements in mean state of sst in coupled model cfsv2 have led to realistic simulation of oceanic modes of variability over indian ocean io pacific i e enso indian ocean dipole iod and that lead to improve simulation of ismr the very purpose of core ii experiments is to see how the ocean models perform with a prescribed atmospheric state in the coupled models the exact cause of the sst bias is not yet known hence we used sst simulations from both the forced and coupled model with same ocean configuration to delineate the probable source of the sst bias the comparison between core ii and cmip5 sst patterns offers a means to expose the role of atmosphere ocean coupling with a dynamical atmospheric model on sst patterns a more complete comparison of core ii and cmip5 simulations is beyond our scope 3 2 observations and reanalysis data used for the model evaluation we make use of the following observational and reanalysis data to evaluate the core ii simulations monthly one degree gridded optimum interpolation oi sst product reynolds et al 2002 for 1982 2007 is taken from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the subsurface temperature and salinity are taken from the world ocean atlas woa09 climatology locarnini et al 2010 antonov et al 2010 boyer et al 2009 we also use woa09 for the sss in woa09 data until 2006 were used to compute the climatology however more argo profile data started in 2007 in the indian ocean including those years of data in the climatology may represent different mean state as compared to mean state based on data until 2006 since the core ii simulations ran until 2007 hence we used woa09 for this study surface currents are taken from the ocean surface current analysis oscar bonjean and lagerloef 2002 the oscar product is available at 0 33 spatial resolution and 5 day averaged for this study we computed monthly climatologies from the 5 day averaged data for the period 1993 2007 we also use ship drift climatology from cutler and swallow 1984 as well as the near surface current 0 15 m climatology version 2 07 from satellite tracked drogued drifter velocities gridded at 0 5 0 5 resolution lumpkin and johnson 2013 all these data were re gridded to 1 1 conforms to the mom grid for comparison we employ monthly mean 1 1 zonal and meridional subsurface currents from the operational ocean oras4 balmaseda et al 2013 reanalysis product for 1982 2007 the long term mean is calculated for this period inter comparison studies of different reanalysis products over indian ocean show oras4 is performing best among most of the widely used products karmakar et al 2017 observed long term monthly mean net heat flux nhf was used from national oceanography centre southampton nocs berry and kent 2009 available at 1 1 resolution we also used monthly mean tropflux praveen kumar et al 2013 nhf for 1982 2007 and computed monthly climatologies for the comparison we note that different observation based products differ among each other and this can adversely affect the assessment of model performance based on single observation thereby by comparing the model simulations with multiple observational products we may achieve robust results 3 3 datasets used for the wind speed evaluation we used buoy observed wind speed data at 3 m height provided by national institute of ocean technology niot under national data buoy programme ndbp of the ministry of earth sciences government of india premkumar et al 2000 to compare the most widely used forcing fields from core ii jra55 do tsujino et al 2018 and drakkar brodeau et al 2010 the buoy location is at 94 e 10 5 n in the bob and shown in fig 1a as red dot daily wind speed from buoy is used for the comparison the 3 hourly 55 km horizontal resolution jra55 do and the 6 hourly 75 km resolution drakkar wind speed were used for the comparison however daily averages were computed from these 3 hourly and 6 hourly data to compare with daily buoy wind speed these datasets have been corrected relative to reanalysis product era interim dee et al 2011 for drakkar and japanese 55 year reanalysis kobayashi et al 2015 for jra55 do products analogous to how core ii has been corrected we also used cross calibrated multi platform ccmp available at http rda ucar edu datasets ds745 1 access surface wind vector analyses atlas et al 2009 for the spatial wind speed comparison here we provide a comparison of core ii with drakkar and jra55 do to understand the reliability of these products for the indian ocean simulation there are notable differences in spatial resolution core ii 2 and jra55 do 0 5 as well as differences in temporal resolutions core ii and drakkar 6 hourly and jra55 do 3 hourly yet for the comparison we only considered daily averaged datasets from all products the corrected core ii jra55 do and drakkar data are available at 10 m height for comparison we interpolate the core ii jra55 do and drakkar 10 m winds to 3 m using the logarithmic scale given by stull 2011 3 4 assessment in sub regions of the indian ocean the indian ocean variability is very inhomogeneous e g schott et al 2009 hence we find it useful to examine the simulations within sub regions as shown in fig 1a these regions include the arabian sea as 50 70 e and 6 25 n the bay of bengal bob 79 5 95 5 e and 7 5 23 5 n the south eastern arabian sea seas 71 77 e and 7 13 n the eastern equatorial indian ocean eeio 80 100 e and 5 s 5 n the thermocline ridge tr 50 75 e and 5 s 10 s and the southern indian ocean sio 40 100 e and 15 s 30 s 4 results and discussions 4 1 evaluation of core ii forcing fields 4 1 1 assessment of the winds and latent heat fluxes latent heat flux lhf is mainly determined by wind speed apart from near surface air temperature and humidity thus any error in the computation of lhf due to inconsistencies in any of these components would reflect in the nhf rahaman and ravichandran 2013 have documented the evaluation of core ii near surface humidity and air temperature the findings of rahaman and ravichandran 2013 are briefly mentioned in section 4 1 2 in what follows we therefore restrict our comparison to the wind speed fig 2 shows the time series comparison of daily wind speed from corrected core ii jra55 do and drakkar in 2006 over southern bob core ii wind speed reproduce the observed seasonal and intra seasonal variability however for most of the year it overestimates the buoy wind speed fig 2 in contrast jra55 do and drakkar winds more accurately capture the buoy observed daily wind speed with slight under estimations the statistics of wind speed comparison is given in table 3 the core ii mean wind speed bias is 0 8 m s with a root mean square deviation rmsd value of 1 75 m s and a correlation coefficient of 0 8 the underestimation of jra55 do and drakkar wind speed with respect to buoy observation is reflected with mean bias of 0 40 m s and 0 35 m s respectively table 3 however the rmsd values in jra55 do and drakkar are much lower when compared to core ii core ii wind speed have larger variability as compared to buoy observation with standard deviations of 2 1 m s in the buoy and 2 6 m s in core ii jra55 do and drakkar standard deviation sd values are very close to the observed buoy value table 3 fig 3a shows the 1993 2007 mean spatial distribution of wind speed from core ii ccmp jra55 do and drakkar the basin average mean wind speed is given within each panel top right the values are roughly similar except for core ii which is slightly higher than the other products which is also seen in the buoy comparison fig 2 the mean wind speed structure over the indian ocean is dominated by the summer monsoon wind the summer monsoon wind speed over as is high as compared to bob and it reflects in the annual mean structure core ii wind speed is higher by 0 5 m s over the west coast of australia as compared to the other products this region also shows the highest wind speed over the entire indian ocean core ii wind is corrected by quikscat wind large and yeager 2009 but still it shows higher values as compared to buoy and other wind products yu et al 2007 have reported large lhf over this region in ncep2 product as compared to other products and attributed this bias to the strong wind sanchez franks et al 2018 also noted lhf biases in this region and linked them to dry biases in humidity the spatial distribution of monthly sd is shown in fig 3b all wind products show that the variability is highest over the somalia coast and it is 4 5 m s in core ii drakkar and jra55 do but slightly lower values 3 4 m s are seen in satellite based product ccmp the variability is lowest over equatorial indian ocean and in a zonal band over the south indian ocean 20 25 s in all products the sd values over these regions are similar in drakkar ccmp and jra do but slightly larger values are seen in core ii to understand the wind impact on lhf we computed latent heat fluxes using bulk formula see details in rahaman and ravichandran 2013 by using buoy observed atmospheric fields but replacing buoy wind speed with core ii jra55 do and drakkar wind speed fields the daily lhf comparison is shown in fig 4 the wind impact on lhf shows rmsd values of 50 w m2 and a mean bias of 22 w m 2 in core ii the underestimation of wind speed in jra55 do and drakkar is reflected as mean lhf bias of 11 w m 2 and 10 w m 2 respectively sanchez franks et al 2018 found that jra 55 underestimates buoy wind speed in the bob in agreement with results here biases in turbulent heat fluxes of the order reported in their work can have large implications for a product model to correctly represent monsoon related processes the rmsd values of 36 w m2 and 34 w m2 are much lower in jra55 do and drakkar as compared to core ii these results also corroborate the finding of swain et al 2009 they showed that over the seas during monsoon season 1 m s rmsd in wind speed can cause 45 w m 2 rmsd in lhf as expected the variability in core ii is also large with sd value 62 w m2 as compared to buoy sd value of 44 w m2 the sd in jra55 do and drakkar is also very close to the sd derived from buoy observations table 4 4 1 2 specific humidity air temperature and radiative fluxes rahaman and ravichandran 2013 evaluated core ii specific humidity qa and air temperature ta with independent in situ observations over the tropical indian ocean they reported that the rmsd value of ta is 0 5 c but a large drop in ta observed during intense rainfall events are not well captured by core ii products they also reported a change in 1 g kg qa can cause about 11 15 w m2 errors in latent heat flux qiu et al 2004 showed that over the western north pacific the synoptic scale heat fluxes have a large impact on sst and have typical amplitude of 1 c the downwelling fluxes of shortwave and longwave radiation from the core ii product have been evaluated with the tropical moored buoy observations venugopal and rahaman 2019 they found the mean bias in core ii over the atlantic ocean is about zero and a rmsd of 43 w m2 and 12 w m2 for downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation respectively for the indian ocean with respect to research moored array for african asian australian monsoon analysis prediction rama buoy the mean bias is roughly 3 w m2 and 8 w m 2 but with large rmsd values of 50 w m2 and 14 w m2 for downwelling short and longwave radiation respectively the variability is also underestimated with standard deviations of 70 w m2 in rama for shortwave whereas in core ii it is 48 w m2 in the case of longwave variability is larger in core ii 23 w m2 as compared to buoy values of 18 w m2 core ii forcing fields compare reasonably well to observational based measures as well as other reanalysis products 4 2 sea surface temperature in this section we offer a particularly extensive analysis of the sst given its importance for indian ocean climate variability and due to its relatively precise observational measures for the analysis purpose we regrided all models and observed sst and nhf dataset uniformly on a 1 x 1 grid 4 2 1 spatial patterns 4 2 1 1 sst patterns from core ii simulations fig 5 shows the annual mean sst bias for each model together with the model ensemble mean bias the observed and model ensemble mean sst is also shown in the upper left corner of each panels the annual mean is computed over the period 1982 to 2007 for both observations and models the oi sst data is based on advance very high resolution radiometer avhrr satellite data reynolds et al 2002 which is available from april 1981 hence we used 1982 2007 to compute monthly climatology observations fig 5a show sst cooler in the west and warmer in the east murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 schott et al 2009 and a tongue of relatively warm sst 29 c in the equatorial indian ocean forming the indian ocean warm pool fasullo and webster 1999 rao et al 2015 rao and ramakrishna 2017 the core ii ensemble mean fig 5b reproduces this warm pool structure both in terms of the magnitude and spatial extent looking at singular model annual means fig 5d s contours almost all of them reproduce the observed patterns two exceptions are awi and access where the maximum sst does not exceed 28 c and show a basin wide cold bias shaded values including the warm pool region zonal variation of the sst pattern is well reproduced in all the core ii simulations the ensemble mean sst pattern nearly replicates the observed mean sst spatial pattern individual models show biases of 1 c with a warm bias over the southwest indian ocean and cold bias over the as and bob no significant improvement is seen in the two eddy permitting models gfdl mom025 and kiel025 as compared to their coarser resolution companion configurations therefore biases may be arising more from improper representation of physical parameterizations e g boundary layer processes than coarse grid resolution or it may be also due to surface forcing bias previous studies have shown that the nhf accounts for most of the tropical indian ocean tio sst variability murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 klein et al 1999 over the as apart from the nhf oceanic processes also play a major role in the sst variability shenoi et al 2002 however sst over bob is more air sea flux driven due to the bay s bl vialard et al 2012 in the tropical southwest indian ocean swio ocean dynamics plays an important role at all timescales due to local and remotely forced ocean dynamics lau and nath 2004 murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 and xie et al 2002 2009 have shown that sst variability over this region is forced by thermocline variability and mixed layer thermocline interactions the warm sst bias over this region is coincident with the warmer thermocline temperature bias over the same region see fig 19 the nhf bias computed from model ssts is uniform throughout the basin 10 w m2 in all these models not shown which further confirms this finding the nemo based models cerfacs cnrm cmcc and kiel show slightly larger warm bias to the south of the equator as compared to other models in the as and the bob almost all simulations show a cold sst bias the annual mean cold bias over these regions mainly arises from a large cold bias during march fig 6 chowdary et al 2015 2016 have shown that the seasonal sst over the bob is governed by the seasonal nhf but the observational study of thangaprakash et al 2015 show that vertical processes and horizontal advection also play a significant role in the seasonal sst tendency over the bob the nhf in core ii simulated models does not differ much with the tropflux observations see fig 11b and section 4 2 2 2 hence the different magnitudes for the sst bias in core ii simulated models over the bob could be due to the vertical processes and horizontal advection thus supporting the finding of thangaprakash et al 2015 in the as the great whirl and the southern eddy are two dominant anti cyclonic eddies present near the somalia coast the great whirl has been observed to form during late may and early june between 5 n and 10 n a large branch of the east african coastal current eacc turns offshore after crossing the equator at about 2 n to 3 n and forms the southern gyre sg the sg is a large anticyclonic retroflection cell with a well marked wedge of cold upwelled water attached to its northern flank the southern cold wedge a third anticyclonic eddy named the socotra eddy se is frequently present in the northeast of the island of socotra beal and donohue 2013 beal et al 2013 the very prominent small circular patch of cold sst bias seen over these regions found in most of the core ii models represents the presence of these anti cyclonic eddies in july and october figure not shown most of the models show a cold bias with access showing the largest 1 5 c gfdl mom group of models also shows a fairly large cold bias whereas this bias is relatively small in the nemo group of models annual mean bias over the bob in the nemo models and fsu are least among all the model simulations the region of the equatorial indian ocean and latitudes to its south show a positive bias 0 6 c in all simulations except awi and access whose simulations show a small cold bias 0 4 c all biases are within observational errors bhat et al 2004 senan et al 2001 furthermore the flux errors are larger than the corrective fluxes needed to correct these sst biases which make it difficult to assign any errors in the models see murtugudde et al 1996 however the high mean ssts are close to atmospheric convective thresholds and thus even small errors can lead to large errors in a coupled climate model the core ii models realistically simulate the spatial distribution and zonal variation of sst in the indian ocean the basin wide bias is within 1 c seen in almost all the models which may arise from problems representing ocean physics as well as atmospheric forcing we conjecture that the most important physical process is related to vertical mixing given the importance of upper ocean boundary layer processes for setting the sst these results suggest that a focus on improved physical parameterizations may in the near term offer more advances in indian ocean simulations than refinement of the grid resolution this conclusion is supported by benshila et al 2014 4 2 1 2 comparing sst from core ii and cmip5 simulations we here compare sst from cmip5 coupled models using the same ocean component as the core ii models in particular we analyze ssts from cmip5 historical simulations from the nine models that employ the same ocean configuration used in our core ii study table 2 compared to forced core ii model simulations coupled cmip5 simulations show sst biases that are not uniformly distributed across different seasons they also show a similar pattern to that of the forced simulations described in section 4 2 1 1 but with larger amplitude the larger biases suggest the amplification of sst errors that arise from coupling with an interactive atmospheric model previous studies have identified a cold sst bias in the indian ocean in coupled climate models pokhrel et al 2012a b chowdary et al 2015 2016 prasanna 2015 fathrio et al 2017a examined the western indian ocean sst biases among cmip5 models and found that about half of the models show positive sst biases while others show negative bias the models with cold sst biases exhibit a colder bias in the entire tropical indian ocean throughout the year the positive bias was attributed to relatively weak southwest monsoonal winds over the as and an equatorial southeasterly wind bias the warm sst biases persisted until boreal fall and then disappeared in winter li et al 2015 all cmip5 models show cold sst biases over the northern as during the pre monsoon season marathayil et al 2013 sandeep and ajayamohan 2014 levine et al 2013 li et al 2015 fathrio et al 2017a studies show that anomalous advection of cold surface air from the south asian landmass during boreal winter contributes to the cold sst biases over the north as marathayil et al 2013 sandeep and ajayamohan 2014 we show the annual mean sst contour and bias color from the cmip5 simulations in fig 7 except for cesm and cmcc none of the cmip5 models reproduce the observed warm pool over the equatorial indian ocean rao et al 2015 the majority of the cmip5 models show a basin wide cold bias with highest bias in the northern as up to 4 c the north as cold bias is more than 3 c in mri whereas cesm shows the smaller cold bias of 0 6 c cesm cmcc and mri show a warm positive bias of up to 1 6 c over the western equatorial indian ocean and southeast indian ocean off the australian coast the overall basin wide cold bias is weakest in cmcc 0 12 c and largest in noresm 0 93 c the largest basin averaged cold bias in core ii ocean only simulations is 0 37 c in access biases in the ncar core ii model are only 0 1 0 2 c to the south of the equator however when coupled as part of cesm this model shows roughly five to ten times larger biases up to 1 c the large cold bias in the cmip5 models over the northern as in the annual mean mostly arises from the cold bias during february april which peaks in march fig 8 the sst cold bias is larger than 3 c in gfdl esm2m gfdl esm2g gfdl cm3 noresm and mri during march sandeep and ajayamohan 2014 show a similar cold bias but with larger amplitude over the north as in all cmip5 models they attributed this bias to an equatorward bias in the subtropical jet stream during boreal spring thus causing excessive cooling of the northern as and adjoining land regions this cold bias in coupled models was also attributed to the northeasterly cold air temperature marathayil et al 2013 the cold bias in forced core ii simulations is much weaker when compared to coupled models that use the same ocean component figs 5 and 7 the cold biases in the core ii simulations are 1 c over the northern as whereas they are 3 c in the cmip5 models with even larger biases in the mri and noresm these results suggest that the large northern as sst biases in coupled models may arise from coupled dynamical feedbacks that amplify ocean errors this hypothesis is supported by fig 9a which shows the seasonal cycle of the mixed layer depth mld in core ii models and woa observations over the northern as the core ii mlds are generally deeper than woa during february march fig 9b shows the mld vs sst bias over the northern as it can be seen that larger sst cold biases are associated with deeper mlds as compared to observations the correlation coefficient between mlds and sst bias is 0 64 which is significant at the 99 confidence level in fig 9b the bergen simulation appears like an outlier without this simulation the correlation coefficient value reduces from 0 64 to 0 50 but it is still significant at the 95 confidence level tozuka et al 2017 showed in the upstream kuroshio extension region in the north west pacific that the deeper mld is less sensitive to cooling by surface heat fluxes however roxy et al 2012 showed a shallow deep mld enhances suppress the sst anomaly thereby amplifying lessening the intra seasonal variability of the monsoon in a coupled model cfsv2 and argued that a prime focus should be on improving the mixed layer scheme of the ocean component in that model this confirms the need of improvement of mld in ocean models for a better simulation of sst over the northern as these results suggest that the origin of sst bias during spring february april mainly arise from the coupled feedbacks as well as mld biases the spatial distribution and magnitude of sst bias in core ii forced simulations are weaker than those in coupled simulations since the errors are amplified by coupled feedbacks we conjecture that the basin wide cold bias in core ii simulations arises from deficiencies in ocean vertical mixing with biases enhanced due to coupled feedbacks in the coupled model simulations 4 2 2 seasonal cycle of sst and net surface heat flux the indian ocean circulation and tracer property distributions exhibit great spatial inhomogeneity correspondingly so is the spatial distribution of the sst bias hence we here consider the area averaged seasonal cycle over the different sub regions shown in fig 1 and described in section 3 4 the ability of model simulations to correctly capture the seasonal sst variation is a difficult task particularly over the north indian ocean 4 2 2 1 arabian sea as fig 10a shows the seasonal evaluation of sst over the as from core ii simulations and its ensemble mean along with observation the observed annual cycle over the as shows a bimodal sst seasonality with the primary maximum during april may and the secondary maximum in october murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 vinayachandran and shetye 1991 fathrio et al 2017a during april may prior to the onset of the indian summer monsoon the as evolves to one of the warmest areas in the tropical oceans joseph 1990 joseph et al 2006 all core ii simulations show bi modal sst seasonality but there exists inter model spread that is largest during summer observations show that sst reduces after the onset of the summer monsoon in june it reaches a minimum during the peak summer monsoon july august over the as due to upwelling off the somali coast and arabian peninsula as well as due to latent heat loss caused by strong southwesterly monsoon winds shenoi et al 2002 another mechanism through which sst reduces over the as is the export of heat through meridional overturning few models show lower sst during july august with respect to noaa oi observation while others show slightly higher this behavior could be due to the different cross equatorial heat transport among different models swapna et al 2017 the cmip5 coupled model simulations show similar variations to those forced by core ii but cmip results show far more inter model spread fig 10c the cold biases during winter and spring in the coupled models are larger 2 c than the core ii models 0 5 c fig 10a c coupled model inter comparison project phase 3 cmip3 and other cmip5 coupled models not considered here also show similar cold biases over the as marathayil et al 2013 levine et al 2013 levine and turner 2012 showed that coupled model sst biases over the northern as are substantially larger than the observed interannual variability of as sst and in turn these biases affect the indian summer monsoon simulations and forecasts narapusetty et al 2015 the as seasonal cycle of nhf from the core ii models matches that of the tropflux observation fig 10b during october march while the magnitude is about 20 30 less than the observation despite this reasonably good match in surface heat flux forcing the cold sst bias in core ii simulations indicates the role of oceanic process in seasonal sst evolution which is also evident from the deeper mld in all models fig 9a recent studies by parampil et al 2016 have shown that tropflux derived nhf over the nio is more realistic when compared with oaflux and satellite derived products all the core ii models underestimate the nhf as compared to observations fig 10b during march october most models show a cold sst bias during spring but the majority shows warm bias during summer july august fig 10a the wind speed is strong over as in core ii during spring but it is weaker during peak summer august as compared to other wind speed products figure not shown this leads to an over estimation of the lhf in model the overestimation of the lhf due to core ii wind speed is also shown in fig 4 and table 4 as previously noted wind speed is not the sole factor determining the lhf rahaman and ravichandran 2013 they showed that the lhf overestimation is mainly due to the positive biases of core ii near surface air temperature and specific humidity fig 10d shows the seasonal evolution of ensemble mean sst and nhf from observations core ii and cmip5 simulations the nhf reaches its maximum in april whereas sst attains its maximum in may studies have shown that the seasonal evolution of sst tendency matches well with the nhf seasonal cycle chowdary et al 2015 sayantani et al 2016 kurian and vinayachandran 2007 in summary the bimodal semiannual cycle of sst in the as is well captured by the core ii forced simulations revealing weaker biases than the coupled cmip5 models we conjecture that the cold sst bias and under estimation of sst maximum in the pre summer monsoon season reflects a problem with simulated oceanic processes since the core ii ensemble nhf is reasonably well matched with both observational products additionally the inability to reach the minimum sst during the summer monsoon season may arise from biases in the wind forcing see section 4 1 1 as well as simulated oceanic processes 4 2 2 2 bay of bengal bob fig 11a shows the sst seasonal cycle over the bob from core ii simulated models and observation as for the as the semiannual cycle is very prominent in the bob with peak ssts in may and october although the sst reduces rapidly over the as following the monsoon onset sst in the bob remains higher than 28 c making the bob favorable for deep atmospheric convection gadgil et al 1984 graham and barnett 1987 the magnitude of sst reduction in the bob is smaller 1 c than in the as 2 3 c this difference arises from the bl present in the bob with this layer suppressing ocean vertical mixing and thus maintaining a higher sst throughout the year thadathil et al 2007 shenoi et al 2002 deboyer montégutet et al 2007 sprintall and tomczak 1992 the models are able to simulate the observed seasonal cycle but mostly underestimate the observed sst with kiel and kiel025 as exceptions this underestimation of sst could be due to the models inability to simulate properly the observed bl thickness thadathil et al 2007 several studies point to the impact of bl on bob s sst variation e g deboyer montégutet et al 2007 saji and yamagata 2003 saji et al 2006 girishkumar et al 2011 the model study of rahaman et al 2014 suggested the importance of relatively fine vertical grid spacing 2 m to properly represent the bl features note that most of the core ii models have vertical grid spacing no finer than 5 m in the upper ocean further evidence for the oceanic role in establishing the sst biases can be seen in fig 11b which shows that the core ii ensemble mean surface heat fluxes closely follow the tropflux observations with little spread across the models as pointed out by parampil et al 2016 data from nocs overestimates the nhf compared to other observational products this bias is also reflected in fig 11b where the nocs nhf is larger than tropflux throughout the year in contrast to the core ii forced simulations the coupled cmip5 simulations show larger sst bias ranging up to 2 c almost throughout the year with maximum during february may fig 11c the inter model spread is large in coupled models compared to the core ii forced simulations fig 11d shows the seasonal variation of the ensemble mean sst and the nhf from both core ii and cmip5 along with observations with core ii models better representing the seasonal variation of sst in the bob than cmip5 models showing a rather uniform offset of 1 c over the year compared to observations 4 2 2 3 eastern equatorial indian ocean eeio sst over the indian ocean generally shows large scale seasonal variability but sst variation in the eeio remains within about 0 5 c fig 12a the mean sst is above 28 c throughout the year thus favoring deep atmospheric convection gadgil et al 1984 and rainfall throughout the year fig 12a shows the eeio sst seasonal cycle from core ii forced models and observation the observation shows that sst exceeds 29 c throughout the year and peaks in april all models are able to capture the observed seasonal cycle with comparatively small biases 0 25 c except access and awi both of which show a systematic year round cold bias of 0 5 c similar to the as and the bob the nhf over the eeio is also underestimated by all models compared to both observational products the core ii ensemble mean value shows good agreement with the observations but a large inter model spread exists throughout the year with all models showing systematically warm or cold biases kiel and fsu show positive sst biases during april may despite a nhf that underestimates the observed values this result suggests that the nhf may not be a major factor determining the evolution of sst during april may but that instead the ocean dynamics likely dominate over the eeio particularly off java and further east horizontal advection through the itf and vertical entrainment by upwelling are the most important processes balancing the annual mean heat budget and these processes in turn control the sst variation qu et al 1994 du et al 2005 in the eeio the horizontal advection by the wj is also expected to contribute to the sst e g halkides and lee 2009 coupled cmip simulations show large cold biases throughout the year and inter model spread is much larger than their core ii counter parts fig 12c the systematic inter model spread is 2 c and the systematic bias is much larger 1 1 5 c in coupled simulations compared to 0 25 0 5 c in core ii simulations the zonal wind stress over this region is westerly from march to october and largest during northern hemisphere spring and autumn driving the bi annually observed equatorial jets in spring and autumn wyrtki 1973 these equatorial jets deepen the thermocline in the east thus contributing to sst increase in the eeio fig 12d shows the ensemble mean sst seasonal cycle from the core ii and the cmip5 simulations along with observations the ensemble mean nhf from the core ii simulations and observations tropflux and nocs are additionally overlaid the core ii ensemble mean closely matches the observed sst seasonal cycle whereas the cmip5 simulations show a systematic cold bias throughout the year with a maximum bias of about 1 2 c during december january additionally the peak sst in cmip5 models is reached in may which is one month after the observed peak in april the nhf from the core ii ensemble is underestimated throughout the year except in autumn as for the as and the bob the eeio nhf peaks one month earlier than the sst so that the tropical indian ocean sst responds to nhf changes after roughly one month 4 2 2 4 thermocline ridge tr sst in the tr also called the seychelles dome region shows a dominant annual cycle rather than a semiannual cycle as in the as the bob and the eeio levitus 1987 rao and sivakumar 1999 vialard et al 2009 sst in the tr region has a large impact on the indian summer monsoon annamalai et al 2005 and the tropical cyclone activity xie et al 2002 therefore it is important for coupled prediction models to simulate the observed sst variability over tr in particular resolving its seasonal cycle provides a useful benchmark test for model performance fig 13a shows the seasonal variation of sst from observation and the core ii simulations observational estimates show an increase in sst from august to april followed by decrease from may to july as the cross equatorial wind starts evolving fig 13a most of the model capture this seasonal variation but they generally overestimate the observed sst throughout the year with a maximum during july august up to 1 c awi and access capture the observed july august cooling over the tr region however both models have a consistently cold bias over other sub regions the nhf is underestimated fig 13b systematically by all core ii simulations with an ensemble bias 60 w m2 during july august fig 13b horizontal advection tends to warm the sst in austral winter owing to the southward ekman heat transport associated with the indian summer monsoon yokoi et al 2012 despite a large negative nhf in the core ii simulations many models show a warm bias during august thus suggesting the role of excess heat transport from north of the equator by the wind driven ekman transport yokoi et al 2012 also showed that cooling by vertical turbulent diffusion in the ocean becomes most effective in the austral summer owing to the shallow mixed layer and correspondingly shallow thermocline during that season positive sst biases may have arisen due to the reduced vertical cooling since the thermocline is deeper 85 140 m than found in the observations 75 80 m not shown similarly the cmip5 simulations also capture the observed seasonal cycle of sst but exhibit a larger inter model spread than the core ii simulations analysis indicates that almost half of the cmip5 models shows a warm bias and the rest show a cold bias thus leading to an ensemble mean cmip5 sst that is close to the observation nagura et al 2013 analyzed 35 coupled general circulation models cgcm including some cmip5 models for the simulations of the longitudinal biases in the seychelles dome they showed that the cmip5 models are unable to simulate the longitude of the upwelling dome and the magnitudes of the annual and semiannual cycles of thermocline depth variability in the dome region these biases could help to explain why some of the cmip5 models generally have problems reproducing the observed seasonal cycle of sst over this region gfdl esm2g shows a systematic cold bias throughout the year fig 13c this region also shows that the nhf leads sst by about one month fig 13d 4 2 3 zonal sst variation along the equator murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 first reported that the mixed layer thermocline interactions in the eeio potentially imply a coupled feedback furthermore saji et al 1999 and webster et al 1999 showed that coupled feedbacks in the equatorial indian ocean are critical for variability in the tropical indian ocean this variability mode is known as the iod many studies have since shown that iod is intrinsic to the indian ocean with a potential kick from the massive western pacific convection center annamalai et al 2003 annamalai and murtugudde 2004 saji et al 2006 wang et al 2016 wang and wang 2014 fig 14a shows the east west sst gradients from core ii simulations and results from cmip5 simulations are shown in fig 14b observational estimates for mean sst in the eastern and western regions are 29 6 c and 27 2 c respectively fig 14a all models show a warm bias of up to 0 9 c in the western equatorial indian ocean 45 60 e fig 14a this sort of bias concentrated on the western equatorial io would have implications for the modes of interannual variability the observation shows a sharp gradient at 65 e and nearly constant values of 29 3 c in between 65 95 e with a dip of 29 1 c at 80 e all models show nearly constant sst between 65 95 e with a spread of 0 5 c compared to observations the kiel group of models as well as fsu and fsu2 represent the upper estimates of sst along the equator while awi and access show a cold bias between 65 95 e providing the lower sst estimate of the ensemble the core ii ensemble mean shows a general warm bias stronger evolved west of 65 e in contrast to the core ii forced simulations most cmip5 simulations show colder sst throughout the basin as well as a large model spread fig 14b overall core ii models show a higher skill in simulating zonal sst distribution along the equator than the cmip5 models we summarize this analysis by noting that the seasonal variation of sst in different sub regions in the indian ocean is well captured by the core ii models compared to the coupled cmip5 simulations in particular the bi modal sst variability over the as the bob and the eeio are well reproduced in core ii models while the absolute climatological values differ regionally and seasonally by up to 1 8 c with a broad range of variations shown by the models however both core ii and cmip5 models exhibit deficiencies in capturing the equatorial indian ocean dynamics as evident from the flat zonal sst gradient and the warm bias over the open ocean upwelling dome south of the equator the seasonal prediction skill for the tropical sst anomalies is a major predictability source for monsoon precipitation in the coupled models and is closely linked to the ability to simulate the sst mean state lee et al 2010 we conjecture that the relatively poor skill of the coupled models at simulating the mean sst in the indian ocean versus the higher skill in the core ii simulations indicates the role for coupled feedbacks that amplify ocean biases these results offer a useful benchmark for use in developing methods to reduce biases in coupled prediction models 4 3 surface salinity and barrier layer in this section we study the behavior of the surface salinity and associated bl within the indian ocean much of this behavior is affected by precipitation and river runoff forcing with core ii simulations using interannually varying monthly mean precipitation derived from satellite corrected rainfall and interannually varying monthly mean river runoff dai et al 2009 danabasoglu et al 2014 additionally as detailed in griffies et al 2009 and danabasoglu et al 2014 core ii simulations are integrated with surface salinity restoring in order to reduce long term drifts in the thermohaline properties of the models details are given in section 3 1 the monthly climatology is computed over the period 1982 to 2007 for all models 4 3 1 surface salinity fig 15 shows the annual mean sss from the core ii models and their biases with respect to observation fig 15a shows the sss from woa observation fig 15b shows the ensemble mean from all models and fig 15c shows the ensemble bias asymmetry in the sss distribution with higher salinity in the as and lower salinity in the bob is seen in the observation and is reproduced by all simulations however all models show a basin wide positive salinity bias with large values over the northern bob and the seas interestingly the biases are much smaller along the observed salinity fronts aligned towards madagascar island from sumatra some models such as cnrm cmcc awi and bergen even show lower salinity along this path due to this opposite sign of the bias the basin averaged salinity bias is much weaker in these models both fsu models show a basin wide bias of 0 44 and 0 48 psu which is much larger than the ensemble mean bias 0 16 psu as well as the bias in other models the annual mean basin averaged salinity from woa observation is 34 77 psu and over the northern bob it reaches down to 32 12 psu due to the strong influence of river runoff in the northern bob the mean sss bias in the individual models ranges between 0 3 and 0 5 psu with higher values in fsu and fsu2 2 1 and 1 8 psu respectively the slight improvement in fsu2 may be due to an improvement in model physics the low salinity water flowing out of the bob along its eastern boundary shetye et al 1996 han and mccreary 2001 jensen 2001 sengupta et al 2006 crosses the basin with the sec and reaches the western indian ocean to madagascar the observed low salinity band south of the equator between 5 s and 20 s is well reproduced in all models this low salinity region also corresponds to the region of inter tropical convergence zone itcz associated with locally large precipitation yu 2011 perigaud et al 2003 the annual sss bias is only 0 11 psu over the entire basin in gfdl gold fig 15p kiel shows a large positive bias over the bob access gfdl mom and ncar show a large positive bias over the eastern as a positive bias over the seas can be attributed to the inability of these models to transport low salinity water by the eicc this behavior can be seen in the depth versus time plots of salinity over this region as well see fig 22a and section 4 4 2 sss simulations improve significantly upon refining the model s horizontal resolution kiel025 gfdl mom025 as compared to their coarser counterpart han et al 2001 reported that advection of salinity by a coastal current plays an essential role in the salinity balance this may be the reason for better salinity simulation in a higher resolution model this result contrasts the sst results fig 5 which revealed only minor sensitivity to the changes in horizontal grid resolution unlike sst spatial structure of annual mean sss and its bias are roughly symmetric across all seasons however different regions differ in seasonal sss variations fig 16 the minimum surface salinity over the nio is seen in october over the north bob fig 16b rao and sivakumar 2003 sengupta et al 2006 fsu and fsu2 seasonal cycles are outliers with a systematic positive bias of 1 psu in the bob fig 16b and in the other regions as well with slight reduction in bias as in the case of sst sss also shows large inter model spread in the bob only cmcc is able to capture the seasonal cycle with lowest observed salinity in october fig 16b peak river runoff and the integrated summer rainfall lead to a sss minimum in october eeio shows two salinity lows during the inter monsoon months of march april and october november in the seasonal sss variations fig 16c these lows are associated with precipitation due to itcz seasonality over this region the models are able to capture this semi annual signal but with varying biases and large inter model spread sss does not change significantly over the sio on seasonal time scales fig 16e it is almost constant in woa at 35 psu and the models are able to capture this near constant sss throughout the year almost all models show a positive salinity bias in the as the bob and the seas fig 16a b f but in fsu and fsu2 this bias is seen in all the sub regions in summary the core ii sss shows good representation of the asymmetric salinity pattern in the indian ocean with high salinity water in the as and low salinity water in the bob most of the models underestimate the freshening in the northern bob with improvement seen in high resolution eddy permitting models 4 3 2 barrier layer and its impact on sst bias the time varying depth of the mixed layer is a crucial parameter for the mixed layer heat budget and hence for the sst chen et al 1994 qiu et al 2004 challenges of ocean models is to simulate this time varying mld over global and regional oceans in the indian ocean the upper ocean stratification in temperature and salinity does not necessarily coincide depending upon the freshwater input it differs particularly over the bob the eeio and the seas thadathil et al 2007 sprintall and tomczak 1992 owing to its unique geographical location the bob receives large amount of freshwater both from local precipitation and river discharge estimated at about 4700 and 3000 km3 yr respectively sengupta et al 2006 annual freshwater input exceeds evaporation and hence it makes the bob relatively fresh compared to the rest of the basin this low saline water is confined within a thin layer near the surface and makes the top of the halocline shallower than the top of the thermocline this unique structure makes the mixed layer limited by the top of halocline and an isothermal layer depth ild limited by top of the thermocline the difference of these two layers is called a bl thadathil et al 2007 sprintall and tomczak 1992 bl also forms over the seas and the eeio this layer inhibits vertical mixing and hence restricts entrainment cooling from the thermocline and affects the mixed layer heat budget and sst variations observational studies show that on a seasonal scale this layer thickness is 10 60 m deboyer montégutet et al 2007 thadathil et al 2007 it has been shown in these studies that bl formation potentially plays a significant role in mixed layer heating in this section we assess the bl from all the simulations and its effect on sst the ild and mld are computed based on kara et al 2000 corresponding to temperature change of 1 c at the surface the annual mean bl from all model simulations and woa is shown in fig 17 sprintall and tomczak 1992 show that three regions eeio north bob and seas consistently display a significant bl of 10 50 m thickness throughout the year there is a bl in the north bob vinayachandran et al 2002 thadathil et al 2007 deboyer montégutet et al 2007 due to inflow of freshwater from adjoining rivers and local precipitation during the indian summer monsoon thus making the mixed layer very thin 10 20 m and in turn thickens the bl fig 17 the observed annual mean bl over the northeastern bob is 40 44 m fig 17 the northwestern bob shows slightly thinner bl mainly since the western bob experiences a regime of excess evaporation as compared to the eastern bob sprintall and tomczak 1992 pokhrel et al 2012b the bl in the western bob is maintained by the river runoff received during summer monsoon vinayachandran et al 2002 sengupta et al 2006 the east west difference in bl over bob is most prominently simulated by kiel and kiel025 other models are unable to capture this east west gradient to see how the models simulate the seasonal variation of the bl we show the time series of the bl averaged over the bob the seas and the eeio in fig 18 observation shows that the seasonality in the bl becomes most prominent over the bob during december january when it becomes 40 m thick fig 18a and is mainly driven by substantial river runoff into the north bob most of the models are unable to capture this winter time thick bl in the northern bob though the nemo group of models kiel at both resolutions cerfacs cnrm and cmcc do a reasonable job with kiel025 and cerfacs have bl slightly thicker than observed value mom and hycom class of models are unable to capture this bl notably horizontal refinement of grid resolution e g mom025 improves the bl simulations fig 30b we conjecture that the inability of the mom class of models to simulate the observed bl in contrast to the nemo class arises from differences in boundary layer parameterizations the second region with a prominent bl occurs over the eeio west of sumatra observation shows an annual mean bl thickness of 20 25 m with seasonality and peaks during november december with a bl thickness of 30 m kiel025 and cerfacs capture the observed mean and seasonality fig 18b the remaining nemo models also capture this annual mean and seasonality with reasonable accuracy the remaining models underestimate the bl fsu and fsu2 models underestimate the bl by 10 m and during the peak season november december it is doubled 20 m the presence of a bl throughout the year is due to the local maximum in p e present throughout the year oberhuber 1988 the seas is the third region where bl is prominent observation shows a thick bl 30 m over the seas fig 18c once again the nemo class of models performs better than the other models the other class of z coordinate models based on mom mom mom025 ictp and access and ncar as well as the isopycnal model bergen provide a reasonable simulation of the location and amplitude of the bl in the hybrid vertical coordinate model fsu and fsu2 bl amplitude is largely underestimated as compared to woa observation the seasonal cycle of the bl shows that the bl is maximum in january february 50 m and then gradually decreases and is almost annihilated in april shenoi et al 2004 fig 18c large spread 10 55 m is seen among the models in simulating the peak bl during january february the superiority of the nemo model class in reproducing the seasonal cycle of bl can be seen with kiel025 which is able to capture the peak magnitudes with slight overestimation although the mom simulations are unable to reach the highest value for the bl thickness the increased resolution clearly improves the peak magnitude fsu and fsu2 are notably poor in reproducing the seasonal cycle the inability of reproducing the bl is mainly due to the inability to bring the low salinity water from the north bob by the eicc during november january shankar et al 2002 rao and sivakumar 2003 as explained in section 4 3 1 4 4 subsurface features 4 4 1 subsurface temperature the spatial distribution of subsurface temperatures in the tropical indian ocean has distinct regional characteristics colborn 1975 it is well documented that all climate models tend to render a diffuse thermocline with mostly deeper than observed thermocline cai and cowan 2013 tao et al 2015 flato et al 2013 the models ability to simulate the temporal and spatial variability particularly on a seasonal timescale determines how well the model performs in terms of monsoon strength and variability it has been reported in ipcc ar5 stocker et al 2013 that the thermocline biases in cmip5 have not improved much despite the increase in resolution compared to cmip3 ipcc ar4 cai and cowan 2013 tao et al 2015 flato et al 2013 it is important in this context to investigate how the core ii simulations perform in simulating subsurface dynamics and thermodynamics the average thermocline depth in the nio is about 100 m rao and sivakumar 2000 yokoi et al 2008 2009 we thus take 100 m as a reference depth with fig 19 showing the 100 m temperature bias from models relative to woa the woa shows three distinct warm regions over the as the eeio and along 25 s 10 s in the south indian ocean the relatively cooler region over the thermocline ridge corresponds to the open ocean upwelling region xie et al 2002 schott et al 2009 similar to the sst distribution all models show a warm bias over this region as well as the western equatorial indian ocean with ictp and bergen showing the largest bias 3 c and cmcc and gfdl gold showing the smallest in these regions the basin averaged bias is largest in bergen 2 4 c followed by ictp 2 1 c whereas gfdl gold shows a negligible bias of 0 1 c the refined resolution reduces the bias especially in gfdl mom025 among the nemo group of models cmcc performed best with a basin averaged bias of 0 49 c interestingly both the isopycal bergen and hybrid class of models fsu fsu2 show larger biases than the z coordinate models this result indicates a common weakness of these models in the representation and or parameterization of near surface physical processes to see how the models capture the seasonal cycle of subsurface temperature we plot the depth versus time mean temperature and the corresponding bias over different regions the vertical levels of all models are regrided to mom depth levels fig 20a shows the upper ocean seasonal evolution of temperature from woa observation 16 core ii model simulations and its ensemble mean in the as the biases of individual models are also shown in shade with mean values represented in contours the warm surface temperature seen in april may fig 20a penetrates down to 40 m with values similar to the surface 30 c in the woa observation which is well represented by the core ii ensemble mean the upper ocean 0 100 m is warmer throughout the year with maximum of 30 c right at the surface during april may but decreasing to 26 c near 40 m below 100 m temperature changes sharply and reaching 11 c at 500 m depth the ensemble mean temperature variation is close to observed values the ensemble mean bias in the thermocline depth and below 100 300 m shows much lower values 1 c compared to many individual models thus indicating a non unidirectional bias of the models the mom group of models gfdl mom gfdl mom025 ictp and access shows a large bias in the thermocline with a range between 1 3 c with the highest bias in the coarsest model ictp among all models mri shows the maximum bias of 4 5 c in the thermocline region in the as for the nemo group of models kiel kiel025 cerfacs cnrm and cmcc the bias in the thermocline region 100 200 m is much less 1 1 5 c with almost negligible bias in cnrm however these biases are increased in the bob and the eeio fig 20b c in contrast the deeper layers below 250 m are much cooler 1 5 c in gfdl gold fsu and fsu2 in the as fig 20a and this bias reduces in the bob and the eeio fig 20b c these biases cancel each other out such that the model ensemble mean resembles the observations in bergen the thermocline shows a positive bias in the as whereas it shows a negative bias in the bob but it is much narrower relative to the mom group of models mom mom025 ictp and access which shows a broader and more diffuse thermocline increased horizontal grid resolution does not show any significant change in the thermocline bias with slight increases in the thermocline bias for both gfdl mom025 and kiel025 as compared to their coarser resolution counterparts fig 20a b c this behavior suggests that these models are producing enhanced spurious mixing due to numerical truncation errors griffies et al 2000 ilıcak et al 2012 all models show a cold and warm bias within 1 c in the upper ocean 0 100 m except awi which shows a cold bias 1 2 c in the bob fig 20b the thermocline continues to be diffuse and warmer for all models except gfdl gold and bergen which are cooler than woa in the eeio observations show a stronger seasonal cycle of temperature down to 500 m depth which is absent in other regions of the tropical io fig 20c all the models show a warm thermocline bias with ictp and mri showing the largest bias 3 4 c also note that the thermocline bias is largest in the eeio as compared to as and bob gfdl gold is an exception among all models in all regions with this model showing a cold thermocline bias with magnitude range of 0 5 1 c the positive subsurface bias is largest over the eeio as compared to the as and the bob the isotherms show a semi annual signal with peaks in may and november that penetrate down to 500 m depth which is in general present in all the models shown here this deep penetration of seasonal variation in the isotherms is due to the convergence of warm water from the western indian ocean to the eastern indian ocean associated with the spring and autumn wj webster et al 1999 rao and sivakumar 2000 the equatorial downwelling kelvin waves generated in may june and november propagate eastward and deepen the thermocline in the region off sumatra du et al 2005 the warm layer of 30 c appears in february and gradually reaches a deeper layer in may and then again cooling down to 29 c in june this near surface observed structure is well captured by the ensemble simulation the observed vertical temperature gradients are well captured in gfdl gold the eeio shows a mixed response to refinement in grid resolution with a slight bias reduction over the thermocline region but degradation below the seasonal thermocline the ensemble mean variation closely followed the woa but with a warm bias almost throughout the upper ocean with highest values in the thermocline region fig 20c 4 4 2 subsurface salinity salinity stratification is mainly driven by the precipitation evaporation and freshwater through river runoff and by the horizontal advection which also play an important role sprintall and tomczak 1992 in the nio near surface haline stratification indirectly influences the evolution of the mixed layer temperature by inhibiting the entrainment of subsurface cooler water moshonkin and harenduprakash 1991 rao and sanil kumar 1991 rao et al 1991 rao and sivakumar 2003 howden and murtugudde 2001 shenoi et al 2002 2004 miller 1976 many modeling studies have also shown that salinity plays an important role in the evolution of sst through mld variations in the tropical indian ocean cooper 1988 masson et al 2002 2005 sharma et al 2007 2010 durand et al 2011 fathrio et al 2017b these results motivate us to examine the vertical salinity gradients in the tropical indian ocean with the vertical difference of salinity between surface and 100 m shown in fig 21 the woa shows three regions with strong haline stratification 1 4 psu namely bob eeio and seas the strong vertical salinity differences are noticed primarily in the northern bob the observed difference is more than 3 psu over the northern bob the mom group of models gfdl mom gfdl mom025 access and ictp and the nemo class kiel kiel025 cerfacs cnrm and cmcc show their strongest stratification there as compared to woa the stratification is rather weak over the bob in awi bergen fsu and fsu2 as compared to woa rao 2015 has shown that within the indian ocean warm pool near surface haline stratification exist over the seas the southwestern bob and the eeio they also reported that a strong coupling between near surface salinity stratification and the subsequent evolution of warm pool core is most prominently seen over the seas the near surface vertical salinity stratification over the seas is instrumental for the mini warm pool in the as durand et al 2004 which is influenced by the advection of low salinity waters from the bob during november february rao et al 2015 hence it is of particular interest to determine how the core ii models capture this stratification since salinity stratification mostly modulates the upper ocean temperature we show the seasonal evolutions of salinity with depth over the seas the bob and the eeio the vertical levels of all models are regrided to mom depth levels fig 22a shows the seasonal evolution of salinity with depth over the seas the freshening in the upper ocean 0 50 m during december february is very prominent in the woa observation this freshening is reasonably reproduced by all models but most prominently by kiel kiel025 and mom025 below this fresh water there is an intrusion of saltier water present throughout the year with peak values in october november at about 50 m depth this intrusion of saltier water is from as high salinity water ashsw as well as salty waters from the red sea and persian gulf shenoi et al 1999 1993 2005 levitus 1983 shetye et al 1994 durgadoo et al 2017 below this saltier layer there is fresher water seen in woa with a minimum at 200 m depth which can also be seen in fig 23c note that individual profiles based observations also show this structure shankar et al 2005 shenoi et al 2005 the upper ocean is saltier during december february in all simulations with salinity larger than 1 2 psu in gfdl mom access ictp ncar bergen fsu and fsu2 aside from bergen these models also show a saltier thermocline region compared to observations as well as an increased salinity down to 300 m depth within the mom models ictp and gfdl mom are unable to capture the winter time upper ocean freshening a refinement of the horizontal resolution mom025 improves the simulation and allows the model to capture these low salinity values among all the models bergen shows the freshest thermocline in contrast to a positive salinity bias for the thermocline in other models fig 22a the core ii ensemble mean variation captures the overall observed vertical structure but with a positive salinity bias with largest value in the thermocline the ensemble mean is also unable to resolve the local minimum in salinity below fig 22b shows the seasonal cycle of vertical salinity over the bob the upper ocean 0 100 m is much fresher 33 34 psu in observations than in the seas due to the proximity of large freshwater input by river runoff mri shows the smallest biases over depth and the seasonal cycle most models show an upper ocean 0 100 m fresh bias except fsu and fsu2 which show a much saltier upper ocean there is a rather large positive salinity biased thermocline in kiel kiel025 cerfacs cnrm cmcc fsu and fsu2 whereas bergen shows a much fresher thermocline as compared to woa fig 22b the remaining models show a slightly saltier 0 3 psu thermocline in the eeio region fig 22c we see a fresh surface layer 0 100 m which is mostly captured by all models except fsu and fsu2 below 100 m salinity shows only weak variation in observations remaining nearly constant at 35 psu however the simulations show a spread with a positive salinity bias in the upper thermocline and fresh bias in the deeper ocean also see fig 23d fig 23 shows the annual mean vertical salinity variations from woa and core ii simulations averaged over different regions the vertical salinity distribution shows distinct variations in the western indian ocean as seas tr as compared to the eastern indian ocean bob and eeio over the bob and the eeio higher precipitation reduces surface salinity compared to the western basin where evaporation dominates precipitation pokhrel et al 2012b thus leading to a saltier surface layer there the observations show that in the as the high surface salinity decreases rapidly with depth to 200 m then the observed salinity decrease is small almost stable up to 800 m depth while deeper a stronger freshening occurs again all simulations show saltier upper ocean except for bergen and awi which show a fresh bias below 200 m all models reproduce a fresh subsurface layer salinities in fsu and fsu2 are the freshest of all simulations this low salinity could be due to the unrealistic exchange of salty water from the red sea and persian gulf in these models legg et al 2009 durgadoo et al 2017 in the bob the halocline is represented by a strong gradient over the upper 100 m which is captured by almost all models except for bergen which shows a negative salinity bias observations also show a local maximum in salinity around 200 400 m depth which is connected to the intrusion of high saline ashsw red sea water rsw and persian gulf water pgw rochford 1964 varadachari et al 1968 sastry et al 1985 vipin et al 2015 all models capture this subsurface salinity maximum except for bergen below 400 m fsu and fsu2 show a much fresher layer as compared to woa observation vertical salinity variations in the seas show a saltier layer at 50 m depth with a fresh layer above and below as already seen in the as in the seas models overestimate the surface and subsurface salinity with only bergen showing a clear local minimum between 100 m and 200 m depth below 600 m all models are fresher than the observations in the tr region the presence of ashsw increases subsurface salinity at 100 200 m depth although all models overestimate salinity in the upper 400 m they capture this increased salinity signature from ashsw and finally end with a rather constant salinity over depth below 1000 m as seen in observations already further up in the water column in the sio a high saline subsurface layer exists at 200 400 m depth this salty layer is formed due to the presence of indian ocean central water the excess evaporation over precipitation forms high salinity surface water 35 psu between 35 s and 25 s winter convection and downward fluxes of salt and heat causes the subtropical water to extend with salinity above 35 psu to a depth of about 500 m wyrtki 1973 the subsurface salinity maximum in the south indian ocean spreads towards the north and is carried by the south equatorial current and reduces the thickness of the central water mass to 300 m at 20 s and 100 m at 10 s the subsurface salinity maximum is at 250 m depth in which salinity can exceed 35 6 psu as reported by warren 1981 this feature is most strongly developed in the central indian ocean between 70 and 100 e along 18 s slight freshening at 1000 m depth is seen in the observation which is captured by most models except ictp and access this freshening is due to the intrusion of antarctic intermediate water in this layer wyrtki 1973 this low salinity layer has a thickness of 500 m or more and can be identified by a salinity minimum of 34 3 34 4 psu at the subtropical convergence zone warren 1981 has reported that the salinity minimum of antarctic intermediate water aaiw is at depth of 600 900 m along 18 s with depth generally increasing towards the west in summary the vertical salinity structure is more realistically captured by z level models mom and nemo group of models except for access and ictp the vertical salinity structure is less well represented by the isopycnal hybrid models bergen fsu and fsu2 an increased horizontal resolution in the model marginally improves the salinity simulation 4 5 variations in the equatorial currents 4 5 1 surface current as seen in fig 24a the core ii simulations capture the major current systems shown in fig 1 during the northeast monsoon the sc flows southward and is limited to the region south of 10 n the surface flow reverses in april and november during the inter monsoon period not shown observations show that during the southwest monsoon the sc develops into an intense jet with extreme velocities of about 2 m s during mid may and reaching to 3 5 m s during june index 1976 1979 this jet is very well reproduced in all the models however models are unable to capture the observed magnitudes not shown the sec the westward current south of 10 s does not undergo any seasonal variation in direction throughout the year the model simulated sec shows good fidelity in reproducing the spatial variability seen in the observations fig 24a compared to the observation all models show a narrower sec and an underrepresented secc pattern fig 24b shows the comparison of the seasonal cycle of the wj between different observations oscar cutler and lumpkin and the core ii model simulations all observations show the spring autumn jets peak in may november but differing in magnitude by 20 cm s interestingly all the models show a quite coherent but under represented autumn jets however there exists a large model spread 25 45 cm s in the representation of the spring jet 4 5 2 subsurface currents fig 25 shows the seasonal cycle of sub surface currents from acoustic doppler current profiler adcp observations and the core ii simulations at 90 e and the equator core ii simulations are able to capture the semi annual cycle of the euc magnitude refining the horizontal resolution from gfdl mom to gfdl mom025 indicates an improvement in the euc representation the nemo groups of models accurately simulate the euc magnitude however all models are unable to capture the timing of the peak values of euc fig 26b where the peak magnitude is reached about a month earlier february relative to adcp observations the pronounced upward phase propagation iskandar et al 2009 is weaker or near absent in the core ii models the presence of wj during inter monsoon period extends down to 100 m fig 25 the adcp observations are not available in the upper 40 m but the extent of spring wj can be seen between 40 and 100 m fig 25 to compare the lower part of wj the seasonal cycle of upper ocean current averaged over 40 100 m depth from observations and simulations are shown in fig 26a none of the models capture the observed peak spring jet values of 45 cm s whereas the models overestimate the autumn jet values the observed eastward current associated with summer monsoon in july is also not found in any of the models whereas the rest of the season they are more coherent and close to observations euc is present below wj and it is most prominent at 90 170 m iskandar et al 2009 to examine the simulated euc seasonal cycle we show the depth averaged 100 200 m zonal current from adcp observation and core ii simulations in fig 26b the peak observed euc value occurs in march april but all the models show an early peak in february march iskandar et al 2009 showed that development of an eastward pressure gradient during winter is responsible for the formation of the euc with a delay of one month equatorial wave dynamics also play a role in the development of euc a downwelling kelvin wave is excited in the western basin in march april see their fig 8b which raises the sea level in the western part whereas an upwelling rossby wave lowers the eastern basin during same time these waves are responsible for generating the pressure gradient in the core ii simulations all models show the appearance of these waves about a month early and hence the pressure gradient force gives rise to an early euc peak not shown the subsurface surface interactions in the ocean are governed chiefly by baroclinic dynamics and wave propagations if baroclinic dynamics are affected via biases in the resolved vertical structure of density the associated planetary rossby and kelvin waves will be affected too these waves are the key controlling factors for thermocline displacements and are at the core of tropical climate variability such as el nino southern oscillation and indian ocean dipole zonal mode iodzm recently shikha and valsala 2018 have shown the subsurface temperature and salinity bias in cmip 5 models over the indian ocean tend to have a positive bias in the speed of first baroclinic mode wave propagation since the first and second baroclinic modes are highly sensitive to density and its biases fig 27a shows the comparison of annual mean vertical variation of the zonal current at 90 e and at the equator the adcp observations show that the annual mean subsurface zonal current peaks at 80 m depth with a magnitude of 15 cm s fsu2 remarkably reproduces this feature as explained earlier the nemo mom class of models over under estimate this observed euc value due to these counter acting biases the ensemble mean is relatively close to adcp observations both in magnitude and depth the subsurface zonal current in april is shown in fig 27b most of the models are unable to capture the peak values at the observed depth only kiel simulations are able to capture the observed depth of the euc but with an overestimation of up to 10 cm s bergen and ncar simulate the peak euc value but it peaks at a shallower depth of 90 m the euc in the coarse model from ictp is almost absent while all other models show a comparable velocity structure as the observations the autumn euc appears at a slightly shallower depth 90 m compared to spring 110 m fig 27c with the models showing biases in the peak depth and its amplitude during autumn most models show stronger euc with varying peak depths ranging between 45 and 90 m whereas the observed value is 35 cm s at 90 m the spread of peak euc values in the autumn is much less than its spring values but in the autumn the models are unable to capture the westward current at the depth range 300 400 m seen in observations to assess the robustness of the above results we repeated the analysis at 80 e where only 3 years 2005 2007 continuous observational adcp data is available till 340 m depth nagura and masumoto 2015 we thus computed a monthly climatology for both adcp and core ii simulated data over that period at 80 e location the adcp and core ii model comparisons show coherent results with that at 90 e the wj and the euc are stronger at 80 e compared to at 90 e not shown furthermore the inter model spread for both currents is reduced at 80 e another notable difference at 80 e is that the timing of the euc peak in spring is reproduced by all models at 90 e all models exhibit an early peak recently mcphaden et al 2015 showed that the volume transport associated with the wj peaks in may november with a transport of 14 9 2 9 sv 19 7 2 4 sv the coupled models analyzed by mcphaden et al 2015 were unable to capture these observed values we examine here the performance of the core ii models by computing the transport following mcphaden et al 2015 the core ii models capture the observed seasonal variation of upper ocean volume transport not shown the ensemble mean of zonal transport shows a transport of 18 74 sv in may and 16 83 sv in november which is similar to wrytki jet volume transport reported by mcphaden et al 2015 4 6 indian ocean meridional overturning circulation the surface circulation of the northern and the equatorial indian ocean shows large seasonal changes due to seasonal reversals of the monsoon winds the seasonal variability of surface circulation is well known such as the somali current schott et al 1990 and the semiannual equatorial jet wyrtki 1973 however characteristics of cec and its underlying mechanisms are not very well known lee 2004 apart from cec the presence of an equatorial roll in the mixed layer of the indian ocean was also identified in model simulations of wacongne and pacanowski 1996 and its presence has been confirmed thereafter by observations wang and mcphaden 2017 horii et al 2013 perez hernandez et al 2012 schott et al 2002a b this shallow equatorial roll consists of a northward wind driven surface current in the upper 25 m near the equator overlaying the southward directed subsurface sverdrup transport this circulation is narrowly confined to within 1 of the equator and is most strongly developed seasonally during july october however it has little impact on cross equatorial heat transport e g schott et al 2002a b miyama et al 2003 in the north indian ocean north of 10 s the annual mean net surface heat flux is directed into the ocean oberhuber 1988 godfrey et al 2007 it is the wind driven meridional overturning circulation in the upper several hundred meters that exports the annual mean net heat gain towards the subtropical sio south of the equator wacongne and pacanowski 1996 lee and marotzke 1997 1998 garternicht and schott 1997 miyama et al 2003 godfrey et al 2007 evaluating a variety of different models over the indian ocean found a mean heat transport more than double the mean obtained when averaging the observed climatology the cec is very important for the nio warming and sea level variability srinivasu et al 2017 swapna et al 2017 fig 28 shows the indian ocean meridional overturning circulation iomoc computed from all the models and the oras4 reanalysis most of the models are able to simulate the cec while there is almost no thermocline northward flow in the coarse model from ictp the mean strength of cec varies in different models and is in the range of 2 8 sv this value is within the earlier reported value of 6 sv lee and marotzke 1997 schott et al 2002a b the cec structures as demonstrated by miyama et al 2003 is well reproduced by a majority of the models fig 28 the ensemble mean from the entire model suite is shown in upper middle panel of fig 28 the cec structure is prominent and it corroborates the finding of miyama et al 2003 although miyama et al 2003 have shown the pathways of cec the vertical extent and the exact location of equatorial crossing have not been reported in earlier studies to quantify the vertical extent and exact location we plot the cross equatorial transport across the equator the cross equatorial transports from all the individual models show the vertical extent of the northward cross equatorial flow extends over the full water column near the african coast fig 29 the magnitude of this flow varies and is strongest in cerfacs cnrm awi fsu and fsu2 the ensemble mean cross equatorial transport with depth is shown in the upper middle panel of fig 29 a narrow band of cec near the somali coast can be seen from fig 29 with vertical extent of the transport that extends to 1500 m all the models show another secondary pathway of northward transport of cross equatorial flow along 75 e with a value ranging 5 10 m2 s these values are more prominent and higher in the fine resolution mom and kiel simulations with a maximum value of 20 25 m2 s with islands and seamounts along 75 e the maldives and chagos archipelago topography plays a major role for the northward transport along that longitude nagura and masumoto 2015 used in situ observations and ogcm output to find a northward current at about 75 e they discussed its dynamics using 1 5 layer model experiments and found that the wj hits the maldives islands near 73 e and meanders leading to a northward current near the islands the kiel and mom topography do not show the presence of maldives island along the 73 e in the upper 1000 m however the mom025 and kiel025 models show the presence of bathymetry at 45 m depth onwards not shown the annual mean currents in the models at 200 m and below are mostly zonal along the equator as reported by nagura and masumoto 2015 the presence of maldives island around 73 e meanders this zonal current and leads to northward current at the southern flank of the island which mainly drives the northward transport seen in fig 29 for the 1 4 degree mom and kiel simulations the strong southward flow apparent in the kiel models near to the somali coast is due to the stronger meridional currents seen in these models this strong southward current is absent in other models not shown the transport along the african coast across 5 s is stronger than across the equator not shown this band is also a slightly wider across 10 s observations show a strong northward transport 25 30 m2 s along 50 e across the 10 s latitude not shown only gfdl mom and ictp are able to capture this band we conclude that most core ii models simulate the structure of the cec in the indian ocean additionally the core ii analysis uncovers a previously unidentified secondary pathway of cec namely there is a northward cross equatorial transport along 75 e which is also present feebly in oras4 complements the pathway near the somali coast 5 summary of impacts from model resolution momin et al 2014 is the only study that reported on the impact of model resolution for indian ocean simulations they showed an overall marginal improvement in d20 sst and sss though with a degradation in sst seasonal cycle over the equatorial indian ocean in earlier sections we identified a variety of features that differ across the ictp gfdl mom gfdl mom025 and kiel kiel025 resolution suite in this section we discuss these two resolution suites with a focus on the bay of bengal fig 30a shows the comparison of sst simulation derived from kiel and mom both coarse and fine resolution models capture the observed seasonal cycle increased resolution does not improve the biases in spring mom and summer for neither kiel nor mom the kiel and kiel025 simulations reproduce the observed sst variation during winter and spring associated with a good representation of the bl thickness fig 30b the observed thermocline seasonal cycle is well captured in mom with some improvement in mom025 however the kiel and kiel025 simulations show a systematic bias of 20 m in 20 c isotherm d20 throughout the season fig 30c possibly as a result of differences in parameterizations between kiel and mom enhanced horizontal resolution shows a significant improvement in the mld simulations both in mom025 and kiel025 as compared to their coarse resolution counterparts fig 30d the mixed layer depth in mom025 and kiel025 shows similar value to woa during spring and summer but deeper by 10 m during autumn and winter their coarse resolution counterparts show 20 m deeper mld as compared to woa observations the vertical temperature difference with respect to woa observations is shown in fig 30e kiel does not show any significant improvement in vertical temperature simulations as resolution increases but mom shows a slight warming in the deeper layer when refining the resolution which can also be seen in the seasonal bias plot in fig 20b for salinity mom shows improved simulations below the thermocline as resolution increases but in kiel bias slightly increases with increase in resolution fig 30f fig 31 shows the annual mean cross equatorial transport with depth along the equator for mom mom025 kiel kiel025 ensemble mean of all models and oras4 as explained in the previous section the coarse resolution models do not show much transport across 72 76 e but with enhanced resolution this transport is very prominent with magnitude of 25 30 m2 s earlier modeling studies show that the cross equatorial volume transport is maximum near the somali coast in a narrow band between 43 and 46 e jensen 2003 2007 miyama et al 2003 the coarse resolution mom and kiel simulations also show the similar band in the surface layer with the high resolution mom025 and kiel025 showing even narrower band of cross equatorial flow near the somalia coast fig 31 with much stronger value 50 m2 s and a strong secondary pathway along 72 76 e as previously reported at around 50 e a weak cross equatorial transport can be found in the simulations except for the mom025 configuration the cross equatorial transport near somalia coast is mainly contributed from july fig 32b whereas there is a negligible cross equatorial volume transport during january fig 32a over the somali coast there is stronger cross equatorial transport in the subsurface with enhanced resolution in kiel025 as well as mom025 the secondary cross equatorial pathways of volume transport along 72 76 e in the subsurface appear in the high resolution models both during winter and summer figs 32a 32b this feature is absent or near absent in the coarse resolution models in the ensemble mean and oras4 reanalysis products as well we conclude that increasing the horizontal resolution does not necessarily improve the temperature and salinity properties noticeably however increased resolution with a realistic topography representation does improve fidelity in the cross equatorial pathways in the indian ocean 6 summary of the assessment we presented an analysis of 16 ocean sea ice models forced according to the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments core interannual protocol focusing here on the annual mean and seasonal features of the indian ocean this assessment is the first of its kind and thus it offers an important benchmark for further studies with global ocean sea ice models or fully coupled climate models in particular we documented the mean state by analyzing surface properties sst sss and surface currents subsurface properties temperature salinity and currents and the moc the sst from cmip5 simulations was also utilized to compare the coupled and core ii simulations our study provides an assessment across a suite of high end global ocean climate models many of which were part of cmip5 climate models we identified many biases with the simulations and offered suggestions for where these biases might be related to limitations in the core ii forcing or the ocean model physical parameterizations as in other core ii assessments we do not perform sensitivity studies to support hypotheses for what mechanisms lead to the diagnosed model biases nevertheless our study provides a critical baseline from which future targeted studies can address these limitations this perspective forms the basis for the nine other published core ii assessments in the following we offer a summary of the main results from our assessment 6 1 sea surface temperature core ii models show improvement in capturing the observed seasonal variability with less bias compared to the coupled models and their sst biases are 2 times smaller than coupled simulations the sst simulations from coupled cmip5 models that we analyzed are dominated by a negative cold bias in the indian ocean of about 1 2 c with large inter model spread particularly over the eeio additionally cmip5 models are generally unable to simulate the timing and magnitude of peak sst values thus affecting the seasonal cycle over the as the bob and the eeio this result emphasizes the need to improve the atmosphere and ocean components of coupled climate models and their coupling to improve their representation of regional indian ocean features we comment in particular on the northern as where the core ii simulations show a negative cold sst bias 1 2 c during february to april which is increased to 2 3 c in the cmip5 models previous studies showed that the advection of cold air from the asian land mass causes this large cooling in coupled models marathayil et al 2013 sandeep and ajayamohan 2014 we also find that this large bias arises from a deeper mld over this region in the core ii simulations 6 2 sea surface salinity sss and barrier layer the core ii models show a positive salinity bias in the bob the as and the seas the simulations from fsu and fsu2 consistently overestimate the sss throughout the basin particularly over the bob the eeio and the sio with these two models exhibiting the largest bias among the core ii models the seasonal cycle of sss shows that inter model spread is larger in the as and the sio the unrealistic seasonal cycle in core ii models in the as might be due to the unrealistic representation of the overflow of high salinity waters from the red sea and persian gulf into the as the intrusion of high salinity water from the as to the bob during the summer monsoon murty et al 1992 vinayachandran et al 1999 is not realistic in most of the models particularly in fsu and fsu2 peak river runoff and the integrated summer rainfall lead to a sss minimum in october over the bob only cmcc captures the seasonal cycle with low salinity in october reflecting those found in observations whereas sst simulations do not notably improve with enhanced resolution the sss simulation improves significantly when moving to the eddy permitting models kiel025 and gfdl mom025 compared to their respective coarser counterparts the seasonal variation in the bl becomes most prominent during december january when it reaches 40 m thickness and is mainly driven by substantial river runoff into the northern bob none of the models capture this thick bl over the northern bob the nemo models kiel cerfacs cnrm and cmcc reasonably capture the bl and the east west gradients the mom based models and the hybrid coordinate models are unable to represent the observed bl variation we conjecture that the inability of mom class of models to simulate the bl in contrast to the nemo models might be due to the use of distinct vertical turbulence mixing schemes 6 3 indian ocean circulation features the core ii models are able to simulate the indian ocean circulation features with reasonable accuracy the wjs are weakest in the ictp simulations coarsest resolution model in the suite and are more faithfully represented in the other mom and nemo class of models all the models capture the observed seasonal cycle of wjs except ictp which underestimates both the spring and autumn jets interestingly all the models show converging values in the autumn jets however there is a larger spread among the models for the spring jet three different observations oscar cutler and lumpkin show the spring autumn jets peak in may november but they differ in magnitude the smc is almost absent in some models and the nmc is weaker in ictp again we hypothesize that this weakness is due to the coarse resolution of 2 used in the ictp model awi bergen ncar and fsu2 also show a near absence of observed peak values of smc we found a splitting of the zonal currents at 10 n off the somali coast in the as during peak summer monsoon in the observation which is absent in all simulations this splitting has not been noted in previous studies and is worthy of further investigation in the future using model and observational data all models underestimate the spring wj peak values of 45 cm s found in adcp observations whereas all models overestimate the autumn jet values the observed eastward current associated with the summer monsoon in july is also poorly simulated by the core ii models the nemo group of models most accurately simulates the euc magnitude however all models show an inaccurate timing of the peak values of the euc with models showing their peak magnitudes about a month earlier february than the adcp observations march 6 4 subsurface temperature and salinity all models show a basin wide warm bias at 100 m depth typically the mean thermocline depth except gfdl gold which shows a slightly cold bias over the eeio and eastern as ictp and bergen showthe largest bias 3 c over the western equatorial indian ocean many models ictp mri and bergen show a warmer subsurface layer over central as cmcc and gfdl gold well reproduce the observed spatial distribution of subsurface temperatures the mom group of models gfdl mom gfdl mom025 ictp and access is unable to reproduce the spatial extent and magnitude of the tr region these models show a higher temperature at 100 m depth as compared to woa although cmcc and gfdl gold capture the tr cooler water they show a cold bias in the eeio the observed spatial distributions are most accurately reproduced by cmcc whereas the bergen and ictp simulations perform the worst the seasonal evolution of subsurface temperature shows distinct differences all the models show a positive warm thermocline bias over the as bob and eeio with a magnitude ranging from 1 to 4 c mri and ictp show the warmest thermocline bias 3 4 c among all the models in all the regions whereas gfdl gold shows a slightly cold thermocline bias the nemo group of models shows a reduced bias 0 5 1 c in the as awi fsu and fsu2 also show a similar low thermocline bias over the as over the eeio isotherms below 100 m show a clear semiannual signal reaching to 500 m depth the thermocline bias shows seasonality in all the models over the as and the eeio there are maximum biases during winter and spring but over the bob the models show maximum biases during the summer time increased spatial resolution in the model increases the thermocline bias over as and bob possibly as a result of increases in spurious mixing griffies et al 2000 ilıcak et al 2012 the mom gfdl mom gfdl mom025 access and ictp and nemo kiel kiel025 cerfacs cnrm and cmcc group of models show stronger upper ocean salinity stratification near the north bob as compared to woa but over the south bob they show weaker salinity stratification awi bergen fsu and fsu2 are unable to capture either north or south bob salinity stratification 6 5 meridional overturning circulation and cross equatorial transport the moc in the indian ocean consists of a cec and a subtropical cell stc also called southern cell see fig 1b the cec is a shallow 500 m meridional overturning circulation consisting of the northward flow of southern hemisphere thermocline water upwelling in the northern hemisphere and a return flow of surface water miyama et al 2003 most of the core ii models simulate the structure of the cec the mean strength of the simulated cec is in the range of 2 8 sv which is within the earlier reported value of 6 sv lee and marotzke 1997 schott et al 2002a b the cec structures reported by miyama et al 2003 are well reproduced by a majority of the core ii models maximum transport occurs through a narrow passage near the somali coast as reported by miyama et al 2003 all simulations show a single narrow band of cross equatorial flow near the somali coast but its vertical structure is yet unknown see figs 3 and 4 of miyama et al 2003 this study shows that the vertical extent of the transport extends to 1500 m all models show a secondary pathway of northward transport of cross equatorial flow along 75 e with a value ranging between 5 and 10 m 2 s these values are more prominent and higher in the high resolution mom025 and kiel025 models with a maximum value of 20 25 m2 s thus most core ii models simulate the structure of the cec in the indian ocean importantly the core ii analysis uncovers a previously unidentified secondary pathway of cec northward cross equatorial transport along 75 e thus complementing the pathway near the somali coast we plan to study this secondary pathway in future studies targeted on the dynamics of this flow 6 6 comments on model resolution ictp is the coarsest model considered in this study which has a nominal 2 degree horizontal grid spacing with 30 vertical levels for many of the metrics assessed in this study this coarse model performed the worse we therefore suggest that indian ocean simulations should be conducted with grid spacing no coarser than the 1 degree used by the bulk of the models considered here when comparing the one degree and one quarter degree simulations we find that moving to a fine horizontal resolution plays a large role in improving mesoscale eddy dominated processes and strong confined boundary current regions in particular for the eddy active bob region the simulations are better represented using 1 4 degree models mom025 and kiel025 than their coarser resolution 1 mom or 0 5 kiel counterparts furthermore an improvement is seen in the representation of mixed layer depth and sss with simulations of 1 4 as compared to their coarse resolution counterpart however the thermocline becomes deeper as well as the vertical temperature and salinity representation degrades in 1 4 models compared to their coarser resolution counterparts this is reflected in the sst features which are not improved thus suggesting that many biases result from limitations due to physical parameterization e g vertical mixing in the boundary layers rather than limitations due to horizontal grid resolution our current understanding of the meridional overturning circulation in the indian ocean is based largely on non eddy resolving models the core ii simulations provide new insight on the cross equatorial cell which is an important component of moc in the indian ocean a future analysis will target how these new pathways improve the inter annual variability of the indian ocean 6 7 closing comments about the present study and its future implications the indian subcontinent and surrounding south asian region are home to billions of people whose livelihood depends on the ismr hence a timely and accurate prediction of the monsoon rains is crucial throughout this region presently many global prediction centers predict ismr on a seasonal time scale the seasonal prediction skill for tropical sst anomalies provides the major predictability source of monsoon precipitation and is closely linked to the models ability to accurately simulate the mean sst sperber and palmer 1996 lee et al 2010 pokhrel et al 2012a 2016 saha et al 2019 current coupled models generally show cold biases over the indian ocean our study of core ii simulations shows that these biases are reduced in core ii forced simulations thus suggesting that the origin for the coupled biases is mostly related to coupled feedbacks that amplify ocean and atmospheric biases however apart from this coupled feedback the coupled mode sst bias also arises due to the tuning effect to make coupled model s global mean temperature comparable to observations the present study also shows that despite using the same atmospheric state and experimental protocol the oceanic response from different models can be quite different as revealed by the sizable intermodal spread in many of the prognostic variables enhanced model horizontal resolution to 1 4 fails to improve the mean state and the seasonal evolutions this result emphasizes the need to improve the model physics as well as providing a realistic representation of bathymetry the phase and strength of the iod play an important role in modulating regional as well as global climate saji et al 1999 webster et al 1999 with the seasonal evolution of the iod sensitive to the representation of the model mean state a recent study also shows a model s ability to capture the teleconnection to the positive iod is closely related to its representation of the mean state hirons et al 2018 hence this study will give significant insight into the iod climate mode and its prediction recent studies by li et al 2016 2017 noted that cmip climate model projections of increased frequency of iod events cai et al 2014 increased ismr or a change in the mean state of the oceans are mostly artifacts of model errors that can significantly distort regional climate projections shikha and valsala 2018 showed that over the indian ocean cmip5 models develop internal warm and saline biases approximately between a depth range of 100 m and 800 m in long term simulations and these internal biases have implications in large scale ocean dynamics via their linkage through ocean baroclinicity these studies suggest that the mean state and subsurface biases in the state of the art coupled climate models can largely limit the model s skill for regional climate prediction the present study showed that even in forced ocean sea ice climate models the subsurface temperature and salinity biases are persistent with particular examples being the thermocline temperature biases that result in the inability of these modes to realistically represent the subsurface mean state therefore more focused research is needed

23993,we present an analysis of annual and seasonal mean characteristics of the indian ocean circulation and water masses from 16 global ocean sea ice model simulations that follow the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments core interannual protocol core ii all simulations show a similar large scale tropical current system but with differences in the equatorial undercurrent most core ii models simulate the structure of the cross equatorial cell cec in the indian ocean we uncover a previously unidentified secondary pathway of northward cross equatorial transport along 75 e thus complementing the pathway near the somali coast this secondary pathway is most prominent in the models which represent topography realistically thus suggesting a need for realistic bathymetry in climate models when probing the water mass structure in the upper ocean we find that the salinity profiles are closer to observations in geopotential level models than in isopycnal models more generally we find that biases are model dependent thus suggesting a grouping into model lineage formulation of the surface boundary vertical coordinate and surface salinity restoring refinement in model horizontal resolution one degree versus 1 4 degree does not significantly improve simulations though there are some marginal improvements in the salinity and barrier layer results the results in turn suggest that a focus on improving physical parameterizations e g boundary layer processes may offer more near term advances in indian ocean simulations than refined grid resolution 1 introduction the tropical indian ocean covers the largest part of the warm pool in the global ocean apart from the west pacific it is a key ingredient in the asian monsoons which are a lifeline for billions of people in the rim countries webster et al 1998 the indian ocean has unique features compared to the pacific and atlantic oceans most notably it is bounded to the north by the asian continent thus preventing the northward export of heat into the extratropical region between 30 and 60 n this geographical constraint leads to a basin wide meridional overturning circulation moc a full list of abbreviations is presented in the appendix and a corresponding transport of heat and mass that play a distinctive role in variability of the global climate system chirokova and webster 2006 schott and mccreary 2001 and then schott et al 2009 provided systematic reviews of indian ocean circulation in particular schott et al 2009 noted that much of the literature pertaining to simulations of the indian ocean is focused on specific aspects rather than unifying across the range of features they also pointed out that one hindrance to progress is that existing models are deficient in a number of ways such as the existence of spurious convective overturning enhanced numerical mixing and unrealistic horizontal diffusion if subsurface mixing is not adequately parameterized the simulated thermocline becomes too diffuse this error affects the temperature of the water that upwells and hence the sea surface temperature sst during recent years increases in observational data have been available under the indian ocean observing system indoos program http www clivar org clivar panels indian indoos this is a sustained observing system operated and supported by various national agencies and coordinated internationally through the climate variability and predictability clivar intergovernmental oceanographic commission ioc global ocean observing system goos indian ocean regional panel unlike for the observations a comprehensive analysis of the basin scale oceanographic features from a suite of ocean models for the indian ocean has not been documented the historical simulations using a suite of 16 global ocean ice models forced by the coordinated ocean reference experiments core ii provide an opportunity to study the dynamics of indian ocean under a coordinated modeling framework this manuscript endeavors to describe and evaluate the mean state and seasonal variations of important oceanographic features such as the sst sea surface salinity sss currents thermocline and barrier layer bl we do so with a suite of 16 state of the art global ocean sea ice model simulations with bulk formula based boundary forcing generated from the same atmospheric state there are examples of a number of successful inter comparison activities for the pacific atlantic arctic and southern oceans tseng et al 2017 danabasoglu et al 2014 2016 farneti et al 2015 ilicak et al 2016 however such coordinated modeling efforts have generally been lacking for the indian ocean we therefore aim here at assessing the simulations from forced global ocean models for the indian ocean sst is one of the most important parameters for the evolution and prediction of the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr as it represents the integrated ocean response to the atmosphere in terms of various feedbacks sahai et al 2007 rajeevan et al 2007 2012 yang et al 2007 accurate simulations of indian ocean sst are challenging given the wide variety of intraseasonal seasonal and interannual variability schott and mccreary 2001 schott et al 2009 in addition to variability intrinsic to the indian ocean there are impacts from el niño southern oscillation enso that connect from the pacific ocean annamalai et al 2005 in the north indian ocean nio hereafter enso affects sst variability through an atmospheric bridge that changes cloud cover and thus modifies surface heat fluxes e g klein et al 1999 murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 over the southwestern indian ocean enso forced sst variability arises from oceanic rossby waves generated by anomalous easterly winds that propagate from the east e g xie et al 2002 huang and kinter iii 2002 errors in simulated indian ocean sst adversely affect the ability of coupled prediction models to accurately forecast ismr chowdary et al 2015 2016 chaudhari et al 2013 levine and turner 2012 the core ii simulations do not use explicit relaxation to observed sst however since air temperature is specified as part of the core ii atmospheric state there is an effective restoring flux haney 1971 murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 griffies et al 2009 hence the core ii simulations are more constrained than coupled climate models our analysis of core ii sst biases thus offers a means to determine that portion of the coupled climate model errors that can be attributed to ocean components sss and subsurface salinities strongly affect the surface buoyancy and hence the surface and subsurface water mass structures weller and anderson 1996 murtugudde et al 1998 salinity can thus have a strong influence on the thermodynamic structure of the mixed layer thermocline and their interactions mignot et al 2007 apart from rainfall salinity distributions in the indian ocean are driven by river inflows especially in the bay of bengal bob which receives nearly as much riverine input as rainfall e g shetye et al 1996 howden and murtugudde 2001 vinayachandran et al 2002 sengupta et al 2006 the influx of freshwater fw through the indonesian through flow itf and the influx of saltier water from the persian gulf and red sea also imprint clear signatures on the dynamics and thermodynamics of the indian ocean murtugudde et al 1998 gordon et al 2010 gordon and fine 1996 mccreary et al 2001 1993 bray et al 1997 many indian ocean modeling studies use regional configurations with closed sponge boundaries at the east and south kurian and vinayachandran 2007 han et al 2001 han and mccreary 2001 often leading to unrealistic salinity properties similarly better representation of bob freshwater influx is essential for studying the salinity distribution sitz et al 2017 the near surface salinity distribution study by zhang and marotzke 1999 using a model configured with open boundaries showed an unrealistic local minimum of salinity in the north western bob due to the lack of inclusion of runoff from ganges and brahmaputra the freshwater forcing affects mixed layer depths and surface currents which can advect the freshwater input away from the rivers howden and murtugudde 2001 sengupta et al 2006 han et al 2001 rahaman et al 2014 showed an improvement in sss simulations with a nested regional model with salinity bias less than 1 psu in the northern bob however coupled models still show large biases 1 5 psu over the bob as well as the nio vinayachandran and nanjundiah 2009 fathrio et al 2017b in general the subsurface salinity bias in models is not documented for the indian ocean from a suite of global model simulations in this study apart from surface salinity we also evaluated the subsurface salinity from the suite of 16 model simulations the indian ocean circulation is dominated by the dramatic seasonally reversing monsoon winds e g webster et al 1998 the low latitude landmass of the indian subcontinent drives the strong monsoon thus causing ocean currents and winds to seasonally reverse in the nio gadgil et al 2005 gadgil 2003 schott et al 2009 seasonally reversing monsoon winds southwesterly during summer and northeasterly during winter give rise to seasonally reversing current systems in the nio the semi annual cycle in the indian ocean is also related to the seasonally reversing monsoonal winds fig 1a provides a schematic of the horizontal circulation patterns in the indian ocean including the circulations forced by the asian monsoon the major nio current systems exhibiting a reversal in direction with the monsoons see fig 1a include the somali current sc southwest and northeast monsoon currents smc and nmc west india coastal current wicc and east india coastal current eicc though the indian ocean does not possess an equatorial upwelling system similar to the pacific or atlantic major upwelling regions do occur off the coast of somalia and sumatra in the north and southeastern equatorial indian ocean respectively green shaded portions of fig 1a another unique feature is the open ocean upwelling dome or seychelles dome in the southwest of the indian ocean satellite color images clearly reveal the existence of an open ocean upwelling zone between 5 s to 12 s over the southwest indian ocean xie et al 2002 the north and south current systems are separated around 10 12 s by a nearly zonal annually prevailing south equatorial current sec the zonal structure of the sec is maintained by the zero wind stress curl around 10 s which is a consequence of the annually prevailing southeasterly winds to the south of 10 s and the seasonally reversing monsoon winds to the north this sec plays a fundamental role in transporting warm and fresh western pacific waters westward across the indian ocean through itf the sec after reaching the northern tip of madagascar bifurcates into the northeast and southeast madagascar current semc and nemc e g chen et al 2014 yamagami and tozuka 2015 the semc feeds into the agulhas current ac which is part of the anticyclonic subtropical gyre similar to those in other ocean basins however unlike other basins this western boundary current overshoots the southern extent of the african continent with a portion extending westward into the south atlantic ocean a k a agulhas leakage and a portion retroflecting and flowing eastward along the equatorward edge of the antarctic circumpolar current lutjeharms 2006 the leeuwin current waite et al 2007 is an eastern boundary current along the west coast of australia interestingly its southward flow is counter to what is expected from the predominant winds along the eastern boundary at low latitudes the indian ocean receives additional heat and mass from the pacific ocean through the itf godfrey 1996 gordon and fine 1996 murtugudde et al 1998 the itf allows the water from the pacific ocean to reach the indian ocean these waters are then transported westward across the indian ocean by the westward flowing sec in the southern tip of madagascar the semc breaks into a series of dipole eddies that propagate downstream into the agulhas current system and enters the atlantic ocean south of south africa han et al 2014 durgadoo et al 2017 nauw et al 2008 palastanga et al 2006 ponsoni et al 2016 ridderinkhof et al 2013 some part of this water then retroflects eastward back into the southern indian ocean sio to feed the south indian ocean counter current sicc palastanga et al 2007 siedler et al 2009 in this study we show how the core ii models are able to simulate these circulation features with respect to observations in addition to the annual monsoonal cycle the circulation varies semiannually along the equator with a strong surface eastward current named wyrtki jet wj wyrtki 1973 wj appears as a narrow band trapped within 2 3 of the equator during the two transition periods of monsoons april may and october november driven by the equatorial westerly winds this wj plays an important role in the large scale heat and freshwater transports in the tropical indian ocean wyrtki 1973 reverdin 1985 schott and mccreary 2001 schott et al 2009 the subsurface currents also show seasonal variations in the equatorial indian ocean observations show the presence of subsurface equatorial under current euc which is reported in various studies e g knox 1976 1981 reppin et al 1999 schott and mccreary 2001 iskandar et al 2009 in the pacific and atlantic oceans the euc is a quasi permanent feature because of the prevailing easterly trade winds philander 1973 philander and pacanowski 1980 mcphaden 1986 seidel and giese 1999 in the equatorial indian ocean however it is transient and depends on winds and pressure gradient variations associated with the distinct seasonal cycle due to the asian monsoon it is most pronounced in northern hemisphere winter iskandar et al 2009 with its presence and absence mainly determined by the weaker and stronger easterlies in late winter and early spring cane 1980 reppin et al 1999 the euc is also present during the southwest monsoon reppin et al 1999 it is associated with equatorial waves driven by the strong seasonally varying surface winds schott and mccreary 2001 the core of this eastward undercurrent is located in the thermocline region above 300 m beneath which a weak westward counter flow exists and can last for at least a month during winter and spring observations show that the magnitude of the eastward undercurrent can exceed 1 2 m s during march june and is comparable to the pacific ocean undercurrent magnitude swallow 1964 1967 previous studies show that forced model simulations are able to capture the undercurrent reasonably well iskandar et al 2009 chen et al 2015 a comprehensive evaluation of how wj and euc are represented in global models is still lacking in this study we also assessed in detail about how the core ii models perform in simulating them apart from the surface circulations and equatorial currents discussed in the previous paragraphs two cells are active in the indian ocean the cross equatorial cell cec and the southern subtropical cell sstc lee 2004 schott et al 2004 the cec is a shallow 500 m meridional overturning circulation consisting of the northward flow of southern hemisphere thermocline water upwelling in the northern hemisphere and a return flow of surface water miyama et al 2003 a schematic of the meridional circulation of the indian ocean in the upper ocean 0 500 m is given in fig 1b from lee 2004 the upper indian ocean heat balance is achieved by cec and sstc miyama et al 2003 schott et al 2004 the cec connects upwelling zones in the nio to subduction zones in the southeastern indian ocean via a southward cross equatorial branch concentrated in the upper 50 m and a northward bulk flow of cooler thermocline water miyama et al 2003 have shown that the sources of water for the subsurface branch of the cross equatorial cell are the subduction zones in the southeastern indian ocean the itf and flow into the basin across the southern boundary this subduction seems to occur predominantly in the southern subtropical indian ocean as shown in fig 1a blue shading a small subduction site also exists in the as however the exact location of this northward thermocline flow is not yet known both poor sampling of deeper layers and relatively coarse resolution models used to study the dynamics of indian ocean have contributed to poor understanding of the subsurface thermocline northward flow in the indian ocean the suite of global ocean circulation models including relatively fine resolution models that participated in the core ii simulations danabasoglu et al 2014 used in this paper made it possible to document simulated pathways of the thermocline water into the nio the cec variability accounts for a significant portion of indian ocean cross equatorial heat transport which is hypothesized to be associated with the asian monsoon chirokova and webster 2006 swapna et al 2017 the indian ocean circulation is mainly driven by the seasonal reversal of the monsoon wind thus the mean and variability of wind forcing has a large impact on indian ocean simulations parekh et al 2011 more generally the heat water and momentum balances are affected by uncertainties in turbulent and radiative heat fluxes these uncertainties in the forcing fields can have a major role in the fidelity of ogcm simulations on intra seasonal seasonal inter annual and longer time scales mcwilliams 1996 hence accurate near surface atmospheric fields are essential for realistic simulations in a forced ocean model here we offer a brief overview of how the core ii atmospheric state compares to observational based measures however a full assessment of these impacts requires comparisons to simulations run with other atmospheric products such as japanese 55 year atmospheric reanalysis jra 55 based surface dataset for driving ocean sea ice models jra55 do tsujino et al 2018 and drakkar brodeau et al 2010 forcing the analysis presented in this paper provides a necessary starting point for that assessment our study is motivated by the important role of the indian ocean in regional and global climate variability especially in the tropics this role in turn prompts the need for improved understanding of indian ocean circulation dynamics including its mean state and variability in support of improved simulations of regional and global climate e g swapna et al 2014 we are motivated to perform systematic assessments of indian ocean features found in global climate model simulations increased awareness of the role of the indian ocean for regional and global climate including its importance for the billions of humans living along its coasts and nearby regions prompts the need to systematically articulate the problems and prospects with global model simulations for this region the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the core ii simulations and the main goal of the study section 3 describes models and observational datasets section 4 contains main results and

the impact of increased model resolutions is described in section 5 major findings from our analysis and its future implications are finally summarized in section 6 2 core ii simulations and the goals of this paper the first phase of the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments core project core i made use of a synthetically constructed normal year forcing nyf large and yeager 2004 with seven modeling groups participated in the study of griffies et al 2009 an underlying question pursued with core is whether models using the same atmospheric state atmospheric state is prescribed over a fixed annual cycle will produce broadly similar simulation features however analyses showed many differences in the simulated results for example models are unable to simulate the realistic moc also models are unable to reach an equilibrium state after a transient phase that in turn prompted further model development and improvement see more details in griffies et al 2009 the second phase core ii makes use of the interannually varying atmospheric forcing iaf of large and yeager 2009 over the 60 year period from 1948 to 2007 details of the core ii protocol are given by danabasoglu et al 2014 the core ii project is the largest coordinated effort to assess the scientific integrity of global ocean sea ice simulations it is now included as phase i of the ocean model inter comparison project omip a part of the world climate research programme coupled model inter comparison project phase 6 cmip6 eyring et al 2016 as documented by griffies et al 2016 core ii simulations are readily comparable to historical observations given their historical forcing hence core ii experiments facilitate the assessment of global ocean sea ice simulations and allow one to probe ocean processes active on sub seasonal to decadal time scales e g danabasoglu et al 2014 2016 griffies et al 2014 at present there are nine core ii assessment papers published in the journal ocean modeling that provide detailed analyses over the pacific atlantic southern and arctic oceans we here focus on the indian ocean since the ismr prediction is dependent on the mean oceanic and atmospheric conditions the central question addressed in this paper is how well do global ocean sea ice models capture the mean state and seasonal cycle of the indian ocean most models employ one to two degrees horizontal grid spacing though there are two that use finer spacing 0 25 degree thus admitting mesoscale eddies in the low latitudes and correspondingly fine scale currents 3 model and observational data used in this study 3 1 models we provide a summary of 16 global ocean sea ice model configurations in table 1 with further details provided in the core ii papers of danabasoglu et al 2014 and farneti et al 2015 we focus on the 5th core ii forcing cycle and use model years corresponding to years of available observations for 1982 2007 the surface fluxes of heat freshwater salt and momentum are determined using the core ii inter annual forcing iaf atmospheric datasets the model s prognostic sst and surface currents and the bulk formulae described in large and yeager 2004 2009 there is no restoring term applied to sst sss restoring is used to prevent unbounded salinity trends in all the model simulations used for this study the nemo based models convert sss restoring to a freshwater flux all the other models apply sss restoring as a salt flux the restoring time scales vary considerably by days to years between the groups weak restoring with time scales of about 4 years were used in fsu kiel and ncar moderate restoring with time scales of 9 12 months were used in awi bergen cerfacs cmcc cnrm gfdl mom ictp and mri strong restoring with time scales of 50 150 days were used in access and gfdl gold see appendix c in danabasoglu et al 2014 for more details on sss restoring technique the vertical mixing scheme used in different models is detailed in appendix a of danabasoglu et al 2014 for sst we also make use of nine corresponding climate models table 2 from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 utilizing historical runs forced with natural and anthropogenic radiative gases to simulate climate over years 1850 2005 we use cmip5 simulations from january 1982 to december 2005 for generating a monthly climatology there are many studies which show that ismr variability is mainly governed by the mean state sst in the indian ocean lee et al 2010 li et al 2001 most of the coupled models show large cold biases in sst in the indian ocean especially in the as the cold bias will have large impacts on the coupled feedbacks and thus the monsoon sujith et al 2019 showed that improvements in mean state of sst in coupled model cfsv2 have led to realistic simulation of oceanic modes of variability over indian ocean io pacific i e enso indian ocean dipole iod and that lead to improve simulation of ismr the very purpose of core ii experiments is to see how the ocean models perform with a prescribed atmospheric state in the coupled models the exact cause of the sst bias is not yet known hence we used sst simulations from both the forced and coupled model with same ocean configuration to delineate the probable source of the sst bias the comparison between core ii and cmip5 sst patterns offers a means to expose the role of atmosphere ocean coupling with a dynamical atmospheric model on sst patterns a more complete comparison of core ii and cmip5 simulations is beyond our scope 3 2 observations and reanalysis data used for the model evaluation we make use of the following observational and reanalysis data to evaluate the core ii simulations monthly one degree gridded optimum interpolation oi sst product reynolds et al 2002 for 1982 2007 is taken from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the subsurface temperature and salinity are taken from the world ocean atlas woa09 climatology locarnini et al 2010 antonov et al 2010 boyer et al 2009 we also use woa09 for the sss in woa09 data until 2006 were used to compute the climatology however more argo profile data started in 2007 in the indian ocean including those years of data in the climatology may represent different mean state as compared to mean state based on data until 2006 since the core ii simulations ran until 2007 hence we used woa09 for this study surface currents are taken from the ocean surface current analysis oscar bonjean and lagerloef 2002 the oscar product is available at 0 33 spatial resolution and 5 day averaged for this study we computed monthly climatologies from the 5 day averaged data for the period 1993 2007 we also use ship drift climatology from cutler and swallow 1984 as well as the near surface current 0 15 m climatology version 2 07 from satellite tracked drogued drifter velocities gridded at 0 5 0 5 resolution lumpkin and johnson 2013 all these data were re gridded to 1 1 conforms to the mom grid for comparison we employ monthly mean 1 1 zonal and meridional subsurface currents from the operational ocean oras4 balmaseda et al 2013 reanalysis product for 1982 2007 the long term mean is calculated for this period inter comparison studies of different reanalysis products over indian ocean show oras4 is performing best among most of the widely used products karmakar et al 2017 observed long term monthly mean net heat flux nhf was used from national oceanography centre southampton nocs berry and kent 2009 available at 1 1 resolution we also used monthly mean tropflux praveen kumar et al 2013 nhf for 1982 2007 and computed monthly climatologies for the comparison we note that different observation based products differ among each other and this can adversely affect the assessment of model performance based on single observation thereby by comparing the model simulations with multiple observational products we may achieve robust results 3 3 datasets used for the wind speed evaluation we used buoy observed wind speed data at 3 m height provided by national institute of ocean technology niot under national data buoy programme ndbp of the ministry of earth sciences government of india premkumar et al 2000 to compare the most widely used forcing fields from core ii jra55 do tsujino et al 2018 and drakkar brodeau et al 2010 the buoy location is at 94 e 10 5 n in the bob and shown in fig 1a as red dot daily wind speed from buoy is used for the comparison the 3 hourly 55 km horizontal resolution jra55 do and the 6 hourly 75 km resolution drakkar wind speed were used for the comparison however daily averages were computed from these 3 hourly and 6 hourly data to compare with daily buoy wind speed these datasets have been corrected relative to reanalysis product era interim dee et al 2011 for drakkar and japanese 55 year reanalysis kobayashi et al 2015 for jra55 do products analogous to how core ii has been corrected we also used cross calibrated multi platform ccmp available at http rda ucar edu datasets ds745 1 access surface wind vector analyses atlas et al 2009 for the spatial wind speed comparison here we provide a comparison of core ii with drakkar and jra55 do to understand the reliability of these products for the indian ocean simulation there are notable differences in spatial resolution core ii 2 and jra55 do 0 5 as well as differences in temporal resolutions core ii and drakkar 6 hourly and jra55 do 3 hourly yet for the comparison we only considered daily averaged datasets from all products the corrected core ii jra55 do and drakkar data are available at 10 m height for comparison we interpolate the core ii jra55 do and drakkar 10 m winds to 3 m using the logarithmic scale given by stull 2011 3 4 assessment in sub regions of the indian ocean the indian ocean variability is very inhomogeneous e g schott et al 2009 hence we find it useful to examine the simulations within sub regions as shown in fig 1a these regions include the arabian sea as 50 70 e and 6 25 n the bay of bengal bob 79 5 95 5 e and 7 5 23 5 n the south eastern arabian sea seas 71 77 e and 7 13 n the eastern equatorial indian ocean eeio 80 100 e and 5 s 5 n the thermocline ridge tr 50 75 e and 5 s 10 s and the southern indian ocean sio 40 100 e and 15 s 30 s 4 results and discussions 4 1 evaluation of core ii forcing fields 4 1 1 assessment of the winds and latent heat fluxes latent heat flux lhf is mainly determined by wind speed apart from near surface air temperature and humidity thus any error in the computation of lhf due to inconsistencies in any of these components would reflect in the nhf rahaman and ravichandran 2013 have documented the evaluation of core ii near surface humidity and air temperature the findings of rahaman and ravichandran 2013 are briefly mentioned in section 4 1 2 in what follows we therefore restrict our comparison to the wind speed fig 2 shows the time series comparison of daily wind speed from corrected core ii jra55 do and drakkar in 2006 over southern bob core ii wind speed reproduce the observed seasonal and intra seasonal variability however for most of the year it overestimates the buoy wind speed fig 2 in contrast jra55 do and drakkar winds more accurately capture the buoy observed daily wind speed with slight under estimations the statistics of wind speed comparison is given in table 3 the core ii mean wind speed bias is 0 8 m s with a root mean square deviation rmsd value of 1 75 m s and a correlation coefficient of 0 8 the underestimation of jra55 do and drakkar wind speed with respect to buoy observation is reflected with mean bias of 0 40 m s and 0 35 m s respectively table 3 however the rmsd values in jra55 do and drakkar are much lower when compared to core ii core ii wind speed have larger variability as compared to buoy observation with standard deviations of 2 1 m s in the buoy and 2 6 m s in core ii jra55 do and drakkar standard deviation sd values are very close to the observed buoy value table 3 fig 3a shows the 1993 2007 mean spatial distribution of wind speed from core ii ccmp jra55 do and drakkar the basin average mean wind speed is given within each panel top right the values are roughly similar except for core ii which is slightly higher than the other products which is also seen in the buoy comparison fig 2 the mean wind speed structure over the indian ocean is dominated by the summer monsoon wind the summer monsoon wind speed over as is high as compared to bob and it reflects in the annual mean structure core ii wind speed is higher by 0 5 m s over the west coast of australia as compared to the other products this region also shows the highest wind speed over the entire indian ocean core ii wind is corrected by quikscat wind large and yeager 2009 but still it shows higher values as compared to buoy and other wind products yu et al 2007 have reported large lhf over this region in ncep2 product as compared to other products and attributed this bias to the strong wind sanchez franks et al 2018 also noted lhf biases in this region and linked them to dry biases in humidity the spatial distribution of monthly sd is shown in fig 3b all wind products show that the variability is highest over the somalia coast and it is 4 5 m s in core ii drakkar and jra55 do but slightly lower values 3 4 m s are seen in satellite based product ccmp the variability is lowest over equatorial indian ocean and in a zonal band over the south indian ocean 20 25 s in all products the sd values over these regions are similar in drakkar ccmp and jra do but slightly larger values are seen in core ii to understand the wind impact on lhf we computed latent heat fluxes using bulk formula see details in rahaman and ravichandran 2013 by using buoy observed atmospheric fields but replacing buoy wind speed with core ii jra55 do and drakkar wind speed fields the daily lhf comparison is shown in fig 4 the wind impact on lhf shows rmsd values of 50 w m2 and a mean bias of 22 w m 2 in core ii the underestimation of wind speed in jra55 do and drakkar is reflected as mean lhf bias of 11 w m 2 and 10 w m 2 respectively sanchez franks et al 2018 found that jra 55 underestimates buoy wind speed in the bob in agreement with results here biases in turbulent heat fluxes of the order reported in their work can have large implications for a product model to correctly represent monsoon related processes the rmsd values of 36 w m2 and 34 w m2 are much lower in jra55 do and drakkar as compared to core ii these results also corroborate the finding of swain et al 2009 they showed that over the seas during monsoon season 1 m s rmsd in wind speed can cause 45 w m 2 rmsd in lhf as expected the variability in core ii is also large with sd value 62 w m2 as compared to buoy sd value of 44 w m2 the sd in jra55 do and drakkar is also very close to the sd derived from buoy observations table 4 4 1 2 specific humidity air temperature and radiative fluxes rahaman and ravichandran 2013 evaluated core ii specific humidity qa and air temperature ta with independent in situ observations over the tropical indian ocean they reported that the rmsd value of ta is 0 5 c but a large drop in ta observed during intense rainfall events are not well captured by core ii products they also reported a change in 1 g kg qa can cause about 11 15 w m2 errors in latent heat flux qiu et al 2004 showed that over the western north pacific the synoptic scale heat fluxes have a large impact on sst and have typical amplitude of 1 c the downwelling fluxes of shortwave and longwave radiation from the core ii product have been evaluated with the tropical moored buoy observations venugopal and rahaman 2019 they found the mean bias in core ii over the atlantic ocean is about zero and a rmsd of 43 w m2 and 12 w m2 for downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation respectively for the indian ocean with respect to research moored array for african asian australian monsoon analysis prediction rama buoy the mean bias is roughly 3 w m2 and 8 w m 2 but with large rmsd values of 50 w m2 and 14 w m2 for downwelling short and longwave radiation respectively the variability is also underestimated with standard deviations of 70 w m2 in rama for shortwave whereas in core ii it is 48 w m2 in the case of longwave variability is larger in core ii 23 w m2 as compared to buoy values of 18 w m2 core ii forcing fields compare reasonably well to observational based measures as well as other reanalysis products 4 2 sea surface temperature in this section we offer a particularly extensive analysis of the sst given its importance for indian ocean climate variability and due to its relatively precise observational measures for the analysis purpose we regrided all models and observed sst and nhf dataset uniformly on a 1 x 1 grid 4 2 1 spatial patterns 4 2 1 1 sst patterns from core ii simulations fig 5 shows the annual mean sst bias for each model together with the model ensemble mean bias the observed and model ensemble mean sst is also shown in the upper left corner of each panels the annual mean is computed over the period 1982 to 2007 for both observations and models the oi sst data is based on advance very high resolution radiometer avhrr satellite data reynolds et al 2002 which is available from april 1981 hence we used 1982 2007 to compute monthly climatology observations fig 5a show sst cooler in the west and warmer in the east murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 schott et al 2009 and a tongue of relatively warm sst 29 c in the equatorial indian ocean forming the indian ocean warm pool fasullo and webster 1999 rao et al 2015 rao and ramakrishna 2017 the core ii ensemble mean fig 5b reproduces this warm pool structure both in terms of the magnitude and spatial extent looking at singular model annual means fig 5d s contours almost all of them reproduce the observed patterns two exceptions are awi and access where the maximum sst does not exceed 28 c and show a basin wide cold bias shaded values including the warm pool region zonal variation of the sst pattern is well reproduced in all the core ii simulations the ensemble mean sst pattern nearly replicates the observed mean sst spatial pattern individual models show biases of 1 c with a warm bias over the southwest indian ocean and cold bias over the as and bob no significant improvement is seen in the two eddy permitting models gfdl mom025 and kiel025 as compared to their coarser resolution companion configurations therefore biases may be arising more from improper representation of physical parameterizations e g boundary layer processes than coarse grid resolution or it may be also due to surface forcing bias previous studies have shown that the nhf accounts for most of the tropical indian ocean tio sst variability murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 klein et al 1999 over the as apart from the nhf oceanic processes also play a major role in the sst variability shenoi et al 2002 however sst over bob is more air sea flux driven due to the bay s bl vialard et al 2012 in the tropical southwest indian ocean swio ocean dynamics plays an important role at all timescales due to local and remotely forced ocean dynamics lau and nath 2004 murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 and xie et al 2002 2009 have shown that sst variability over this region is forced by thermocline variability and mixed layer thermocline interactions the warm sst bias over this region is coincident with the warmer thermocline temperature bias over the same region see fig 19 the nhf bias computed from model ssts is uniform throughout the basin 10 w m2 in all these models not shown which further confirms this finding the nemo based models cerfacs cnrm cmcc and kiel show slightly larger warm bias to the south of the equator as compared to other models in the as and the bob almost all simulations show a cold sst bias the annual mean cold bias over these regions mainly arises from a large cold bias during march fig 6 chowdary et al 2015 2016 have shown that the seasonal sst over the bob is governed by the seasonal nhf but the observational study of thangaprakash et al 2015 show that vertical processes and horizontal advection also play a significant role in the seasonal sst tendency over the bob the nhf in core ii simulated models does not differ much with the tropflux observations see fig 11b and section 4 2 2 2 hence the different magnitudes for the sst bias in core ii simulated models over the bob could be due to the vertical processes and horizontal advection thus supporting the finding of thangaprakash et al 2015 in the as the great whirl and the southern eddy are two dominant anti cyclonic eddies present near the somalia coast the great whirl has been observed to form during late may and early june between 5 n and 10 n a large branch of the east african coastal current eacc turns offshore after crossing the equator at about 2 n to 3 n and forms the southern gyre sg the sg is a large anticyclonic retroflection cell with a well marked wedge of cold upwelled water attached to its northern flank the southern cold wedge a third anticyclonic eddy named the socotra eddy se is frequently present in the northeast of the island of socotra beal and donohue 2013 beal et al 2013 the very prominent small circular patch of cold sst bias seen over these regions found in most of the core ii models represents the presence of these anti cyclonic eddies in july and october figure not shown most of the models show a cold bias with access showing the largest 1 5 c gfdl mom group of models also shows a fairly large cold bias whereas this bias is relatively small in the nemo group of models annual mean bias over the bob in the nemo models and fsu are least among all the model simulations the region of the equatorial indian ocean and latitudes to its south show a positive bias 0 6 c in all simulations except awi and access whose simulations show a small cold bias 0 4 c all biases are within observational errors bhat et al 2004 senan et al 2001 furthermore the flux errors are larger than the corrective fluxes needed to correct these sst biases which make it difficult to assign any errors in the models see murtugudde et al 1996 however the high mean ssts are close to atmospheric convective thresholds and thus even small errors can lead to large errors in a coupled climate model the core ii models realistically simulate the spatial distribution and zonal variation of sst in the indian ocean the basin wide bias is within 1 c seen in almost all the models which may arise from problems representing ocean physics as well as atmospheric forcing we conjecture that the most important physical process is related to vertical mixing given the importance of upper ocean boundary layer processes for setting the sst these results suggest that a focus on improved physical parameterizations may in the near term offer more advances in indian ocean simulations than refinement of the grid resolution this conclusion is supported by benshila et al 2014 4 2 1 2 comparing sst from core ii and cmip5 simulations we here compare sst from cmip5 coupled models using the same ocean component as the core ii models in particular we analyze ssts from cmip5 historical simulations from the nine models that employ the same ocean configuration used in our core ii study table 2 compared to forced core ii model simulations coupled cmip5 simulations show sst biases that are not uniformly distributed across different seasons they also show a similar pattern to that of the forced simulations described in section 4 2 1 1 but with larger amplitude the larger biases suggest the amplification of sst errors that arise from coupling with an interactive atmospheric model previous studies have identified a cold sst bias in the indian ocean in coupled climate models pokhrel et al 2012a b chowdary et al 2015 2016 prasanna 2015 fathrio et al 2017a examined the western indian ocean sst biases among cmip5 models and found that about half of the models show positive sst biases while others show negative bias the models with cold sst biases exhibit a colder bias in the entire tropical indian ocean throughout the year the positive bias was attributed to relatively weak southwest monsoonal winds over the as and an equatorial southeasterly wind bias the warm sst biases persisted until boreal fall and then disappeared in winter li et al 2015 all cmip5 models show cold sst biases over the northern as during the pre monsoon season marathayil et al 2013 sandeep and ajayamohan 2014 levine et al 2013 li et al 2015 fathrio et al 2017a studies show that anomalous advection of cold surface air from the south asian landmass during boreal winter contributes to the cold sst biases over the north as marathayil et al 2013 sandeep and ajayamohan 2014 we show the annual mean sst contour and bias color from the cmip5 simulations in fig 7 except for cesm and cmcc none of the cmip5 models reproduce the observed warm pool over the equatorial indian ocean rao et al 2015 the majority of the cmip5 models show a basin wide cold bias with highest bias in the northern as up to 4 c the north as cold bias is more than 3 c in mri whereas cesm shows the smaller cold bias of 0 6 c cesm cmcc and mri show a warm positive bias of up to 1 6 c over the western equatorial indian ocean and southeast indian ocean off the australian coast the overall basin wide cold bias is weakest in cmcc 0 12 c and largest in noresm 0 93 c the largest basin averaged cold bias in core ii ocean only simulations is 0 37 c in access biases in the ncar core ii model are only 0 1 0 2 c to the south of the equator however when coupled as part of cesm this model shows roughly five to ten times larger biases up to 1 c the large cold bias in the cmip5 models over the northern as in the annual mean mostly arises from the cold bias during february april which peaks in march fig 8 the sst cold bias is larger than 3 c in gfdl esm2m gfdl esm2g gfdl cm3 noresm and mri during march sandeep and ajayamohan 2014 show a similar cold bias but with larger amplitude over the north as in all cmip5 models they attributed this bias to an equatorward bias in the subtropical jet stream during boreal spring thus causing excessive cooling of the northern as and adjoining land regions this cold bias in coupled models was also attributed to the northeasterly cold air temperature marathayil et al 2013 the cold bias in forced core ii simulations is much weaker when compared to coupled models that use the same ocean component figs 5 and 7 the cold biases in the core ii simulations are 1 c over the northern as whereas they are 3 c in the cmip5 models with even larger biases in the mri and noresm these results suggest that the large northern as sst biases in coupled models may arise from coupled dynamical feedbacks that amplify ocean errors this hypothesis is supported by fig 9a which shows the seasonal cycle of the mixed layer depth mld in core ii models and woa observations over the northern as the core ii mlds are generally deeper than woa during february march fig 9b shows the mld vs sst bias over the northern as it can be seen that larger sst cold biases are associated with deeper mlds as compared to observations the correlation coefficient between mlds and sst bias is 0 64 which is significant at the 99 confidence level in fig 9b the bergen simulation appears like an outlier without this simulation the correlation coefficient value reduces from 0 64 to 0 50 but it is still significant at the 95 confidence level tozuka et al 2017 showed in the upstream kuroshio extension region in the north west pacific that the deeper mld is less sensitive to cooling by surface heat fluxes however roxy et al 2012 showed a shallow deep mld enhances suppress the sst anomaly thereby amplifying lessening the intra seasonal variability of the monsoon in a coupled model cfsv2 and argued that a prime focus should be on improving the mixed layer scheme of the ocean component in that model this confirms the need of improvement of mld in ocean models for a better simulation of sst over the northern as these results suggest that the origin of sst bias during spring february april mainly arise from the coupled feedbacks as well as mld biases the spatial distribution and magnitude of sst bias in core ii forced simulations are weaker than those in coupled simulations since the errors are amplified by coupled feedbacks we conjecture that the basin wide cold bias in core ii simulations arises from deficiencies in ocean vertical mixing with biases enhanced due to coupled feedbacks in the coupled model simulations 4 2 2 seasonal cycle of sst and net surface heat flux the indian ocean circulation and tracer property distributions exhibit great spatial inhomogeneity correspondingly so is the spatial distribution of the sst bias hence we here consider the area averaged seasonal cycle over the different sub regions shown in fig 1 and described in section 3 4 the ability of model simulations to correctly capture the seasonal sst variation is a difficult task particularly over the north indian ocean 4 2 2 1 arabian sea as fig 10a shows the seasonal evaluation of sst over the as from core ii simulations and its ensemble mean along with observation the observed annual cycle over the as shows a bimodal sst seasonality with the primary maximum during april may and the secondary maximum in october murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 vinayachandran and shetye 1991 fathrio et al 2017a during april may prior to the onset of the indian summer monsoon the as evolves to one of the warmest areas in the tropical oceans joseph 1990 joseph et al 2006 all core ii simulations show bi modal sst seasonality but there exists inter model spread that is largest during summer observations show that sst reduces after the onset of the summer monsoon in june it reaches a minimum during the peak summer monsoon july august over the as due to upwelling off the somali coast and arabian peninsula as well as due to latent heat loss caused by strong southwesterly monsoon winds shenoi et al 2002 another mechanism through which sst reduces over the as is the export of heat through meridional overturning few models show lower sst during july august with respect to noaa oi observation while others show slightly higher this behavior could be due to the different cross equatorial heat transport among different models swapna et al 2017 the cmip5 coupled model simulations show similar variations to those forced by core ii but cmip results show far more inter model spread fig 10c the cold biases during winter and spring in the coupled models are larger 2 c than the core ii models 0 5 c fig 10a c coupled model inter comparison project phase 3 cmip3 and other cmip5 coupled models not considered here also show similar cold biases over the as marathayil et al 2013 levine et al 2013 levine and turner 2012 showed that coupled model sst biases over the northern as are substantially larger than the observed interannual variability of as sst and in turn these biases affect the indian summer monsoon simulations and forecasts narapusetty et al 2015 the as seasonal cycle of nhf from the core ii models matches that of the tropflux observation fig 10b during october march while the magnitude is about 20 30 less than the observation despite this reasonably good match in surface heat flux forcing the cold sst bias in core ii simulations indicates the role of oceanic process in seasonal sst evolution which is also evident from the deeper mld in all models fig 9a recent studies by parampil et al 2016 have shown that tropflux derived nhf over the nio is more realistic when compared with oaflux and satellite derived products all the core ii models underestimate the nhf as compared to observations fig 10b during march october most models show a cold sst bias during spring but the majority shows warm bias during summer july august fig 10a the wind speed is strong over as in core ii during spring but it is weaker during peak summer august as compared to other wind speed products figure not shown this leads to an over estimation of the lhf in model the overestimation of the lhf due to core ii wind speed is also shown in fig 4 and table 4 as previously noted wind speed is not the sole factor determining the lhf rahaman and ravichandran 2013 they showed that the lhf overestimation is mainly due to the positive biases of core ii near surface air temperature and specific humidity fig 10d shows the seasonal evolution of ensemble mean sst and nhf from observations core ii and cmip5 simulations the nhf reaches its maximum in april whereas sst attains its maximum in may studies have shown that the seasonal evolution of sst tendency matches well with the nhf seasonal cycle chowdary et al 2015 sayantani et al 2016 kurian and vinayachandran 2007 in summary the bimodal semiannual cycle of sst in the as is well captured by the core ii forced simulations revealing weaker biases than the coupled cmip5 models we conjecture that the cold sst bias and under estimation of sst maximum in the pre summer monsoon season reflects a problem with simulated oceanic processes since the core ii ensemble nhf is reasonably well matched with both observational products additionally the inability to reach the minimum sst during the summer monsoon season may arise from biases in the wind forcing see section 4 1 1 as well as simulated oceanic processes 4 2 2 2 bay of bengal bob fig 11a shows the sst seasonal cycle over the bob from core ii simulated models and observation as for the as the semiannual cycle is very prominent in the bob with peak ssts in may and october although the sst reduces rapidly over the as following the monsoon onset sst in the bob remains higher than 28 c making the bob favorable for deep atmospheric convection gadgil et al 1984 graham and barnett 1987 the magnitude of sst reduction in the bob is smaller 1 c than in the as 2 3 c this difference arises from the bl present in the bob with this layer suppressing ocean vertical mixing and thus maintaining a higher sst throughout the year thadathil et al 2007 shenoi et al 2002 deboyer montégutet et al 2007 sprintall and tomczak 1992 the models are able to simulate the observed seasonal cycle but mostly underestimate the observed sst with kiel and kiel025 as exceptions this underestimation of sst could be due to the models inability to simulate properly the observed bl thickness thadathil et al 2007 several studies point to the impact of bl on bob s sst variation e g deboyer montégutet et al 2007 saji and yamagata 2003 saji et al 2006 girishkumar et al 2011 the model study of rahaman et al 2014 suggested the importance of relatively fine vertical grid spacing 2 m to properly represent the bl features note that most of the core ii models have vertical grid spacing no finer than 5 m in the upper ocean further evidence for the oceanic role in establishing the sst biases can be seen in fig 11b which shows that the core ii ensemble mean surface heat fluxes closely follow the tropflux observations with little spread across the models as pointed out by parampil et al 2016 data from nocs overestimates the nhf compared to other observational products this bias is also reflected in fig 11b where the nocs nhf is larger than tropflux throughout the year in contrast to the core ii forced simulations the coupled cmip5 simulations show larger sst bias ranging up to 2 c almost throughout the year with maximum during february may fig 11c the inter model spread is large in coupled models compared to the core ii forced simulations fig 11d shows the seasonal variation of the ensemble mean sst and the nhf from both core ii and cmip5 along with observations with core ii models better representing the seasonal variation of sst in the bob than cmip5 models showing a rather uniform offset of 1 c over the year compared to observations 4 2 2 3 eastern equatorial indian ocean eeio sst over the indian ocean generally shows large scale seasonal variability but sst variation in the eeio remains within about 0 5 c fig 12a the mean sst is above 28 c throughout the year thus favoring deep atmospheric convection gadgil et al 1984 and rainfall throughout the year fig 12a shows the eeio sst seasonal cycle from core ii forced models and observation the observation shows that sst exceeds 29 c throughout the year and peaks in april all models are able to capture the observed seasonal cycle with comparatively small biases 0 25 c except access and awi both of which show a systematic year round cold bias of 0 5 c similar to the as and the bob the nhf over the eeio is also underestimated by all models compared to both observational products the core ii ensemble mean value shows good agreement with the observations but a large inter model spread exists throughout the year with all models showing systematically warm or cold biases kiel and fsu show positive sst biases during april may despite a nhf that underestimates the observed values this result suggests that the nhf may not be a major factor determining the evolution of sst during april may but that instead the ocean dynamics likely dominate over the eeio particularly off java and further east horizontal advection through the itf and vertical entrainment by upwelling are the most important processes balancing the annual mean heat budget and these processes in turn control the sst variation qu et al 1994 du et al 2005 in the eeio the horizontal advection by the wj is also expected to contribute to the sst e g halkides and lee 2009 coupled cmip simulations show large cold biases throughout the year and inter model spread is much larger than their core ii counter parts fig 12c the systematic inter model spread is 2 c and the systematic bias is much larger 1 1 5 c in coupled simulations compared to 0 25 0 5 c in core ii simulations the zonal wind stress over this region is westerly from march to october and largest during northern hemisphere spring and autumn driving the bi annually observed equatorial jets in spring and autumn wyrtki 1973 these equatorial jets deepen the thermocline in the east thus contributing to sst increase in the eeio fig 12d shows the ensemble mean sst seasonal cycle from the core ii and the cmip5 simulations along with observations the ensemble mean nhf from the core ii simulations and observations tropflux and nocs are additionally overlaid the core ii ensemble mean closely matches the observed sst seasonal cycle whereas the cmip5 simulations show a systematic cold bias throughout the year with a maximum bias of about 1 2 c during december january additionally the peak sst in cmip5 models is reached in may which is one month after the observed peak in april the nhf from the core ii ensemble is underestimated throughout the year except in autumn as for the as and the bob the eeio nhf peaks one month earlier than the sst so that the tropical indian ocean sst responds to nhf changes after roughly one month 4 2 2 4 thermocline ridge tr sst in the tr also called the seychelles dome region shows a dominant annual cycle rather than a semiannual cycle as in the as the bob and the eeio levitus 1987 rao and sivakumar 1999 vialard et al 2009 sst in the tr region has a large impact on the indian summer monsoon annamalai et al 2005 and the tropical cyclone activity xie et al 2002 therefore it is important for coupled prediction models to simulate the observed sst variability over tr in particular resolving its seasonal cycle provides a useful benchmark test for model performance fig 13a shows the seasonal variation of sst from observation and the core ii simulations observational estimates show an increase in sst from august to april followed by decrease from may to july as the cross equatorial wind starts evolving fig 13a most of the model capture this seasonal variation but they generally overestimate the observed sst throughout the year with a maximum during july august up to 1 c awi and access capture the observed july august cooling over the tr region however both models have a consistently cold bias over other sub regions the nhf is underestimated fig 13b systematically by all core ii simulations with an ensemble bias 60 w m2 during july august fig 13b horizontal advection tends to warm the sst in austral winter owing to the southward ekman heat transport associated with the indian summer monsoon yokoi et al 2012 despite a large negative nhf in the core ii simulations many models show a warm bias during august thus suggesting the role of excess heat transport from north of the equator by the wind driven ekman transport yokoi et al 2012 also showed that cooling by vertical turbulent diffusion in the ocean becomes most effective in the austral summer owing to the shallow mixed layer and correspondingly shallow thermocline during that season positive sst biases may have arisen due to the reduced vertical cooling since the thermocline is deeper 85 140 m than found in the observations 75 80 m not shown similarly the cmip5 simulations also capture the observed seasonal cycle of sst but exhibit a larger inter model spread than the core ii simulations analysis indicates that almost half of the cmip5 models shows a warm bias and the rest show a cold bias thus leading to an ensemble mean cmip5 sst that is close to the observation nagura et al 2013 analyzed 35 coupled general circulation models cgcm including some cmip5 models for the simulations of the longitudinal biases in the seychelles dome they showed that the cmip5 models are unable to simulate the longitude of the upwelling dome and the magnitudes of the annual and semiannual cycles of thermocline depth variability in the dome region these biases could help to explain why some of the cmip5 models generally have problems reproducing the observed seasonal cycle of sst over this region gfdl esm2g shows a systematic cold bias throughout the year fig 13c this region also shows that the nhf leads sst by about one month fig 13d 4 2 3 zonal sst variation along the equator murtugudde and busalacchi 1999 first reported that the mixed layer thermocline interactions in the eeio potentially imply a coupled feedback furthermore saji et al 1999 and webster et al 1999 showed that coupled feedbacks in the equatorial indian ocean are critical for variability in the tropical indian ocean this variability mode is known as the iod many studies have since shown that iod is intrinsic to the indian ocean with a potential kick from the massive western pacific convection center annamalai et al 2003 annamalai and murtugudde 2004 saji et al 2006 wang et al 2016 wang and wang 2014 fig 14a shows the east west sst gradients from core ii simulations and results from cmip5 simulations are shown in fig 14b observational estimates for mean sst in the eastern and western regions are 29 6 c and 27 2 c respectively fig 14a all models show a warm bias of up to 0 9 c in the western equatorial indian ocean 45 60 e fig 14a this sort of bias concentrated on the western equatorial io would have implications for the modes of interannual variability the observation shows a sharp gradient at 65 e and nearly constant values of 29 3 c in between 65 95 e with a dip of 29 1 c at 80 e all models show nearly constant sst between 65 95 e with a spread of 0 5 c compared to observations the kiel group of models as well as fsu and fsu2 represent the upper estimates of sst along the equator while awi and access show a cold bias between 65 95 e providing the lower sst estimate of the ensemble the core ii ensemble mean shows a general warm bias stronger evolved west of 65 e in contrast to the core ii forced simulations most cmip5 simulations show colder sst throughout the basin as well as a large model spread fig 14b overall core ii models show a higher skill in simulating zonal sst distribution along the equator than the cmip5 models we summarize this analysis by noting that the seasonal variation of sst in different sub regions in the indian ocean is well captured by the core ii models compared to the coupled cmip5 simulations in particular the bi modal sst variability over the as the bob and the eeio are well reproduced in core ii models while the absolute climatological values differ regionally and seasonally by up to 1 8 c with a broad range of variations shown by the models however both core ii and cmip5 models exhibit deficiencies in capturing the equatorial indian ocean dynamics as evident from the flat zonal sst gradient and the warm bias over the open ocean upwelling dome south of the equator the seasonal prediction skill for the tropical sst anomalies is a major predictability source for monsoon precipitation in the coupled models and is closely linked to the ability to simulate the sst mean state lee et al 2010 we conjecture that the relatively poor skill of the coupled models at simulating the mean sst in the indian ocean versus the higher skill in the core ii simulations indicates the role for coupled feedbacks that amplify ocean biases these results offer a useful benchmark for use in developing methods to reduce biases in coupled prediction models 4 3 surface salinity and barrier layer in this section we study the behavior of the surface salinity and associated bl within the indian ocean much of this behavior is affected by precipitation and river runoff forcing with core ii simulations using interannually varying monthly mean precipitation derived from satellite corrected rainfall and interannually varying monthly mean river runoff dai et al 2009 danabasoglu et al 2014 additionally as detailed in griffies et al 2009 and danabasoglu et al 2014 core ii simulations are integrated with surface salinity restoring in order to reduce long term drifts in the thermohaline properties of the models details are given in section 3 1 the monthly climatology is computed over the period 1982 to 2007 for all models 4 3 1 surface salinity fig 15 shows the annual mean sss from the core ii models and their biases with respect to observation fig 15a shows the sss from woa observation fig 15b shows the ensemble mean from all models and fig 15c shows the ensemble bias asymmetry in the sss distribution with higher salinity in the as and lower salinity in the bob is seen in the observation and is reproduced by all simulations however all models show a basin wide positive salinity bias with large values over the northern bob and the seas interestingly the biases are much smaller along the observed salinity fronts aligned towards madagascar island from sumatra some models such as cnrm cmcc awi and bergen even show lower salinity along this path due to this opposite sign of the bias the basin averaged salinity bias is much weaker in these models both fsu models show a basin wide bias of 0 44 and 0 48 psu which is much larger than the ensemble mean bias 0 16 psu as well as the bias in other models the annual mean basin averaged salinity from woa observation is 34 77 psu and over the northern bob it reaches down to 32 12 psu due to the strong influence of river runoff in the northern bob the mean sss bias in the individual models ranges between 0 3 and 0 5 psu with higher values in fsu and fsu2 2 1 and 1 8 psu respectively the slight improvement in fsu2 may be due to an improvement in model physics the low salinity water flowing out of the bob along its eastern boundary shetye et al 1996 han and mccreary 2001 jensen 2001 sengupta et al 2006 crosses the basin with the sec and reaches the western indian ocean to madagascar the observed low salinity band south of the equator between 5 s and 20 s is well reproduced in all models this low salinity region also corresponds to the region of inter tropical convergence zone itcz associated with locally large precipitation yu 2011 perigaud et al 2003 the annual sss bias is only 0 11 psu over the entire basin in gfdl gold fig 15p kiel shows a large positive bias over the bob access gfdl mom and ncar show a large positive bias over the eastern as a positive bias over the seas can be attributed to the inability of these models to transport low salinity water by the eicc this behavior can be seen in the depth versus time plots of salinity over this region as well see fig 22a and section 4 4 2 sss simulations improve significantly upon refining the model s horizontal resolution kiel025 gfdl mom025 as compared to their coarser counterpart han et al 2001 reported that advection of salinity by a coastal current plays an essential role in the salinity balance this may be the reason for better salinity simulation in a higher resolution model this result contrasts the sst results fig 5 which revealed only minor sensitivity to the changes in horizontal grid resolution unlike sst spatial structure of annual mean sss and its bias are roughly symmetric across all seasons however different regions differ in seasonal sss variations fig 16 the minimum surface salinity over the nio is seen in october over the north bob fig 16b rao and sivakumar 2003 sengupta et al 2006 fsu and fsu2 seasonal cycles are outliers with a systematic positive bias of 1 psu in the bob fig 16b and in the other regions as well with slight reduction in bias as in the case of sst sss also shows large inter model spread in the bob only cmcc is able to capture the seasonal cycle with lowest observed salinity in october fig 16b peak river runoff and the integrated summer rainfall lead to a sss minimum in october eeio shows two salinity lows during the inter monsoon months of march april and october november in the seasonal sss variations fig 16c these lows are associated with precipitation due to itcz seasonality over this region the models are able to capture this semi annual signal but with varying biases and large inter model spread sss does not change significantly over the sio on seasonal time scales fig 16e it is almost constant in woa at 35 psu and the models are able to capture this near constant sss throughout the year almost all models show a positive salinity bias in the as the bob and the seas fig 16a b f but in fsu and fsu2 this bias is seen in all the sub regions in summary the core ii sss shows good representation of the asymmetric salinity pattern in the indian ocean with high salinity water in the as and low salinity water in the bob most of the models underestimate the freshening in the northern bob with improvement seen in high resolution eddy permitting models 4 3 2 barrier layer and its impact on sst bias the time varying depth of the mixed layer is a crucial parameter for the mixed layer heat budget and hence for the sst chen et al 1994 qiu et al 2004 challenges of ocean models is to simulate this time varying mld over global and regional oceans in the indian ocean the upper ocean stratification in temperature and salinity does not necessarily coincide depending upon the freshwater input it differs particularly over the bob the eeio and the seas thadathil et al 2007 sprintall and tomczak 1992 owing to its unique geographical location the bob receives large amount of freshwater both from local precipitation and river discharge estimated at about 4700 and 3000 km3 yr respectively sengupta et al 2006 annual freshwater input exceeds evaporation and hence it makes the bob relatively fresh compared to the rest of the basin this low saline water is confined within a thin layer near the surface and makes the top of the halocline shallower than the top of the thermocline this unique structure makes the mixed layer limited by the top of halocline and an isothermal layer depth ild limited by top of the thermocline the difference of these two layers is called a bl thadathil et al 2007 sprintall and tomczak 1992 bl also forms over the seas and the eeio this layer inhibits vertical mixing and hence restricts entrainment cooling from the thermocline and affects the mixed layer heat budget and sst variations observational studies show that on a seasonal scale this layer thickness is 10 60 m deboyer montégutet et al 2007 thadathil et al 2007 it has been shown in these studies that bl formation potentially plays a significant role in mixed layer heating in this section we assess the bl from all the simulations and its effect on sst the ild and mld are computed based on kara et al 2000 corresponding to temperature change of 1 c at the surface the annual mean bl from all model simulations and woa is shown in fig 17 sprintall and tomczak 1992 show that three regions eeio north bob and seas consistently display a significant bl of 10 50 m thickness throughout the year there is a bl in the north bob vinayachandran et al 2002 thadathil et al 2007 deboyer montégutet et al 2007 due to inflow of freshwater from adjoining rivers and local precipitation during the indian summer monsoon thus making the mixed layer very thin 10 20 m and in turn thickens the bl fig 17 the observed annual mean bl over the northeastern bob is 40 44 m fig 17 the northwestern bob shows slightly thinner bl mainly since the western bob experiences a regime of excess evaporation as compared to the eastern bob sprintall and tomczak 1992 pokhrel et al 2012b the bl in the western bob is maintained by the river runoff received during summer monsoon vinayachandran et al 2002 sengupta et al 2006 the east west difference in bl over bob is most prominently simulated by kiel and kiel025 other models are unable to capture this east west gradient to see how the models simulate the seasonal variation of the bl we show the time series of the bl averaged over the bob the seas and the eeio in fig 18 observation shows that the seasonality in the bl becomes most prominent over the bob during december january when it becomes 40 m thick fig 18a and is mainly driven by substantial river runoff into the north bob most of the models are unable to capture this winter time thick bl in the northern bob though the nemo group of models kiel at both resolutions cerfacs cnrm and cmcc do a reasonable job with kiel025 and cerfacs have bl slightly thicker than observed value mom and hycom class of models are unable to capture this bl notably horizontal refinement of grid resolution e g mom025 improves the bl simulations fig 30b we conjecture that the inability of the mom class of models to simulate the observed bl in contrast to the nemo class arises from differences in boundary layer parameterizations the second region with a prominent bl occurs over the eeio west of sumatra observation shows an annual mean bl thickness of 20 25 m with seasonality and peaks during november december with a bl thickness of 30 m kiel025 and cerfacs capture the observed mean and seasonality fig 18b the remaining nemo models also capture this annual mean and seasonality with reasonable accuracy the remaining models underestimate the bl fsu and fsu2 models underestimate the bl by 10 m and during the peak season november december it is doubled 20 m the presence of a bl throughout the year is due to the local maximum in p e present throughout the year oberhuber 1988 the seas is the third region where bl is prominent observation shows a thick bl 30 m over the seas fig 18c once again the nemo class of models performs better than the other models the other class of z coordinate models based on mom mom mom025 ictp and access and ncar as well as the isopycnal model bergen provide a reasonable simulation of the location and amplitude of the bl in the hybrid vertical coordinate model fsu and fsu2 bl amplitude is largely underestimated as compared to woa observation the seasonal cycle of the bl shows that the bl is maximum in january february 50 m and then gradually decreases and is almost annihilated in april shenoi et al 2004 fig 18c large spread 10 55 m is seen among the models in simulating the peak bl during january february the superiority of the nemo model class in reproducing the seasonal cycle of bl can be seen with kiel025 which is able to capture the peak magnitudes with slight overestimation although the mom simulations are unable to reach the highest value for the bl thickness the increased resolution clearly improves the peak magnitude fsu and fsu2 are notably poor in reproducing the seasonal cycle the inability of reproducing the bl is mainly due to the inability to bring the low salinity water from the north bob by the eicc during november january shankar et al 2002 rao and sivakumar 2003 as explained in section 4 3 1 4 4 subsurface features 4 4 1 subsurface temperature the spatial distribution of subsurface temperatures in the tropical indian ocean has distinct regional characteristics colborn 1975 it is well documented that all climate models tend to render a diffuse thermocline with mostly deeper than observed thermocline cai and cowan 2013 tao et al 2015 flato et al 2013 the models ability to simulate the temporal and spatial variability particularly on a seasonal timescale determines how well the model performs in terms of monsoon strength and variability it has been reported in ipcc ar5 stocker et al 2013 that the thermocline biases in cmip5 have not improved much despite the increase in resolution compared to cmip3 ipcc ar4 cai and cowan 2013 tao et al 2015 flato et al 2013 it is important in this context to investigate how the core ii simulations perform in simulating subsurface dynamics and thermodynamics the average thermocline depth in the nio is about 100 m rao and sivakumar 2000 yokoi et al 2008 2009 we thus take 100 m as a reference depth with fig 19 showing the 100 m temperature bias from models relative to woa the woa shows three distinct warm regions over the as the eeio and along 25 s 10 s in the south indian ocean the relatively cooler region over the thermocline ridge corresponds to the open ocean upwelling region xie et al 2002 schott et al 2009 similar to the sst distribution all models show a warm bias over this region as well as the western equatorial indian ocean with ictp and bergen showing the largest bias 3 c and cmcc and gfdl gold showing the smallest in these regions the basin averaged bias is largest in bergen 2 4 c followed by ictp 2 1 c whereas gfdl gold shows a negligible bias of 0 1 c the refined resolution reduces the bias especially in gfdl mom025 among the nemo group of models cmcc performed best with a basin averaged bias of 0 49 c interestingly both the isopycal bergen and hybrid class of models fsu fsu2 show larger biases than the z coordinate models this result indicates a common weakness of these models in the representation and or parameterization of near surface physical processes to see how the models capture the seasonal cycle of subsurface temperature we plot the depth versus time mean temperature and the corresponding bias over different regions the vertical levels of all models are regrided to mom depth levels fig 20a shows the upper ocean seasonal evolution of temperature from woa observation 16 core ii model simulations and its ensemble mean in the as the biases of individual models are also shown in shade with mean values represented in contours the warm surface temperature seen in april may fig 20a penetrates down to 40 m with values similar to the surface 30 c in the woa observation which is well represented by the core ii ensemble mean the upper ocean 0 100 m is warmer throughout the year with maximum of 30 c right at the surface during april may but decreasing to 26 c near 40 m below 100 m temperature changes sharply and reaching 11 c at 500 m depth the ensemble mean temperature variation is close to observed values the ensemble mean bias in the thermocline depth and below 100 300 m shows much lower values 1 c compared to many individual models thus indicating a non unidirectional bias of the models the mom group of models gfdl mom gfdl mom025 ictp and access shows a large bias in the thermocline with a range between 1 3 c with the highest bias in the coarsest model ictp among all models mri shows the maximum bias of 4 5 c in the thermocline region in the as for the nemo group of models kiel kiel025 cerfacs cnrm and cmcc the bias in the thermocline region 100 200 m is much less 1 1 5 c with almost negligible bias in cnrm however these biases are increased in the bob and the eeio fig 20b c in contrast the deeper layers below 250 m are much cooler 1 5 c in gfdl gold fsu and fsu2 in the as fig 20a and this bias reduces in the bob and the eeio fig 20b c these biases cancel each other out such that the model ensemble mean resembles the observations in bergen the thermocline shows a positive bias in the as whereas it shows a negative bias in the bob but it is much narrower relative to the mom group of models mom mom025 ictp and access which shows a broader and more diffuse thermocline increased horizontal grid resolution does not show any significant change in the thermocline bias with slight increases in the thermocline bias for both gfdl mom025 and kiel025 as compared to their coarser resolution counterparts fig 20a b c this behavior suggests that these models are producing enhanced spurious mixing due to numerical truncation errors griffies et al 2000 ilıcak et al 2012 all models show a cold and warm bias within 1 c in the upper ocean 0 100 m except awi which shows a cold bias 1 2 c in the bob fig 20b the thermocline continues to be diffuse and warmer for all models except gfdl gold and bergen which are cooler than woa in the eeio observations show a stronger seasonal cycle of temperature down to 500 m depth which is absent in other regions of the tropical io fig 20c all the models show a warm thermocline bias with ictp and mri showing the largest bias 3 4 c also note that the thermocline bias is largest in the eeio as compared to as and bob gfdl gold is an exception among all models in all regions with this model showing a cold thermocline bias with magnitude range of 0 5 1 c the positive subsurface bias is largest over the eeio as compared to the as and the bob the isotherms show a semi annual signal with peaks in may and november that penetrate down to 500 m depth which is in general present in all the models shown here this deep penetration of seasonal variation in the isotherms is due to the convergence of warm water from the western indian ocean to the eastern indian ocean associated with the spring and autumn wj webster et al 1999 rao and sivakumar 2000 the equatorial downwelling kelvin waves generated in may june and november propagate eastward and deepen the thermocline in the region off sumatra du et al 2005 the warm layer of 30 c appears in february and gradually reaches a deeper layer in may and then again cooling down to 29 c in june this near surface observed structure is well captured by the ensemble simulation the observed vertical temperature gradients are well captured in gfdl gold the eeio shows a mixed response to refinement in grid resolution with a slight bias reduction over the thermocline region but degradation below the seasonal thermocline the ensemble mean variation closely followed the woa but with a warm bias almost throughout the upper ocean with highest values in the thermocline region fig 20c 4 4 2 subsurface salinity salinity stratification is mainly driven by the precipitation evaporation and freshwater through river runoff and by the horizontal advection which also play an important role sprintall and tomczak 1992 in the nio near surface haline stratification indirectly influences the evolution of the mixed layer temperature by inhibiting the entrainment of subsurface cooler water moshonkin and harenduprakash 1991 rao and sanil kumar 1991 rao et al 1991 rao and sivakumar 2003 howden and murtugudde 2001 shenoi et al 2002 2004 miller 1976 many modeling studies have also shown that salinity plays an important role in the evolution of sst through mld variations in the tropical indian ocean cooper 1988 masson et al 2002 2005 sharma et al 2007 2010 durand et al 2011 fathrio et al 2017b these results motivate us to examine the vertical salinity gradients in the tropical indian ocean with the vertical difference of salinity between surface and 100 m shown in fig 21 the woa shows three regions with strong haline stratification 1 4 psu namely bob eeio and seas the strong vertical salinity differences are noticed primarily in the northern bob the observed difference is more than 3 psu over the northern bob the mom group of models gfdl mom gfdl mom025 access and ictp and the nemo class kiel kiel025 cerfacs cnrm and cmcc show their strongest stratification there as compared to woa the stratification is rather weak over the bob in awi bergen fsu and fsu2 as compared to woa rao 2015 has shown that within the indian ocean warm pool near surface haline stratification exist over the seas the southwestern bob and the eeio they also reported that a strong coupling between near surface salinity stratification and the subsequent evolution of warm pool core is most prominently seen over the seas the near surface vertical salinity stratification over the seas is instrumental for the mini warm pool in the as durand et al 2004 which is influenced by the advection of low salinity waters from the bob during november february rao et al 2015 hence it is of particular interest to determine how the core ii models capture this stratification since salinity stratification mostly modulates the upper ocean temperature we show the seasonal evolutions of salinity with depth over the seas the bob and the eeio the vertical levels of all models are regrided to mom depth levels fig 22a shows the seasonal evolution of salinity with depth over the seas the freshening in the upper ocean 0 50 m during december february is very prominent in the woa observation this freshening is reasonably reproduced by all models but most prominently by kiel kiel025 and mom025 below this fresh water there is an intrusion of saltier water present throughout the year with peak values in october november at about 50 m depth this intrusion of saltier water is from as high salinity water ashsw as well as salty waters from the red sea and persian gulf shenoi et al 1999 1993 2005 levitus 1983 shetye et al 1994 durgadoo et al 2017 below this saltier layer there is fresher water seen in woa with a minimum at 200 m depth which can also be seen in fig 23c note that individual profiles based observations also show this structure shankar et al 2005 shenoi et al 2005 the upper ocean is saltier during december february in all simulations with salinity larger than 1 2 psu in gfdl mom access ictp ncar bergen fsu and fsu2 aside from bergen these models also show a saltier thermocline region compared to observations as well as an increased salinity down to 300 m depth within the mom models ictp and gfdl mom are unable to capture the winter time upper ocean freshening a refinement of the horizontal resolution mom025 improves the simulation and allows the model to capture these low salinity values among all the models bergen shows the freshest thermocline in contrast to a positive salinity bias for the thermocline in other models fig 22a the core ii ensemble mean variation captures the overall observed vertical structure but with a positive salinity bias with largest value in the thermocline the ensemble mean is also unable to resolve the local minimum in salinity below fig 22b shows the seasonal cycle of vertical salinity over the bob the upper ocean 0 100 m is much fresher 33 34 psu in observations than in the seas due to the proximity of large freshwater input by river runoff mri shows the smallest biases over depth and the seasonal cycle most models show an upper ocean 0 100 m fresh bias except fsu and fsu2 which show a much saltier upper ocean there is a rather large positive salinity biased thermocline in kiel kiel025 cerfacs cnrm cmcc fsu and fsu2 whereas bergen shows a much fresher thermocline as compared to woa fig 22b the remaining models show a slightly saltier 0 3 psu thermocline in the eeio region fig 22c we see a fresh surface layer 0 100 m which is mostly captured by all models except fsu and fsu2 below 100 m salinity shows only weak variation in observations remaining nearly constant at 35 psu however the simulations show a spread with a positive salinity bias in the upper thermocline and fresh bias in the deeper ocean also see fig 23d fig 23 shows the annual mean vertical salinity variations from woa and core ii simulations averaged over different regions the vertical salinity distribution shows distinct variations in the western indian ocean as seas tr as compared to the eastern indian ocean bob and eeio over the bob and the eeio higher precipitation reduces surface salinity compared to the western basin where evaporation dominates precipitation pokhrel et al 2012b thus leading to a saltier surface layer there the observations show that in the as the high surface salinity decreases rapidly with depth to 200 m then the observed salinity decrease is small almost stable up to 800 m depth while deeper a stronger freshening occurs again all simulations show saltier upper ocean except for bergen and awi which show a fresh bias below 200 m all models reproduce a fresh subsurface layer salinities in fsu and fsu2 are the freshest of all simulations this low salinity could be due to the unrealistic exchange of salty water from the red sea and persian gulf in these models legg et al 2009 durgadoo et al 2017 in the bob the halocline is represented by a strong gradient over the upper 100 m which is captured by almost all models except for bergen which shows a negative salinity bias observations also show a local maximum in salinity around 200 400 m depth which is connected to the intrusion of high saline ashsw red sea water rsw and persian gulf water pgw rochford 1964 varadachari et al 1968 sastry et al 1985 vipin et al 2015 all models capture this subsurface salinity maximum except for bergen below 400 m fsu and fsu2 show a much fresher layer as compared to woa observation vertical salinity variations in the seas show a saltier layer at 50 m depth with a fresh layer above and below as already seen in the as in the seas models overestimate the surface and subsurface salinity with only bergen showing a clear local minimum between 100 m and 200 m depth below 600 m all models are fresher than the observations in the tr region the presence of ashsw increases subsurface salinity at 100 200 m depth although all models overestimate salinity in the upper 400 m they capture this increased salinity signature from ashsw and finally end with a rather constant salinity over depth below 1000 m as seen in observations already further up in the water column in the sio a high saline subsurface layer exists at 200 400 m depth this salty layer is formed due to the presence of indian ocean central water the excess evaporation over precipitation forms high salinity surface water 35 psu between 35 s and 25 s winter convection and downward fluxes of salt and heat causes the subtropical water to extend with salinity above 35 psu to a depth of about 500 m wyrtki 1973 the subsurface salinity maximum in the south indian ocean spreads towards the north and is carried by the south equatorial current and reduces the thickness of the central water mass to 300 m at 20 s and 100 m at 10 s the subsurface salinity maximum is at 250 m depth in which salinity can exceed 35 6 psu as reported by warren 1981 this feature is most strongly developed in the central indian ocean between 70 and 100 e along 18 s slight freshening at 1000 m depth is seen in the observation which is captured by most models except ictp and access this freshening is due to the intrusion of antarctic intermediate water in this layer wyrtki 1973 this low salinity layer has a thickness of 500 m or more and can be identified by a salinity minimum of 34 3 34 4 psu at the subtropical convergence zone warren 1981 has reported that the salinity minimum of antarctic intermediate water aaiw is at depth of 600 900 m along 18 s with depth generally increasing towards the west in summary the vertical salinity structure is more realistically captured by z level models mom and nemo group of models except for access and ictp the vertical salinity structure is less well represented by the isopycnal hybrid models bergen fsu and fsu2 an increased horizontal resolution in the model marginally improves the salinity simulation 4 5 variations in the equatorial currents 4 5 1 surface current as seen in fig 24a the core ii simulations capture the major current systems shown in fig 1 during the northeast monsoon the sc flows southward and is limited to the region south of 10 n the surface flow reverses in april and november during the inter monsoon period not shown observations show that during the southwest monsoon the sc develops into an intense jet with extreme velocities of about 2 m s during mid may and reaching to 3 5 m s during june index 1976 1979 this jet is very well reproduced in all the models however models are unable to capture the observed magnitudes not shown the sec the westward current south of 10 s does not undergo any seasonal variation in direction throughout the year the model simulated sec shows good fidelity in reproducing the spatial variability seen in the observations fig 24a compared to the observation all models show a narrower sec and an underrepresented secc pattern fig 24b shows the comparison of the seasonal cycle of the wj between different observations oscar cutler and lumpkin and the core ii model simulations all observations show the spring autumn jets peak in may november but differing in magnitude by 20 cm s interestingly all the models show a quite coherent but under represented autumn jets however there exists a large model spread 25 45 cm s in the representation of the spring jet 4 5 2 subsurface currents fig 25 shows the seasonal cycle of sub surface currents from acoustic doppler current profiler adcp observations and the core ii simulations at 90 e and the equator core ii simulations are able to capture the semi annual cycle of the euc magnitude refining the horizontal resolution from gfdl mom to gfdl mom025 indicates an improvement in the euc representation the nemo groups of models accurately simulate the euc magnitude however all models are unable to capture the timing of the peak values of euc fig 26b where the peak magnitude is reached about a month earlier february relative to adcp observations the pronounced upward phase propagation iskandar et al 2009 is weaker or near absent in the core ii models the presence of wj during inter monsoon period extends down to 100 m fig 25 the adcp observations are not available in the upper 40 m but the extent of spring wj can be seen between 40 and 100 m fig 25 to compare the lower part of wj the seasonal cycle of upper ocean current averaged over 40 100 m depth from observations and simulations are shown in fig 26a none of the models capture the observed peak spring jet values of 45 cm s whereas the models overestimate the autumn jet values the observed eastward current associated with summer monsoon in july is also not found in any of the models whereas the rest of the season they are more coherent and close to observations euc is present below wj and it is most prominent at 90 170 m iskandar et al 2009 to examine the simulated euc seasonal cycle we show the depth averaged 100 200 m zonal current from adcp observation and core ii simulations in fig 26b the peak observed euc value occurs in march april but all the models show an early peak in february march iskandar et al 2009 showed that development of an eastward pressure gradient during winter is responsible for the formation of the euc with a delay of one month equatorial wave dynamics also play a role in the development of euc a downwelling kelvin wave is excited in the western basin in march april see their fig 8b which raises the sea level in the western part whereas an upwelling rossby wave lowers the eastern basin during same time these waves are responsible for generating the pressure gradient in the core ii simulations all models show the appearance of these waves about a month early and hence the pressure gradient force gives rise to an early euc peak not shown the subsurface surface interactions in the ocean are governed chiefly by baroclinic dynamics and wave propagations if baroclinic dynamics are affected via biases in the resolved vertical structure of density the associated planetary rossby and kelvin waves will be affected too these waves are the key controlling factors for thermocline displacements and are at the core of tropical climate variability such as el nino southern oscillation and indian ocean dipole zonal mode iodzm recently shikha and valsala 2018 have shown the subsurface temperature and salinity bias in cmip 5 models over the indian ocean tend to have a positive bias in the speed of first baroclinic mode wave propagation since the first and second baroclinic modes are highly sensitive to density and its biases fig 27a shows the comparison of annual mean vertical variation of the zonal current at 90 e and at the equator the adcp observations show that the annual mean subsurface zonal current peaks at 80 m depth with a magnitude of 15 cm s fsu2 remarkably reproduces this feature as explained earlier the nemo mom class of models over under estimate this observed euc value due to these counter acting biases the ensemble mean is relatively close to adcp observations both in magnitude and depth the subsurface zonal current in april is shown in fig 27b most of the models are unable to capture the peak values at the observed depth only kiel simulations are able to capture the observed depth of the euc but with an overestimation of up to 10 cm s bergen and ncar simulate the peak euc value but it peaks at a shallower depth of 90 m the euc in the coarse model from ictp is almost absent while all other models show a comparable velocity structure as the observations the autumn euc appears at a slightly shallower depth 90 m compared to spring 110 m fig 27c with the models showing biases in the peak depth and its amplitude during autumn most models show stronger euc with varying peak depths ranging between 45 and 90 m whereas the observed value is 35 cm s at 90 m the spread of peak euc values in the autumn is much less than its spring values but in the autumn the models are unable to capture the westward current at the depth range 300 400 m seen in observations to assess the robustness of the above results we repeated the analysis at 80 e where only 3 years 2005 2007 continuous observational adcp data is available till 340 m depth nagura and masumoto 2015 we thus computed a monthly climatology for both adcp and core ii simulated data over that period at 80 e location the adcp and core ii model comparisons show coherent results with that at 90 e the wj and the euc are stronger at 80 e compared to at 90 e not shown furthermore the inter model spread for both currents is reduced at 80 e another notable difference at 80 e is that the timing of the euc peak in spring is reproduced by all models at 90 e all models exhibit an early peak recently mcphaden et al 2015 showed that the volume transport associated with the wj peaks in may november with a transport of 14 9 2 9 sv 19 7 2 4 sv the coupled models analyzed by mcphaden et al 2015 were unable to capture these observed values we examine here the performance of the core ii models by computing the transport following mcphaden et al 2015 the core ii models capture the observed seasonal variation of upper ocean volume transport not shown the ensemble mean of zonal transport shows a transport of 18 74 sv in may and 16 83 sv in november which is similar to wrytki jet volume transport reported by mcphaden et al 2015 4 6 indian ocean meridional overturning circulation the surface circulation of the northern and the equatorial indian ocean shows large seasonal changes due to seasonal reversals of the monsoon winds the seasonal variability of surface circulation is well known such as the somali current schott et al 1990 and the semiannual equatorial jet wyrtki 1973 however characteristics of cec and its underlying mechanisms are not very well known lee 2004 apart from cec the presence of an equatorial roll in the mixed layer of the indian ocean was also identified in model simulations of wacongne and pacanowski 1996 and its presence has been confirmed thereafter by observations wang and mcphaden 2017 horii et al 2013 perez hernandez et al 2012 schott et al 2002a b this shallow equatorial roll consists of a northward wind driven surface current in the upper 25 m near the equator overlaying the southward directed subsurface sverdrup transport this circulation is narrowly confined to within 1 of the equator and is most strongly developed seasonally during july october however it has little impact on cross equatorial heat transport e g schott et al 2002a b miyama et al 2003 in the north indian ocean north of 10 s the annual mean net surface heat flux is directed into the ocean oberhuber 1988 godfrey et al 2007 it is the wind driven meridional overturning circulation in the upper several hundred meters that exports the annual mean net heat gain towards the subtropical sio south of the equator wacongne and pacanowski 1996 lee and marotzke 1997 1998 garternicht and schott 1997 miyama et al 2003 godfrey et al 2007 evaluating a variety of different models over the indian ocean found a mean heat transport more than double the mean obtained when averaging the observed climatology the cec is very important for the nio warming and sea level variability srinivasu et al 2017 swapna et al 2017 fig 28 shows the indian ocean meridional overturning circulation iomoc computed from all the models and the oras4 reanalysis most of the models are able to simulate the cec while there is almost no thermocline northward flow in the coarse model from ictp the mean strength of cec varies in different models and is in the range of 2 8 sv this value is within the earlier reported value of 6 sv lee and marotzke 1997 schott et al 2002a b the cec structures as demonstrated by miyama et al 2003 is well reproduced by a majority of the models fig 28 the ensemble mean from the entire model suite is shown in upper middle panel of fig 28 the cec structure is prominent and it corroborates the finding of miyama et al 2003 although miyama et al 2003 have shown the pathways of cec the vertical extent and the exact location of equatorial crossing have not been reported in earlier studies to quantify the vertical extent and exact location we plot the cross equatorial transport across the equator the cross equatorial transports from all the individual models show the vertical extent of the northward cross equatorial flow extends over the full water column near the african coast fig 29 the magnitude of this flow varies and is strongest in cerfacs cnrm awi fsu and fsu2 the ensemble mean cross equatorial transport with depth is shown in the upper middle panel of fig 29 a narrow band of cec near the somali coast can be seen from fig 29 with vertical extent of the transport that extends to 1500 m all the models show another secondary pathway of northward transport of cross equatorial flow along 75 e with a value ranging 5 10 m2 s these values are more prominent and higher in the fine resolution mom and kiel simulations with a maximum value of 20 25 m2 s with islands and seamounts along 75 e the maldives and chagos archipelago topography plays a major role for the northward transport along that longitude nagura and masumoto 2015 used in situ observations and ogcm output to find a northward current at about 75 e they discussed its dynamics using 1 5 layer model experiments and found that the wj hits the maldives islands near 73 e and meanders leading to a northward current near the islands the kiel and mom topography do not show the presence of maldives island along the 73 e in the upper 1000 m however the mom025 and kiel025 models show the presence of bathymetry at 45 m depth onwards not shown the annual mean currents in the models at 200 m and below are mostly zonal along the equator as reported by nagura and masumoto 2015 the presence of maldives island around 73 e meanders this zonal current and leads to northward current at the southern flank of the island which mainly drives the northward transport seen in fig 29 for the 1 4 degree mom and kiel simulations the strong southward flow apparent in the kiel models near to the somali coast is due to the stronger meridional currents seen in these models this strong southward current is absent in other models not shown the transport along the african coast across 5 s is stronger than across the equator not shown this band is also a slightly wider across 10 s observations show a strong northward transport 25 30 m2 s along 50 e across the 10 s latitude not shown only gfdl mom and ictp are able to capture this band we conclude that most core ii models simulate the structure of the cec in the indian ocean additionally the core ii analysis uncovers a previously unidentified secondary pathway of cec namely there is a northward cross equatorial transport along 75 e which is also present feebly in oras4 complements the pathway near the somali coast 5 summary of impacts from model resolution momin et al 2014 is the only study that reported on the impact of model resolution for indian ocean simulations they showed an overall marginal improvement in d20 sst and sss though with a degradation in sst seasonal cycle over the equatorial indian ocean in earlier sections we identified a variety of features that differ across the ictp gfdl mom gfdl mom025 and kiel kiel025 resolution suite in this section we discuss these two resolution suites with a focus on the bay of bengal fig 30a shows the comparison of sst simulation derived from kiel and mom both coarse and fine resolution models capture the observed seasonal cycle increased resolution does not improve the biases in spring mom and summer for neither kiel nor mom the kiel and kiel025 simulations reproduce the observed sst variation during winter and spring associated with a good representation of the bl thickness fig 30b the observed thermocline seasonal cycle is well captured in mom with some improvement in mom025 however the kiel and kiel025 simulations show a systematic bias of 20 m in 20 c isotherm d20 throughout the season fig 30c possibly as a result of differences in parameterizations between kiel and mom enhanced horizontal resolution shows a significant improvement in the mld simulations both in mom025 and kiel025 as compared to their coarse resolution counterparts fig 30d the mixed layer depth in mom025 and kiel025 shows similar value to woa during spring and summer but deeper by 10 m during autumn and winter their coarse resolution counterparts show 20 m deeper mld as compared to woa observations the vertical temperature difference with respect to woa observations is shown in fig 30e kiel does not show any significant improvement in vertical temperature simulations as resolution increases but mom shows a slight warming in the deeper layer when refining the resolution which can also be seen in the seasonal bias plot in fig 20b for salinity mom shows improved simulations below the thermocline as resolution increases but in kiel bias slightly increases with increase in resolution fig 30f fig 31 shows the annual mean cross equatorial transport with depth along the equator for mom mom025 kiel kiel025 ensemble mean of all models and oras4 as explained in the previous section the coarse resolution models do not show much transport across 72 76 e but with enhanced resolution this transport is very prominent with magnitude of 25 30 m2 s earlier modeling studies show that the cross equatorial volume transport is maximum near the somali coast in a narrow band between 43 and 46 e jensen 2003 2007 miyama et al 2003 the coarse resolution mom and kiel simulations also show the similar band in the surface layer with the high resolution mom025 and kiel025 showing even narrower band of cross equatorial flow near the somalia coast fig 31 with much stronger value 50 m2 s and a strong secondary pathway along 72 76 e as previously reported at around 50 e a weak cross equatorial transport can be found in the simulations except for the mom025 configuration the cross equatorial transport near somalia coast is mainly contributed from july fig 32b whereas there is a negligible cross equatorial volume transport during january fig 32a over the somali coast there is stronger cross equatorial transport in the subsurface with enhanced resolution in kiel025 as well as mom025 the secondary cross equatorial pathways of volume transport along 72 76 e in the subsurface appear in the high resolution models both during winter and summer figs 32a 32b this feature is absent or near absent in the coarse resolution models in the ensemble mean and oras4 reanalysis products as well we conclude that increasing the horizontal resolution does not necessarily improve the temperature and salinity properties noticeably however increased resolution with a realistic topography representation does improve fidelity in the cross equatorial pathways in the indian ocean 6 summary of the assessment we presented an analysis of 16 ocean sea ice models forced according to the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments core interannual protocol focusing here on the annual mean and seasonal features of the indian ocean this assessment is the first of its kind and thus it offers an important benchmark for further studies with global ocean sea ice models or fully coupled climate models in particular we documented the mean state by analyzing surface properties sst sss and surface currents subsurface properties temperature salinity and currents and the moc the sst from cmip5 simulations was also utilized to compare the coupled and core ii simulations our study provides an assessment across a suite of high end global ocean climate models many of which were part of cmip5 climate models we identified many biases with the simulations and offered suggestions for where these biases might be related to limitations in the core ii forcing or the ocean model physical parameterizations as in other core ii assessments we do not perform sensitivity studies to support hypotheses for what mechanisms lead to the diagnosed model biases nevertheless our study provides a critical baseline from which future targeted studies can address these limitations this perspective forms the basis for the nine other published core ii assessments in the following we offer a summary of the main results from our assessment 6 1 sea surface temperature core ii models show improvement in capturing the observed seasonal variability with less bias compared to the coupled models and their sst biases are 2 times smaller than coupled simulations the sst simulations from coupled cmip5 models that we analyzed are dominated by a negative cold bias in the indian ocean of about 1 2 c with large inter model spread particularly over the eeio additionally cmip5 models are generally unable to simulate the timing and magnitude of peak sst values thus affecting the seasonal cycle over the as the bob and the eeio this result emphasizes the need to improve the atmosphere and ocean components of coupled climate models and their coupling to improve their representation of regional indian ocean features we comment in particular on the northern as where the core ii simulations show a negative cold sst bias 1 2 c during february to april which is increased to 2 3 c in the cmip5 models previous studies showed that the advection of cold air from the asian land mass causes this large cooling in coupled models marathayil et al 2013 sandeep and ajayamohan 2014 we also find that this large bias arises from a deeper mld over this region in the core ii simulations 6 2 sea surface salinity sss and barrier layer the core ii models show a positive salinity bias in the bob the as and the seas the simulations from fsu and fsu2 consistently overestimate the sss throughout the basin particularly over the bob the eeio and the sio with these two models exhibiting the largest bias among the core ii models the seasonal cycle of sss shows that inter model spread is larger in the as and the sio the unrealistic seasonal cycle in core ii models in the as might be due to the unrealistic representation of the overflow of high salinity waters from the red sea and persian gulf into the as the intrusion of high salinity water from the as to the bob during the summer monsoon murty et al 1992 vinayachandran et al 1999 is not realistic in most of the models particularly in fsu and fsu2 peak river runoff and the integrated summer rainfall lead to a sss minimum in october over the bob only cmcc captures the seasonal cycle with low salinity in october reflecting those found in observations whereas sst simulations do not notably improve with enhanced resolution the sss simulation improves significantly when moving to the eddy permitting models kiel025 and gfdl mom025 compared to their respective coarser counterparts the seasonal variation in the bl becomes most prominent during december january when it reaches 40 m thickness and is mainly driven by substantial river runoff into the northern bob none of the models capture this thick bl over the northern bob the nemo models kiel cerfacs cnrm and cmcc reasonably capture the bl and the east west gradients the mom based models and the hybrid coordinate models are unable to represent the observed bl variation we conjecture that the inability of mom class of models to simulate the bl in contrast to the nemo models might be due to the use of distinct vertical turbulence mixing schemes 6 3 indian ocean circulation features the core ii models are able to simulate the indian ocean circulation features with reasonable accuracy the wjs are weakest in the ictp simulations coarsest resolution model in the suite and are more faithfully represented in the other mom and nemo class of models all the models capture the observed seasonal cycle of wjs except ictp which underestimates both the spring and autumn jets interestingly all the models show converging values in the autumn jets however there is a larger spread among the models for the spring jet three different observations oscar cutler and lumpkin show the spring autumn jets peak in may november but they differ in magnitude the smc is almost absent in some models and the nmc is weaker in ictp again we hypothesize that this weakness is due to the coarse resolution of 2 used in the ictp model awi bergen ncar and fsu2 also show a near absence of observed peak values of smc we found a splitting of the zonal currents at 10 n off the somali coast in the as during peak summer monsoon in the observation which is absent in all simulations this splitting has not been noted in previous studies and is worthy of further investigation in the future using model and observational data all models underestimate the spring wj peak values of 45 cm s found in adcp observations whereas all models overestimate the autumn jet values the observed eastward current associated with the summer monsoon in july is also poorly simulated by the core ii models the nemo group of models most accurately simulates the euc magnitude however all models show an inaccurate timing of the peak values of the euc with models showing their peak magnitudes about a month earlier february than the adcp observations march 6 4 subsurface temperature and salinity all models show a basin wide warm bias at 100 m depth typically the mean thermocline depth except gfdl gold which shows a slightly cold bias over the eeio and eastern as ictp and bergen showthe largest bias 3 c over the western equatorial indian ocean many models ictp mri and bergen show a warmer subsurface layer over central as cmcc and gfdl gold well reproduce the observed spatial distribution of subsurface temperatures the mom group of models gfdl mom gfdl mom025 ictp and access is unable to reproduce the spatial extent and magnitude of the tr region these models show a higher temperature at 100 m depth as compared to woa although cmcc and gfdl gold capture the tr cooler water they show a cold bias in the eeio the observed spatial distributions are most accurately reproduced by cmcc whereas the bergen and ictp simulations perform the worst the seasonal evolution of subsurface temperature shows distinct differences all the models show a positive warm thermocline bias over the as bob and eeio with a magnitude ranging from 1 to 4 c mri and ictp show the warmest thermocline bias 3 4 c among all the models in all the regions whereas gfdl gold shows a slightly cold thermocline bias the nemo group of models shows a reduced bias 0 5 1 c in the as awi fsu and fsu2 also show a similar low thermocline bias over the as over the eeio isotherms below 100 m show a clear semiannual signal reaching to 500 m depth the thermocline bias shows seasonality in all the models over the as and the eeio there are maximum biases during winter and spring but over the bob the models show maximum biases during the summer time increased spatial resolution in the model increases the thermocline bias over as and bob possibly as a result of increases in spurious mixing griffies et al 2000 ilıcak et al 2012 the mom gfdl mom gfdl mom025 access and ictp and nemo kiel kiel025 cerfacs cnrm and cmcc group of models show stronger upper ocean salinity stratification near the north bob as

overturning circulation and cross equatorial transport the moc in the indian ocean consists of a cec and a subtropical cell stc also called southern cell see fig 1b the cec is a shallow 500 m meridional overturning circulation consisting of the northward flow of southern hemisphere thermocline water upwelling in the northern hemisphere and a return flow of surface water miyama et al 2003 most of the core ii models simulate the structure of the cec the mean strength of the simulated cec is in the range of 2 8 sv which is within the earlier reported value of 6 sv lee and marotzke 1997 schott et al 2002a b the cec structures reported by miyama et al 2003 are well reproduced by a majority of the core ii models maximum transport occurs through a narrow passage near the somali coast as reported by miyama et al 2003 all simulations show a single narrow band of cross equatorial flow near the somali coast but its vertical structure is yet unknown see figs 3 and 4 of miyama et al 2003 this study shows that the vertical extent of the transport extends to 1500 m all models show a secondary pathway of northward transport of cross equatorial flow along 75 e with a value ranging between 5 and 10 m 2 s these values are more prominent and higher in the high resolution mom025 and kiel025 models with a maximum value of 20 25 m2 s thus most core ii models simulate the structure of the cec in the indian ocean importantly the core ii analysis uncovers a previously unidentified secondary pathway of cec northward cross equatorial transport along 75 e thus complementing the pathway near the somali coast we plan to study this secondary pathway in future studies targeted on the dynamics of this flow 6 6 comments on model resolution ictp is the coarsest model considered in this study which has a nominal 2 degree horizontal grid spacing with 30 vertical levels for many of the metrics assessed in this study this coarse model performed the worse we therefore suggest that indian ocean simulations should be conducted with grid spacing no coarser than the 1 degree used by the bulk of the models considered here when comparing the one degree and one quarter degree simulations we find that moving to a fine horizontal resolution plays a large role in improving mesoscale eddy dominated processes and strong confined boundary current regions in particular for the eddy active bob region the simulations are better represented using 1 4 degree models mom025 and kiel025 than their coarser resolution 1 mom or 0 5 kiel counterparts furthermore an improvement is seen in the representation of mixed layer depth and sss with simulations of 1 4 as compared to their coarse resolution counterpart however the thermocline becomes deeper as well as the vertical temperature and salinity representation degrades in 1 4 models compared to their coarser resolution counterparts this is reflected in the sst features which are not improved thus suggesting that many biases result from limitations due to physical parameterization e g vertical mixing in the boundary layers rather than limitations due to horizontal grid resolution our current understanding of the meridional overturning circulation in the indian ocean is based largely on non eddy resolving models the core ii simulations provide new insight on the cross equatorial cell which is an important component of moc in the indian ocean a future analysis will target how these new pathways improve the inter annual variability of the indian ocean 6 7 closing comments about the present study and its future implications the indian subcontinent and surrounding south asian region are home to billions of people whose livelihood depends on the ismr hence a timely and accurate prediction of the monsoon rains is crucial throughout this region presently many global prediction centers predict ismr on a seasonal time scale the seasonal prediction skill for tropical sst anomalies provides the major predictability source of monsoon precipitation and is closely linked to the models ability to accurately simulate the mean sst sperber and palmer 1996 lee et al 2010 pokhrel et al 2012a 2016 saha et al 2019 current coupled models generally show cold biases over the indian ocean our study of core ii simulations shows that these biases are reduced in core ii forced simulations thus suggesting that the origin for the coupled biases is mostly related to coupled feedbacks that amplify ocean and atmospheric biases however apart from this coupled feedback the coupled mode sst bias also arises due to the tuning effect to make coupled model s global mean temperature comparable to observations the present study also shows that despite using the same atmospheric state and experimental protocol the oceanic response from different models can be quite different as revealed by the sizable intermodal spread in many of the prognostic variables enhanced model horizontal resolution to 1 4 fails to improve the mean state and the seasonal evolutions this result emphasizes the need to improve the model physics as well as providing a realistic representation of bathymetry the phase and strength of the iod play an important role in modulating regional as well as global climate saji et al 1999 webster et al 1999 with the seasonal evolution of the iod sensitive to the representation of the model mean state a recent study also shows a model s ability to capture the teleconnection to the positive iod is closely related to its representation of the mean state hirons et al 2018 hence this study will give significant insight into the iod climate mode and its prediction recent studies by li et al 2016 2017 noted that cmip climate model projections of increased frequency of iod events cai et al 2014 increased ismr or a change in the mean state of the oceans are mostly artifacts of model errors that can significantly distort regional climate projections shikha and valsala 2018 showed that over the indian ocean cmip5 models develop internal warm and saline biases approximately between a depth range of 100 m and 800 m in long term simulations and these internal biases have implications in large scale ocean dynamics via their linkage through ocean baroclinicity these studies suggest that the mean state and subsurface biases in the state of the art coupled climate models can largely limit the model s skill for regional climate prediction the present study showed that even in forced ocean sea ice climate models the subsurface temperature and salinity biases are persistent with particular examples being the thermocline temperature biases that result in the inability of these modes to realistically represent the subsurface mean state therefore more focused research is needed

23994,this article describes 3d medium 4km and high 500m horizontal resolution ocean models developed for the coral sea with a particular focus on the great barrier reef lagoon the medium resolution model is underpinning a 10 year reanalysis and a forecast demonstrator system for maritime monitoring the ocean models have been developed to assist the management of the great barrier reef given the existence of a number of stressors acting on the reef the presented models aim to represent physical stressors that include thermal salinity and flooding rivers the river discharge is tracked by passive and age tracers they can provide concentrations to identify the area volume influenced by flood water this paper gives an overview of the forward non linear models with the aim to assess their performance the models have been evaluated over a two year period spanning january 2009 march 2011 including the 2010 2011 la nina and the advent of tropical cyclone yasi in early 2011 that contributed to one of the largest river discharge events recorded over northern queensland the models performance is investigated on a full domain scale via means of satellite sea surface temperature sst expendable bathythermograph xbt and drifter data over the shelf and the great barrier reef lagoon available tide gauges ocean colour chlorophyll a and queensland s integrated marine observing system qimos mooring data of temperature salinity and velocity have been used to assess the models results suggest that the high resolution model gives better statistics in terms of mean absolute deviation and bias compared to the medium resolution model for subsurface temperature and salinity over the deep ocean moreover sea surface temperature performance is similar for both models over the lagoon and shelf both models performance is mixed the high resolution model displays a consistent warm bias on the order of 0 3 c over the shallow well mixed stations throughout the year however the 4km model displays larger variability in this region it tends to be too warm in summer and too cool in winter when compared to moorings modelled velocities are assessed via means of the qimos moorings overall the high resolution model fares better in terms of current direction with an average veering of 13 vs 22 the models performance is comparable in terms of current speed over the shallow moorings however the high resolution model is better equipped to represent steeper shelves and this results at times in better performance for velocity and temperature particularly over palm passage a large focus has been placed on including and assessing passive tracer dynamics emanating from river discharge 25 river sources have been added across the models domain together with a set of one dimensional channels representing the volume flux of brine two case studies are presented to demonstrate the models ability to reproduce mean features of observed plumes a major river discharge event has been examined in further detail both models are able to reproduce the low salinity signal present in the observations in the upper level to a satisfactory degree the 4km model matches the observed strength and duration of the fresh water plume substantially better than the high resolution model in this case 1 introduction the great barrier reef gbr is the largest adjacent coral reef complex in the world kinsey 2004 it comprises the shelf sea off the queensland region of australia and forms part of the unesco world heritage area a number of stressors have been and continue to act on the reef system causing damage to the reef complex for example silt nutrients from fertiliser and animals and herbicides and pesticides are washed off the land especially during major rain storms and may find their way via streams and estuaries into the ocean devlin et al 2011 2013 ocean warming and acidification due to a changed climate steinberg 2007 put further pressure on the system and have been linked to reef decline while mechanical damage may occur from dredging tropical cyclones and fishing de ath et al 2012 a major threat is brought upon the reef via crown of thorns starfish cots infestation elevated nutrients in the seawater are believed to rapidly increase their population de ath et al 2012 from an oceanographic point of view ocean currents are responsible for carrying material away from discharging estuaries and can propagate them to reef locations where they impact water quality environmental prediction and monitoring of ocean currents and river discharge in this region is thought to have potential to provide information beneficial for managing and mitigating anthropogenic pressures on the gbr the large scale circulation of the pacific ocean and coral sea is shown in fig 1 the main circulation feature is a principal flow towards the coast via the south equatorial current sec the sec is split up into various jets such as the north vanuatu jet nvj and the north south caledonian jet n scj that exhibits large seasonality the sec bifurcates near the shelf edge flowing toward the south as the source water of the east australian current eac and as a weaker current toward the north forming the north queensland current nqc and papua gyre pg the large scale forcing via the sec varies on time scales of months to years the atmospheric forcing is partially responsible for the seasonal variation in strength of the east australian current eac the eac is strongest in austral summer and weakest in winter autumn months hence responding to the seasonally active southeast trade winds the northwest monsoon is active from december to march and tends to coincide with strong southward flow within the eac intrannual variability within the eac has also been reported to be dominated by 90 140 day mesoscale period corresponding to the meandering and eddy shedding time scale e g archer et al 2017 and references therein ocean dynamics within the reef are impacted by tides winds sea level pressure slp continental shelf waves river discharge and upwelling the main flow direction within the reef matrix follows the atmospheric mean circulation hence northward flows are observed during active southeast trades the flow has a southward direction otherwise watermass exchange between the reef and the adjacent deep ocean plays an important role in the health of the reef and the shelf s ecosystem the interaction of the reef with the shelf provides a control mechanism of reef temperature even in the absence of wind and induces cross shelf changes in nutrient supply for reef communities e g andrews and gentien 1982 schiller et al 2015 benthuysen et al 2016 the continental shelf is narrow in the north about 40 60 km wide and has a dense reef coverage the shelf widens towards the south and is less densely populated with coral reefs over the central region a change in orientation of the shelf at around 17 s allows the southward flowing eac to impact directly onto the lagoon this is consistent with early model studies brinkman et al 2002 that predicted the measured bifurcation point at which the sec splits into north and southward flow at around 17 18 s one of the main passages in that vicinity allowing for the cross shelf exchange is palm passage intrusive upwelling events here are associated with cooler saltier waters penetrating onto the reef e g benthuysen et al 2016 these events happen on a regular basis typically from october to march since they only involve the near bottom layers they are undetectable from space hydrodynamic model simulations can assist in detecting these events and furthermore characterising their spread and strength schiller et al 2015 benthuysen et al 2016 sandery et al 2019 here we describe hydrodynamic models of differing resolution that have been developed for the great barrier reef the higher resolution 500 m model was implemented to provide a nature run to better resolve the complex reef system and therefore to provide a system wide reference data given the limitations of the observing system within the lagoon the target application for the bureau of meteorology bom was a 4 km model for a data assimilating reanalysis and a forecast system of the physical state sandery et al 2019 colberg et al 2018 the setup is similar to a modelling approach taken by the csiro ereefs system e g schiller et al 2015 herzfeld 2015 who use the sparse hydrodynamic ocean code shoc herzfeld et al 2008 to model the gbr with different horizontal resolution 4 km and 1 km their model forms the core of a suite of hydrodynamic biogeochemical and sediment models across paddock catchment estuary reef lagoon and ocean scales both the csiro and bom ereefs initiatives are funded by australian and queensland state government agencies and private investors to inform on the management of risk on water quality of the gbr the bom focusses on physical aspects of the system with a data assimilating forecasting service in mind it has several points of distinction from the csiro approach such as terrain following coordinates which have an advantage in representing the lagoon and river channels but with known limitations at the shelf break which need to be carefully minimised other differences such as the implementation of freshwater fluxes are touched upon in the relevant model section with greater detail when appropriate references and comparison to the csiro gbr models are included throughout this study the main focus of this study is on assessing the models performance on coastal and shelf scales with a forecast service in mind models are compared to the available queensland integrated marine observing system qimos moorings for temperature salinity and velocity over a roughly 2 year period jan 2009 mar 2011 section 2 gives an overview of the applied ocean models the models performance is assessed in section 3 on the full domain and shelf and coastal scales section 4 provides two case studies of river discharge events of note while section 5 gives a summary and a final discussion of the results 2 system setup 2 1 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model used for this study is the regional ocean modelling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 a finite difference model that uses stretched terrain following vertical coordinates the study region and model domain are shown in fig 1 the bathymetry used is a blend of datasets consisting of the gbr100 m beaman 2010 geoscience australia ga 9 arc second whiteway 2009 and the ga northward extension daniell 2008 the different bathymetric products have been blended via simple linear interpolation for points along the edge of the gbr100 bathymetry the grid nodes use a mercator projection to unify cell aspect ratio atmospheric fluxes are applied using the standard roms bulk formulae fairall et al 1996 the model uses a combined nudging radiation open boundary condition for temperature salinity and the components of the velocity field marchesiello et al 2001 the chapman condition is used for the free surface and the flather condition for 2d momentum vertical hourly atmospheric boundary conditions are taken from the climate forecast system reanalyses cfsr saha et al 2010 2014 lateral boundary conditions are daily average fields of temperature salinity and velocities derived via the bluelink reanalyses bran oke et al 2008 2013 these boundary conditions are effective where the model boundary is over deep water but they are less well resolved over the shelf and torres strait river freshwater fluxes have been sourced from the bureau of meteorology based on empirical models that rely on tide gauge data and consist of historical hourly fluxes for 25 catchments section 2 2 outlines the river specification for the ocean models we are using the topex poseidon global tidal model tpxo version 7 2 egbert et al 1994 to apply tidal phase and amplitude for sea surface height and barotropic velocities vertical advection of tracers uses a 4th order centred scheme and for advection of horizontal momentum a 3rd order upstream scheme is used this scheme was modified to include limiters see also naughten et al 2017 brassington et al 2018 when integrating the non linear models forward in time in the presence of strong horizontal density or tracer gradients the 3rd order upwinding scheme tends to numerically under over shoot what this means in practice for our modelling applications is that strong river flows with near zero salinity will tend to become negative at some point in time this behaviour is well studied and numerous numerical approaches are available to counter act this undesirable effect the smagorinsky scheme is employed to parameterise a spatially dependent horizontal mixing of momentum in order to model different aspects of the great barrier reef a high resolution on average 500 m and a forecast resolution on average 4 km model have been developed the high resolution model was integrated for 2 years spanning jan 2009 march 2011 the 4 km model was run 5 years from jan 2006 dec 2011 the number of topography following vertical levels are 25 and 30 for the 500 m and 4 km model respectively they are stretched towards the surface in both cases the bathymetry was smoothed with a modified shapiro filter e g penven et al 2008 to prevent excessive horizontal pressure gradient errors which can occur in terrain following vertical coordinate models the vertical coordinate transformation results in an additional hydrostatic correction term in the pressure gradient calculation that depends on the steepness of the bathymetry two numbers are often used to characterise said steepness the beckman and haidvogel number r x 0 beckmann and haidvogel 1993 which is a measure of the model resolution to the topographic variation and the haney or hydrostatic consistency number r x 1 haney 1991 hydrostatic inconsistency occurs when the discretised pressure gradient force pgf fails to vanish on horizontal isopycnic surfaces the haney number can be used to quantify different hydrostatic regimes consistent r x 1 1 inconsistent 1 r x 1 5 and unstable r x 1 5 in practice haney numbers below 3 mean that safe and conservative smoothing has been applied haney numbers of 1 are almost impossible to achieve unless the bathymetry is smoothed unrealistically the baroclinic pressure gradient force in roms is discretised with a high order density jacobian scheme based on monotonized cubic polynomial fits for the vertical profiles of density and geopotential height shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2009 this scheme dramatically reduces errors in hydrostatic balance shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2009 show that the pressure gradient solver in roms is robustly tolerant for hydrostatic inconsistent grids i e r x 1 1 in practice the roms community considers values of r x 1 6 safe to use the bathymetry has been smoothed with model stability in mind and resulted in a maximum beckman and haidvogel number of r x 0 0 39 0 33 for the hr fc models the resulting haney number varies spatially over the model domains and is largest over the shelf break and near the river channels spatial values of r x 1 are between 1 to 5 for the 4 km model due to the increased resolution the high resolution model gives smaller areas of high values for r x 1 with 9 grid points displaying r x 1 values greater than 5 these are located near the river mouth the models hence are well within the range of pragmatic choice for bathymetry smoothing the models are configured with an area of increased explicit viscosity and diffusivity sponge layer at the open boundaries and roughly scaled according to the rossby radius of deformation the sponge layer has been applied to both tracer and velocity fields it has been found that the implementation of a sponge layer is essential to successfully model the dynamics and thermodynamics of the coral sea at high resolution in the case of a too small or an absent sponge layer heat fluxes entering the model domain via the sec were strongly reduced resulting in widespread ocean model cooling extending from the deep ocean to the shelf not shown this subsequently affected the intrusive upwelling onto the gbr the 4 km model was less dependent on the strength and width of the sponge layer because the 4 km horizontal resolution is of similar order of magnitude than that of the global model bottom drag is parameterised using the quadratic law a spatially varying quadratic drag coefficient has been applied to the 4 km model in areas that are covered by known reef structures hemerson pers comm over these areas the quadratic drag coefficient has been increased by an order of magnitude from q d e e p 0 003 to q r e e f 0 03 roughly following e g hoeke et al 2013 and hearn et al 2001 applying a varying drag coefficient leads to an adjustment in the speed of the tidal gravity wave and showed an improved capability of the 4 km model to represent tidal elevations along the queensland coast appendix a includes a thorough comparison between modelled tides and observations for 70 tide gauges along the queensland coast it also discusses the effect of introducing a varying drag coefficient over reef structures for the 4 km model subgridscale vertical mixing is introduced by the k profile parameterisation scheme large et al 1994 2 2 river implementation riverine input at an ocean model s land boundary has been studied extensively e g herzfeld 2015 yankovsky 2000 a known problem that occurs when freshwater sources are included directly at the land sea boundary is that the naturally developed countercurrent in the lower model layers and the associated salt tongue is blocked yankovsky 2000 yankovsky 2000 argues that this results in the generation of strong cyclonic vorticity with divergence on the surface this potentially leads to an upstream deflection of the buoyant water from its source it is only after this initial response that the plume does an anticyclonic rotation under the influence of coriolis in other words modelled river plumes can move downward further than observed however it is suggested that in cases of large flow rates over relatively short periods the buoyant coastal discharge moves beyond the river mouth and can match observed results to some extent yankovsky 2000 suggests that in such cases it is viable to implement river flow at the land sea interface in this specific application of the gbr it is noted that this is the important case that produces the largest footprint and impact in a more recent study by herzfeld 2015 a method was proposed that aims to account for upstream flow in the salt wedge and in estuary mixing that elevates salinity at the mouth this method proved successful however it does not deal with the fact that catchments are often located a fair distance from the coast this can lead to a signal delay during rain events that cannot be dynamically modelled unless the hydrodynamic model implements an estuary like structure or resolves the estuary explicitly wilkin et al pers comm follow a different strategy to apply riverine input they manipulate the land sea mask to include a 1d river channel for each catchment the observed horizontal distance from river mouth to the catchment is used to determine the length of the channel while the model s vertical depth is used to adjust for the observed river volume applying the river input this way may ensure that the modelled velocity mass transport within the channels is able to match the observed velocity mass transport more realistically and hence account for appropriate arrival times of the fresh water signal at the river mouth however limitations of that method include time varying river bed volume due to different flow rates and unknown bottom roughness parameters within the river bed also in the case where the river s source lies above sea level very likely in most cases some of the freshwater momentum will be due to the influence of gravity an advantage of this method is that it dynamically develops a vertical salinity profile for each catchment in this study the second method described above is implemented due to its potential for adjusting freshwater arrival times at the river mouth and its ability to dynamically develop a vertical salinity profile which is unknown and flow dependent in most cases 25 catchments along the queensland coast are included in the model simulations as indicated in fig 1 the implementation for the 4 km model includes the addition of a linear slope within the 1d channels to match the minimum depth of 5 m at the land sea boundary the implementation of river channels for the 500 m model is simpler in that the depth of the channels has not been adjusted therefore the channels have a minimum depth equal to the minimum bathymetric depth of the model h m i n 1 m appendix b gives additional information on the river channel implementation and specification at this point we acknowledge that there are other sources of freshwater input in our domain such as the fly river which are not taken into account in the current model setup the models were designed to use quality controlled daily fresh water fluxes from australian catchments with the aim of providing a forecast service in the future we were not able to secure a similar product for other freshwater sources we acknowledge that the outflow would affect the water properties over the lagoon south of papua new guinea for example with potential local impacts to the northern tip of the great barrier reef however the general circulation in the northern gbr has a northward transport as influenced by the papua gyre 2 3 passive tracers both the 500 m and 4 km ocean models are configured to include 3d passive tracers and 3d age tracers the passive tracers can be viewed as dyes of a given concentration the 3d passive tracer fields are advected via the 3rd order upwinding scheme and differ to the active tracers temperature and salinity in that they do not affect the ocean s density field the implementation of the age tracer follows the constituent oriented age and residence time theory cart for a detailed description on the implementation the reader is referred to zhang et al 2010 and references therein passive tracers differ substantially from a sediment transport model in this study they are used to serve as a first order approximation of advection of particles however it should be noted that passive tracers are not able to represent processes such as sediment re suspension of particles as they do not bear any mass we note that typically river discharges in the gbr area are associated with large volume flood events that lead to turbulent plumes that have a longer retention period of suspended sediments and are visible in satellite imagery the high river discharge velocities during such flood events are likely to prevent settling of sediments as they enter the ocean at the same time re suspension of marine sediment at the inlets and along the coasts is common during large storm or flood events thus rendering distinct visibility in satellite images the nature of the queensland rivers which are either typically dry or flooding leads to limited pre conditioning of freshwater and something that can be traced by passive tracers and age tracers here we argue that the use of passive tracers is sufficient for a first order tracking of sediments but noting possible drawbacks due to the additional data load and compute time the number of passive tracers has been held low for the 500 m model only 1 tracer and 1 age field were added for pragmatic reasons while for the 4 km model 5 tracer and 5 age fields were added for the 500 m model each catchment is connected to the same tracer and age field while the 5 tracers and 5 tracer ages for the 4 km model are connected to a particular set of rivers the connections are roughly guided by maximising the distance between the selected rivers for each tracer to minimise the likelihood of mixing of tracers from different sources thereby ideally allowing for backtracking a particular plume to its unique catchment source hereafter we denote the 4 km model configuration as fc forecast and the 500 m model configuration as hr high resolution 3 model evaluation this section presents analysis into eddy kinetic energy eke for the gbr domain over the year 2009 the high resolution hydrodynamic model and the imos altimeter product have been spatially interpolated to a common resolution at the medium resolution model this is followed by a discussion of the domain wide innovation statistics between the hydrodynamic models and observations lastly model output is compared to the imos moorings array 3 1 mean and eddy kinetic energy fig 2 compares modelled mean and eddy kinetic energy mke eke with satellite observations for the year 2009 the imos altimeter dataset is used to compare to model results it maps the sea level anomalies sla using optimal interpolation of detided de meaned inverse barometer adjusted altimeter and tide gauge estimates of sea level the gridded dataset is near real time and provides gridded sea level anomalies gsla every 2 days on a 0 2 grid see also http oceancurrent imos org au in order to facilitate a meaningful comparison with the models we calculate 2 day averages of modelled sea surface height this removes much of the tidal signal we further remove the mean sea surface height over 2009 to get a quantity that is comparable to the gsla geostrophic velocities are then calculated from the resulting sea level anomalies the inverse barometer effect has not been removed but its effect over the coral sea is small when considering annual timescales the displayed imos mke is largest over the mean current systems of the domain dynamic active regions are the eac south of 16 s that flows south along the shelf edge the queensland current and papua gyre to the north south of 24 s the eac becomes more variable resulting in largest mke values near 22 s and to the east the oceanography is dominated by mesoscale eddies resulting in widespread enhanced mke both models are able to capture the pattern along the shelf edge and the high mke region in the southern part of the domain well however differences in strength are apparent for example both models show larger values of mke along the northern shelf suggesting the pg is too dynamic the fc model overestimates mke of the eac between 16 and 24 s but matches very well with imos mke south of 25 s the hr model captures mke better along the northern eac 15 18 s but overestimates mke for the southern eac the mesoscale eddy dominated parts of the domain are well captured by the hr but underestimated by fc the imos mke shows elevated values within the gbr lagoon along the capricorn channel 22 s 152 e both models fail to capture the variability here instead mke is large along the reef edges which may be a residual of the strong tidally driven currents there areas of low mke between 15 and 20 s are well captured by the fc model the hr model overestimates mke here to some extent further to the north along the nvj both models overestimate mke with the fc model more so than the hr model the eke shown in fig 2 highlights the areas of mesoscale eddy activity to the south the various jets entering the eastern model domain and variability over the pg the imos eke displays a broad band of eke between 15 and 20 s that is underestimated in width by the models this could be due to the 0 2 resolution of imos dataset over the pg towards the eastern boundary the observations exhibit a wavelike pattern emanating from torres strait which may be tidally forced the hr model captures this pattern a little better than the fc model as suggested before by the mke the eddy dominated areas in the south are better represented in the hr model than in the fc model the hr model overestimates variability in the centre of the domain suggesting that eddy activity is not dampened enough there 3 2 full domain statistics the data assimilation software enkf c sakov 2014 has been used in a purely data analysis mode to calculate full domain innovation statistics for the 500 m and 4 km models the analysis is based on daily averages of temperature and salinity fields the displayed statistics have been calculated taking into account observations from various sources and combining all observations into gridscale super observations regardless of instrument or platform within a model grid cell they are weighted by the inverse error variance to the average location and time within the cell and observation window observations include remotely sensed sst and in situ temperature and salinity from argo profiles sea surface temperature sst retrievals from multiple platforms including global high resolution sea surface temperature ghrsst navoceano may et al 1998 windsat gaiser et al 2004 pathfinder amsr e amsr2 are used when available sst observations are limited to night time only in the region to minimise diurnal warming biases the navoceano advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr per pixel bias correction is applied in situ temperature and salinity from argo roemmich et al 2009 is used however these observations are sparse and limited in this region to the deep ocean part of the domain table 1 displays mean statistics that have been calculated over the year 2009 for the two models shown are the mean absolute deviation mad the bias and the number of observations we have not included innovations statistics for sea level anomaly sla as de tided sla fields were not available from the 500 m model simulation we note that tides also affect the temperature and salinity fields but to a lesser extent allowing for the quantitative analyses presented here in terms of global mean statistics it appears that both models give reasonable results compared with reanalysis data for the model domain not shown but see sandery et al 2019 the models perform similar for sst with a m a d h r 0 559 c compared to m a d f c 0 561 c however the hr model displays a larger warm bias for sst b i a s h r f c 0 344 0 281 c this may be a consequence of differences in upper cell thickness due to finer resolution bathymetry and differences in vertical model levels enhanced variability present in the hr model may further contribute to this difference the warm bias for both models is partly caused by daily averaging of model output daily averaging includes the diurnal warming period and is at odds with the satellite sst s who are biased towards night times recalculation of the sst bias for the hr model based on 6 hourly averages and taking into account only night time sst shows a reduction of the warm bias by 0 1 c a more rigorous calculation of modelled night time sst may lead to further improvements in bias but is beyond the scope of this paper the hr outperforms the 4 km model for both temperature and salinity profiles for example the m a d h r 0 59 c vs m a d f c 0 90 c and m a d h r 0 121 psu vs m a d f c 0 171 psu the statistical performance of the hr model is in fact similar to that of the reanalysis discussed in sandery et al 2019 more striking is a reduced bias seen for temperature and salinity in the hr model with b i a s h r f c 0 0001 0 423 c and b i a s h r f c 0 050 0 093 psu the relatively large bias in the fc model for temperature is likely related to excessive diapycnal mixing caused by the lower resolution over the shelf higher horizontal resolution gives the hr model an advantage through reducing unwanted spurious mixing the choice of the horizontal advection scheme strongly influences the mixing properties of the models the 3rd order upwind scheme can lead to unrealistic mixing in roms strategies to alleviate this problem have been presented by the community for example by introducing higher order advection operators that split the advective and diffusive components however higher order schemes also introduce larger noise in the presence of strong density gradients and thus are more unstable given that our model places a strong focus on river discharge which in this area is associated with short but strong river flushing events the choice was to keep the 3rd order upwinding scheme we shall also note that the strong subsurface temperature bias is only seen for temperature and not for salinity furthermore the shallow well mixed coastal areas are not affected by this bias see table 2 3 3 q imos mooring array verification in this section we compare daily averages of modelled temperature salinities and velocities to observations taken from the queensland node imos mooring array the q imos mooring array is operated by the australian institute for marine science aims see also http imos org au httpimosorgauqimoshtml html the great barrier reef is the main focus region for this node and aims to understand the impact of the oceans on the reef the role that the east australian current plays and how future changes in the oceans may affect the coast the time period under consideration for this analysis covers january 2009 march 2011 fig 1 displays the 10 qimos moorings that have been included in the analyses as black dots additional information such as site depth and number of observations available for over the time period is given in the appendix table c 1 no salinity observations are available for heron island north gbrhin and lizard shelf gbrlsh in general the number of observations for salinity is about 1 4 that of temperature the largest amount of temperature salinity observations on a daily averaged basis are available for palm passage gbrpps mooring lizard shelf while the least amounts of temperature salinity observations are available for lizard slope gbrlsl elusive reef gbrelr the deepest shallowest mooring is lizard slope gbrlsl yongala nrsyon with depths of 300 m and 30 m no velocity observations are available for heron island north and lizard shelf prior to calculating the statistics presented below the observations have been processed by a applying the respective qc flags for each dataset temperature salinity and velocity b for temperature and salinity an out of range condition has been applied in which values have not been processed when v a r 0 v a r 40 and c a gradient condition has been applied for temperature and salinity screening for unrealistically large gradients in addition statistics for velocities have been calculated only for depths below 10 m as the adcp measurements tend to display large errors near the surface not shown two of the nine moorings gbrelr and gbrmyr display strong variations in depth over the period of interest these fluctuations are rapid at times and can be in the order of 60 m over a few days gbrelr and gbrlsh at times display unrealistic eddy like features not shown that affect the statistics gbrmyr displays unrealistically large velocities for a period from march november 2009 at 20 80 m depth not shown 3 3 1 temperature fig 3 compares the main statistics of the observed and modelled temperatures for selected stations for the 4 km and 500 m model additional stations are shown in the appendix in figs c 1 c 3 shown are 1 the temperature distribution as a histogram for observations and model results 2 scatter density plot between observed and modelled temperature and 3 scatter depth plot between observed and modelled temperature the scatter depth plots give additional information on model performance with depth figs 3 and c 1 are complemented by table 2 that displays the mean statistics such as the mean absolute deviation mad bias skill score after willmott 1981 and number of observations nobs the skill score has been calculated over each continuous time measurement at a near constant depth level fig 4 provides an example for palm passage gbrpps the figure shows mad bias skill score and correlation coefficient on the right panels of the figure for the fc fig 4a and hr fig 4b model the hovmoeller plots on the left side give an indication on available observations at depth levels over the specific time period for each pair of hovmoeller plots the upper ones display the observations while the lower ones denote the respective model results it can be seen that for this particular station the hr model displays a consistent mad bias and skill score over time and depth while the fc model exhibits a degrading performance with depth overall the hr model performs better in both mad and bias with values of m a d f c h r 0 91 0 74 c and b i a s f c h r 0 23 0 21 c however the mean statistics are strongly influenced by the substantially larger error seen for the 4 km model for gbrlsl m a d f c h r 2 32 0 80 c b i a s f c h r 1 91 0 65 c removing this station from the mean statistics reveals that both models have a similar average performance for mad m a d f c h r 0 75 0 73 c while the hr model displays a larger negative hence warm bias of 0 3 c b i a s f c h r 0 03 0 3 c these results are consistent with other modelling studies over the gbr for example schiller et al 2015 use a 4 km implementation of the shoc model over the gbr and compare results to imos moorings time period and number of observations differ but overall they calculate a mean absolute error of 0 65 c and a bias of 0 27 c the hr model displays substantially larger negative biases for gbrote gbrhin gbrlsh and nrsyon compared to fc but the mad s for each of those stations is comparable in the order of 0 4 0 6 c this suggests that the error spread is similar for both models the reason for the difference in bias is that the fc model displays larger variability over the course of a year with a tendency of being too warm cold in austral summer winter figure not shown thereby having an on average smaller bias this behaviour is particularly prevalent for the shallow well mixed stations gbrote grbhin and nrsyon the scatter density plot fig 3 a b demonstrates this change in bias exemplarily for nrsyon cooler warmer temperatures associated with winter summer months suggest a positive negative bias in fc while the bias is consistently negative for hr overall performance for gbrcch is similar for both models the models behave differently with depth orange colouring the hr model develops a negative wide spread bias while the fc model is centred positive biased fig 3c d the histograms suggest that the hr model better represents the temperature distribution overall at the deeper mooring gbrmyr both models display a large overall error m a d 1 c and bias 0 7 0 8 c the scatter plots in fig 3g h suggest that both models perform well from the surface to about 120 m depth and depreciate below that depth model errors at around 200 m are substantially larger blue colouring with a bias of around 2 c the given histograms further demonstrate the model observation mismatch here model results by schiller et al 2015 confirm a large bias and error for this site however the roms model seems to perform somewhat worse than the shoc model given the overlapping month the difference in model performance may very well be rooted in the choice of coordinate system gbrmyr is situated along the shelf edge and sigma coordinates may underestimate upwelling onto shelf to some extent for gbrelr both models display a large error on the order of 1 c that is mostly related to a large spread for the deeper water masses at about 100 m and 300 m depth the bias is somewhat larger for hr b i a s f c h r 0 35 0 43 c this station is situated the furthest offshore and is subjected to large variability emanating from the eac thus the large mad is likely owing to the chaotic behaviour of the eac the smaller bias suggests that overall the models are simulating the mean conditions correctly intra model differences are large for gbrpps with hr significantly out performing fc by displaying a smaller error m a d f c h r 0 84 0 57 c and small bias b i a s f c h r 0 56 0 05 c fig 3e f suggest that the performance of both models is similar near the surface but deteriorates with depth for fc as it becomes too cool fig 4 additionally suggests that this cool bias at depth persists throughout the year palm passage is an important passage for watermass exchange with the deep ocean driven by tidal motion and dynamic uplift these results suggest that the fc model may potentially overestimate intrusive upwelling events which in turn may explain the cooler near bottom temperatures for other stations over the lagoon such as e g nrsyon fig 5 shows an example of watermass exchange via palm passage the vertical temperature sections displayed for each model are 14 days apart dated at the beginning and mid of february 2009 the shelf being initially well mixed fig 5a b becomes stratified with a cool near bottom layer after the intrusion event fig 5c d the fc model is too cold compared to observations for this particular event compare to fig 4 general skill scores are high for both models in the order of 0 9 for the shallow stations depth less than 70 m the hr model shows better skill for deeper moorings such as gbrcch gbrelr gbrcch gbrmyr and gbrlsl most likely due to better shelf representation the largest intra model difference in skill is seen for gbrelr s k i l l f c h r 0 06 0 32 this station is situated the furthest offshore the coarser resolution model may include larger amounts of variability via the eac which reduces the skill score 3 3 2 salinity the number of salinity observations delivered by the qimos mooring array is only about 25 of that of temperature furthermore no salinity measurements are available for heron island north and lizard slope station table 3 gives the summary statistics for the remaining moorings for the different model simulations while figs 6 and c 2 show the salinity distributions scatter density and scatter depth plots overall both models have a tendency to being significantly too salty for 5 out of 8 moorings i e gbrcch gbrelr nrsyon gbrpps and gbrlsh when compared to observations the hr model performs overall better than the fc model on all three metrics mad bias and skill the mean error statistics are comparable to results reported by schiller et al 2015 who calculate a mean model error of 0 19 psu compared to a mean error of m a d f c h r 0 2 0 13 psu in this study however in terms of bias results differ schiller et al 2015 find that their model is too fresh overall here the opposite is found differing time periods for calculating statistics may be the reason salinity over the shallow reef is strongly influenced by river discharge which can be quite seasonal and contribute to model uncertainty for most stations outliers exist and errors can become large with values of up to 0 8 psu as evident from the distribution plots the exceptions are gbrcch and gbrelr fig 6 a b and e f which show comparatively little dispersion these 2 stations are deeper 100 m and 250 m and salinity measurements are taken at depths around 80 100 m this reduces observed variability and is positively reflected in the results the near surface salinity data is strongly influenced by ocean currents and local atmospheric conditions implying additional variability and uncertainty both models display the largest error and spread m a d f c h r 0 30 0 22 psu at nrsyon the nrsyon mooring is strongly influenced by freshwater discharge from the burdekin catchment which is subject to large fluctuations this is reflected in the salinity distribution at this station over the validation period the catchment has seen one of the largest fresh water discharge event discussed further in section 4 over the last 10 years the comparatively large model bias needs therefore to be interpreted in the context of unusually strong fresh water input and variability the lowest salinity values are extreme events at the tail of the histogram the bulk of the observed salinity values at 34 36 psu are well captured by the models the gbrmyr mooring fig 6e f delivers salinity measurements at 2 depth levels 30 60 m and 180 200 m as such it is the only station that delivers salinity data at a comparatively deep layer for the deep layer the 4 km model misses the salinity distribution completely while the hr model performs very well we speculate that the large bias seen in the fc model is due to the applied bathymetry smoothing which is strongest along the shelf and leads to changes in watermass characteristics in addition both models display a fresh salinity bias similar to what has been observed in schiller et al 2015 for this station and depth in terms of skill the models perform well for gbrote gbrhis nrsyon and gbrpps the hr model has a substantially better skill for gbrote s k i l l f c h r 0 6 0 81 however skill values are poor for gbrelr and gbrmyr for both models but particularly for the hr model we note that observations for gbrelr are very sparse with only two continuous measurements at two depth levels in addition the observations exhibit short term variability which is not well reproduced by the hr model 3 3 3 velocity we compare daily averaged modelled and observed velocities all moorings except heron island south gbrhis and lizard shelf gbrlsh contain velocity measurements and are assessed the daily averaging procedure removes much of the tidal signal of the observed and modelled velocities table 4 displays the mean statistics for the velocities no skill score is included in this analysis but instead a measure for the error of direction of flow veering is given veering has been derived using a complex correlation analysis following kundu 1975 it calculates the mean veering by weighting the average according to the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity vectors therefore larger velocities have a higher impact in the analysis the mad and bias displayed in table 4 are calculated for the current speed the complementing figs 7 and c 3 display histograms for direction and current speed and density plots of current speed both models display similar error statistics for mad and bias of current speed for 6 out of the 8 stations i e gbrote gbrhin gbrcch nrsyon gbrmyr and gbrlsl with mean errors in the order of the standard deviation of observations reflecting the variability in the system overall the models capture the mean velocity or its distribution rather well this is reflected in the biases that are about an order of magnitude smaller or less than 20 of the observed mean flow some exceptions with larger biases exist for gbrelr gbrmyr gbrlsl and will be discussed further below on average the hr model better represents the direction of flow with a mean veering of 12 59 compared to 21 5 for the fc model it is assumed this is a direct consequence of better bathymetry representation of the hr model the largest difference in veering is seen for gbrhin v e e r i n g f c h r 23 25 0 05 with the hr model performing better because it is able to represent the direction of the stronger currents more accurately error statistics for gbrelr fig 7 a b stand out compared to other stations the largest errors in mad and veering are recorded here the mad for both models is in excess of 0 2 m s which is about 50 of the observed mean flow of 0 5 m s due to the exposed position of this mooring the eac strongly affects the flow and variability eddy kinetic energy as seen in fig 2 has maximum values near the position of gbrelr the larger error hence reflects the non linearity of the system another concern is the veering error of 45 which suggests the models have very different flow characteristics compared to the observations the observations suggest a flow towards the northeast which is counterintuitive given the prevalence of the southward flowing eac for this station it is thus suggested that the error lies with the observations and not necessarily with the models in addition the fc model exhibits its largest positive bias of 0 12 m s for current speed overestimating the lower end of the velocities substantially the hr model has a small bias here 0 01 m s and represents the mean distribution of the flow speed well the largest intra model difference for current speed and direction is seen for gbrpps fig 7 e f the fc model does not capture the characteristics of prevailing currents the flow is too strong and too offshore oriented resulting in veering of 31 38 the error is also large and with 0 15 m s it matches the mean current speed the hr model does well in terms of direction and also captures the current speed distribution quite well reflected in the smaller bias nevertheless the hr model has still a large error of 0 10 m s and overestimates the velocities in the 0 2 0 4 m s range further offshore at gbrmyr fig 7 g h the fc model captures the flow characteristics better particularly the error in flow direction is reduced while the hr model displays its largest veering error here the station location captures parts of the eac induced variability hence the coarser resolution model is better equipped to deal with the larger non linearity as it effectively spatially filters the variability over the lagoon at nrsyon fig 7 c d both models perform similarly the hr model shows a smaller error for current speeds and direction both models show a consistent error in flow direction of 10 the flow over the reef lagoon is strongly driven by local winds and hence we suggest that atmospheric forcing and or bathymetric inconsistencies may be contributing to this error 4 river plume this section provides two case studies for river discharge events of note for the burdekin and fitzroy rivers the two catchments account for over 50 of the total river discharge over 2006 2011 the discussion includes the plume development over time and qualitative comparison to available observations most rainfall events in queensland are accompanied by strong cloud over the ocean and land however the cloud cover is often reduced over the ocean as the plume emerges and develops this provides an opportunity for using satellite derived products such as chlorophyll a and modis aqua terra imagery to compare to model results modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer https oceancolor gsfc nasa gov data aqua is a key instrument aboard the terra eos am and aqua eos pm satellites terra s orbit around the earth is timed so that it passes from north to south across the equator in the morning 10am aest while aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon approximate 2pm aest terra modis and aqua modis view the entire earth s surface every 2 days acquiring data in 36 spectral bands chlorophyll a has been derived from cloud free daytime imagery acquired by the modis aqua platform the modis imagery is processed using the nasa developed seawifs data analysis system seadas and the bureau operational ocean colour booc data processing package to obtain estimates of in water optical properties and concentrations of optically active constituents as such chlorophyll a is not independent of the modis aqua imagery but can complement these observations in addition to the spatial analyses test case 1 includes an analysis of near surface and bottom salinity at the yongala mooring and therefore provides an event interpretation to complement the general discussion of salinity in the previous section for that mooring in the following we compare the modelled plumes with the observations on a daily basis for test cases 1 and 2 averaging of the model output may account for some differences between observation and modelled plumes due to the nearshore advection by the tide for comparison purposes we select days which are either of general interest and or contain limited cloud cover some of the difference seen in the images of tracer and tracer age between the high resolution model and the 4 km model are due to the fact that the high resolution model only uses one passive tracer and age while the 4 km model uses 5 passive tracers and ages therefore when plotting 500 m model output all rivers that have been active in the area of interest are impacting the spatial pattern of tracer concentration and age for the fc model 5 tracers and ages are distributed across the 25 catchments each tracer and age only represents the discharge associated with 4 or 5 selected catchments in the subsequent analyses and discussion aqua terra modis imagery is sometimes referred to as ma mt and chlorophyll a is referred to as cl a 4 1 case 1 burdekin 2009 4 1 1 ma and cl a fig 8a displays the volume transport for the burdekin catchment for the discussed river discharge event the 2009 event was the largest recorded between 2006 2011 with a maximum transport exceeding 20 000 m 3 s the maximum discharge was recorded on february 5 2009 figs 9 11 display the modelled plumes their ages observed cl a concentration and true colour images for different dates overall both models display a similar distribution of tracer density large differences in the modelled age in particular over the northern part of the domain can be attributed to the difference in the number of tracers included for each model see section 2 3 the tracer field for the 500 m model includes additional river sources to the north south from the haughton herbert and tully don and o connell catchments see fig 1 fig 9 shows the developing plume about a week after the discharge event had peaked the ma mt image displays a sediment rich plume that emanates from the burdekin river mouth with a north east orientation there is evidence of a south eastward extension of the plume reaching 20 s 149 e both model simulations capture the dense plume and the farther offshore extension rather well the dye concentration has a maximum that coincides with the sediment rich plume structure near the river mouth this feature is captured particularly well by the 500 m model during february 18 2009 just after the second peak visual agreement between the models and observations is less good the observations suggest that the river plume is pressed tightly against the coastline with a northward orientation although both models display a northward extent in tracer and age maximum dye concentration has a north east orientation it is likely that both models either overestimate the river velocities or that daily averaging of dye concentration is at odds with ma mt snapshots the former would be indicative of limitations in the applied method of adding freshwater fluxes via 1d river channels riverbed volume will change with changing flow rates and frictional forces will therefore vary over time both effects are not accounted for in the model simulations cl a has a high concentration around the river mouth with developing north and southward extensions up to 19 s and 147 e both models match this quite well although dye concentrations are low particularly for the 500 m model hence the age fields visualise this spatial pattern better during the waning phase of the event fig 11 cl a is highly concentrated to the north and south of the river mouth in a 20 50km wide band extending from 19 s to 20 s the models capture the extent of the plume well but seem to favour a southward direction which is related to the prevailing atmospheric conditions at that time the models display a pocket of 10 15day old tracers that matches well with the high cl a concentration to north of the river mouth this age coincides with the timing of the first large discharge peak fig 8 towards the south the plume is younger in age less than 9 days which is consistent with the timing of the second peak winds are westerly during that time explaining the plume movement the cl a pattern is better matched by the 4 km model the ma image shows a broad plume with a suggestive eastward orientation the 500 m model captures this feature well 4 1 2 qimos mooring fig 12 compares near surface left and bottom right salinity for the models to observations at yongala mooring the timeseries for the near surface salinity d 7 m clearly shows the fresh water plume entering the mooring area during february 16 march 02 approximately 2 3 weeks after the maximum discharge occurred fig 8 no such freshening is observed for the near bottom salinity d 27 m giving away the nature of the plume being confined to the upper levels in the water column the two models are both able to capture the observed freshening the fc model in particular matches the order of magnitude and the duration of the freshwater signal very well the hr model does exhibit two peaks of advected freshwater which do not compare as well to the observations in terms of duration and strength the first peak although being on time with the observations does not capture the strength very well while the second peak occurs too late it is suggested that the timing of river discharge is out of sync with the wind forcing and or that larger intrinsic variability in the hr model have led to this behaviour after the plume has been advected further the models revert back to the mean salinity values arguably the 500 m model does a better job here than the fc simulation which tends to stay fresher over time compared to the observations the calculated statistics also shown in fig 12 confirm the visual inspection the hr model has a larger rmse r m s e h r 0 59 psu compared to the fc model r m s e f c 0 43 psu in the upper layer the rmse is slightly smaller for the near bottom layer for the hr model r m s e h r f c 0 25 0 28 psu corresponding correlation values are lower for the hr model in the upper layer owing to the mismatch in timing of the fresh water plume r h r f c 0 92 0 72 psu and this is also reflected in lower skill values for the hr model here s k i l l h r f c 0 84 0 95 for the near bottom layer correlation values are the same for both models with values of r 0 92 indicating solid model performance here 4 2 case 2 fitzroy 2010 2011 significantly higher rainfall over most parts of australia was experienced during the 2010 2011 la nina from july 2010 to march 2011 which lead to flooding in many parts of the country the arrival of tc yasi in early 2011 added to the already high precipitation rate the fitzroy catchment being located further south to the tc s land crossing had a peak discharge of over 13000 m 3 s in the first week of january fig 8b making it the largest discharge event for the fitzroy catchment over the last 10 years the first image shown for this event fig 8b is for december 18 2010 four days after the first smaller peak shown in fig 8b 6000 m 3 s the ma image displays a sediment rich river plume extending northward from the river mouth both models display high tracer concentrations over this area thereby capturing this sediment rich structure the 500 m does this better as it retains a northward direction within the high concentration area both models show an eastward extent of the plume which is also indicated in the ma image on january 11 2011 fig 14 about a week after maximum river discharge fig 8b ma reveals a large dense river plume emanating from the river mouth towards the north east this plume is about 60km in length both models display maximum concentrations around the river mouth however the fc model does not capture the eastward orientation of the plume very well this is likely caused by too weak velocities at the river mouth which may be linked to an overestimation of the river volume in the 1d channel for this catchment as discussed in section 2 1 the hr tracer aligns well with observations suggesting tracer speed and discharge timing are modelled well high cl a concentration is extending northward in a 20 km wide band at 23 s both models capture this feature well in terms of concentration and ages the 500 m model displays a rich detail in spatial features that give quite a realistic account on what is observed on january 13 2011 two days later the discharge event is subsiding fig 15 the ma image suggests that the dense sediment plume is attached to the coast following a northward flow direction under the influence of coriolis this is in good agreement with modelled tracer concentrations the cl a image displays high concentrations near 24 s this is well captured by the 500 m model but not in the 4 km model the source for this high cl a concentration is the calliope catchment see fig 1 which is included in the tracer field of the 500 m model 5 summary and discussion this paper presented results from hydrodynamic ocean models of the great barrier reef at two horizontal resolutions the models are designed to accurately represent the general circulation at the lagoon particular attention has been given to a river discharge and b cross shelf exchange with a boundary current system in light of the work by schiller et al 2015 an emphasis has been given to a to this end passive tracer and ages have been implemented as such the models may lend themselves to water quality assessments using a natural decay model but without explicitly implementing a deterministic bio geo chemical modelling component the models have been thoroughly tested for their performance on various aspects given that the gbr is such an important asset but so sparsely observed a large emphasis has been placed upon verifying model results with available mooring data this is to our knowledge the first ocean modelling study that takes advantage of all available mooring data of physical ocean properties temperature salinity and currents during a specific time period the models have first been compared to 70 available tide gauges the 500 m model showed some good results in terms of correlation rmse std and lag the 4 km model showed improved performance after a spatially varying bottom drag was applied to known reef areas this was done in a crude manner with bathymetric regions flagged as reef assigned the same increase in drag we suggest that a further classification on reef types may be desirable and could further improve the 4 km model s performance in terms of variability the models show good agreement with signals of observed mean and eddy kinetic energy the high resolution model has an advantage to capture the dynamic rich areas over the southern domain more realistically both models suggest variability is somewhat underestimated over the papua gyre and northern branch of the eac the high and medium resolution models have been assessed for the full domain region it was found that sea surface temperatures perform similarly for both models with a mean error of around 0 5 c and a mean warm bias between 0 2 and 0 3 c somewhat larger for the hr model the warm bias can be improved upon when considering modelled night time temperatures as opposed to daily averages to be more consistent with satellite sst we included a simple analysis that used 6 hourly averaged data to estimate night time sst this has been done for the hr model only this resulted in a reduction of the bias of around 0 1 c and also slightly improved the mad the remaining warm bias of 0 1 0 2 c may be due to the bulk flux formulation overestimating the net heat flux into the upper ocean layer or the applied vertical mixing scheme not being capable of mixing the heat down adequately we tested the second hypotheses for the fc model only by changing the mixing scheme to mellor and yamada 1982 but did not find that the model results improved significantly not shown modelled subsurface temperatures reveal larger intra model differences the high resolution model outperforms the fc model in both mean absolute deviation and bias particularly the effective bias removal from 0 4 c is encouraging given that the models operate with nearly identical physics the reason for this must be rooted in the increased horizontal resolution it is known that spurious mixing can alter the properties of watermasses in sigma coordinate models and we assume that this is the culprit here given the coarse resolution of the fc model compared to the hr model spurious diapycnal mixing is bound to play a larger role here performance of the models over the gbr lagoon has been assessed via the qimos mooring array we assessed available temperature salinity and velocity profile data for 10 moorings the results suggest that the high resolution model performs better overall for temperature because the 4 km model exhibits a very large error for lizard slope in the order of 2 c due to a warm temperature bias at 200 m depth the higher resolution model shows a consistent warm bias for the shallow well mixed moorings on the order 0 3 c while the fc model compensates too warm temperatures in summer with too cold temperatures in winter leading to an overall smaller bias over the year for those stations the fc model has a larger error for palm passage and myrmidon reef in particular for palm passage this is related to poorer model performance with depth the model is too cool there suggesting that it may overestimate intrusive upwelling events benthuysen et al 2016 to some extent the mooring sits along the shelf edge and is strongly influenced by variability from the eac particularly for the fc model this also leads to an overestimation of onshore velocities and a high error in ocean current direction when compared to the high resolution model in terms of salinity the high resolution model also performs better than the 4 km resolution model with an overall error of 0 13 psu generally both models have a tendency to be too salty likely due to missing river discharge precipitation and model bias the overall error estimated from the qimos moorings is in agreement with the full domain salinity analyses estimated from profile data for the hr model the fc model performs slightly better here than on a full domain basis of some interest is the model s performance over yongala mooring because 1 this mooring is the only mooring that is directly situated within the reef and 2 it is in close proximity to the burdekin catchment during the period of investigation the largest river discharge event in the past 10 years was recorded for the burdekin catchment the salinity histogram displays the resulting fresh water intrusion at yongala at the end of the tail giving a large range of salinity here subsequently the overall model error at around 0 2 0 3 psu is much larger for both models compared to the other stations extreme events like this come with a number of uncertainties such as river discharge amounts distribution of freshwater in the water column and atmospheric precipitation in light of that the models perform reasonably well in particular the fc model showed that it is able to capture the timing and severity of the freshwater tongue very well lastly we examined the models capability of modelling river plumes we utilised passive tracers and ages to compare visually with modis and chlorophyll maps two case studies were discussed the burdekin river discharge and the fitzroy discharge events results suggest that the models are able to reproduce basic features of the observed plumes in particular the 500 m model has an advantage in displaying the sediment rich plume near the river mouths more realistically the results of this paper suggest that the high resolution model has an advantage over the 4 km forecast model it performs better particularly over the deep ocean due to increased horizontal resolution which eliminates the subsurface temperature bias nevertheless when combined with data assimilation the 4 km forecast model has subsequently and successfully been used to form a 10 year reanalysis and a quasi operational model of the gbr sandery et al 2019 here it is implied that the 500 m model could possibly outperform the fc model in a similar data assimilation framework the bureau of meteorology australia has undertaken data assimilation within the ensemble optimum interpolation enoi framework e g brassington et al 2007 oke 2002 sakov 2014 enoi is based on the assumption of a static model ensemble when calculating the model error one of the challenges that needs to be overcome is the creation of an ensemble for the 500 m model if the model is to be used as a forecast tool latest moves within the bom have been towards employing the ensemble kalman filter method in which each forecast involves the forward integration of a set number of ensemble members on the order of 100 although the 500 m model increases the numerical cost the reduced model bias and improved distribution of variability e g eke would be an advantage to either method which cannot overcome systematic errors acknowledgements this work has been funded as part of ereefs australia https ereefs org au ereefs high performance computing was undertaken at the australian national computational

like to acknowledge the two anonymous reviewers who helped to improve the document appendix a spatial varying drag coefficient and tidal representation fig 1 green dots displays the position of all tide gauges for which data were obtained for the year 2009 the number of available gauges is not evenly distributed over the domain but is skewed towards southern queensland with 40 stations located between the southern model boundary to 25 s 30 stations are located between 25 15 s only 5 stations are north of 15 s they have been left out of the analyses because 1 they are located in torres strait just outside the model domain and 2 no useable data during the period of investigation was available as partially indicated in fig 1 many stations are located within estuaries and tidal flats this leads to bad correlation values there the observed data has been screened to exclude any missing values and obvious measurement errors have been removed however in the case where stations are located in rivers or estuaries the nearest ocean point has been taken for comparison in that regard we expect that the overall statistics presented could be further improved upon if those stations were left out for example the 6 lowest r 0 2 correlation values between observation and model data are either alert stations on land or are situated in an estuary fig a 1 displays the main results stemming from the tidal analyses shown are the mean statistics such as maximum correlation root mean square error rmse standard deviation std and maximum lag the results are summed up as histograms we are testing 2 versions of the forecast model with and without changing drag coefficient over the reef to demonstrate the effect of drag on the modelled tides we denote the 4 km model with a fixed varying drag coefficient f c f c 2 overall statistics do not differ substantially between the three models in terms of maximum correlation a large proportion of the gauges 4 km models 33 of 70 hr 31 of 70 reaches an r between 0 9 1 the fc models giving slightly better correlation values than the hr model for this bracket not much difference is seen between the two 4 km models for maximum correlation the lowest correlation values r 0 2 are associated with alert stations and stations situated in estuaries and tidal flats this is also true for the 10 12 stations with 0 2 r 0 5 about 20 stations for each model display moderately good correlations of 0 5 r 0 9 12 of these are alert stations three are within rivers and on land one is next to a pier and 4 stations are on the beach open ocean the rmse is shown in fig a 1b it suggests an improved error for the 4 km model after the varying drag coefficient is introduced this is mostly seen in the r m s e 0 1 0 4 bracket f c 5 of 70 stations f c 2 13 of 70 stations the f c 2 model has a similar error distribution across the tide gauges than the hr model however std differences fig a 1c suggest that the introduction of the varying drag coefficient over the reef has reduced the sea level variability slightly due to increased friction which dampens the signal the hr model tends to underestimate variability slightly a major improvement is seen for f c 2 in the timing of the tidal signal fig a 1d the maximum lag is reduced hence improved for f c 2 the performance is similar to hr suggesting that tidal wave speeds have responded positively to the spatially variable friction term appendix b river specifications table b 1 outlines the 25 catchments included in the model simulations and their characteristic dimensions such as width length and volume table b 2 gives the associated channel specifications for the 500 m and 4 km models for each catchment including channel volume volume ratio between modelled channels and observed rivers number of model cells used for the 1d channels optimal cell depth that would result in a best fit of model channel and observed river volume and the average depth of each model channel it can be seen from the ratio between model channels and observed river volumes that the channels overestimate the volume mostly this is expected and almost unavoidable since the observed river lengths are much larger than their depths and widths in order to adjust a 4 km or a 500 m grid via their depth whilst keeping the length close to observed lengths very shallow channels are necessary this results in unwanted instabilities for example the ratio between observed and channel volume is largest for the logan catchment here the ratio indicates that the volume of the 4 km model channel is about 200 times larger than the observed river volume in order to match the observed volume an optimal channel depth in the order of 1 cm would have been required which is not possible without violating vertical cfl criteria appendix c additional tables and figures see figs c 1 c 3 and table c 1 
23994,this article describes 3d medium 4km and high 500m horizontal resolution ocean models developed for the coral sea with a particular focus on the great barrier reef lagoon the medium resolution model is underpinning a 10 year reanalysis and a forecast demonstrator system for maritime monitoring the ocean models have been developed to assist the management of the great barrier reef given the existence of a number of stressors acting on the reef the presented models aim to represent physical stressors that include thermal salinity and flooding rivers the river discharge is tracked by passive and age tracers they can provide concentrations to identify the area volume influenced by flood water this paper gives an overview of the forward non linear models with the aim to assess their performance the models have been evaluated over a two year period spanning january 2009 march 2011 including the 2010 2011 la nina and the advent of tropical cyclone yasi in early 2011 that contributed to one of the largest river discharge events recorded over northern queensland the models performance is investigated on a full domain scale via means of satellite sea surface temperature sst expendable bathythermograph xbt and drifter data over the shelf and the great barrier reef lagoon available tide gauges ocean colour chlorophyll a and queensland s integrated marine observing system qimos mooring data of temperature salinity and velocity have been used to assess the models results suggest that the high resolution model gives better statistics in terms of mean absolute deviation and bias compared to the medium resolution model for subsurface temperature and salinity over the deep ocean moreover sea surface temperature performance is similar for both models over the lagoon and shelf both models performance is mixed the high resolution model displays a consistent warm bias on the order of 0 3 c over the shallow well mixed stations throughout the year however the 4km model displays larger variability in this region it tends to be too warm in summer and too cool in winter when compared to moorings modelled velocities are assessed via means of the qimos moorings overall the high resolution model fares better in terms of current direction with an average veering of 13 vs 22 the models performance is comparable in terms of current speed over the shallow moorings however the high resolution model is better equipped to represent steeper shelves and this results at times in better performance for velocity and temperature particularly over palm passage a large focus has been placed on including and assessing passive tracer dynamics emanating from river discharge 25 river sources have been added across the models domain together with a set of one dimensional channels representing the volume flux of brine two case studies are presented to demonstrate the models ability to reproduce mean features of observed plumes a major river discharge event has been examined in further detail both models are able to reproduce the low salinity signal present in the observations in the upper level to a satisfactory degree the 4km model matches the observed strength and duration of the fresh water plume substantially better than the high resolution model in this case 1 introduction the great barrier reef gbr is the largest adjacent coral reef complex in the world kinsey 2004 it comprises the shelf sea off the queensland region of australia and forms part of the unesco world heritage area a number of stressors have been and continue to act on the reef system causing damage to the reef complex for example silt nutrients from fertiliser and animals and herbicides and pesticides are washed off the land especially during major rain storms and may find their way via streams and estuaries into the ocean devlin et al 2011 2013 ocean warming and acidification due to a changed climate steinberg 2007 put further pressure on the system and have been linked to reef decline while mechanical damage may occur from dredging tropical cyclones and fishing de ath et al 2012 a major threat is brought upon the reef via crown of thorns starfish cots infestation elevated nutrients in the seawater are believed to rapidly increase their population de ath et al 2012 from an oceanographic point of view ocean currents are responsible for carrying material away from discharging estuaries and can propagate them to reef locations where they impact water quality environmental prediction and monitoring of ocean currents and river discharge in this region is thought to have potential to provide information beneficial for managing and mitigating anthropogenic pressures on the gbr the large scale circulation of the pacific ocean and coral sea is shown in fig 1 the main circulation feature is a principal flow towards the coast via the south equatorial current sec the sec is split up into various jets such as the north vanuatu jet nvj and the north south caledonian jet n scj that exhibits large seasonality the sec bifurcates near the shelf edge flowing toward the south as the source water of the east australian current eac and as a weaker current toward the north forming the north queensland current nqc and papua gyre pg the large scale forcing via the sec varies on time scales of months to years the atmospheric forcing is partially responsible for the seasonal variation in strength of the east australian current eac the eac is strongest in austral summer and weakest in winter autumn months hence responding to the seasonally active southeast trade winds the northwest monsoon is active from december to march and tends to coincide with strong southward flow within the eac intrannual variability within the eac has also been reported to be dominated by 90 140 day mesoscale period corresponding to the meandering and eddy shedding time scale e g archer et al 2017 and references therein ocean dynamics within the reef are impacted by tides winds sea level pressure slp continental shelf waves river discharge and upwelling the main flow direction within the reef matrix follows the atmospheric mean circulation hence northward flows are observed during active southeast trades the flow has a southward direction otherwise watermass exchange between the reef and the adjacent deep ocean plays an important role in the health of the reef and the shelf s ecosystem the interaction of the reef with the shelf provides a control mechanism of reef temperature even in the absence of wind and induces cross shelf changes in nutrient supply for reef communities e g andrews and gentien 1982 schiller et al 2015 benthuysen et al 2016 the continental shelf is narrow in the north about 40 60 km wide and has a dense reef coverage the shelf widens towards the south and is less densely populated with coral reefs over the central region a change in orientation of the shelf at around 17 s allows the southward flowing eac to impact directly onto the lagoon this is consistent with early model studies brinkman et al 2002 that predicted the measured bifurcation point at which the sec splits into north and southward flow at around 17 18 s one of the main passages in that vicinity allowing for the cross shelf exchange is palm passage intrusive upwelling events here are associated with cooler saltier waters penetrating onto the reef e g benthuysen et al 2016 these events happen on a regular basis typically from october to march since they only involve the near bottom layers they are undetectable from space hydrodynamic model simulations can assist in detecting these events and furthermore characterising their spread and strength schiller et al 2015 benthuysen et al 2016 sandery et al 2019 here we describe hydrodynamic models of differing resolution that have been developed for the great barrier reef the higher resolution 500 m model was implemented to provide a nature run to better resolve the complex reef system and therefore to provide a system wide reference data given the limitations of the observing system within the lagoon the target application for the bureau of meteorology bom was a 4 km model for a data assimilating reanalysis and a forecast system of the physical state sandery et al 2019 colberg et al 2018 the setup is similar to a modelling approach taken by the csiro ereefs system e g schiller et al 2015 herzfeld 2015 who use the sparse hydrodynamic ocean code shoc herzfeld et al 2008 to model the gbr with different horizontal resolution 4 km and 1 km their model forms the core of a suite of hydrodynamic biogeochemical and sediment models across paddock catchment estuary reef lagoon and ocean scales both the csiro and bom ereefs initiatives are funded by australian and queensland state government agencies and private investors to inform on the management of risk on water quality of the gbr the bom focusses on physical aspects of the system with a data assimilating forecasting service in mind it has several points of distinction from the csiro approach such as terrain following coordinates which have an advantage in representing the lagoon and river channels but with known limitations at the shelf break which need to be carefully minimised other differences such as the implementation of freshwater fluxes are touched upon in the relevant model section with greater detail when appropriate references and comparison to the csiro gbr models are included throughout this study the main focus of this study is on assessing the models performance on coastal and shelf scales with a forecast service in mind models are compared to the available queensland integrated marine observing system qimos moorings for temperature salinity and velocity over a roughly 2 year period jan 2009 mar 2011 section 2 gives an overview of the applied ocean models the models performance is assessed in section 3 on the full domain and shelf and coastal scales section 4 provides two case studies of river discharge events of note while section 5 gives a summary and a final discussion of the results 2 system setup 2 1 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model used for this study is the regional ocean modelling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 a finite difference model that uses stretched terrain following vertical coordinates the study region and model domain are shown in fig 1 the bathymetry used is a blend of datasets consisting of the gbr100 m beaman 2010 geoscience australia ga 9 arc second whiteway 2009 and the ga northward extension daniell 2008 the different bathymetric products have been blended via simple linear interpolation for points along the edge of the gbr100 bathymetry the grid nodes use a mercator projection to unify cell aspect ratio atmospheric fluxes are applied using the standard roms bulk formulae fairall et al 1996 the model uses a combined nudging radiation open boundary condition for temperature salinity and the components of the velocity field marchesiello et al 2001 the chapman condition is used for the free surface and the flather condition for 2d momentum vertical hourly atmospheric boundary conditions are taken from the climate forecast system reanalyses cfsr saha et al 2010 2014 lateral boundary conditions are daily average fields of temperature salinity and velocities derived via the bluelink reanalyses bran oke et al 2008 2013 these boundary conditions are effective where the model boundary is over deep water but they are less well resolved over the shelf and torres strait river freshwater fluxes have been sourced from the bureau of meteorology based on empirical models that rely on tide gauge data and consist of historical hourly fluxes for 25 catchments section 2 2 outlines the river specification for the ocean models we are using the topex poseidon global tidal model tpxo version 7 2 egbert et al 1994 to apply tidal phase and amplitude for sea surface height and barotropic velocities vertical advection of tracers uses a 4th order centred scheme and for advection of horizontal momentum a 3rd order upstream scheme is used this scheme was modified to include limiters see also naughten et al 2017 brassington et al 2018 when integrating the non linear models forward in time in the presence of strong horizontal density or tracer gradients the 3rd order upwinding scheme tends to numerically under over shoot what this means in practice for our modelling applications is that strong river flows with near zero salinity will tend to become negative at some point in time this behaviour is well studied and numerous numerical approaches are available to counter act this undesirable effect the smagorinsky scheme is employed to parameterise a spatially dependent horizontal mixing of momentum in order to model different aspects of the great barrier reef a high resolution on average 500 m and a forecast resolution on average 4 km model have been developed the high resolution model was integrated for 2 years spanning jan 2009 march 2011 the 4 km model was run 5 years from jan 2006 dec 2011 the number of topography following vertical levels are 25 and 30 for the 500 m and 4 km model respectively they are stretched towards the surface in both cases the bathymetry was smoothed with a modified shapiro filter e g penven et al 2008 to prevent excessive horizontal pressure gradient errors which can occur in terrain following vertical coordinate models the vertical coordinate transformation results in an additional hydrostatic correction term in the pressure gradient calculation that depends on the steepness of the bathymetry two numbers are often used to characterise said steepness the beckman and haidvogel number r x 0 beckmann and haidvogel 1993 which is a measure of the model resolution to the topographic variation and the haney or hydrostatic consistency number r x 1 haney 1991 hydrostatic inconsistency occurs when the discretised pressure gradient force pgf fails to vanish on horizontal isopycnic surfaces the haney number can be used to quantify different hydrostatic regimes consistent r x 1 1 inconsistent 1 r x 1 5 and unstable r x 1 5 in practice haney numbers below 3 mean that safe and conservative smoothing has been applied haney numbers of 1 are almost impossible to achieve unless the bathymetry is smoothed unrealistically the baroclinic pressure gradient force in roms is discretised with a high order density jacobian scheme based on monotonized cubic polynomial fits for the vertical profiles of density and geopotential height shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2009 this scheme dramatically reduces errors in hydrostatic balance shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2009 show that the pressure gradient solver in roms is robustly tolerant for hydrostatic inconsistent grids i e r x 1 1 in practice the roms community considers values of r x 1 6 safe to use the bathymetry has been smoothed with model stability in mind and resulted in a maximum beckman and haidvogel number of r x 0 0 39 0 33 for the hr fc models the resulting haney number varies spatially over the model domains and is largest over the shelf break and near the river channels spatial values of r x 1 are between 1 to 5 for the 4 km model due to the increased resolution the high resolution model gives smaller areas of high values for r x 1 with 9 grid points displaying r x 1 values greater than 5 these are located near the river mouth the models hence are well within the range of pragmatic choice for bathymetry smoothing the models are configured with an area of increased explicit viscosity and diffusivity sponge layer at the open boundaries and roughly scaled according to the rossby radius of deformation the sponge layer has been applied to both tracer and velocity fields it has been found that the implementation of a sponge layer is essential to successfully model the dynamics and thermodynamics of the coral sea at high resolution in the case of a too small or an absent sponge layer heat fluxes entering the model domain via the sec were strongly reduced resulting in widespread ocean model cooling extending from the deep ocean to the shelf not shown this subsequently affected the intrusive upwelling onto the gbr the 4 km model was less dependent on the strength and width of the sponge layer because the 4 km horizontal resolution is of similar order of magnitude than that of the global model bottom drag is parameterised using the quadratic law a spatially varying quadratic drag coefficient has been applied to the 4 km model in areas that are covered by known reef structures hemerson pers comm over these areas the quadratic drag coefficient has been increased by an order of magnitude from q d e e p 0 003 to q r e e f 0 03 roughly following e g hoeke et al 2013 and hearn et al 2001 applying a varying drag coefficient leads to an adjustment in the speed of the tidal gravity wave and showed an improved capability of the 4 km model to represent tidal elevations along the queensland coast appendix a includes a thorough comparison between modelled tides and observations for 70 tide gauges along the queensland coast it also discusses the effect of introducing a varying drag coefficient over reef structures for the 4 km model subgridscale vertical mixing is introduced by the k profile parameterisation scheme large et al 1994 2 2 river implementation riverine input at an ocean model s land boundary has been studied extensively e g herzfeld 2015 yankovsky 2000 a known problem that occurs when freshwater sources are included directly at the land sea boundary is that the naturally developed countercurrent in the lower model layers and the associated salt tongue is blocked yankovsky 2000 yankovsky 2000 argues that this results in the generation of strong cyclonic vorticity with divergence on the surface this potentially leads to an upstream deflection of the buoyant water from its source it is only after this initial response that the plume does an anticyclonic rotation under the influence of coriolis in other words modelled river plumes can move downward further than observed however it is suggested that in cases of large flow rates over relatively short periods the buoyant coastal discharge moves beyond the river mouth and can match observed results to some extent yankovsky 2000 suggests that in such cases it is viable to implement river flow at the land sea interface in this specific application of the gbr it is noted that this is the important case that produces the largest footprint and impact in a more recent study by herzfeld 2015 a method was proposed that aims to account for upstream flow in the salt wedge and in estuary mixing that elevates salinity at the mouth this method proved successful however it does not deal with the fact that catchments are often located a fair distance from the coast this can lead to a signal delay during rain events that cannot be dynamically modelled unless the hydrodynamic model implements an estuary like structure or resolves the estuary explicitly wilkin et al pers comm follow a different strategy to apply riverine input they manipulate the land sea mask to include a 1d river channel for each catchment the observed horizontal distance from river mouth to the catchment is used to determine the length of the channel while the model s vertical depth is used to adjust for the observed river volume applying the river input this way may ensure that the modelled velocity mass transport within the channels is able to match the observed velocity mass transport more realistically and hence account for appropriate arrival times of the fresh water signal at the river mouth however limitations of that method include time varying river bed volume due to different flow rates and unknown bottom roughness parameters within the river bed also in the case where the river s source lies above sea level very likely in most cases some of the freshwater momentum will be due to the influence of gravity an advantage of this method is that it dynamically develops a vertical salinity profile for each catchment in this study the second method described above is implemented due to its potential for adjusting freshwater arrival times at the river mouth and its ability to dynamically develop a vertical salinity profile which is unknown and flow dependent in most cases 25 catchments along the queensland coast are included in the model simulations as indicated in fig 1 the implementation for the 4 km model includes the addition of a linear slope within the 1d channels to match the minimum depth of 5 m at the land sea boundary the implementation of river channels for the 500 m model is simpler in that the depth of the channels has not been adjusted therefore the channels have a minimum depth equal to the minimum bathymetric depth of the model h m i n 1 m appendix b gives additional information on the river channel implementation and specification at this point we acknowledge that there are other sources of freshwater input in our domain such as the fly river which are not taken into account in the current model setup the models were designed to use quality controlled daily fresh water fluxes from australian catchments with the aim of providing a forecast service in the future we were not able to secure a similar product for other freshwater sources we acknowledge that the outflow would affect the water properties over the lagoon south of papua new guinea for example with potential local impacts to the northern tip of the great barrier reef however the general circulation in the northern gbr has a northward transport as influenced by the papua gyre 2 3 passive tracers both the 500 m and 4 km ocean models are configured to include 3d passive tracers and 3d age tracers the passive tracers can be viewed as dyes of a given concentration the 3d passive tracer fields are advected via the 3rd order upwinding scheme and differ to the active tracers temperature and salinity in that they do not affect the ocean s density field the implementation of the age tracer follows the constituent oriented age and residence time theory cart for a detailed description on the implementation the reader is referred to zhang et al 2010 and references therein passive tracers differ substantially from a sediment transport model in this study they are used to serve as a first order approximation of advection of particles however it should be noted that passive tracers are not able to represent processes such as sediment re suspension of particles as they do not bear any mass we note that typically river discharges in the gbr area are associated with large volume flood events that lead to turbulent plumes that have a longer retention period of suspended sediments and are visible in satellite imagery the high river discharge velocities during such flood events are likely to prevent settling of sediments as they enter the ocean at the same time re suspension of marine sediment at the inlets and along the coasts is common during large storm or flood events thus rendering distinct visibility in satellite images the nature of the queensland rivers which are either typically dry or flooding leads to limited pre conditioning of freshwater and something that can be traced by passive tracers and age tracers here we argue that the use of passive tracers is sufficient for a first order tracking of sediments but noting possible drawbacks due to the additional data load and compute time the number of passive tracers has been held low for the 500 m model only 1 tracer and 1 age field were added for pragmatic reasons while for the 4 km model 5 tracer and 5 age fields were added for the 500 m model each catchment is connected to the same tracer and age field while the 5 tracers and 5 tracer ages for the 4 km model are connected to a particular set of rivers the connections are roughly guided by maximising the distance between the selected rivers for each tracer to minimise the likelihood of mixing of tracers from different sources thereby ideally allowing for backtracking a particular plume to its unique catchment source hereafter we denote the 4 km model configuration as fc forecast and the 500 m model configuration as hr high resolution 3 model evaluation this section presents analysis into eddy kinetic energy eke for the gbr domain over the year 2009 the high resolution hydrodynamic model and the imos altimeter product have been spatially interpolated to a common resolution at the medium resolution model this is followed by a discussion of the domain wide innovation statistics between the hydrodynamic models and observations lastly model output is compared to the imos moorings array 3 1 mean and eddy kinetic energy fig 2 compares modelled mean and eddy kinetic energy mke eke with satellite observations for the year 2009 the imos altimeter dataset is used to compare to model results it maps the sea level anomalies sla using optimal interpolation of detided de meaned inverse barometer adjusted altimeter and tide gauge estimates of sea level the gridded dataset is near real time and provides gridded sea level anomalies gsla every 2 days on a 0 2 grid see also http oceancurrent imos org au in order to facilitate a meaningful comparison with the models we calculate 2 day averages of modelled sea surface height this removes much of the tidal signal we further remove the mean sea surface height over 2009 to get a quantity that is comparable to the gsla geostrophic velocities are then calculated from the resulting sea level anomalies the inverse barometer effect has not been removed but its effect over the coral sea is small when considering annual timescales the displayed imos mke is largest over the mean current systems of the domain dynamic active regions are the eac south of 16 s that flows south along the shelf edge the queensland current and papua gyre to the north south of 24 s the eac becomes more variable resulting in largest mke values near 22 s and to the east the oceanography is dominated by mesoscale eddies resulting in widespread enhanced mke both models are able to capture the pattern along the shelf edge and the high mke region in the southern part of the domain well however differences in strength are apparent for example both models show larger values of mke along the northern shelf suggesting the pg is too dynamic the fc model overestimates mke of the eac between 16 and 24 s but matches very well with imos mke south of 25 s the hr model captures mke better along the northern eac 15 18 s but overestimates mke for the southern eac the mesoscale eddy dominated parts of the domain are well captured by the hr but underestimated by fc the imos mke shows elevated values within the gbr lagoon along the capricorn channel 22 s 152 e both models fail to capture the variability here instead mke is large along the reef edges which may be a residual of the strong tidally driven currents there areas of low mke between 15 and 20 s are well captured by the fc model the hr model overestimates mke here to some extent further to the north along the nvj both models overestimate mke with the fc model more so than the hr model the eke shown in fig 2 highlights the areas of mesoscale eddy activity to the south the various jets entering the eastern model domain and variability over the pg the imos eke displays a broad band of eke between 15 and 20 s that is underestimated in width by the models this could be due to the 0 2 resolution of imos dataset over the pg towards the eastern boundary the observations exhibit a wavelike pattern emanating from torres strait which may be tidally forced the hr model captures this pattern a little better than the fc model as suggested before by the mke the eddy dominated areas in the south are better represented in the hr model than in the fc model the hr model overestimates variability in the centre of the domain suggesting that eddy activity is not dampened enough there 3 2 full domain statistics the data assimilation software enkf c sakov 2014 has been used in a purely data analysis mode to calculate full domain innovation statistics for the 500 m and 4 km models the analysis is based on daily averages of temperature and salinity fields the displayed statistics have been calculated taking into account observations from various sources and combining all observations into gridscale super observations regardless of instrument or platform within a model grid cell they are weighted by the inverse error variance to the average location and time within the cell and observation window observations include remotely sensed sst and in situ temperature and salinity from argo profiles sea surface temperature sst retrievals from multiple platforms including global high resolution sea surface temperature ghrsst navoceano may et al 1998 windsat gaiser et al 2004 pathfinder amsr e amsr2 are used when available sst observations are limited to night time only in the region to minimise diurnal warming biases the navoceano advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr per pixel bias correction is applied in situ temperature and salinity from argo roemmich et al 2009 is used however these observations are sparse and limited in this region to the deep ocean part of the domain table 1 displays mean statistics that have been calculated over the year 2009 for the two models shown are the mean absolute deviation mad the bias and the number of observations we have not included innovations statistics for sea level anomaly sla as de tided sla fields were not available from the 500 m model simulation we note that tides also affect the temperature and salinity fields but to a lesser extent allowing for the quantitative analyses presented here in terms of global mean statistics it appears that both models give reasonable results compared with reanalysis data for the model domain not shown but see sandery et al 2019 the models perform similar for sst with a m a d h r 0 559 c compared to m a d f c 0 561 c however the hr model displays a larger warm bias for sst b i a s h r f c 0 344 0 281 c this may be a consequence of differences in upper cell thickness due to finer resolution bathymetry and differences in vertical model levels enhanced variability present in the hr model may further contribute to this difference the warm bias for both models is partly caused by daily averaging of model output daily averaging includes the diurnal warming period and is at odds with the satellite sst s who are biased towards night times recalculation of the sst bias for the hr model based on 6 hourly averages and taking into account only night time sst shows a reduction of the warm bias by 0 1 c a more rigorous calculation of modelled night time sst may lead to further improvements in bias but is beyond the scope of this paper the hr outperforms the 4 km model for both temperature and salinity profiles for example the m a d h r 0 59 c vs m a d f c 0 90 c and m a d h r 0 121 psu vs m a d f c 0 171 psu the statistical performance of the hr model is in fact similar to that of the reanalysis discussed in sandery et al 2019 more striking is a reduced bias seen for temperature and salinity in the hr model with b i a s h r f c 0 0001 0 423 c and b i a s h r f c 0 050 0 093 psu the relatively large bias in the fc model for temperature is likely related to excessive diapycnal mixing caused by the lower resolution over the shelf higher horizontal resolution gives the hr model an advantage through reducing unwanted spurious mixing the choice of the horizontal advection scheme strongly influences the mixing properties of the models the 3rd order upwind scheme can lead to unrealistic mixing in roms strategies to alleviate this problem have been presented by the community for example by introducing higher order advection operators that split the advective and diffusive components however higher order schemes also introduce larger noise in the presence of strong density gradients and thus are more unstable given that our model places a strong focus on river discharge which in this area is associated with short but strong river flushing events the choice was to keep the 3rd order upwinding scheme we shall also note that the strong subsurface temperature bias is only seen for temperature and not for salinity furthermore the shallow well mixed coastal areas are not affected by this bias see table 2 3 3 q imos mooring array verification in this section we compare daily averages of modelled temperature salinities and velocities to observations taken from the queensland node imos mooring array the q imos mooring array is operated by the australian institute for marine science aims see also http imos org au httpimosorgauqimoshtml html the great barrier reef is the main focus region for this node and aims to understand the impact of the oceans on the reef the role that the east australian current plays and how future changes in the oceans may affect the coast the time period under consideration for this analysis covers january 2009 march 2011 fig 1 displays the 10 qimos moorings that have been included in the analyses as black dots additional information such as site depth and number of observations available for over the time period is given in the appendix table c 1 no salinity observations are available for heron island north gbrhin and lizard shelf gbrlsh in general the number of observations for salinity is about 1 4 that of temperature the largest amount of temperature salinity observations on a daily averaged basis are available for palm passage gbrpps mooring lizard shelf while the least amounts of temperature salinity observations are available for lizard slope gbrlsl elusive reef gbrelr the deepest shallowest mooring is lizard slope gbrlsl yongala nrsyon with depths of 300 m and 30 m no velocity observations are available for heron island north and lizard shelf prior to calculating the statistics presented below the observations have been processed by a applying the respective qc flags for each dataset temperature salinity and velocity b for temperature and salinity an out of range condition has been applied in which values have not been processed when v a r 0 v a r 40 and c a gradient condition has been applied for temperature and salinity screening for unrealistically large gradients in addition statistics for velocities have been calculated only for depths below 10 m as the adcp measurements tend to display large errors near the surface not shown two of the nine moorings gbrelr and gbrmyr display strong variations in depth over the period of interest these fluctuations are rapid at times and can be in the order of 60 m over a few days gbrelr and gbrlsh at times display unrealistic eddy like features not shown that affect the statistics gbrmyr displays unrealistically large velocities for a period from march november 2009 at 20 80 m depth not shown 3 3 1 temperature fig 3 compares the main statistics of the observed and modelled temperatures for selected stations for the 4 km and 500 m model additional stations are shown in the appendix in figs c 1 c 3 shown are 1 the temperature distribution as a histogram for observations and model results 2 scatter density plot between observed and modelled temperature and 3 scatter depth plot between observed and modelled temperature the scatter depth plots give additional information on model performance with depth figs 3 and c 1 are complemented by table 2 that displays the mean statistics such as the mean absolute deviation mad bias skill score after willmott 1981 and number of observations nobs the skill score has been calculated over each continuous time measurement at a near constant depth level fig 4 provides an example for palm passage gbrpps the figure shows mad bias skill score and correlation coefficient on the right panels of the figure for the fc fig 4a and hr fig 4b model the hovmoeller plots on the left side give an indication on available observations at depth levels over the specific time period for each pair of hovmoeller plots the upper ones display the observations while the lower ones denote the respective model results it can be seen that for this particular station the hr model displays a consistent mad bias and skill score over time and depth while the fc model exhibits a degrading performance with depth overall the hr model performs better in both mad and bias with values of m a d f c h r 0 91 0 74 c and b i a s f c h r 0 23 0 21 c however the mean statistics are strongly influenced by the substantially larger error seen for the 4 km model for gbrlsl m a d f c h r 2 32 0 80 c b i a s f c h r 1 91 0 65 c removing this station from the mean statistics reveals that both models have a similar average performance for mad m a d f c h r 0 75 0 73 c while the hr model displays a larger negative hence warm bias of 0 3 c b i a s f c h r 0 03 0 3 c these results are consistent with other modelling studies over the gbr for example schiller et al 2015 use a 4 km implementation of the shoc model over the gbr and compare results to imos moorings time period and number of observations differ but overall they calculate a mean absolute error of 0 65 c and a bias of 0 27 c the hr model displays substantially larger negative biases for gbrote gbrhin gbrlsh and nrsyon compared to fc but the mad s for each of those stations is comparable in the order of 0 4 0 6 c this suggests that the error spread is similar for both models the reason for the difference in bias is that the fc model displays larger variability over the course of a year with a tendency of being too warm cold in austral summer winter figure not shown thereby having an on average smaller bias this behaviour is particularly prevalent for the shallow well mixed stations gbrote grbhin and nrsyon the scatter density plot fig 3 a b demonstrates this change in bias exemplarily for nrsyon cooler warmer temperatures associated with winter summer months suggest a positive negative bias in fc while the bias is consistently negative for hr overall performance for gbrcch is similar for both models the models behave differently with depth orange colouring the hr model develops a negative wide spread bias while the fc model is centred positive biased fig 3c d the histograms suggest that the hr model better represents the temperature distribution overall at the deeper mooring gbrmyr both models display a large overall error m a d 1 c and bias 0 7 0 8 c the scatter plots in fig 3g h suggest that both models perform well from the surface to about 120 m depth and depreciate below that depth model errors at around 200 m are substantially larger blue colouring with a bias of around 2 c the given histograms further demonstrate the model observation mismatch here model results by schiller et al 2015 confirm a large bias and error for this site however the roms model seems to perform somewhat worse than the shoc model given the overlapping month the difference in model performance may very well be rooted in the choice of coordinate system gbrmyr is situated along the shelf edge and sigma coordinates may underestimate upwelling onto shelf to some extent for gbrelr both models display a large error on the order of 1 c that is mostly related to a large spread for the deeper water masses at about 100 m and 300 m depth the bias is somewhat larger for hr b i a s f c h r 0 35 0 43 c this station is situated the furthest offshore and is subjected to large variability emanating from the eac thus the large mad is likely owing to the chaotic behaviour of the eac the smaller bias suggests that overall the models are simulating the mean conditions correctly intra model differences are large for gbrpps with hr significantly out performing fc by displaying a smaller error m a d f c h r 0 84 0 57 c and small bias b i a s f c h r 0 56 0 05 c fig 3e f suggest that the performance of both models is similar near the surface but deteriorates with depth for fc as it becomes too cool fig 4 additionally suggests that this cool bias at depth persists throughout the year palm passage is an important passage for watermass exchange with the deep ocean driven by tidal motion and dynamic uplift these results suggest that the fc model may potentially overestimate intrusive upwelling events which in turn may explain the cooler near bottom temperatures for other stations over the lagoon such as e g nrsyon fig 5 shows an example of watermass exchange via palm passage the vertical temperature sections displayed for each model are 14 days apart dated at the beginning and mid of february 2009 the shelf being initially well mixed fig 5a b becomes stratified with a cool near bottom layer after the intrusion event fig 5c d the fc model is too cold compared to observations for this particular event compare to fig 4 general skill scores are high for both models in the order of 0 9 for the shallow stations depth less than 70 m the hr model shows better skill for deeper moorings such as gbrcch gbrelr gbrcch gbrmyr and gbrlsl most likely due to better shelf representation the largest intra model difference in skill is seen for gbrelr s k i l l f c h r 0 06 0 32 this station is situated the furthest offshore the coarser resolution model may include larger amounts of variability via the eac which reduces the skill score 3 3 2 salinity the number of salinity observations delivered by the qimos mooring array is only about 25 of that of temperature furthermore no salinity measurements are available for heron island north and lizard slope station table 3 gives the summary statistics for the remaining moorings for the different model simulations while figs 6 and c 2 show the salinity distributions scatter density and scatter depth plots overall both models have a tendency to being significantly too salty for 5 out of 8 moorings i e gbrcch gbrelr nrsyon gbrpps and gbrlsh when compared to observations the hr model performs overall better than the fc model on all three metrics mad bias and skill the mean error statistics are comparable to results reported by schiller et al 2015 who calculate a mean model error of 0 19 psu compared to a mean error of m a d f c h r 0 2 0 13 psu in this study however in terms of bias results differ schiller et al 2015 find that their model is too fresh overall here the opposite is found differing time periods for calculating statistics may be the reason salinity over the shallow reef is strongly influenced by river discharge which can be quite seasonal and contribute to model uncertainty for most stations outliers exist and errors can become large with values of up to 0 8 psu as evident from the distribution plots the exceptions are gbrcch and gbrelr fig 6 a b and e f which show comparatively little dispersion these 2 stations are deeper 100 m and 250 m and salinity measurements are taken at depths around 80 100 m this reduces observed variability and is positively reflected in the results the near surface salinity data is strongly influenced by ocean currents and local atmospheric conditions implying additional variability and uncertainty both models display the largest error and spread m a d f c h r 0 30 0 22 psu at nrsyon the nrsyon mooring is strongly influenced by freshwater discharge from the burdekin catchment which is subject to large fluctuations this is reflected in the salinity distribution at this station over the validation period the catchment has seen one of the largest fresh water discharge event discussed further in section 4 over the last 10 years the comparatively large model bias needs therefore to be interpreted in the context of unusually strong fresh water input and variability the lowest salinity values are extreme events at the tail of the histogram the bulk of the observed salinity values at 34 36 psu are well captured by the models the gbrmyr mooring fig 6e f delivers salinity measurements at 2 depth levels 30 60 m and 180 200 m as such it is the only station that delivers salinity data at a comparatively deep layer for the deep layer the 4 km model misses the salinity distribution completely while the hr model performs very well we speculate that the large bias seen in the fc model is due to the applied bathymetry smoothing which is strongest along the shelf and leads to changes in watermass characteristics in addition both models display a fresh salinity bias similar to what has been observed in schiller et al 2015 for this station and depth in terms of skill the models perform well for gbrote gbrhis nrsyon and gbrpps the hr model has a substantially better skill for gbrote s k i l l f c h r 0 6 0 81 however skill values are poor for gbrelr and gbrmyr for both models but particularly for the hr model we note that observations for gbrelr are very sparse with only two continuous measurements at two depth levels in addition the observations exhibit short term variability which is not well reproduced by the hr model 3 3 3 velocity we compare daily averaged modelled and observed velocities all moorings except heron island south gbrhis and lizard shelf gbrlsh contain velocity measurements and are assessed the daily averaging procedure removes much of the tidal signal of the observed and modelled velocities table 4 displays the mean statistics for the velocities no skill score is included in this analysis but instead a measure for the error of direction of flow veering is given veering has been derived using a complex correlation analysis following kundu 1975 it calculates the mean veering by weighting the average according to the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity vectors therefore larger velocities have a higher impact in the analysis the mad and bias displayed in table 4 are calculated for the current speed the complementing figs 7 and c 3 display histograms for direction and current speed and density plots of current speed both models display similar error statistics for mad and bias of current speed for 6 out of the 8 stations i e gbrote gbrhin gbrcch nrsyon gbrmyr and gbrlsl with mean errors in the order of the standard deviation of observations reflecting the variability in the system overall the models capture the mean velocity or its distribution rather well this is reflected in the biases that are about an order of magnitude smaller or less than 20 of the observed mean flow some exceptions with larger biases exist for gbrelr gbrmyr gbrlsl and will be discussed further below on average the hr model better represents the direction of flow with a mean veering of 12 59 compared to 21 5 for the fc model it is assumed this is a direct consequence of better bathymetry representation of the hr model the largest difference in veering is seen for gbrhin v e e r i n g f c h r 23 25 0 05 with the hr model performing better because it is able to represent the direction of the stronger currents more accurately error statistics for gbrelr fig 7 a b stand out compared to other stations the largest errors in mad and veering are recorded here the mad for both models is in excess of 0 2 m s which is about 50 of the observed mean flow of 0 5 m s due to the exposed position of this mooring the eac strongly affects the flow and variability eddy kinetic energy as seen in fig 2 has maximum values near the position of gbrelr the larger error hence reflects the non linearity of the system another concern is the veering error of 45 which suggests the models have very different flow characteristics compared to the observations the observations suggest a flow towards the northeast which is counterintuitive given the prevalence of the southward flowing eac for this station it is thus suggested that the error lies with the observations and not necessarily with the models in addition the fc model exhibits its largest positive bias of 0 12 m s for current speed overestimating the lower end of the velocities substantially the hr model has a small bias here 0 01 m s and represents the mean distribution of the flow speed well the largest intra model difference for current speed and direction is seen for gbrpps fig 7 e f the fc model does not capture the characteristics of prevailing currents the flow is too strong and too offshore oriented resulting in veering of 31 38 the error is also large and with 0 15 m s it matches the mean current speed the hr model does well in terms of direction and also captures the current speed distribution quite well reflected in the smaller bias nevertheless the hr model has still a large error of 0 10 m s and overestimates the velocities in the 0 2 0 4 m s range further offshore at gbrmyr fig 7 g h the fc model captures the flow characteristics better particularly the error in flow direction is reduced while the hr model displays its largest veering error here the station location captures parts of the eac induced variability hence the coarser resolution model is better equipped to deal with the larger non linearity as it effectively spatially filters the variability over the lagoon at nrsyon fig 7 c d both models perform similarly the hr model shows a smaller error for current speeds and direction both models show a consistent error in flow direction of 10 the flow over the reef lagoon is strongly driven by local winds and hence we suggest that atmospheric forcing and or bathymetric inconsistencies may be contributing to this error 4 river plume this section provides two case studies for river discharge events of note for the burdekin and fitzroy rivers the two catchments account for over 50 of the total river discharge over 2006 2011 the discussion includes the plume development over time and qualitative comparison to available observations most rainfall events in queensland are accompanied by strong cloud over the ocean and land however the cloud cover is often reduced over the ocean as the plume emerges and develops this provides an opportunity for using satellite derived products such as chlorophyll a and modis aqua terra imagery to compare to model results modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer https oceancolor gsfc nasa gov data aqua is a key instrument aboard the terra eos am and aqua eos pm satellites terra s orbit around the earth is timed so that it passes from north to south across the equator in the morning 10am aest while aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon approximate 2pm aest terra modis and aqua modis view the entire earth s surface every 2 days acquiring data in 36 spectral bands chlorophyll a has been derived from cloud free daytime imagery acquired by the modis aqua platform the modis imagery is processed using the nasa developed seawifs data analysis system seadas and the bureau operational ocean colour booc data processing package to obtain estimates of in water optical properties and concentrations of optically active constituents as such chlorophyll a is not independent of the modis aqua imagery but can complement these observations in addition to the spatial analyses test case 1 includes an analysis of near surface and bottom salinity at the yongala mooring and therefore provides an event interpretation to complement the general discussion of salinity in the previous section for that mooring in the following we compare the modelled plumes with the observations on a daily basis for test cases 1 and 2 averaging of the model output may account for some differences between observation and modelled plumes due to the nearshore advection by the tide for comparison purposes we select days which are either of general interest and or contain limited cloud cover some of the difference seen in the images of tracer and tracer age between the high resolution model and the 4 km model are due to the fact that the high resolution model only uses one passive tracer and age while the 4 km model uses 5 passive tracers and ages therefore when plotting 500 m model output all rivers that have been active in the area of interest are impacting the spatial pattern of tracer concentration and age for the fc model 5 tracers and ages are distributed across the 25 catchments each tracer and age only represents the discharge associated with 4 or 5 selected catchments in the subsequent analyses and discussion aqua terra modis imagery is sometimes referred to as ma mt and chlorophyll a is referred to as cl a 4 1 case 1 burdekin 2009 4 1 1 ma and cl a fig 8a displays the volume transport for the burdekin catchment for the discussed river discharge event the 2009 event was the largest recorded between 2006 2011 with a maximum transport exceeding 20 000 m 3 s the maximum discharge was recorded on february 5 2009 figs 9 11 display the modelled plumes their ages observed cl a concentration and true colour images for different dates overall both models display a similar distribution of tracer density large differences in the modelled age in particular over the northern part of the domain can be attributed to the difference in the number of tracers included for each model see section 2 3 the tracer field for the 500 m model includes additional river sources to the north south from the haughton herbert and tully don and o connell catchments see fig 1 fig 9 shows the developing plume about a week after the discharge event had peaked the ma mt image displays a sediment rich plume that emanates from the burdekin river mouth with a north east orientation there is evidence of a south eastward extension of the plume reaching 20 s 149 e both model simulations capture the dense plume and the farther offshore extension rather well the dye concentration has a maximum that coincides with the sediment rich plume structure near the river mouth this feature is captured particularly well by the 500 m model during february 18 2009 just after the second peak visual agreement between the models and observations is less good the observations suggest that the river plume is pressed tightly against the coastline with a northward orientation although both models display a northward extent in tracer and age maximum dye concentration has a north east orientation it is likely that both models either overestimate the river velocities or that daily averaging of dye concentration is at odds with ma mt snapshots the former would be indicative of limitations in the applied method of adding freshwater fluxes via 1d river channels riverbed volume will change with changing flow rates and frictional forces will therefore vary over time both effects are not accounted for in the model simulations cl a has a high concentration around the river mouth with developing north and southward extensions up to 19 s and 147 e both models match this quite well although dye concentrations are low particularly for the 500 m model hence the age fields visualise this spatial pattern better during the waning phase of the event fig 11 cl a is highly concentrated to the north and south of the river mouth in a 20 50km wide band extending from 19 s to 20 s the models capture the extent of the plume well but seem to favour a southward direction which is related to the prevailing atmospheric conditions at that time the models display a pocket of 10 15day old tracers that matches well with the high cl a concentration to north of the river mouth this age coincides with the timing of the first large discharge peak fig 8 towards the south the plume is younger in age less than 9 days which is consistent with the timing of the second peak winds are westerly during that time explaining the plume movement the cl a pattern is better matched by the 4 km model the ma image shows a broad plume with a suggestive eastward orientation the 500 m model captures this feature well 4 1 2 qimos mooring fig 12 compares near surface left and bottom right salinity for the models to observations at yongala mooring the timeseries for the near surface salinity d 7 m clearly shows the fresh water plume entering the mooring area during february 16 march 02 approximately 2 3 weeks after the maximum discharge occurred fig 8 no such freshening is observed for the near bottom salinity d 27 m giving away the nature of the plume being confined to the upper levels in the water column the two models are both able to capture the observed freshening the fc model in particular matches the order of magnitude and the duration of the freshwater signal very well the hr model does exhibit two peaks of advected freshwater which do not compare as well to the observations in terms of duration and strength the first peak although being on time with the observations does not capture the strength very well while the second peak occurs too late it is suggested that the timing of river discharge is out of sync with the wind forcing and or that larger intrinsic variability in the hr model have led to this behaviour after the plume has been advected further the models revert back to the mean salinity values arguably the 500 m model does a better job here than the fc simulation which tends to stay fresher over time compared to the observations the calculated statistics also shown in fig 12 confirm the visual inspection the hr model has a larger rmse r m s e h r 0 59 psu compared to the fc model r m s e f c 0 43 psu in the upper layer the rmse is slightly smaller for the near bottom layer for the hr model r m s e h r f c 0 25 0 28 psu corresponding correlation values are lower for the hr model in the upper layer owing to the mismatch in timing of the fresh water plume r h r f c 0 92 0 72 psu and this is also reflected in lower skill values for the hr model here s k i l l h r f c 0 84 0 95 for the near bottom layer correlation values are the same for both models with values of r 0 92 indicating solid model performance here 4 2 case 2 fitzroy 2010 2011 significantly higher rainfall over most parts of australia was experienced during the 2010 2011 la nina from july 2010 to march 2011 which lead to flooding in many parts of the country the arrival of tc yasi in early 2011 added to the already high precipitation rate the fitzroy catchment being located further south to the tc s land crossing had a peak discharge of over 13000 m 3 s in the first week of january fig 8b making it the largest discharge event for the fitzroy catchment over the last 10 years the first image shown for this event fig 8b is for december 18 2010 four days after the first smaller peak shown in fig 8b 6000 m 3 s the ma image displays a sediment rich river plume extending northward from the river mouth both models display high tracer concentrations over this area thereby capturing this sediment rich structure the 500 m does this better as it retains a northward direction within the high concentration area both models show an eastward extent of the plume which is also indicated in the ma image on january 11 2011 fig 14 about a week after maximum river discharge fig 8b ma reveals a large dense river plume emanating from the river mouth towards the north east this plume is about 60km in length both models display maximum concentrations around the river mouth however the fc model does not capture the eastward orientation of the plume very well this is likely caused by too weak velocities at the river mouth which may be linked to an overestimation of the river volume in the 1d channel for this catchment as discussed in section 2 1 the hr tracer aligns well with observations suggesting tracer speed and discharge timing are modelled well high cl a concentration is extending northward in a 20 km wide band at 23 s both models capture this feature well in terms of concentration and ages the 500 m model displays a rich detail in spatial features that give quite a realistic account on what is observed on january 13 2011 two days later the discharge event is subsiding fig 15 the ma image suggests that the dense sediment plume is attached to the coast following a northward flow direction under the influence of coriolis this is in good agreement with modelled tracer concentrations the cl a image displays high concentrations near 24 s this is well captured by the 500 m model but not in the 4 km model the source for this high cl a concentration is the calliope catchment see fig 1 which is included in the tracer field of the 500 m model 5 summary and discussion this paper presented results from hydrodynamic ocean models of the great barrier reef at two horizontal resolutions the models are designed to accurately represent the general circulation at the lagoon particular attention has been given to a river discharge and b cross shelf exchange with a boundary current system in light of the work by schiller et al 2015 an emphasis has been given to a to this end passive tracer and ages have been implemented as such the models may lend themselves to water quality assessments using a natural decay model but without explicitly implementing a deterministic bio geo chemical modelling component the models have been thoroughly tested for their performance on various aspects given that the gbr is such an important asset but so sparsely observed a large emphasis has been placed upon verifying model results with available mooring data this is to our knowledge the first ocean modelling study that takes advantage of all available mooring data of physical ocean properties temperature salinity and currents during a specific time period the models have first been compared to 70 available tide gauges the 500 m model showed some good results in terms of correlation rmse std and lag the 4 km model showed improved performance after a spatially varying bottom drag was applied to known reef areas this was done in a crude manner with bathymetric regions flagged as reef assigned the same increase in drag we suggest that a further classification on reef types may be desirable and could further improve the 4 km model s performance in terms of variability the models show good agreement with signals of observed mean and eddy kinetic energy the high resolution model has an advantage to capture the dynamic rich areas over the southern domain more realistically both models suggest variability is somewhat underestimated over the papua gyre and northern branch of the eac the high and medium resolution models have been assessed for the full domain region it was found that sea surface temperatures perform similarly for both models with a mean error of around 0 5 c and a mean warm bias between 0 2 and 0 3 c somewhat larger for the hr model the warm bias can be improved upon when considering modelled night time temperatures as opposed to daily averages to be more consistent with satellite sst we included a simple analysis that used 6 hourly averaged data to estimate night time sst this has been done for the hr model only this resulted in a reduction of the bias of around 0 1 c and also slightly improved the mad the remaining warm bias of 0 1 0 2 c may be due to the bulk flux formulation overestimating the net heat flux into the upper ocean layer or the applied vertical mixing scheme not being capable of mixing the heat down adequately we tested the second hypotheses for the fc model only by changing the mixing scheme to mellor and yamada 1982 but did not find that the model results improved significantly not shown modelled subsurface temperatures reveal larger intra model differences the high resolution model outperforms the fc model in both mean absolute deviation and bias particularly the effective bias removal from 0 4 c is encouraging given that the models operate with nearly identical physics the reason for this must be rooted in the increased horizontal resolution it is known that spurious mixing can alter the properties of watermasses in sigma coordinate models and we assume that this is the culprit here given the coarse resolution of the fc model compared to the hr model spurious diapycnal mixing is bound to play a larger role here performance of the models over the gbr lagoon has been assessed via the qimos mooring array we assessed available temperature salinity and velocity profile data for 10 moorings the results suggest that the high resolution model performs better overall for temperature because the 4 km model exhibits a very large error for lizard slope in the order of 2 c due to a warm temperature bias at 200 m depth the higher resolution model shows a consistent warm bias for the shallow well mixed moorings on the order 0 3 c while the fc model compensates too warm temperatures in summer with too cold temperatures in winter leading to an overall smaller bias over the year for those stations the fc model has a larger error for palm passage and myrmidon reef in particular for palm passage this is related to poorer model performance with depth the model is too cool there suggesting that it may overestimate intrusive upwelling events benthuysen et al 2016 to some extent the mooring sits along the shelf edge and is strongly influenced by variability from the eac particularly for the fc model this also leads to an overestimation of onshore velocities and a high error in ocean current direction when compared to the high resolution model in terms of salinity the high resolution model also performs better than the 4 km resolution model with an overall error of 0 13 psu generally both models have a tendency to be too salty likely due to missing river discharge precipitation and model bias the overall error estimated from the qimos moorings is in agreement with the full domain salinity analyses estimated from profile data for the hr model the fc model performs slightly better here than on a full domain basis of some interest is the model s performance over yongala mooring because 1 this mooring is the only mooring that is directly situated within the reef and 2 it is in close proximity to the burdekin catchment during the period of investigation the largest river discharge event in the past 10 years was recorded for the burdekin catchment the salinity histogram displays the resulting fresh water intrusion at yongala at the end of the tail giving a large range of salinity here subsequently the overall model error at around 0 2 0 3 psu is much larger for both models compared to the other stations extreme events like this come with a number of uncertainties such as river discharge amounts distribution of freshwater in the water column and atmospheric precipitation in light of that the models perform reasonably well in particular the fc model showed that it is able to capture the timing and severity of the freshwater tongue very well lastly we examined the models capability of modelling river plumes we utilised passive tracers and ages to compare visually with modis and chlorophyll maps two case studies were discussed the burdekin river discharge and the fitzroy discharge events results suggest that the models are able to reproduce basic features of the observed plumes in particular the 500 m model has an advantage in displaying the sediment rich plume near the river mouths more realistically the results of this paper suggest that the high resolution model has an advantage over the 4 km forecast model it performs better particularly over the deep ocean due to increased horizontal resolution which eliminates the subsurface temperature bias nevertheless when combined with data assimilation the 4 km forecast model has subsequently and successfully been used to form a 10 year reanalysis and a quasi operational model of the gbr sandery et al 2019 here it is implied that the 500 m model could possibly outperform the fc model in a similar data assimilation framework the bureau of meteorology australia has undertaken data assimilation within the ensemble optimum interpolation enoi framework e g brassington et al 2007 oke 2002 sakov 2014 enoi is based on the assumption of a static model ensemble when calculating the model error one of the challenges that needs to be overcome is the creation of an ensemble for the 500 m model if the model is to be used as a forecast tool latest moves within the bom have been towards employing the ensemble kalman filter method in which each forecast involves the forward integration of a set number of ensemble members on the order of 100 although the 500 m model increases the numerical cost the reduced model bias and improved distribution of variability e g eke would be an advantage to either method which cannot overcome systematic errors acknowledgements this work has been funded as part of ereefs australia https ereefs org au ereefs high performance computing was undertaken at the australian national computational

like to acknowledge the two anonymous reviewers who helped to improve the document appendix a spatial varying drag coefficient and tidal representation fig 1 green dots displays the position of all tide gauges for which data were obtained for the year 2009 the number of available gauges is not evenly distributed over the domain but is skewed towards southern queensland with 40 stations located between the southern model boundary to 25 s 30 stations are located between 25 15 s only 5 stations are north of 15 s they have been left out of the analyses because 1 they are located in torres strait just outside the model domain and 2 no useable data during the period of investigation was available as partially indicated in fig 1 many stations are located within estuaries and tidal flats this leads to bad correlation values there the observed data has been screened to exclude any missing values and obvious measurement errors have been removed however in the case where stations are located in rivers or estuaries the nearest ocean point has been taken for comparison in that regard we expect that the overall statistics presented could be further improved upon if those stations were left out for example the 6 lowest r 0 2 correlation values between observation and model data are either alert stations on land or are situated in an estuary fig a 1 displays the main results stemming from the tidal analyses shown are the mean statistics such as maximum correlation root mean square error rmse standard deviation std and maximum lag the results are summed up as histograms we are testing 2 versions of the forecast model with and without changing drag coefficient over the reef to demonstrate the effect of drag on the modelled tides we denote the 4 km model with a fixed varying drag coefficient f c f c 2 overall statistics do not differ substantially between the three models in terms of maximum correlation a large proportion of the gauges 4 km models 33 of 70 hr 31 of 70 reaches an r between 0 9 1 the fc models giving slightly better correlation values than the hr model for this bracket not much difference is seen between the two 4 km models for maximum correlation the lowest correlation values r 0 2 are associated with alert stations and stations situated in estuaries and tidal flats this is also true for the 10 12 stations with 0 2 r 0 5 about 20 stations for each model display moderately good correlations of 0 5 r 0 9 12 of these are alert stations three are within rivers and on land one is next to a pier and 4 stations are on the beach open ocean the rmse is shown in fig a 1b it suggests an improved error for the 4 km model after the varying drag coefficient is introduced this is mostly seen in the r m s e 0 1 0 4 bracket f c 5 of 70 stations f c 2 13 of 70 stations the f c 2 model has a similar error distribution across the tide gauges than the hr model however std differences fig a 1c suggest that the introduction of the varying drag coefficient over the reef has reduced the sea level variability slightly due to increased friction which dampens the signal the hr model tends to underestimate variability slightly a major improvement is seen for f c 2 in the timing of the tidal signal fig a 1d the maximum lag is reduced hence improved for f c 2 the performance is similar to hr suggesting that tidal wave speeds have responded positively to the spatially variable friction term appendix b river specifications table b 1 outlines the 25 catchments included in the model simulations and their characteristic dimensions such as width length and volume table b 2 gives the associated channel specifications for the 500 m and 4 km models for each catchment including channel volume volume ratio between modelled channels and observed rivers number of model cells used for the 1d channels optimal cell depth that would result in a best fit of model channel and observed river volume and the average depth of each model channel it can be seen from the ratio between model channels and observed river volumes that the channels overestimate the volume mostly this is expected and almost unavoidable since the observed river lengths are much larger than their depths and widths in order to adjust a 4 km or a 500 m grid via their depth whilst keeping the length close to observed lengths very shallow channels are necessary this results in unwanted instabilities for example the ratio between observed and channel volume is largest for the logan catchment here the ratio indicates that the volume of the 4 km model channel is about 200 times larger than the observed river volume in order to match the observed volume an optimal channel depth in the order of 1 cm would have been required which is not possible without violating vertical cfl criteria appendix c additional tables and figures see figs c 1 c 3 and table c 1
