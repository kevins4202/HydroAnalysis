5365,3d virtual network was numerically constructed from particles of various sizes and the drainage process was simulated the resulting moisture retention curves suggested that the sample geometry affects the drainage this unexpected result was confirmed experimentally for water retention curves of sandy and loamy soil samples differing only in air accessible surface 19 6 cm2 open surface and around 0 8 mm2 paraffin covered surface with an opening made by injection needle experimental water retention curves differed markedly below pf 2 and less at higher suctions confirming the theoretically predicted behavior the experiment did not confirmed a second hypothesis that water retention depends on sample diameter and height two open surface sandy soil samples 5 cm 5 cm and the second 2 6 cm 2 0 cm diameter height had very similar water retention curves possibly the specimens had too close diameter height ratios keywords drainage model pore water retention simulation soil 1 introduction soil water retention curve wrc is one of the most important soil characteristics closely related to soil fertility and physical quality dexter 2004 it is widely accepted that wrc determines water usability by plant roots it is used to estimate field water capacity plant available water and or wilting point soil water retention differs during income and outcome of water flooding drainage and or wetting drying hysteresis water retention results from soil wettability a strength of water adhesion to soil solid phase and pore size distribution related to the space available for the retained water and to the water potential via dimensions of menisci in soil capillaries it is evident that wrc is related to soil grain size distribution arya and paris 1981 pande et al 2020 buczko and gerke 2005 since the soil is a randomly disordered granular body its pores are invariably irregular and have tortuous connections it holds even for the geometrically simplest porous media composed from identical spheres méheust et al 2002 moebius and or 2012 therefore modeling of soil water behavior in complicated pore structure has been a great challenge up to date most of the papers dealing with soil water retention modeling are based on analytical or semi analytical richards or van genuchten van genuchten 1980 equations relating moisture content to water pressure and or water flow hydraulic conductivity to water potential or water content soil water characteristics have been most frequently described in analytical form by so called pedotransfer functions using most available soil data like grain size distribution gsd organic matter content and bulk density e g mualem 1976 alvarez acostal et al 2012 despite all soil water properties are derivatives of geometry of soil pores which are determined by solid phase geometry these functions describe water storage phenomenologically not taking into account the microscopic mechanisms measurements of soil water retention can be performed using laboratory and field procedures the field measurements give probably the most realistic wrc s however due to the heterogeneity of soil profiles a need for installation of several tensiometers and soil sampling for moisture content determination long equilibration time weather changes relatively small range of measuring pressure and huge amount of work the field procedures are not practical bork and diekkrüger 1990 leij et al 1996 pachepsky et al 2001 in laboratory procedures an undisturbed soil core sampled into a metal cylinder is placed upon a porous membrane permeable for water but not for air and saturated with water different pressures are applied to remove water from the soil sample since the membrane has to be water saturated during the whole measuring procedure the maximum pressure difference across the membrane should not exceed its bubbling pressure brooks and corey 1964 at which the largest membrane pores are emptied two modes of laboratory wrc determination are the most common applying a vacuum to the lower side of the membrane the water content is measured by tension plate devices in which the atmospheric pressure pushes water out from the sample pores the theoretical upper limit of the applied pressures is 100 kpa and practically it is not higher than 70 kpa bork and diekkrüger 1990 the necessity of frequent weighing of the sample to determine the equilibrium water content at different water potentials brakes soil membrane connection at each measuring step this may seriously affect the measurements due to water redistribution in the sample pores having occasionally two or one air available surfaces the effect of the sample membrane disconnections is eliminated in pressure chamber method in which compressed air is used to displace water from the soil sample placed permanently upon a membrane or a ceramic plate also markedly higher pressures up to 1500 kpa can be achieved in this method the first aim of the present paper was to construct a model of soil medium composed from particles of various sizes into geometrically well defined porous structure in which individual pore dimensions and connections can be distinguished and to simulate the drainage of the obtained virtual structure the second aim of the paper was to check whether the simulated drainage pathways correspond to that of a real soil our main assumption was that if a virtual structure has the same gsd and porosity than the investigated soil some properties of both objects including water characteristics should be the same or close the measurements of soil drainage for various sample shapes and different initial soil air contact areas were performed using pressure chamber method that we consider to be more accurate than the pressure plate one 2 theory computer simulation of soil structure and its drainage the simulation consists of the following stages 1 mass based particle size distribution of the investigated soil is transferred to number based particle size distribution 2 construction of a particles network random 3d packing of particles having the above number based size distribution to reach the representative elementary volume radius and coordinates x y z of each particle are stocked in a file procedure 2 1 below 3 construction of pore network a pore is considered as a space between 4 contacting particles a tetrahedron with apexes located in the particles centers is created the pore void is approximated as a sphere adjacent to all particles and the pore necks as circles adjacent to 3 sections of particles on each tetrahedron wall volumes tetrahedron volume minus summary volume of 4 particles segments and radii all 4 necks for each pore of all pores in the particle network are determined determination of pore location each pore is assigned with a number expressing a quantity of the pores contiguous for all 4 pore sides if the number of a pore is 4 3 or 2 such pore is classified as active one which means that it is situated at the surface of the created structure procedure 2 2 below 4 drainage of created grain structure saturating the whole pore network with water choosing amount numbers of active pores which will be dried first applying continuously increasing suction from its minimum value determined by the largest neck of the active pore to the highest one determined by the smallest neck in the whole structure procedure 2 3 below 2 1 geometric model of particles arrangement into soil structural network following letey 1991 the soil structure can be defined as a configuration of its solid phase and understood as an arrangement of individual soil components into a network soil structure depends primarily on soil grain size distribution gsd reflecting frequencies of occurrence of particles of various sizes we simulated the soil microstructure by creating minimum space networks for a set of spherical particles of various gsd each particle was labeled with its own number the packing procedure started from a kernel composed from 5 self touching particles and it was enlarged adding particle by particle the packing procedure takes a random size particle of number n 1 and places it in contact with three already networked particles by solving a set of three equations 1 x i x n 1 2 y i y n 1 2 z i z n 1 2 r i r n 1 2 x j x n 1 2 y j y n 1 2 z j z n 1 2 r j r n 1 2 x k x n 1 2 y k y n 1 2 z k z n 1 2 r k r n 1 2 where i j k are sphere numbers n i is central particle number j i and k j x y and z are particle center spatial coordinates and r is the particle radius the space coordinates x n 1 y n 1 z n 1 of a particle of radius r n 1 are accepted when the new particle does not overlap any already networked one the packing procedure gradually surrounds the ith particle with new particles until any place adjacent to it exists and then the next particle starts joining the particle numbered i 1 fig 1 presents the simplest case of incorporation of a new particle n 1 to the network by touching 3 particles i j and k already present in the structure the above procedure is repeated until the structural porosity begins to be independent on the size of the network i e the representative elementary volume rev of an investigated soil body bear 1979 is reached 2 2 pore system of particles network inside the created virtual network a complicated porous system of micro channels and voids is formed to describe this system a single pore concept of mason 1972 was applied in which a single pore is formed between four particles the pore void is created as a sphere adjacent to all four particles as it is shown in fig 2 the parameters of such sphere can be determined by solving a set of four equations 2 x i 1 a j 2 y i 1 b j 2 z i 1 c j 2 r i 1 d j 2 x i 2 a j 2 y i 2 b j 2 z i 2 c j 2 r i 2 d j 2 x i 3 a j 2 y i 3 b j 2 z i 3 c j 2 r i 3 d j 2 x i 4 a j 2 y i 4 b j 2 z i 4 c j 2 r i 4 d j 2 where j is pore number and i i1 i2 i3 i4 is a number of the particle x y z are spatial coordinates of a center of i th particle a b c are spatial coordinates of a center of the pore sphere and r d are particle and pore void radii respectively the single pore is a part of a tetrahedron with apexes located in particle centers this pore is characterized by five parameters the pore volume tetrahedron volume minus total volume of the four particle segments in the tetrahedron and radii of the four pore necks at each tetrahedron wall the radius of the neck is the radius of the circle adjacent to all of three arcs cut off by the tetrahedron wall as shown in fig 2 the neck size r234 between particles i2 2 i2 3 i3 4 can be calculated from 3 x i 1 a k 2 y i 1 b k 2 r i 1 r 234 k 2 x i 2 a k 2 y i 2 b k 2 r i 2 r 234 k 2 x i 3 a k 2 y i 3 b k 2 r i 3 r 234 k 2 where k 1 4 and i m 1 4 for a given tetrahedron pore x y are planar coordinates of a particle center and a b are planar coordinates of a neck center the 3d delaunnay tessellation concept okabe et al 1992 allowed for the division of spaces onto a set of tetrahedrons containing pores thus describing the pore system of the simulated particle networks finding radii and centers of voids and necks this procedure is similar to triangulation where a plain area containing a given number of points is divided into a set of triangles that fill the area coherently 2 3 drainage of the virtual particle network from microscopic point of view soil drainage can be considered as a replacement of pore water by air that is possible when the drained pore is in direct or indirect contact with the outside atmosphere and the water pressure within the drained pore is lower than the drainage pressure water tension or air pressure in the proposed model we divided soil pores into three categories neutral air filled active filled with water and having a contact with the outside atmosphere or with a neutral pore across the active pore neck a meniscus is formed on which an absolute value of the capillary pressure reaches local maximum and the drainage of the active pore occurs when the outside pressure reaches the capillary pressure of the pore neck passive filled with water and surrounded by other water filled pores the passive pore can be drained if at least one of its neighboring pores is drained out and then the passive pore becomes active having parameterized all pores of a 3d network structure and knowing their connections numbers of neighboring pores it was possible to simulate the pore system drainage the simulation was based on the fact that the withdrawal of water from the saturated soil sample induced by a macroscopic pressure gradient starts at its upper surface because all active pores are initially located only on the top of the sample the largest pores are drained first the range of the pressures needed to drain the whole structure was determined by the largest rmax and the smallest rmin pore necks radii capillary pressure prc at a meniscus formed on a neck of any radius r was approximated by the laplace equation with zero water contact angle 4 pr c 2 σ w r where σw is water surface tension let us suppose that at the beginning of drainage all pores of the virtual network are water saturated this means that each active pore is located only on the outer surface of the porous structure the surface pores of the largest diameter neck are emptied first and remain active the active pore is cleared when the external pressure pr1 is greater than the meniscus pressure prc of the active neck if all other three necks of the just drained pore are smaller than the outlet one the drainage stops if at least one of them is equal or larger than the outlet one the drainage of the neighboring pore occurs if the above procedure is repeated with a gradual increase in pressure smaller and smaller necks are activated and pores of appropriate size are emptied the pressure increase pore suction is continued until all active pores are emptied it is worth emphasizing that such drainage procedure allows some large pores to retain water if they are surrounded by smaller neck pores hunt et al 2013 the sum of all tetrahedrons represents the total volume of the pore structure and the sum of the volumes of all individual pores gives the total pore volume furthermore having the amount of empty and water filled pores i e the water content of the pore system at different prc values the water retention curve can be easily constructed for the reason of simplicity the 2d analogue explaining the above procedure is shown in fig 3 the other results concern 3d structure the center of the circular particle locates at the common vertex of at least three triangles larger particles are surrounded by more adjacent particles and generally more pores are present around them in 2d each pore consists of three particles and has 3 necks see fig 2 the neck size is the difference between the particle center distance and the sum of the two particles radii fig 3 illustrates also the drainage of the same network at a stage where about half of all the pores were emptied black triangles and the other half remained filled with water white triangles some of the pores filled with water are still active and some are passive therefore regions surrounded only by passive pores remain filled with water at the applied pressure the presented approach to drainage means that a given active pore is completely emptied when the external pressure reaches the value associated with the active neck consequences of the above simplifications are analyzed in appendix a similarly a fluid retention was characterized in porous structures consisting of capillaries of varying cross section by wang et al 2013 the probability of occurrence of larger active pores is lower for smaller air contact area smaller sample diameter or smaller air available surface and the probability of occurrence of interconnected large pores decreases with the sample height thus one can expect that drainage of the same virtual structure should give different results for various amounts of initially active pores and for various initial sizes of the structure 3 materials glass bed a mixture of glass spheres river sand and three narrow size fractions sand 1 2 and 3 extracted from the river sand were used their particle size compositions are presented in table 1 two hungarian soils of different texture sandy haplic arenosol calcaric wrb and loamy calcic phaeozem siltic wrb formed from loess were used basic properties of these soils are presented in table 2 particle size categories of the soils were determined with the sedimentation method buzás 1993 4 methods to check whether the model reconstructs the native structure of real specimens the simulated networks were constructed for particles of size distributions coinciding with glass bed river sand and sands no 1 2 and 3 porosity of these structures were calculated and compared to experimentally determined porosities of the studied materials the experimental porosities were determined from bulk densities determined from 3 replicates of soil samples dried at 105 c for 24 h and densities of solid phase measured by helium pycnometry quantum crome ultrapycnometer 1000 to model the hypothesized effect of air contact area on wrc drainage of a virtual network constructed from particles of granulometric composition corresponding to the studied glass bed see table 1 was simulated for different number of initially active pores 3 332 and 3571 the wrc was simulated for n integer pressure values p i 1 p i pma x pmin n for i 1 2 n 1 water content for p1 was the entry value in the applied loop experimental water retention curve for the glass bed filled into kopetzky 5 cm diameter 5 cm height cylinder was measured as well to practically check the simulated effects of the sample air contact area on water retention experimental wrc s were determined for two samples of each studied soil placed in kopetzky cylinder the top of the first sample was open while the second one was closed with a plastic plug having a single air entry through a syringe needle of 0 5 mm radius the needle was deepened 10 mm below the soil specimen surface to avoid spreading of the entered air above the sample during the drainage process to practically check the postulated effect of sample dimensions on water retention we measured wrc s for the sandy soil using two open surface samples of different diameter height ratio 2 6 2 0 and 5 0 5 0 cm cm these samples are called later small and big respectively for all wrc measurements the soils were placed into the appropriate cylinders filled from the bottom upwards by distilled water to compact packing dried in a lab atmosphere and finally overnight at 105 c next the cylinders were again filled with water and placed in the pressure chamber on a 500 kpa air entry ceramic plate at a controlled temperature 20 3 c the amount of water replaced from the samples under increasing pressures from 0 to 150 kpa was measured volumetrically inside the chamber early simple analogues of swc 150 soil water characteristic cell www gcts com allowing for measurements of water outflow from the soil sample thus eliminating necessity of its frequent weighing and braking soil membrane connection were used for this purpose all measurements were made according to the standard procedure crescimano and iovino 1995 kool and parker 1987 in two replicates for each sample the data presented further are averages from these replicates 5 results and discussion all pores of virtual particle pore networks constructed from particles of psd corresponding to these of the studied granular materials were interconnected and the tetrahedrons filled the network volume coherently or almost coherently the representative network the representative elementary volume rev contained minimum 7000 mono sized particles and the particle number increased with broadening psd range about 27 000 particles for psd of loamy river sand the biggest created network contained 30 000 particles in all cases the simulated structures had near spherical shapes the bulk density of the loamy soil was equal to 1 1 g cm 3 1 07 1 12 and of the sandy soil 1 55 g cm 3 1 51 1 57 and their porosities were equal to 57 4 0 86 and 42 8 0 79 respectively it is necessary to mention that all samples of each soil had practically the same bulk densities in all experiments experimentally determined porosities of the sands and the glass bed and their simulated counterparts are presented in table 3 the differences between simulated and measured porosities were in all cases lower than 5 this may certify that simulated networks well reflected the natural structures of the studied objects water drainage curves simulated for the network corresponding to the glass bed gsd for a different number of initially active pores together with the experimental wrc are presented in fig 4 drying of the virtual network begins at a low pressure corresponding to the largest surface pore which is initially active generally when the amount of primary active pores is limited drying starts at higher pressure one can notice also that the pressure at which air starts to penetrate the pore network air bubbling pressure is probably not an absolute value and depends on soil sample geometry as well air bubbling pressure concerns a path composed of large pores going from the sample top to the bottom it is hypothesized that such a path is the random set of connected large pores in short height soil samples wider paths and smaller bubbling pressures are more likely than in long height samples from the other hand the bubbling pressure should be smaller for wider sample diameter because statistically broader active pores occur at the sample top and more possibilities exist to find a path composed of larger pores only in reality a part of lens and thin layer water remains in a pore even when its accessibility condition is fulfilled hunt et al 2013 while the applied model supposes complete drying it means that at the same pressures the real moisture content is higher than the simulated one the main conclusion drawn from the above simulations is that the moisture retention is not an absolute soil characteristic because it depends on the availability of pores that are able to be drained and thus on size and shape of the sample experimental water retention curves of sandy and loamy soil samples differing in air contact area having open and rubber covered surface are shown in figs 5 and 6 the measurements were markedly shorter for open surface sample 39 days in average than for rubber covered surface 93 days due to large differences in equilibration time the experiments confirmed our theoretical prediction that the measured soil moisture retention depends on the experimental setup for soil samples with limited air access water outflow started at higher pressure than for the open surface sample at higher pressures pf 2 water retention curves for both samples are much closer the proposed model supported by the above experimental data can extend an explanation of a water deficit in crusted soils heavy rain disintegrates the surface layer aggregates in clay and loamy soils after the rain stops a newly created dense packed top soil layer crust is formed from the finest particles due to positive grain sedimentation within the crust all water air contacts are practically limited to rare slits during further drainage more water remains below the crust what means that the soil surface is more saturated with water therefore there is less space for accumulation of water coming from a next rain and the excess of not retained water is either evaporated or run off from sloppy fields in fig 7 water retention curves of sandy soil samples of different volumes 10 6 and 100 cm3 and different diameter to height ratios 1 29 and 1 0 respectively are shown despite large differences in shapes and volumes rather small differences in water retention curves measured for both samples occurred a negligible influence of sample dimensions and shapes on wrc s was also observed experimentally in the pressure plate test for fine grained clays by wang et al 2015 for samples of the same height and various surface areas height to diameter ratio 1 as supposed previously drainage should start at a higher pressure for higher sample height and at a lower pressure for samples of higher surface area opposite to the above the drainage of big sample having higher height starts at slightly lower pressure than the drainage of the small sample smaller height however the big sample has significantly larger surface area than the small one and its drainage at lower pressure may be due to a prevalence of air contact area effects the height diameter ratio for big and small samples was not higher than 1 1 0 and 0 77 respectively similarly as in wang et al 2015 experiments possibly the sample height effects are more pronounced at higher height diameter ratios which seems interesting for further studies the sample studied in the laboratory should be representative for the investigated soil bear 1979 diekkrüger 1990 eggleston and peirce 1995 kutilek and nielsen 1994 it is commonly accepted that a soil sample inserted to a kopetzky cylinder of 5 cm diameter and 5 cm height 100 cm3 volume meets the above requirement however 60 400 cm3 samples are also used long time is needed to equilibrate water retention in large samples our results suggest that the experimental pf curve can be representative even for much smaller soil samples than these commonly used at present it supports the practice of leij et al 1996 who applied sample height limited to 2 3 cm and the volume of 30 40 cm3 to accelerate the equilibrium and make the measurements faster soil moisture retention curves are measured in laboratories in belief that they are equal to the field ones literature data are ambiguous in this respect bork and diekkrüger 1990 analyzed field and laboratory water retentions of 2500 soils showing that in all cases for a given water pressure the mean field wrc is lower than the lab one however our analysis of unsoda http www worldcat org title unsoda unsaturated soil hydraulic database where similar results are presented suggests that such relation is not a general rule among 81 pairs of water retention curves 42 pairs confirm this finding 19 pairs show opposite relation and in 20 cases the two curves more or less overlap it s worth noting that unsoda laboratory measurements were performed for different sample volumes varying from 60 to 400 cm3 and for different sample shapes diameter height ratios from 0 39 to 2 22 field moisture content was mainly measured with neutron probe which measures the average moisture content from a sphere of 20 25 cm in diameter the results presented in this paper suggest that equality of lab and field data is occasional and should not be a priori assumed however at the present state of the investigations it is difficult to say whether the predicted and observed differences between water retention curves are just certain curiosities or they indicate a methodological error of the actually applied measuring methods 6 conclusions drainage simulations of a virtual network composed from particles of various size distributions resulted in water retention depending on the area of the sample contact with the outer space air access and on the sample shape the first prediction was experimentally verified for sandy and loamy soils for which high differences between water retention curves measured for samples of the same bulk densities and different air access areas open and partially plugged surface high differences between water retention curves were observed below pf 2 for pf 2 both curves almost overlapped the model predicts that the drainage pressure increases with the sample height and decreases with its surface area diameter the experiments measured slightly lower drainage pressures for bigger specimens of higher height and larger surfaces the theoretically predicted differences may possibly be observed for specimens of greater height to diameter ratios this subject needs further

a pore drainage neglects a certain volume of water remaining in the pore as lenses iwata et al 1988 and as the thin film covering the solid phase globus 1966 both forms of water are present even if the absolute water pressure is greater than the pore neck laplace pressure the water pressure prl of the lens between two identical spheres can be expressed as a1 p r l α σ w 1 r 1 α 1 r 2 α where r1 and r2 are curvature radii of lens water and the angle α is defined by the extent of the lens as illustrated in fig a1 both radii depend on the water volume being quantified by the particle radius r

where β is an angle between tetrahedron walls the a4 equation is an extension of the iwata et al 1988 equation with a coefficient β 2π describing a part of water lens inside the tetrahedron water pressure of a thin water layer at the particle surface prh is related to the van der waals interactions globus 1966 a5 pr h a h 3 where a is hamaker constant 10 20j and h is water layer thickness at the particle surface let us estimate the impact of lens and thin layer water on particle surfaces on the calculated moisture content of the virtual particle and pore medium for simplicity a regular tetrahedral pore composed of 4 equal spheres will be analyzed it was supposed that similar relationships occur in all tetrahedral pores but in this case a total volume of lenses and thin layers seems to be the higher than in tetrahedrons composed from particles of different radii volume of lens and of thin layer water will be calculated for regular tetrahedron which will allow for rough estimation of its impact on the moisture content of the virtual granular medium as a whole as the tetrahedron edge length is 2r its total volume vt can be calculated as a6 v t 2 2 3 r 3 solid phase inside a tetrahedron is composed of 4 identical spherical segments the segment volume vs can be calculated as a7 v s 1 3 ε r 3 where ε is spherical excess of the 3 angles of the spherical triangle total porosity of tetrahedron ptot is a8 p tot v t v s v t drainage of such pore starts when the outer suction becomes infinitesimally higher than the capillary pressure of a neck at any tetrahedron wall this pressure is quantified by a circle radius rn inscribed between three circles arcs at the tetrahedron wall see the neck in fig 2 a9 r n 2 3 3 r when the suction reaches the value prn determined by a10 pr n 2 σ w r n the pore becomes empty and only water lenses and thin layer water films for which water pressure is larger remain inside determination of water lenses and thin layer water volumes remaining in the pores will allow us to estimate the error of the assumption that no water remains in the pore muhammadi and meskini vishkaee 2012 2d representation of the lens and thin layer water is shown in fig a2 where air entered into the pore through neck d1 lens water locates between two neighboring particles and thin layer water film covers entire particle surfaces inside a triangular shaped pore to illustrate the extent of particular forms of water exemplary calculations for particles of radius r 0 1 mm were performed at equilibrium both pressures of water lens and thin film must be equal to the neck pressure a11 p r n p r l p r h value of αp corresponding to prn can be determined for lens water from eq a1 and thickness h of thin layer water from eq a5 consequently for all six lenses present in the tetrahedron the summary lens water volume can be calculated as a12 v l tot 6 v l since there are four spherical triangles in each tetrahedron their surface area st is a13 s t 4 ε r 2 where ε 0 551 for equilateral triangle the volume of thin water layer v h tot in tetrahedron is a14 v h tot s t h 4 ε h r 2 so the relative volume of lens water pl is a15 p l v l tot v t and relative volume of thin layer water ph is a16 p h s t h v t table a1 shows the respective calculations made for particle radius r 0 1 mm the main conclusion from the above considerations is that the volume of lens and thin layer water remaining in the pore after drying at the suction corresponding to a neck pressure prn constitutes 2 of tetrahedral volume or 7 5 total porosity and so the summary impact of lens and thin layer is negligible 0 01 this remaining part of water in the pore is drained step by step at higher pressures the above calculations give a rough estimation of the error of the presented simulation 
5365,3d virtual network was numerically constructed from particles of various sizes and the drainage process was simulated the resulting moisture retention curves suggested that the sample geometry affects the drainage this unexpected result was confirmed experimentally for water retention curves of sandy and loamy soil samples differing only in air accessible surface 19 6 cm2 open surface and around 0 8 mm2 paraffin covered surface with an opening made by injection needle experimental water retention curves differed markedly below pf 2 and less at higher suctions confirming the theoretically predicted behavior the experiment did not confirmed a second hypothesis that water retention depends on sample diameter and height two open surface sandy soil samples 5 cm 5 cm and the second 2 6 cm 2 0 cm diameter height had very similar water retention curves possibly the specimens had too close diameter height ratios keywords drainage model pore water retention simulation soil 1 introduction soil water retention curve wrc is one of the most important soil characteristics closely related to soil fertility and physical quality dexter 2004 it is widely accepted that wrc determines water usability by plant roots it is used to estimate field water capacity plant available water and or wilting point soil water retention differs during income and outcome of water flooding drainage and or wetting drying hysteresis water retention results from soil wettability a strength of water adhesion to soil solid phase and pore size distribution related to the space available for the retained water and to the water potential via dimensions of menisci in soil capillaries it is evident that wrc is related to soil grain size distribution arya and paris 1981 pande et al 2020 buczko and gerke 2005 since the soil is a randomly disordered granular body its pores are invariably irregular and have tortuous connections it holds even for the geometrically simplest porous media composed from identical spheres méheust et al 2002 moebius and or 2012 therefore modeling of soil water behavior in complicated pore structure has been a great challenge up to date most of the papers dealing with soil water retention modeling are based on analytical or semi analytical richards or van genuchten van genuchten 1980 equations relating moisture content to water pressure and or water flow hydraulic conductivity to water potential or water content soil water characteristics have been most frequently described in analytical form by so called pedotransfer functions using most available soil data like grain size distribution gsd organic matter content and bulk density e g mualem 1976 alvarez acostal et al 2012 despite all soil water properties are derivatives of geometry of soil pores which are determined by solid phase geometry these functions describe water storage phenomenologically not taking into account the microscopic mechanisms measurements of soil water retention can be performed using laboratory and field procedures the field measurements give probably the most realistic wrc s however due to the heterogeneity of soil profiles a need for installation of several tensiometers and soil sampling for moisture content determination long equilibration time weather changes relatively small range of measuring pressure and huge amount of work the field procedures are not practical bork and diekkrüger 1990 leij et al 1996 pachepsky et al 2001 in laboratory procedures an undisturbed soil core sampled into a metal cylinder is placed upon a porous membrane permeable for water but not for air and saturated with water different pressures are applied to remove water from the soil sample since the membrane has to be water saturated during the whole measuring procedure the maximum pressure difference across the membrane should not exceed its bubbling pressure brooks and corey 1964 at which the largest membrane pores are emptied two modes of laboratory wrc determination are the most common applying a vacuum to the lower side of the membrane the water content is measured by tension plate devices in which the atmospheric pressure pushes water out from the sample pores the theoretical upper limit of the applied pressures is 100 kpa and practically it is not higher than 70 kpa bork and diekkrüger 1990 the necessity of frequent weighing of the sample to determine the equilibrium water content at different water potentials brakes soil membrane connection at each measuring step this may seriously affect the measurements due to water redistribution in the sample pores having occasionally two or one air available surfaces the effect of the sample membrane disconnections is eliminated in pressure chamber method in which compressed air is used to displace water from the soil sample placed permanently upon a membrane or a ceramic plate also markedly higher pressures up to 1500 kpa can be achieved in this method the first aim of the present paper was to construct a model of soil medium composed from particles of various sizes into geometrically well defined porous structure in which individual pore dimensions and connections can be distinguished and to simulate the drainage of the obtained virtual structure the second aim of the paper was to check whether the simulated drainage pathways correspond to that of a real soil our main assumption was that if a virtual structure has the same gsd and porosity than the investigated soil some properties of both objects including water characteristics should be the same or close the measurements of soil drainage for various sample shapes and different initial soil air contact areas were performed using pressure chamber method that we consider to be more accurate than the pressure plate one 2 theory computer simulation of soil structure and its drainage the simulation consists of the following stages 1 mass based particle size distribution of the investigated soil is transferred to number based particle size distribution 2 construction of a particles network random 3d packing of particles having the above number based size distribution to reach the representative elementary volume radius and coordinates x y z of each particle are stocked in a file procedure 2 1 below 3 construction of pore network a pore is considered as a space between 4 contacting particles a tetrahedron with apexes located in the particles centers is created the pore void is approximated as a sphere adjacent to all particles and the pore necks as circles adjacent to 3 sections of particles on each tetrahedron wall volumes tetrahedron volume minus summary volume of 4 particles segments and radii all 4 necks for each pore of all pores in the particle network are determined determination of pore location each pore is assigned with a number expressing a quantity of the pores contiguous for all 4 pore sides if the number of a pore is 4 3 or 2 such pore is classified as active one which means that it is situated at the surface of the created structure procedure 2 2 below 4 drainage of created grain structure saturating the whole pore network with water choosing amount numbers of active pores which will be dried first applying continuously increasing suction from its minimum value determined by the largest neck of the active pore to the highest one determined by the smallest neck in the whole structure procedure 2 3 below 2 1 geometric model of particles arrangement into soil structural network following letey 1991 the soil structure can be defined as a configuration of its solid phase and understood as an arrangement of individual soil components into a network soil structure depends primarily on soil grain size distribution gsd reflecting frequencies of occurrence of particles of various sizes we simulated the soil microstructure by creating minimum space networks for a set of spherical particles of various gsd each particle was labeled with its own number the packing procedure started from a kernel composed from 5 self touching particles and it was enlarged adding particle by particle the packing procedure takes a random size particle of number n 1 and places it in contact with three already networked particles by solving a set of three equations 1 x i x n 1 2 y i y n 1 2 z i z n 1 2 r i r n 1 2 x j x n 1 2 y j y n 1 2 z j z n 1 2 r j r n 1 2 x k x n 1 2 y k y n 1 2 z k z n 1 2 r k r n 1 2 where i j k are sphere numbers n i is central particle number j i and k j x y and z are particle center spatial coordinates and r is the particle radius the space coordinates x n 1 y n 1 z n 1 of a particle of radius r n 1 are accepted when the new particle does not overlap any already networked one the packing procedure gradually surrounds the ith particle with new particles until any place adjacent to it exists and then the next particle starts joining the particle numbered i 1 fig 1 presents the simplest case of incorporation of a new particle n 1 to the network by touching 3 particles i j and k already present in the structure the above procedure is repeated until the structural porosity begins to be independent on the size of the network i e the representative elementary volume rev of an investigated soil body bear 1979 is reached 2 2 pore system of particles network inside the created virtual network a complicated porous system of micro channels and voids is formed to describe this system a single pore concept of mason 1972 was applied in which a single pore is formed between four particles the pore void is created as a sphere adjacent to all four particles as it is shown in fig 2 the parameters of such sphere can be determined by solving a set of four equations 2 x i 1 a j 2 y i 1 b j 2 z i 1 c j 2 r i 1 d j 2 x i 2 a j 2 y i 2 b j 2 z i 2 c j 2 r i 2 d j 2 x i 3 a j 2 y i 3 b j 2 z i 3 c j 2 r i 3 d j 2 x i 4 a j 2 y i 4 b j 2 z i 4 c j 2 r i 4 d j 2 where j is pore number and i i1 i2 i3 i4 is a number of the particle x y z are spatial coordinates of a center of i th particle a b c are spatial coordinates of a center of the pore sphere and r d are particle and pore void radii respectively the single pore is a part of a tetrahedron with apexes located in particle centers this pore is characterized by five parameters the pore volume tetrahedron volume minus total volume of the four particle segments in the tetrahedron and radii of the four pore necks at each tetrahedron wall the radius of the neck is the radius of the circle adjacent to all of three arcs cut off by the tetrahedron wall as shown in fig 2 the neck size r234 between particles i2 2 i2 3 i3 4 can be calculated from 3 x i 1 a k 2 y i 1 b k 2 r i 1 r 234 k 2 x i 2 a k 2 y i 2 b k 2 r i 2 r 234 k 2 x i 3 a k 2 y i 3 b k 2 r i 3 r 234 k 2 where k 1 4 and i m 1 4 for a given tetrahedron pore x y are planar coordinates of a particle center and a b are planar coordinates of a neck center the 3d delaunnay tessellation concept okabe et al 1992 allowed for the division of spaces onto a set of tetrahedrons containing pores thus describing the pore system of the simulated particle networks finding radii and centers of voids and necks this procedure is similar to triangulation where a plain area containing a given number of points is divided into a set of triangles that fill the area coherently 2 3 drainage of the virtual particle network from microscopic point of view soil drainage can be considered as a replacement of pore water by air that is possible when the drained pore is in direct or indirect contact with the outside atmosphere and the water pressure within the drained pore is lower than the drainage pressure water tension or air pressure in the proposed model we divided soil pores into three categories neutral air filled active filled with water and having a contact with the outside atmosphere or with a neutral pore across the active pore neck a meniscus is formed on which an absolute value of the capillary pressure reaches local maximum and the drainage of the active pore occurs when the outside pressure reaches the capillary pressure of the pore neck passive filled with water and surrounded by other water filled pores the passive pore can be drained if at least one of its neighboring pores is drained out and then the passive pore becomes active having parameterized all pores of a 3d network structure and knowing their connections numbers of neighboring pores it was possible to simulate the pore system drainage the simulation was based on the fact that the withdrawal of water from the saturated soil sample induced by a macroscopic pressure gradient starts at its upper surface because all active pores are initially located only on the top of the sample the largest pores are drained first the range of the pressures needed to drain the whole structure was determined by the largest rmax and the smallest rmin pore necks radii capillary pressure prc at a meniscus formed on a neck of any radius r was approximated by the laplace equation with zero water contact angle 4 pr c 2 σ w r where σw is water surface tension let us suppose that at the beginning of drainage all pores of the virtual network are water saturated this means that each active pore is located only on the outer surface of the porous structure the surface pores of the largest diameter neck are emptied first and remain active the active pore is cleared when the external pressure pr1 is greater than the meniscus pressure prc of the active neck if all other three necks of the just drained pore are smaller than the outlet one the drainage stops if at least one of them is equal or larger than the outlet one the drainage of the neighboring pore occurs if the above procedure is repeated with a gradual increase in pressure smaller and smaller necks are activated and pores of appropriate size are emptied the pressure increase pore suction is continued until all active pores are emptied it is worth emphasizing that such drainage procedure allows some large pores to retain water if they are surrounded by smaller neck pores hunt et al 2013 the sum of all tetrahedrons represents the total volume of the pore structure and the sum of the volumes of all individual pores gives the total pore volume furthermore having the amount of empty and water filled pores i e the water content of the pore system at different prc values the water retention curve can be easily constructed for the reason of simplicity the 2d analogue explaining the above procedure is shown in fig 3 the other results concern 3d structure the center of the circular particle locates at the common vertex of at least three triangles larger particles are surrounded by more adjacent particles and generally more pores are present around them in 2d each pore consists of three particles and has 3 necks see fig 2 the neck size is the difference between the particle center distance and the sum of the two particles radii fig 3 illustrates also the drainage of the same network at a stage where about half of all the pores were emptied black triangles and the other half remained filled with water white triangles some of the pores filled with water are still active and some are passive therefore regions surrounded only by passive pores remain filled with water at the applied pressure the presented approach to drainage means that a given active pore is completely emptied when the external pressure reaches the value associated with the active neck consequences of the above simplifications are analyzed in appendix a similarly a fluid retention was characterized in porous structures consisting of capillaries of varying cross section by wang et al 2013 the probability of occurrence of larger active pores is lower for smaller air contact area smaller sample diameter or smaller air available surface and the probability of occurrence of interconnected large pores decreases with the sample height thus one can expect that drainage of the same virtual structure should give different results for various amounts of initially active pores and for various initial sizes of the structure 3 materials glass bed a mixture of glass spheres river sand and three narrow size fractions sand 1 2 and 3 extracted from the river sand were used their particle size compositions are presented in table 1 two hungarian soils of different texture sandy haplic arenosol calcaric wrb and loamy calcic phaeozem siltic wrb formed from loess were used basic properties of these soils are presented in table 2 particle size categories of the soils were determined with the sedimentation method buzás 1993 4 methods to check whether the model reconstructs the native structure of real specimens the simulated networks were constructed for particles of size distributions coinciding with glass bed river sand and sands no 1 2 and 3 porosity of these structures were calculated and compared to experimentally determined porosities of the studied materials the experimental porosities were determined from bulk densities determined from 3 replicates of soil samples dried at 105 c for 24 h and densities of solid phase measured by helium pycnometry quantum crome ultrapycnometer 1000 to model the hypothesized effect of air contact area on wrc drainage of a virtual network constructed from particles of granulometric composition corresponding to the studied glass bed see table 1 was simulated for different number of initially active pores 3 332 and 3571 the wrc was simulated for n integer pressure values p i 1 p i pma x pmin n for i 1 2 n 1 water content for p1 was the entry value in the applied loop experimental water retention curve for the glass bed filled into kopetzky 5 cm diameter 5 cm height cylinder was measured as well to practically check the simulated effects of the sample air contact area on water retention experimental wrc s were determined for two samples of each studied soil placed in kopetzky cylinder the top of the first sample was open while the second one was closed with a plastic plug having a single air entry through a syringe needle of 0 5 mm radius the needle was deepened 10 mm below the soil specimen surface to avoid spreading of the entered air above the sample during the drainage process to practically check the postulated effect of sample dimensions on water retention we measured wrc s for the sandy soil using two open surface samples of different diameter height ratio 2 6 2 0 and 5 0 5 0 cm cm these samples are called later small and big respectively for all wrc measurements the soils were placed into the appropriate cylinders filled from the bottom upwards by distilled water to compact packing dried in a lab atmosphere and finally overnight at 105 c next the cylinders were again filled with water and placed in the pressure chamber on a 500 kpa air entry ceramic plate at a controlled temperature 20 3 c the amount of water replaced from the samples under increasing pressures from 0 to 150 kpa was measured volumetrically inside the chamber early simple analogues of swc 150 soil water characteristic cell www gcts com allowing for measurements of water outflow from the soil sample thus eliminating necessity of its frequent weighing and braking soil membrane connection were used for this purpose all measurements were made according to the standard procedure crescimano and iovino 1995 kool and parker 1987 in two replicates for each sample the data presented further are averages from these replicates 5 results and discussion all pores of virtual particle pore networks constructed from particles of psd corresponding to these of the studied granular materials were interconnected and the tetrahedrons filled the network volume coherently or almost coherently the representative network the representative elementary volume rev contained minimum 7000 mono sized particles and the particle number increased with broadening psd range about 27 000 particles for psd of loamy river sand the biggest created network contained 30 000 particles in all cases the simulated structures had near spherical shapes the bulk density of the loamy soil was equal to 1 1 g cm 3 1 07 1 12 and of the sandy soil 1 55 g cm 3 1 51 1 57 and their porosities were equal to 57 4 0 86 and 42 8 0 79 respectively it is necessary to mention that all samples of each soil had practically the same bulk densities in all experiments experimentally determined porosities of the sands and the glass bed and their simulated counterparts are presented in table 3 the differences between simulated and measured porosities were in all cases lower than 5 this may certify that simulated networks well reflected the natural structures of the studied objects water drainage curves simulated for the network corresponding to the glass bed gsd for a different number of initially active pores together with the experimental wrc are presented in fig 4 drying of the virtual network begins at a low pressure corresponding to the largest surface pore which is initially active generally when the amount of primary active pores is limited drying starts at higher pressure one can notice also that the pressure at which air starts to penetrate the pore network air bubbling pressure is probably not an absolute value and depends on soil sample geometry as well air bubbling pressure concerns a path composed of large pores going from the sample top to the bottom it is hypothesized that such a path is the random set of connected large pores in short height soil samples wider paths and smaller bubbling pressures are more likely than in long height samples from the other hand the bubbling pressure should be smaller for wider sample diameter because statistically broader active pores occur at the sample top and more possibilities exist to find a path composed of larger pores only in reality a part of lens and thin layer water remains in a pore even when its accessibility condition is fulfilled hunt et al 2013 while the applied model supposes complete drying it means that at the same pressures the real moisture content is higher than the simulated one the main conclusion drawn from the above simulations is that the moisture retention is not an absolute soil characteristic because it depends on the availability of pores that are able to be drained and thus on size and shape of the sample experimental water retention curves of sandy and loamy soil samples differing in air contact area having open and rubber covered surface are shown in figs 5 and 6 the measurements were markedly shorter for open surface sample 39 days in average than for rubber covered surface 93 days due to large differences in equilibration time the experiments confirmed our theoretical prediction that the measured soil moisture retention depends on the experimental setup for soil samples with limited air access water outflow started at higher pressure than for the open surface sample at higher pressures pf 2 water retention curves for both samples are much closer the proposed model supported by the above experimental data can extend an explanation of a water deficit in crusted soils heavy rain disintegrates the surface layer aggregates in clay and loamy soils after the rain stops a newly created dense packed top soil layer crust is formed from the finest particles due to positive grain sedimentation within the crust all water air contacts are practically limited to rare slits during further drainage more water remains below the crust what means that the soil surface is more saturated with water therefore there is less space for accumulation of water coming from a next rain and the excess of not retained water is either evaporated or run off from sloppy fields in fig 7 water retention curves of sandy soil samples of different volumes 10 6 and 100 cm3 and different diameter to height ratios 1 29 and 1 0 respectively are shown despite large differences in shapes and volumes rather small differences in water retention curves measured for both samples occurred a negligible influence of sample dimensions and shapes on wrc s was also observed experimentally in the pressure plate test for fine grained clays by wang et al 2015 for samples of the same height and various surface areas height to diameter ratio 1 as supposed previously drainage should start at a higher pressure for higher sample height and at a lower pressure for samples of higher surface area opposite to the above the drainage of big sample having higher height starts at slightly lower pressure than the drainage of the small sample smaller height however the big sample has significantly larger surface area than the small one and its drainage at lower pressure may be due to a prevalence of air contact area effects the height diameter ratio for big and small samples was not higher than 1 1 0 and 0 77 respectively similarly as in wang et al 2015 experiments possibly the sample height effects are more pronounced at higher height diameter ratios which seems interesting for further studies the sample studied in the laboratory should be representative for the investigated soil bear 1979 diekkrüger 1990 eggleston and peirce 1995 kutilek and nielsen 1994 it is commonly accepted that a soil sample inserted to a kopetzky cylinder of 5 cm diameter and 5 cm height 100 cm3 volume meets the above requirement however 60 400 cm3 samples are also used long time is needed to equilibrate water retention in large samples our results suggest that the experimental pf curve can be representative even for much smaller soil samples than these commonly used at present it supports the practice of leij et al 1996 who applied sample height limited to 2 3 cm and the volume of 30 40 cm3 to accelerate the equilibrium and make the measurements faster soil moisture retention curves are measured in laboratories in belief that they are equal to the field ones literature data are ambiguous in this respect bork and diekkrüger 1990 analyzed field and laboratory water retentions of 2500 soils showing that in all cases for a given water pressure the mean field wrc is lower than the lab one however our analysis of unsoda http www worldcat org title unsoda unsaturated soil hydraulic database where similar results are presented suggests that such relation is not a general rule among 81 pairs of water retention curves 42 pairs confirm this finding 19 pairs show opposite relation and in 20 cases the two curves more or less overlap it s worth noting that unsoda laboratory measurements were performed for different sample volumes varying from 60 to 400 cm3 and for different sample shapes diameter height ratios from 0 39 to 2 22 field moisture content was mainly measured with neutron probe which measures the average moisture content from a sphere of 20 25 cm in diameter the results presented in this paper suggest that equality of lab and field data is occasional and should not be a priori assumed however at the present state of the investigations it is difficult to say whether the predicted and observed differences between water retention curves are just certain curiosities or they indicate a methodological error of the actually applied measuring methods 6 conclusions drainage simulations of a virtual network composed from particles of various size distributions resulted in water retention depending on the area of the sample contact with the outer space air access and on the sample shape the first prediction was experimentally verified for sandy and loamy soils for which high differences between water retention curves measured for samples of the same bulk densities and different air access areas open and partially plugged surface high differences between water retention curves were observed below pf 2 for pf 2 both curves almost overlapped the model predicts that the drainage pressure increases with the sample height and decreases with its surface area diameter the experiments measured slightly lower drainage pressures for bigger specimens of higher height and larger surfaces the theoretically predicted differences may possibly be observed for specimens of greater height to diameter ratios this subject needs further

a pore drainage neglects a certain volume of water remaining in the pore as lenses iwata et al 1988 and as the thin film covering the solid phase globus 1966 both forms of water are present even if the absolute water pressure is greater than the pore neck laplace pressure the water pressure prl of the lens between two identical spheres can be expressed as a1 p r l α σ w 1 r 1 α 1 r 2 α where r1 and r2 are curvature radii of lens water and the angle α is defined by the extent of the lens as illustrated in fig a1 both radii depend on the water volume being quantified by the particle radius r and α iwata et al 1988 a2 r 1 α r sin α cos α 1 cos α a3 r 2 α r 1 cos α cos α volume vl of lens water between two equal spheres can be described as a4 v l α 2 π r 3 1 cos α 1 2 1 tan α π 2 α β 2 π where β is an angle between tetrahedron walls the a4 equation is an extension of the iwata et al 1988 equation with a coefficient β 2π describing a part of water lens inside the tetrahedron water pressure of a thin water layer at the particle surface prh is related to the van der waals interactions globus 1966 a5 pr h a h 3 where a is hamaker constant 10 20j and h is water layer thickness at the particle surface let us estimate the impact of lens and thin layer water on particle surfaces on the calculated moisture content of the virtual particle and pore medium for simplicity a regular tetrahedral pore composed of 4 equal spheres will be analyzed it was supposed that similar relationships occur in all tetrahedral pores but in this case a total volume of lenses and thin layers seems to be the higher than in tetrahedrons composed from particles of different radii volume of lens and of thin layer water will be calculated for regular tetrahedron which will allow for rough estimation of its impact on the moisture content of the virtual granular medium as a whole as the tetrahedron edge length is 2r its total volume vt can be calculated as a6 v t 2 2 3 r 3 solid phase inside a tetrahedron is composed of 4 identical spherical segments the segment volume vs can be calculated as a7 v s 1 3 ε r 3 where ε is spherical excess of the 3 angles of the spherical triangle total porosity of tetrahedron ptot is a8 p tot v t v s v t drainage of such pore starts when the outer suction becomes infinitesimally higher than the capillary pressure of a neck at any tetrahedron wall this pressure is quantified by a circle radius rn inscribed between three circles arcs at the tetrahedron wall see the neck in fig 2 a9 r n 2 3 3 r when the suction reaches the value prn determined by a10 pr n 2 σ w r n the pore becomes empty and only water lenses and thin layer water films for which water pressure is larger remain inside determination of water lenses and thin layer water volumes remaining in the pores will allow us to estimate the error of the assumption that no water remains in the pore muhammadi and meskini vishkaee 2012 2d representation of the lens and thin layer water is shown in fig a2 where air entered into the pore through neck d1 lens water locates between two neighboring particles and thin layer water film covers entire particle surfaces inside a triangular shaped pore to illustrate the extent of particular forms of water exemplary calculations for particles of radius r 0 1 mm were performed at equilibrium both pressures of water lens and thin film must be equal to the neck pressure a11 p r n p r l p r h value of αp corresponding to prn can be determined for lens water from eq a1 and thickness h of thin layer water from eq a5 consequently for all six lenses present in the tetrahedron the summary lens water volume can be calculated as a12 v l tot 6 v l since there are four spherical triangles in each tetrahedron their surface area st is a13 s t 4 ε r 2 where ε 0 551 for equilateral triangle the volume of thin water layer v h tot in tetrahedron is a14 v h tot s t h 4 ε h r 2 so the relative volume of lens water pl is a15 p l v l tot v t and relative volume of thin layer water ph is a16 p h s t h v t table a1 shows the respective calculations made for particle radius r 0 1 mm the main conclusion from the above considerations is that the volume of lens and thin layer water remaining in the pore after drying at the suction corresponding to a neck pressure prn constitutes 2 of tetrahedral volume or 7 5 total porosity and so the summary impact of lens and thin layer is negligible 0 01 this remaining part of water in the pore is drained step by step at higher pressures the above calculations give a rough estimation of the error of the presented simulation 
5366,the budyko framework was firstly developed to estimate actual evaporation as a function of precipitation and the aridity index at steady state conditions based on this framework the water storage change in the watershed is assumed to be negligible at large spatial and temporal scales however steady state conditions are not valid for many watersheds worldwide or at finer temporal or spatial scales accordingly the application of the budyko framework has become challenging for these situations therefore many researchers have tried to extend the budyko framework for non steady state conditions the aim of this study is to provide a review of the extended equations and to discuss using the budyko framework in a changing world while the extended equations are more complex than the original ones they still require little data thus the budyko framework either the original or the extended can be a very useful tool for hydrological modeling with lots of applications especially in data scarce regions keywords budyko aridity index hydrological modeling anthropogenic activities non steady state conditions 1 introduction estimating water balance components is an important part of hydrological modeling the relationship between mean annual precipitation actual and potential evaporation and runoff at watershed scale was explained by several physical empirical and statistical hydrological models budyko 1974 1958 fu 1981 gerrits et al 2009 mezentsev 1955 porporato et al 2004 yang et al 2008 hydrological models can be classified into lumped and distributed models where lumped models are often simpler in favor of less computation time in comparison to distributed models in spite of considerable progress in technology and computational power the calibration of fully distributed models with many parameters is still a challenging issue with the problems of equifinality beven 1996 1993 the budyko framework can be considered as a lumped model and is a quick first order estimate of precipitation partitioning into evaporation and runoff it is simple and has little input requirements compared to complex hydrological models such as the semi distributed swat arnold et al 1998 or the fully distributed model affdef moretti and montanari 2007 next to giving a first order estimate of evaporation gerrits et al 2009 tekleab et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 the budyko framework is also used for studying the sensitivity of runoff to changes in climate variables and characteristics of the catchments liu et al 2013 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 2001 sun et al 2014 yang et al 2014 investigating the impact of climate change on the hydrological response of catchments and long term water availability for water resources management donohue et al 2007 liu and yang 2010 mcvicar et al 2007 teng et al 2012 and separating the impact of natural climate change and direct human activities on the change in mean annual runoff jiang et al 2015 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and hejazi 2011 while the origins of the budyko framework are ranging back to the beginning of the 20th century ol dekop 1911 schreiber 1904 the framework was firstly developed by budyko 1958 who introduced a simple relationship between mean annual actual evaporation mean annual precipitation and aridity index at the watershed scale known as the budyko curve he assumed that mean annual evaporation is controlled by water availability approximated by precipitation and atmospheric demand represented by net radiation in very dry regions of the world with sufficient energy available for evaporation annual evaporation may approach annual precipitation water limitation on the contrary in very wet regions annual evaporation may approach atmospheric demand or potential evaporation energy limitation depending on the dryness of the region the available water or the available energy limits evaporation as expressed by the following equations budyko 1958 1 e p 1 w h e n r n p v e r y d r y c o n d i t i o n s 2 e r n w h e n r n p 0 v e r y w e t c o n d i t i o n s in which e p and r n are mean annual evaporation mean annual precipitation and net radiation the budyko framework is obtained based on the water and energy balance as described by arora 2002 3 d s d t p q e 4 r n ρ λ e h g where d s is the water storage change over time d t q is the catchment runoff λ is the latent heat of vaporization ρ is the density of water h is the sensible heat flux and g is the ground heat flux at mean annual scale the water storage change over time d s d t and net ground heat flux g is assumed to be negligible furthermore it is assumed that the sensible heat flux is positive dividing equation 4 by p the following equation is obtained 5 r n p ρ λ e p h p by considering r n ρ λ e p and b r h ρ λ e b r bowen ratio equation 5 can be rewritten as 6 e p p e p b r e p ϕ e p 1 b r the bowen ratio is a function of the aridity index ϕ e p p therefore by rearranging equation 6 the general budyko equation is obtained 7 e p ϕ 1 f ϕ f ϕ f e p p equation 7 is the so called budyko hypothesis which was first introduced by schreiber 1904 and written in this form by arora 2002 this equation indicates that the water balance is mainly controlled by the macro climate of the catchment however several researchers suggested that the water balance is also controlled by dynamic interactions between climate soil and vegetation characteristics donohue et al 2007 li et al 2013 milly 1994 padrón et al 2017 potter et al 2005 williams et al 2012 xu et al 2013 and hence some different curves were provided accordingly additionally the budyko framework was firstly developed for the steady state conditions in the catchments in these conditions the watershed must be natural closed and the only source of available water for evaporation is the local precipitation du et al 2016 furthermore the water storage change in the watershed is assumed to be negligible at large spatial and temporal scales however for many watersheds worldwide or at finer temporal or spatial scales the steady state conditions are not valid many previous studies showed that hydrological processes are underinfluenceof natural and anthropogenic changes frans et al 2013 istanbulluoglu et al 2012 li et al 2014 vogel et al 2011 zhang and schilling 2006 the human interference with nature such as urbanization groundwater withdrawal deforestation and land cover alteration caused significant changes in the natural hydrological cycle and water balance of most catchments worldwide for example transferring water from another basin through the inter basin water transfer projects bonacci and andri 2010 or applying water as irrigation for water requirement of the crops in dry regions gordon et al 2005 would increase water availability for evaporation such situations caused a new concept to be emerged in the context of hydrology socio hydrology sivapalan et al 2012 in which human activities are taking into account as a central part of hydrological modeling furthermore at finer temporal scales high variability of the water storage content becomes an important issue of the water balance in the budyko framework wang et al 2009 yokoo et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 therefore most watersheds are under non steady state conditions for which the application of the original budyko framework has become challenging as a consequence many researchers have tried to extend the budyko framework to be applicable for non steady state conditions an extensive review of the advances in hydrological modeling with the budyko framework has been provided by wang et al 2016 mainly for steady state conditions with little focus on non steady state conditions therefore in this paper we focus on the advances in the budyko framework for non steady state conditions however for better understanding the non steady state conditions we first provide a short history of the budyko curves for steady state conditions in section 2 both parametric and non parametric equations will be discussed and then the non steady state equations will be provided in section 3 in section 4 and section 5 we discuss the way in which the budyko framework may be matured and converted to a robust tool in prediction processes finally section 6 is dedicated to the conclusion 2 budyko framework under steady state conditions a short overview 2 1 non parametric equations schreiber 1904 developed the first budyko equation to model annual flow without any explicit knowledge about the physical base of the framework 8 q p exp k p where k is an empirical constant ol dekop 1911 rewrote schreiber s equation by replacing the empirical constant by long term average potential evaporation and proposed the following equation which is a function of the aridity andréassian et al 2016 9 e p 1 exp e p p 1 exp ϕ this equation shows that evaporation depends on the available water p and the potential evaporation e p afterward by analyzing the data in some catchments in russia ol dekop 1911 found that the evaporation ratio could be better described by a hyperbolic tangent function instead of an exponential one he suggested that the curve must have a slope of 45 for the tangent at the origin and the slope must then decrease until finally the curve turns parallel to the abscissa axis andréassian et al 2016 ol dekop 1911 then based on the data from several catchments he found that the hyperbolic tangent is the most suitable function and thus he provided the following equation 10 e p ϕ tanh 1 ϕ e p p t a n h p e p further based on empirical evidence budyko 1948 found that the data lay between the curves of schreiber 1904 and ol dekop 1911 and therefore he suggested a new equation which was the geometrically the mean of those two equations 11 e p e p p t a n h p e p 1 e x p e p p 0 5 based on more data budyko 1951 and budyko and zubenok 1961 found that the proposed curve was applicable for large basins at the long term mean annual time scale afterwards other researchers developed new equations in various forms within the budyko framework for example based on new data and considering the constraints of water and energy availability andreassian and sari 2019 turc 1954 empirically proposed the following equation 12 e p 1 0 9 1 ϕ 2 1 0 9 p e p 2 this equation was updated by pike 1964 who found that replacing 0 9 by 1 in equation 12 gave better results the new equation was named as turc pike equation the equations mentioned above equations 9 12 have a numerical behavior in a similar manner fig 1 arora 2002 2 2 parametric equations some researchers attempted to feed the equations by more physics and provide theoretical and physical support for the budyko framework a summary of these attempts is provided in table 1 accordingly fu 1981 developed a new analytical model based on phenomenological considerations with dimensional analysis and mathematical reasoning the new model is expressed as follows zhang et al 2004 13 e p 1 e p p 1 e p p ω 1 ω in this equation ω is the model parameter representing the catchment characteristics ω 1 by assuming that the potential evaporation rate is constant the arrival of precipitation events has a poisson distribution the events are instantaneous and that the storm depths are independent with an exponential distribution milly 1993 developed the following equation 14 e p exp α 1 p e p 1 exp α 1 p e p p e p with α the ratio of soil water holding capacity to the mean storm depth milly s work indicated that the storage capacity of the root zone has an important role in controlling evaporation later milly 1994 indicated that for a constant climate no seasonality evaporation is equal to the maximum of precipitation or potential evaporation it can be stated that when precipitation and potential evaporation are in phase out of phase the catchments plot closer to away from the asymptotes budyko and zubenok 1961 milly 1994 mentioned that other reasons for this deviation are the water holding capacity of the root zone infiltration capacity of the soil and the rate of water flow toward the plant roots he further proposed and tested a supply demand storage hypothesis in which the long term water balance is determined only by the interaction between local precipitation as supply and potential evaporation as demand mediated by soil water storage according to his proposed hypothesis the partitioning of mean annual precipitation into runoff and evaporation is under the influence of seven dimensionless variables choudhury 1999 attempted to assess if the non parametric empirical equations are independent of the spatial scale for this purpose he investigated the effects of spatial variations of precipitation and net radiation r n on evaporation using a generalized form of the empirical equation of pike 1964 choudhury 1999 added an adjustable parameter a which is related to the characteristics of soil topography and vegetation of the catchment xu et al 2014 and changes between spatial scales of micrometeorological measurements areas ca 1 km2 and large river basins areas ca 106 km2 15 e p 1 1 p r n a 1 a zhang et al 2001 found that plant available water coefficient w which is representative of the type of vegetation has an important role on partitioning precipitation into evaporation and runoff they proposed the following equation 16 e p 1 w e p p 1 w e p p e p p 1 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 used the abcd model and developed an expression for evaporation ratio e p according to a new soil moisture storage index γ this equation is fitted better to the observations than the budyko type equations schreiber ol dekop turc pike 17 e p 1 2 1 γ 1 r 1 2 γ 1 r γ 2 1 2 r r 2 0 5 in this equation γ b p b is the model parameter r e x p γ and e p p they mentioned that the abcd model contains a soil moisture accounting component and therefore equation 17 could incorporate the impact of soil moisture changes for the long term water balance of the catchment considering the effect of both frequency and depth of rainfall events on the soil water balance and incorporating the soil properties i e maximum soil water storage capacity w 0 porporato et al 2004 proposed the following model 18 e p 1 q q 1 e x p q γ q γ q q in which e p p q w 0 d and d is mean depth per storm event they found that for q 5 5 their model reproduces the budyko 1948 curve very well finally wang and tang 2014 developed a one parameter budyko type model for the mean annual time scale based on a generalization of the proportionality hypothesis of the soil conservation service scs model the new introduced parameter of their model ε is defined as the ratio of the initial evaporation ratio and horton index wang and tang 2014 the horton index is the ratio between evaporation and catchment wetting water available for evaporation horton 1933 troch et al 2009 and is relatively constant from year to year and is controlled by the vegetation properties troch et al 2009 voepel et al 2011 accordingly they provided the following equation 19 e p 1 e p p 1 e p p 2 4 ε 2 ε e p p 2 ε 2 ε despite the development of several budyko equations zhou et al 2015 believed that a simpler method to generate budyko functions was needed which meets the water and energy constraints thus they incorporated the complementary relationship they suggested that their complementary relationship could be applied for evaluating impacts of change in climate and or catchment characteristics on hydrological response of the catchment moreover their proposed function can be used to develop any number of valid budyko functions and or to test the validity of the existing functions it should be mentioned that in addition to the studies that developed a new model to take different physical factors such as vegetation soil moisture topography rainfall characteristics into account many other researchers tried to investigate the effect of these factors on the water balance of the catchments through the budyko framework donohue et al 2010 2007 dooge et al 1999 feng et al 2012 gerrits et al 2009 hickel and zhang 2006 mianabadi et al 2019 ning et al 2017 padrón et al 2017 potter et al 2005 3 budyko framework under non steady state conditions generally the budyko framework is quite an applicable method for estimating the water energy balance of both gauged and ungauged catchments but an important issue in its applicability is that it assumes the catchments are under hydrological steady state conditions which are controlled by macro climatic factors this assumption can lead to deviations from the observations when the budyko hypothesis is applied for finer spatial and temporal scales thus the budyko framework should be extended to have a more accurate estimation of evaporation and runoff at finer spatial and temporal scales in this section the budyko models developed for the non steady state conditions are presented han et al 2011 stated that irrigation can be a large proportion of the lateral water inputs which contributes to the water supply available for evaporation in their study basin the river water withdrawal is the main source of irrigation considering a study period with stable annual mean groundwater table depth han et al 2011 contributed irrigation i into the water balance of the basin and extended the fu equation as follows 20 e p i 1 e p p i 1 e p p i τ 1 τ in which τ 1 fu 1981 yang et al 2007 is the model parameter based on their results the extended budyko type model performed well for 26 subregions in the study basin for estimation of evaporation at mean annual and interannual scales wang 2012 mentioned that the extent to which the annual water balance is under the influence of water storage change is necessary to be examined by water storage data thus he studied the effect of water storage changes on the water balance at mean annual and interannual scales he considered the total water storage change of a watershed as the sum of soil moisture change δ s s m i groundwater change δ s g w i and surface water change δ s s w i as follows 21 δ s i δ s sm i δ s gw i δ s sw i he investigated the impact of water storage change on interannual water balance from 1982 to 2003 water years n 22 years his results showed that the ratio of the annual water storage change to the annual precipitation is larger than 10 during 40 of the years and larger than 5 during 70 of the years therefore he concluded that the interannual storage change cannot be neglected for his case study sites since the main land use in his study watersheds was agricultural land with the least human interferes the groundwater withdrawal was mainly used for irrigation therefore the total water supply under non steady state conditions included both precipitation and water storage change and it could be presented as effective precipitation p i δ s i thus the evaporation ratio and aridity index were calculated as e i p i δ s i and e pi p i δ s i respectively wang 2012 mentioned that groundwater storage has a more important impact on the annual water balance than the soil moisture storage during drought years chen et al 2013 examined the budyko hypothesis at the seasonal and monthly scales under non steady state conditions when water storage change was significant for this purpose they defined the monthly seasonal and annual aridity indices and evaporation ratio by defining effective rainfall as p k δ s k where k is the index for the given time scale i e monthly seasonal or annual with this definition they modified the turc pike equation to model seasonal evaporation and storage change and applied the model to 277 watersheds in the united states for 21 years 1983 2003 in dry months the depletion of water storage would be added to precipitation and the available water supply includes precipitation and water storage extraction in wet months rainfall infiltrates into the ground and replenishes the water storage and thus the available water supply is the subtraction of water storage from precipitation following wang 2012 chen et al 2013 defined the aridity index k as follows 22 k e pk p k δ s k in which e pk p k and δ s k are evaporation precipitation and water storage both soil water and groundwater change respectively for k time scale furthermore chen et al 2013 suggested that while the lower limit of the seasonal aridity index in the budyko framework is zero it may be positive or even higher than 1 during dry seasons for a given watershed considering the lower bound of the seasonal aridity index for a given watershed and the differentiation between dry and wet seasons they extended the budyko type model for the estimation of seasonal evaporation ratio for wet and dry seasons as follows 23 e w p w δ s w 1 e pw p w δ s w φ w v w 1 v w 24 e d p d δ s d 1 e pd p d δ s d φ d v d 1 v d in these equations v w and v d are the turc pike parameters for wet and dry seasons respectively and φ w and φ d are the corresponding lower bounds of aridity indices in wet and dry seasons respectively their results for 277 watersheds in the united states showed that in wet dry seasons 99 90 of watersheds had nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients larger than 0 5 chen et al 2013 showed that in many cases in their study watersheds the evaporation ratio is higher than 1 when precipitation is considered as the only source of water supply they mentioned that the uncertainty of evaporation might be a reason for that but it does not fully explain that behavior in extremely dry years therefore they concluded that in addition to precipitation storage change also should be considered in the available water supply the role of water storage in maintaining evaporation is significant especially for extremely dry years with aridity index higher than 1 their results showed that by accurately describing the water and energy supply the budyko hypothesis could be applied at the interannual scale greve et al 2016 used the formulation introduced by fu 1981 and zhang et al 2004 and derived a new two parameter equation for the non steady state conditions as mentioned earlier fu s equation is subject to two constraints water limit and energy limit lines these two limits show that evaporation is limited by precipitation and potential evaporation greve et al 2016 mentioned that in addition to water storage change additional water can be available due to human interventions milly et al 2008 landscape changes jaramillo and destouni 2016 water phase changes berghuijs et al 2014 jaramillo and destouni 2016 or long term soil moisture changes due to transient climate change orlowsky and seneviratne 2013 wang 2005 while zhang et al 2008 han et al 2011 wang 2012 and chen et al 2013 investigated the limitation of the budyko framework and extended the budyko hypothesis for the conditions when evaporation exceeds precipitation greve et al 2016 modified the fu equation analytically using basic phenomenological assumptions as made by zhang et al 2004 and provided the following equation 25 e p f k y 0 1 1 1 y 0 k 1 k 1 k in this equation k like ω is the parameter representing the watershed characteristics the new parameter y 0 represents the new boundary condition and has a physical interpretation related to the additional water supply for evaporation if k 2 6 and y 0 0 the greve equation corresponds to the budyko 1948 curve greve et al 2016 used their equation globally at monthly time scale and showed that the evaporation ratio estimated by the new model has a good correlation with the observed evaporation ratio although some previous studies incorporated the water storage effects into the budyko framework wang and zhou 2016 claimed that the role of groundwater dependent evaporation was not yet evaluated both soil water and groundwater changes may be the cause of evaporation ratio higher than one wang 2012 reported that during drought year 1988 the evaporation ratio was about 1 1 in two watersheds in illinois united states in which about 100 mm soil water and about 200 mm of groundwater storage was depleted it showed that the contribution of groundwater was more significant than soil storage as mentioned by chen and hu 2004 the effect of groundwater on surface evaporation depends on the groundwater table depth a groundwater table near the surface has a significant effect on evaporation therefore shallow groundwater would increase the occurrence of the cases with an evaporation ratio higher than 1 chen et al 2020 wang and zhou 2016 therefore wang and zhou 2016 developed a method to incorporate the groundwater dependent evaporation into the annual water balance in the standard budyko framework for analyzing the method they modified the abcd model thomas 1981 and then the modified model was applied in the study catchments to estimate the actual evaporation using the estimated evaporation by the modified abcd model the interannual water balance for the period of 1957 2010 in the standard and modified budyko framework was analyzed their study area was located in the erdos plateau in northern central china in the middle part of the yellow river basin with a semiarid to arid climate wang and zhou 2016 plotted the annual p q p versus the aridity index for the average of six catchments during 1957 1978 and concluded that the long term water balance of the catchments follows the original budyko framework under steady state conditions in contrast their results for some individual catchments showed that the annual p q p versus the aridity index had a negative relation and did not follow the budyko framework for some other catchments the relation was positive but still did not follow the original budyko framework such an abnormal relation was also highlighted by istanbulluoglu et al 2012 in the north loup river basin nebraska usa istanbulluoglu et al 2012 concluded that it occurred by ignoring the water storage change in the catchment therefore they replaced the p q p with p q δ s gw p δ s gw the interannual groundwater storage change and found that the equation followed the zhang et al 2001 s curve for their study catchment however they did not take the groundwater dependent evaporation into account wang and zhou 2016 mentioned that there is no long term groundwater level monitoring data in their study catchments furthermore the p q δ s gw p approach causes the interannual soil moisture storage change to be ignored therefore they estimated the storage change from the monthly baseflow data using the modified abcd model to analyze their method they divided the study catchments into two zones zone 1 with deep groundwater and zone 2 with shallow groundwater in zone 1 the evaporation ratio was smaller than 1 below the water limit line for the whole range of the aridity indices while in zone 2 the relation between the evaporation ratio and aridity index did not follow the original budyko framework and the evaporation ratio was higher than 1 they concluded that the groundwater dependent evaporation was the reason for this behavior generally they proposed that the evaporation ratio for the whole catchment can be estimated as follows 26 e p 1 r 1 1 π 1 π r g g a where r is the ratio of the zone 2 area to the whole catchment area is aridity index π is the parameter representing the catchment characteristics g is the parameter controlling the intensity of groundwater dependent evaporation and g a is the annual groundwater storage wang and zhou 2016 mentioned that the water supply in the original budyko framework e g precipitation for the steady state conditions is not dependent on both evaporation and runoff and thus the aridity index is an independent variable however effective precipitation p δ s as defined by wang 2012 and chen et al 2013 is under the influence of the feedback mechanism between evaporation and runoff the interdependency between water supply and evaporation limits the application of the modified budyko framework in assessing the shift in annual water balance therefore they suggested that the extended formula for annual water balance in the standard budyko framework such as their proposed equation equation 26 is a more efficient and straightforward approach and can keep the aridity index as an independent index for the climatic conditions du et al 2016 mentioned that in addition to groundwater and soil water storage the water transfer from other basins in unclosed basins is another important source of water that is available for evaporation considering this issue they investigated the applicability of the budyko hypothesis for the heihe river basin in china at the non steady state conditions and then they improved the original budyko framework based on the basins water balance 27 e p e 1 e p p e 1 e p p e μ c 1 μ where μ and c are two dimensionless fitting parameters μ 1 fu 1981 yang et al 2007 is a well known parameter representing the watershed characteristics p e is equivalent precipitation which includes the channel inflow coming from the upper basin and or inter basin water transfer q in and the soil moisture root zone water change δ s sm p e p q in δ s sm they did not include the groundwater storage change in their model since they believed that it is the result of the groundwater baseflow exchange and therefore does not have direct interaction with evaporation to test the new budyko type curve du et al 2016 used the abcd model thomas 1981 to obtain the required data e g soil water storage and actual evaporation at the monthly scale their results showed that due to the impact of water transfer and soil water storage change the original budyko framework is not applicable for their study basin furthermore they found that at the annual time scale their new equation performed more or less similar to fu s equation at the monthly scale their proposed model performed better than the original fu equation for the defined evaporation ratios less than 1 e p e 1 and performed the same for evaporation ratios close to 1 e p e 1 they suggested that their new equation could be applied for water balance interpretations over extremely dry regions with non steady state conditions considering water storage changes in the watershed moussa and lhomme 2016 proposed a new physically based formulation by introducing the parameter of h e δ s e p which represents the variable δ s in a dimensionless form their equation can be applied under non steady state conditions at any time scale with various budyko functions using the fu zhang equation the new formulation was similar to the equation of greve et al 2016 for δ s 0 in the standard budyko space e p e p p moreover they extended the new formulation in the space of e p δ s e p p δ s comparing the new equation to the formulations of chen et al 2013 and du et al 2016 they found that the upper limit of all formulations was similar while the lower limit was different they presented their formulation in both budyko e p p e p and turc 1 p e p e e p space as defined by andréassian et al 2016 in this paper only the formulation in the budyko space is presented 28 e p b 1 1 h e h e f o r δ s 0 29 e p 1 h e b 1 1 h e f o r δ s 0 in these equations b 1 is representative of any budyko function equations 28 and 29 are presented for the standard budyko space in the extended space e p δ s e p p δ s the equations are defined as follows 30 e p δ s 1 1 h e b 1 1 h e h e f o r δ s 0 31 e p δ s 1 1 h e 1 h e b 1 1 h e f o r δ s 0 equation 31 can be written as e p δ s b 1 b 1 e p p δ s therefore moussa and lhomme 2016 mentioned that for δ s 0 e p δ s is independent of h e and is similar to the steady state conditions it should be mentioned that instead of h e another dimensionless parameter h p δ s p can be included in the new formulation of moussa and lhomme 2016 yielding another form of the equations tang et al 2017 extended the one parameter equation developed by wang and tang 2014 to reconstruct annual terrestrial water storage change δ s and groundwater storage change δ s gw in the large scale irrigated region in punjab pakistan following the method of chen et al 2013 the new 2 parameter model was developed as follows 32 e p e 1 e p p e φ 1 e p p e φ 2 4 2 e p p e φ 2 2 in which p e is defined as p δ s φ is the lower bound of the annual aridity index and is the model parameter interpreted as the ratio between initial evaporation and total evaporation tang et al 2017 concluded that their new proposed budyko type equation integrated with grace data would result in a useful method for assessing the long term groundwater storage change in the regions with large scale irrigation despite developing the new budyko equations condon and maxwell 2017 suggested that the ability to estimate or measure groundwater storage changes is limited and therefore the implication of the modified budyko approaches should be more evaluated for this purpose they investigated the effect of storage change on the budyko hypothesis using the evaporation ratio estimated by three common approaches 1 direct evaporation quantified from field observations divided by precipitation e p 2 evaporation calculated from precipitation and surface runoff divided by precipitation p q p and 3 direct evaporation divided by effective precipitation by taking groundwater contribution g into account e p g when groundwater surface water exchanges are occurring their results for 25 000 nested watersheds 100 3 000 000 km2 showed that the groundwater storage would shift the budyko curve depending on the approach to estimate the evaporation ratio as expected for the first approach e p some points fell above the water limit line with evaporation ratios higher than 1 this is explained by the fact that in these conditions the partitioning occurs between evaporation and runoff plus groundwater storage change instead of precipitation and runoff only their results also showed that in the case with g 0 i e storage change negligible the three approaches were equivalent a comparison among the developed models at non steady state conditions is provided in table 2 as shown in the table most of the studies are developed for arid and semi arid regions where precipitation is not enough for meeting the water demand of the watersheds and thus water is provided through groundwater depletion or inter basin transfer which increases the available water of the watersheds leading to a deviation from the original budyko framework 4 on the value of the budyko framework for future hydrological studies although several attempts to apply the budyko framework under non steady state conditions resulted in more complexity in the framework its simplicity and accuracy are still enough to be widely applied the framework is nowadays still highly valuable maybe not for studying the process of evaporation in detail therefore the framework is too simplistic but it can serve purposes like 4 1 validation of remote sensing data the budyko framework can be used for validation of remote sensing data of precipitation and evaporation as done by koppa and gebremichael 2017 they used fu s equation and showed that in comparison to the complex distributed hydrological models the simple budyko curves can be applied effectively for validation of observational data 4 2 down sampling of remote sensing data rouholahnejad freund and kirchner 2017 applied the budyko curves to derive a simple sub grid closure relation that estimates how spatial heterogeneity and lateral moisture redistribution affect average evaporation as seen from the atmosphere they mentioned that they used the budyko curve as a simple model to find how the supply of available water and evaporative demand control evaporation they believed that the budyko framework can be applied instead of complex ecohydrological models which obey the same energy and water constraints and their behavior is not greatly different from the budyko curves the budyko curves estimate evaporation as a function of its main drivers e g precipitation and potential evaporation allowing a general analytical derivation which might be difficultly derived from the complex models however their finding could be compared by further analysis through physically distributed models with high resolution data 4 3 constraining hydrological models evaporation estimates obtained from the budyko framework may constrain the parameter search space significantly for example besides two daily and eight daily remote sensing products lsa saf and mod16 nijzink et al 2018 applied the analytical budyko framework to obtain a long term estimate of evaporation as the constraint of five rainfall runoff models their results showed that the budyko framework was helpful with strong improvements in model calibration and performance 4 4 quantification of the relative impacts of climate variability and direct human activities on mean annual runoff in continuationoffu s equation application mo et al 2018 found that the effect of human activities on decline in mean annual runoff is more considerable than climate change in the bahe river in china 4 5 identifying the main source of uncertainty in a complex hydrological model using budyko coefficients malago et al 2018 stated that when the simulated data derived from swat are too far from the budyko curves in wet conditions it could be related to the uncertainties of the model parameterization this research tried to use the budyko curve as a criterion for model calibration so that significant departure from the curve is interpreted as high potential inconsistency of model parameterization 4 6 determining the crop coefficient one of the works in applying budyko curves for its simplicity is the work done by zhang et al 2017 who determined the crop coefficient under non standard conditions by integrating the budyko framework under both steady state and non steady state conditions into the traditional crop coefficient approach to assess the volume of the agricultural virtual water content by minimum data they showed that despite using less data their model calculated virtual water content in a good agreement with some previous research studies while the above mentioned studies show that the original budyko framework performs reasonably well for their given aims they suggested that the framework is still limited for some cases and the extended framework can be used for dealing with these limitations for example koppa and gebremichael 2017 mentioned that fu s equation is limited to consider the catchment storage at long term temporal scale therefore the developed error metric characterizes the bias in precipitation and evaporation datasets and not the variance thus they suggested using the extended budyko curves under non steady state conditions for example the equation of greve et al 2016 to validate remotely sensed precipitation and evaporation at monthly and daily time scales or at the catchments with considerable long term water storage changes moreover mo et al 2018 suggested that more details on runoff change could be revealed using the extended budyko curves at inter and intra annual scales e g non steady state conditions malago et al 2018 also noted that in their study the points above the water limit line can indicate the non steady state conditions in the catchments rather than the uncertainties and therefore the extended budyko curves should be considered accordingly in spite of being more complex than the original framework using the extended budyko framework under non steady state conditions for different purposes of hydrological modeling would lead to more accurate and reliable results it is a great advance in hydrological modeling because most of the watersheds worldwide are nowadays under the influence of human interventions and are not steady and natural any longer such situations mostly occur in developing countries with insufficient data availability which limits using complex hydrological models the contribution of runoff and evaporation into the water balance of each catchment is influenced by human activities and it changes the water cycle of the catchments leading to the need for a deeper understanding of the human water system interactions moreover model calibration as the most important part of the hydrological modeling should consider the interactions between human and water systems therefore traditional calibration makes the results less reliable to take into account the role of human activities in hydrological modeling the budyko framework at non steady state conditions would be a very functional approach which can efficiently model and assess water balance components especially at large scale modeling for example recently lei et al 2018 presented a new type budyko model which is potentially a generalized constraint in water resources system models simplifying the structure of the current hydrological models to develop new models for the non steady state conditions these new models can be applied for the prediction of future human interventions in the water balance of the catchments especially for large scale spatial and temporal modeling according to these studies the extended budyko framework is an efficient alternative that can be used instead of the original budyko framework and complex hydrological models however this requires more reliable data such as irrigation and available soil water additionally a novel issue that may take advantage of the budyko framework is the design of an efficient water resources planning strategy with improvement in runoff estimation as inflow to dam reservoirs especially in arid regions with high complexity in groundwater modeling this may be proposed as future contributions in hydrology and water resources context moreover the budyko framework can be used in hydrological modeling for partitioning total evaporation into interception soil evaporation and transpiration e g gerrits et al 2009 mianabadi et al 2019 or for evaluation of evaporation fluxes estimated by the new proposed hydrological or land surface models for example while good et al 2017 by using field studies and remotely sensed estimates found that the ratio of transpiration to precipitation has a unimodal distribution their finding was also identified by porporato et al 2004 s model equation 18 within the budyko framework furthermore they applied the porporato s model to partition actual evaporation into interception ground surface evaporation and transpiration relative to precipitation however they mentioned the appropriate application of the budyko framework for the steady state conditions thus future studies can focus on the way of applying the budyko framework for partitioning evaporation at non steady state conditions 5 perspectives of the budyko framework generally in spite of some limitations of the budyko framework it is expected that the natural and anthropogenic changes such as climate change land use alteration and inter basin water transfer can increase the contribution of the budyko framework in hydrological modeling thus attempts for applying the framework in a changing world with an increasing role of human activities in the hydrological cycle of catchments might be helpful for hydrological studies in the future however it is not completely clear how the budyko framework can contribute herein especially under non steady state conditions for example the relationship between land cover change and evaporation in the future with considering the climate change effects has important impacts on catchment hydrology and might be potentially investigated by the budyko framework as it is slightly discussed by ning et al 2020 at steady state conditions response to the question on how such issues could be investigated under non steady state conditions needs efficient solutions with considering the extended budyko equations for this purpose taking advantage of the time series technique fathi et al 2019 and modification of the line integral based method zheng 2019 can be suggested for non steady state conditions it may need meta research or meta analysis of the previous researches to predict the future of hydrological modeling based on the budyko framework meanwhile there are still some other important unsolved questions involved with the budyko framework one question is how the relationship between model parameters and catchment properties would change at non steady state conditions for example while the greve s model greve et al 2016 has been analytically derived from the fu equation fu 1981 their parameters are differently related to the catchment properties at steady and non steady state conditions moreover due to human interference the water systems have become more complex with increasing interaction and co evolution of the different processes affecting the water balance accordingly the budyko framework might be widely used to capture the overall behaviour of the catchment zhang et al 2008 it is believed that the vegetation landscape co evolution can help a given watershed not to deviate from the budyko framework if it encounters with any possible climatic changes however the results showed that climate change can change the budyko curve van der velde et al 2014 through changing the interaction and co evolution between climate and catchment properties wang et al 2016 thus another question is how the extended budyko framework can help with this issue one issue that can also be considered is that more attempts have to be conducted for improving the budyko framework at smaller spatial scale with diversity controlling factors e g bai et al 2020 therefore calibration of major important factors through the intelligence search method in future studies can be more conducted on the application of the budyko hypothesis for smaller catchments and even for hydrological response units hrus in a catchment however one important question is how the interactions among the key processes affecting the catchment response would be changing at smaller temporal spatial scales last but not the least question might be the role of virtual water the amount of water needed to produce commodities which is then transported to other places for consumptions chapagain et al 2006 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 in hydrological modeling as sivapalan et al 2012 suggested that socio hydrology might address the virtual water trade the question might be that if it is possible to apply the holistic view of the budyko framework to help the experts of the socio hydrology to deal with this challenge 6 conclusion the budyko framework is a useful and more convenient tool which in some cases can be used instead of distributed hydrological models which are complex and time consuming with lots of data requirements and large uncertainties in the input data model structure and parameterization since it is firstly developed for spatially large scale catchment with low complexity of real world processes this may be known as the most important limitation of the budyko approach but it is still an effective tool for assessing the impacts of climate factors and catchment properties on the water energy balance and the interaction among them therefore the co evolution of the hydrological processes makes it possible to use the simple budyko framework to identify the overall behavior of the catchments on the whole in some ungauged catchments especially in developing countries the data is not sufficiently provided or if provided is inaccurate or publicly restricted to be used as input for the complex models and this can lead to large uncertainty in the models results in spite of simplicity the budyko framework can lead us to identify if our results are reasonable even if the extended budyko curves are not directly applicable for catchments with insufficient data the original budyko framework can help the researcher to determine that abnormal behavior of the catchments is arising from the catchments characteristics or from the uncertainty of the data for example when a data point is located above the water limit line it shows that either the input data are uncertain or the catchment is under non steady state conditions such a finding cannot be obtained by complex hydrological models on the other hand in a changing world with human interferes in the hydrological cycle of the water systems e g groundwater withdrawal and or inter basin water transfer some watersheds are under non steady state conditions and the water balance of the watersheds does not follow the original budyko framework any longer furthermore since the original budyko framework was developed for long term temporal and large spatial scales its application at finer scales where the water storage change is an important component of the water balance is challenging in such situations the extended budyko curves have to be used these extended budyko equations can enhance our understanding of the overall behavior of ecohydrological processes which are valuable for practical applications while the extended equations are more complex than the original ones they still are simpler with less data requirements than the complex distributed models in developing countries in which the hydrological cycle of the catchments is considerably under the influence of anthropogenic activities the application of the original budyko framework is limited moreover in these countries applying complex models is also limited due to unavailable or insufficient data therefore the extended budyko equations are useful tools for the estimation of evaporation in these regions despite all the advantages provided by the budyko framework it is likely still too simple to represent the full complexity of real world processes and thus might be subject to over interpretations leading to flawed and false conclusions several studies showed that using budyko equations especially the parametric equations resulted in inconclusive and sometimes potentially contradicting outcomes padrón et al 2017 zhou et al 2015a b nonetheless extending the budyko framework at both temporal and spatial scales might be helpful for some watershed with less complexity for evaluating the complex models or for the situations in which very accurate estimations are not needed accordingly the next generation of the hydrological modeling may need to go toward applying the budyko framework to estimate the hydrological components at steady and non steady state conditions in a changing world however some questions within the budyko framework remain unsolved like the interactions among the key processes affecting the catchment response at different temporal spatial time scales the relationship between land cover change and evaporation in the future the relationship between models parameters and catchment properties at non steady state conditions using extended budyko framework to capture the overall behaviour of the catchment considering the co evolution of the processes and the role of virtual water in hydrological modeling these questions might be further investigated in the future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

5366,the budyko framework was firstly developed to estimate actual evaporation as a function of precipitation and the aridity index at steady state conditions based on this framework the water storage change in the watershed is assumed to be negligible at large spatial and temporal scales however steady state conditions are not valid for many watersheds worldwide or at finer temporal or spatial scales accordingly the application of the budyko framework has become challenging for these situations therefore many researchers have tried to extend the budyko framework for non steady state conditions the aim of this study is to provide a review of the extended equations and to discuss using the budyko framework in a changing world while the extended equations are more complex than the original ones they still require little data thus the budyko framework either the original or the extended can be a very useful tool for hydrological modeling with lots of applications especially in data scarce regions keywords budyko aridity index hydrological modeling anthropogenic activities non steady state conditions 1 introduction estimating water balance components is an important part of hydrological modeling the relationship between mean annual precipitation actual and potential evaporation and runoff at watershed scale was explained by several physical empirical and statistical hydrological models budyko 1974 1958 fu 1981 gerrits et al 2009 mezentsev 1955 porporato et al 2004 yang et al 2008 hydrological models can be classified into lumped and distributed models where lumped models are often simpler in favor of less computation time in comparison to distributed models in spite of considerable progress in technology and computational power the calibration of fully distributed models with many parameters is still a challenging issue with the problems of equifinality beven 1996 1993 the budyko framework can be considered as a lumped model and is a quick first order estimate of precipitation partitioning into evaporation and runoff it is simple and has little input requirements compared to complex hydrological models such as the semi distributed swat arnold et al 1998 or the fully distributed model affdef moretti and montanari 2007 next to giving a first order estimate of evaporation gerrits et al 2009 tekleab et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 the budyko framework is also used for studying the sensitivity of runoff to changes in climate variables and characteristics of the catchments liu et al 2013 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 2001 sun et al 2014 yang et al 2014 investigating the impact of climate change on the hydrological response of catchments and long term water availability for water resources management donohue et al 2007 liu and yang 2010 mcvicar et al 2007 teng et al 2012 and separating the impact of natural climate change and direct human activities on the change in mean annual runoff jiang et al 2015 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and hejazi 2011 while the origins of the budyko framework are ranging back to the beginning of the 20th century ol dekop 1911 schreiber 1904 the framework was firstly developed by budyko 1958 who introduced a simple relationship between mean annual actual evaporation mean annual precipitation and aridity index at the watershed scale known as the budyko curve he assumed that mean annual evaporation is controlled by water availability approximated by precipitation and atmospheric demand represented by net radiation in very dry regions of the world with sufficient energy available for evaporation annual evaporation may approach annual precipitation water limitation on the contrary in very wet regions annual evaporation may approach atmospheric demand or potential evaporation energy limitation depending on the dryness of the region the available water or the available energy limits evaporation as expressed by the following equations budyko 1958 1 e p 1 w h e n r n p v e r y d r y c o n d i t i o n s 2 e r n w h e n r n p 0 v e r y w e t c o n d i t i o n s in which e p and r n are mean annual evaporation mean annual precipitation and net radiation the budyko framework is obtained based on the water and energy balance as described by arora 2002 3 d s d t p q e 4 r n ρ λ e h g where d s is the water storage change over time d t q is the catchment runoff λ is the latent heat of vaporization ρ is the density of water h is the sensible heat flux and g is the ground heat flux at mean annual scale the water storage change over time d s d t and net ground heat flux g is assumed to be negligible furthermore it is assumed that the sensible heat flux is positive dividing equation 4 by p the following equation is obtained 5 r n p ρ λ e p h p by considering r n ρ λ e p and b r h ρ λ e b r bowen ratio equation 5 can be rewritten as 6 e p p e p b r e p ϕ e p 1 b r the bowen ratio is a function of the aridity index ϕ e p p therefore by rearranging equation 6 the general budyko equation is obtained 7 e p ϕ 1 f ϕ f ϕ f e p p equation 7 is the so called budyko hypothesis which was first introduced by schreiber 1904 and written in this form by arora 2002 this equation indicates that the water balance is mainly controlled by the macro climate of the catchment however several researchers suggested that the water balance is also controlled by dynamic interactions between climate soil and vegetation characteristics donohue et al 2007 li et al 2013 milly 1994 padrón et al 2017 potter et al 2005 williams et al 2012 xu et al 2013 and hence some different curves were provided accordingly additionally the budyko framework was firstly developed for the steady state conditions in the catchments in these conditions the watershed must be natural closed and the only source of available water for evaporation is the local precipitation du et al 2016 furthermore the water storage change in the watershed is assumed to be negligible at large spatial and temporal scales however for many watersheds worldwide or at finer temporal or spatial scales the steady state conditions are not valid many previous studies showed that hydrological processes are underinfluenceof natural and anthropogenic changes frans et al 2013 istanbulluoglu et al 2012 li et al 2014 vogel et al 2011 zhang and schilling 2006 the human interference with nature such as urbanization groundwater withdrawal deforestation and land cover alteration caused significant changes in the natural hydrological cycle and water balance of most catchments worldwide for example transferring water from another basin through the inter basin water transfer projects bonacci and andri 2010 or applying water as irrigation for water requirement of the crops in dry regions gordon et al 2005 would increase water availability for evaporation such situations caused a new concept to be emerged in the context of hydrology socio hydrology sivapalan et al 2012 in which human activities are taking into account as a central part of hydrological modeling furthermore at finer temporal scales high variability of the water storage content becomes an important issue of the water balance in the budyko framework wang et al 2009 yokoo et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 therefore most watersheds are under non steady state conditions for which the application of the original budyko framework has become challenging as a consequence many researchers have tried to extend the budyko framework to be applicable for non steady state conditions an extensive review of the advances in hydrological modeling with the budyko framework has been provided by wang et al 2016 mainly for steady state conditions with little focus on non steady state conditions therefore in this paper we focus on the advances in the budyko framework for non steady state conditions however for better understanding the non steady state conditions we first provide a short history of the budyko curves for steady state conditions in section 2 both parametric and non parametric equations will be discussed and then the non steady state equations will be provided in section 3 in section 4 and section 5 we discuss the way in which the budyko framework may be matured and converted to a robust tool in prediction processes finally section 6 is dedicated to the conclusion 2 budyko framework under steady state conditions a short overview 2 1 non parametric equations schreiber 1904 developed the first budyko equation to model annual flow without any explicit knowledge about the physical base of the framework 8 q p exp k p where k is an empirical constant ol dekop 1911 rewrote schreiber s equation by replacing the empirical constant by long term average potential evaporation and proposed the following equation which is a function of the aridity andréassian et al 2016 9 e p 1 exp e p p 1 exp ϕ this equation shows that evaporation depends on the available water p and the potential evaporation e p afterward by analyzing the data in some catchments in russia ol dekop 1911 found that the evaporation ratio could be better described by a hyperbolic tangent function instead of an exponential one he suggested that the curve must have a slope of 45 for the tangent at the origin and the slope must then decrease until finally the curve turns parallel to the abscissa axis andréassian et al 2016 ol dekop 1911 then based on the data from several catchments he found that the hyperbolic tangent is the most suitable function and thus he provided the following equation 10 e p ϕ tanh 1 ϕ e p p t a n h p e p further based on empirical evidence budyko 1948 found that the data lay between the curves of schreiber 1904 and ol dekop 1911 and therefore he suggested a new equation which was the geometrically the mean of those two equations 11 e p e p p t a n h p e p 1 e x p e p p 0 5 based on more data budyko 1951 and budyko and zubenok 1961 found that the proposed curve was applicable for large basins at the long term mean annual time scale afterwards other researchers developed new equations in various forms within the budyko framework for example based on new data and considering the constraints of water and energy availability andreassian and sari 2019 turc 1954 empirically proposed the following equation 12 e p 1 0 9 1 ϕ 2 1 0 9 p e p 2 this equation was updated by pike 1964 who found that replacing 0 9 by 1 in equation 12 gave better results the new equation was named as turc pike equation the equations mentioned above equations 9 12 have a numerical behavior in a similar manner fig 1 arora 2002 2 2 parametric equations some researchers attempted to feed the equations by more physics and provide theoretical and physical support for the budyko framework a summary of these attempts is provided in table 1 accordingly fu 1981 developed a new analytical model based on phenomenological considerations with dimensional analysis and mathematical reasoning the new model is expressed as follows zhang et al 2004 13 e p 1 e p p 1 e p p ω 1 ω in this equation ω is the model parameter representing the catchment characteristics ω 1 by assuming that the potential evaporation rate is constant the arrival of precipitation events has a poisson distribution the events are instantaneous and that the storm depths are independent with an exponential distribution milly 1993 developed the following equation 14 e p exp α 1 p e p 1 exp α 1 p e p p e p with α the ratio of soil water holding capacity to the mean storm depth milly s work indicated that the storage capacity of the root zone has an important role in controlling evaporation later milly 1994 indicated that for a constant climate no seasonality evaporation is equal to the maximum of precipitation or potential evaporation it can be stated that when precipitation and potential evaporation are in phase out of phase the catchments plot closer to away from the asymptotes budyko and zubenok 1961 milly 1994 mentioned that other reasons for this deviation are the water holding capacity of the root zone infiltration capacity of the soil and the rate of water flow toward the plant roots he further proposed and tested a supply demand storage hypothesis in which the long term water balance is determined only by the interaction between local precipitation as supply and potential evaporation as demand mediated by soil water storage according to his proposed hypothesis the partitioning of mean annual precipitation into runoff and evaporation is under the influence of seven dimensionless variables choudhury 1999 attempted to assess if the non parametric empirical equations are independent of the spatial scale for this purpose he investigated the effects of spatial variations of precipitation and net radiation r n on evaporation using a generalized form of the empirical equation of pike 1964 choudhury 1999 added an adjustable parameter a which is related to the characteristics of soil topography and vegetation of the catchment xu et al 2014 and changes between spatial scales of micrometeorological measurements areas ca 1 km2 and large river basins areas ca 106 km2 15 e p 1 1 p r n a 1 a zhang et al 2001 found that plant available water coefficient w which is representative of the type of vegetation has an important role on partitioning precipitation into evaporation and runoff they proposed the following equation 16 e p 1 w e p p 1 w e p p e p p 1 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 used the abcd model and developed an expression for evaporation ratio e p according to a new soil moisture storage index γ this equation is fitted better to the observations than the budyko type equations schreiber ol dekop turc pike 17 e p 1 2 1 γ 1 r 1 2 γ 1 r γ 2 1 2 r r 2 0 5 in this equation γ b p b is the model parameter r e x p γ and e p p they mentioned that the abcd model contains a soil moisture accounting component and therefore equation 17 could incorporate the impact of soil moisture changes for the long term water balance of the catchment considering the effect of both frequency and depth of rainfall events on the soil water balance and incorporating the soil properties i e maximum soil water storage capacity w 0 porporato et al 2004 proposed the following model 18 e p 1 q q 1 e x p q γ q γ q q in which e p p q w 0 d and d is mean depth per storm event they found that for q 5 5 their model reproduces the budyko 1948 curve very well finally wang and tang 2014 developed a one parameter budyko type model for the mean annual time scale based on a generalization of the proportionality hypothesis of the soil conservation service scs model the new introduced parameter of their model ε is defined as the ratio of the initial evaporation ratio and horton index wang and tang 2014 the horton index is the ratio between evaporation and catchment wetting water available for evaporation horton 1933 troch et al 2009 and is relatively constant from year to year and is controlled by the vegetation properties troch et al 2009 voepel et al 2011 accordingly they provided the following equation 19 e p 1 e p p 1 e p p 2 4 ε 2 ε e p p 2 ε 2 ε despite the development of several budyko equations zhou et al 2015 believed that a simpler method to generate budyko functions was needed which meets the water and energy constraints thus they incorporated the complementary relationship they suggested that their complementary relationship could be applied for evaluating impacts of change in climate and or catchment characteristics on hydrological response of the catchment moreover their proposed function can be used to develop any number of valid budyko functions and or to test the validity of the existing functions it should be mentioned that in addition to the studies that developed a new model to take different physical factors such as vegetation soil moisture topography rainfall characteristics into account many other researchers tried to investigate the effect of these factors on the water balance of the catchments through the budyko framework donohue et al 2010 2007 dooge et al 1999 feng et al 2012 gerrits et al 2009 hickel and zhang 2006 mianabadi et al 2019 ning et al 2017 padrón et al 2017 potter et al 2005 3 budyko framework under non steady state conditions generally the budyko framework is quite an applicable method for estimating the water energy balance of both gauged and ungauged catchments but an important issue in its applicability is that it assumes the catchments are under hydrological steady state conditions which are controlled by macro climatic factors this assumption can lead to deviations from the observations when the budyko hypothesis is applied for finer spatial and temporal scales thus the budyko framework should be extended to have a more accurate estimation of evaporation and runoff at finer spatial and temporal scales in this section the budyko models developed for the non steady state conditions are presented han et al 2011 stated that irrigation can be a large proportion of the lateral water inputs which contributes to the water supply available for evaporation in their study basin the river water withdrawal is the main source of irrigation considering a study period with stable annual mean groundwater table depth han et al 2011 contributed irrigation i into the water balance of the basin and extended the fu equation as follows 20 e p i 1 e p p i 1 e p p i τ 1 τ in which τ 1 fu 1981 yang et al 2007 is the model parameter based on their results the extended budyko type model performed well for 26 subregions in the study basin for estimation of evaporation at mean annual and interannual scales wang 2012 mentioned that the extent to which the annual water balance is under the influence of water storage change is necessary to be examined by water storage data thus he studied the effect of water storage changes on the water balance at mean annual and interannual scales he considered the total water storage change of a watershed as the sum of soil moisture change δ s s m i groundwater change δ s g w i and surface water change δ s s w i as follows 21 δ s i δ s sm i δ s gw i δ s sw i he investigated the impact of water storage change on interannual water balance from 1982 to 2003 water years n 22 years his results showed that the ratio of the annual water storage change to the annual precipitation is larger than 10 during 40 of the years and larger than 5 during 70 of the years therefore he concluded that the interannual storage change cannot be neglected for his case study sites since the main land use in his study watersheds was agricultural land with the least human interferes the groundwater withdrawal was mainly used for irrigation therefore the total water supply under non steady state conditions included both precipitation and water storage change and it could be presented as effective precipitation p i δ s i thus the evaporation ratio and aridity index were calculated as e i p i δ s i and e pi p i δ s i respectively wang 2012 mentioned that groundwater storage has a more important impact on the annual water balance than the soil moisture storage during drought years chen et al 2013 examined the budyko hypothesis at the seasonal and monthly scales under non steady state conditions when water storage change was significant for this purpose they defined the monthly seasonal and annual aridity indices and evaporation ratio by defining effective rainfall as p k δ s k where k is the index for the given time scale i e monthly seasonal or annual with this definition they modified the turc pike equation to model seasonal evaporation and storage change and applied the model to 277 watersheds in the united states for 21 years 1983 2003 in dry months the depletion of water storage would be added to precipitation and the available water supply includes precipitation and water storage extraction in wet months rainfall infiltrates into the ground and replenishes the water storage and thus the available water supply is the subtraction of water storage from precipitation following wang 2012 chen et al 2013 defined the aridity index k as follows 22 k e pk p k δ s k in which e pk p k and δ s k are evaporation precipitation and water storage both soil water and groundwater change respectively for k time scale furthermore chen et al 2013 suggested that while the lower limit of the seasonal aridity index in the budyko framework is zero it may be positive or even higher than 1 during dry seasons for a given watershed considering the lower bound of the seasonal aridity index for a given watershed and the differentiation between dry and wet seasons they extended the budyko type model for the estimation of seasonal evaporation ratio for wet and dry seasons as follows 23 e w p w δ s w 1 e pw p w δ s w φ w v w 1 v w 24 e d p d δ s d 1 e pd p d δ s d φ d v d 1 v d in these equations v w and v d are the turc pike parameters for wet and dry seasons respectively and φ w and φ d are the corresponding lower bounds of aridity indices in wet and dry seasons respectively their results for 277 watersheds in the united states showed that in wet dry seasons 99 90 of watersheds had nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients larger than 0 5 chen et al 2013 showed that in many cases in their study watersheds the evaporation ratio is higher than 1 when precipitation is considered as the only source of water supply they mentioned that the uncertainty of evaporation might be a reason for that but it does not fully explain that behavior in extremely dry years therefore they concluded that in addition to precipitation storage change also should be considered in the available water supply the role of water storage in maintaining evaporation is significant especially for extremely dry years with aridity index higher than 1 their results showed that by accurately describing the water and energy supply the budyko hypothesis could be applied at the interannual scale greve et al 2016 used the formulation introduced by fu 1981 and zhang et al 2004 and derived a new two parameter equation for the non steady state conditions as mentioned earlier fu s equation is subject to two constraints water limit and energy limit lines these two limits show that evaporation is limited by precipitation and potential evaporation greve et al 2016 mentioned that in addition to water storage change additional water can be available due to human interventions milly et al 2008 landscape changes jaramillo and destouni 2016 water phase changes berghuijs et al 2014 jaramillo and destouni 2016 or long term soil moisture changes due to transient climate change orlowsky and seneviratne 2013 wang 2005 while zhang et al 2008 han et al 2011 wang 2012 and chen et al 2013 investigated the limitation of the budyko framework and extended the budyko hypothesis for the conditions when evaporation exceeds precipitation greve et al 2016 modified the fu equation analytically using basic phenomenological assumptions as made by zhang et al 2004 and provided the following equation 25 e p f k y 0 1 1 1 y 0 k 1 k 1 k in this equation k like ω is the parameter representing the watershed characteristics the new parameter y 0 represents the new boundary condition and has a physical interpretation related to the additional water supply for evaporation if k 2 6 and y 0 0 the greve equation corresponds to the budyko 1948 curve greve et al 2016 used their equation globally at monthly time scale and showed that the evaporation ratio estimated by the new model has a good correlation with the observed evaporation ratio although some previous studies incorporated the water storage effects into the budyko framework wang and zhou 2016 claimed that the role of groundwater dependent evaporation was not yet evaluated both soil water and groundwater changes may be the cause of evaporation ratio higher than one wang 2012 reported that during drought year 1988 the evaporation ratio was about 1 1 in two watersheds in illinois united states in which about 100 mm soil water and about 200 mm of groundwater storage was depleted it showed that the contribution of groundwater was more significant than soil storage as mentioned by chen and hu 2004 the effect of groundwater on surface evaporation depends on the groundwater table depth a groundwater table near the surface has a significant effect on evaporation therefore shallow groundwater would increase the occurrence of the cases with an evaporation ratio higher than 1 chen et al 2020 wang and zhou 2016 therefore wang and zhou 2016 developed a method to incorporate the groundwater dependent evaporation into the annual water balance in the standard budyko framework for analyzing the method they modified the abcd model thomas 1981 and then the modified model was applied in the study catchments to estimate the actual evaporation using the estimated evaporation by the modified abcd model the interannual water balance for the period of 1957 2010 in the standard and modified budyko framework was analyzed their study area was located in the erdos plateau in northern central china in the middle part of the yellow river basin with a semiarid to arid climate wang and zhou 2016 plotted the annual p q p versus the aridity index for the average of six catchments during 1957 1978 and concluded that the long term water balance of the catchments follows the original budyko framework under steady state conditions in contrast their results for some individual catchments showed that the annual p q p versus the aridity index had a negative relation and did not follow the budyko framework for some other catchments the relation was positive but still did not follow the original budyko framework such an abnormal relation was also highlighted by istanbulluoglu et al 2012 in the north loup river basin nebraska usa istanbulluoglu et al 2012 concluded that it occurred by ignoring the water storage change in the catchment therefore they replaced the p q p with p q δ s gw p δ s gw the interannual groundwater storage change and found that the equation followed the zhang et al 2001 s curve for their study catchment however they did not take the groundwater dependent evaporation into account wang and zhou 2016 mentioned that there is no long term groundwater level monitoring data in their study catchments furthermore the p q δ s gw p approach causes the interannual soil moisture storage change to be ignored therefore they estimated the storage change from the monthly baseflow data using the modified abcd model to analyze their method they divided the study catchments into two zones zone 1 with deep groundwater and zone 2 with shallow groundwater in zone 1 the evaporation ratio was smaller than 1 below the water limit line for the whole range of the aridity indices while in zone 2 the relation between the evaporation ratio and aridity index did not follow the original budyko framework and the evaporation ratio was higher than 1 they concluded that the groundwater dependent evaporation was the reason for this behavior generally they proposed that the evaporation ratio for the whole catchment can be estimated as follows 26 e p 1 r 1 1 π 1 π r g g a where r is the ratio of the zone 2 area to the whole catchment area is aridity index π is the parameter representing the catchment characteristics g is the parameter controlling the intensity of groundwater dependent evaporation and g a is the annual groundwater storage wang and zhou 2016 mentioned that the water supply in the original budyko framework e g precipitation for the steady state conditions is not dependent on both evaporation and runoff and thus the aridity index is an independent variable however effective precipitation p δ s as defined by wang 2012 and chen et al 2013 is under the influence of the feedback mechanism between evaporation and runoff the interdependency between water supply and evaporation limits the application of the modified budyko framework in assessing the shift in annual water balance therefore they suggested that the extended formula for annual water balance in the standard budyko framework such as their proposed equation equation 26 is a more efficient and straightforward approach and can keep the aridity index as an independent index for the climatic conditions du et al 2016 mentioned that in addition to groundwater and soil water storage the water transfer from other basins in unclosed basins is another important source of water that is available for evaporation considering this issue they investigated the applicability of the budyko hypothesis for the heihe river basin in china at the non steady state conditions and then they improved the original budyko framework based on the basins water balance 27 e p e 1 e p p e 1 e p p e μ c 1 μ where

change in their model since they believed that it is the result of the groundwater baseflow exchange and therefore does not have direct interaction with evaporation to test the new budyko type curve du et al 2016 used the abcd model thomas 1981 to obtain the required data e g soil water storage and actual evaporation at the monthly scale their results showed that due to the impact of water transfer and soil water storage change the original budyko framework is not applicable for their study basin furthermore they found that at the annual time scale their new equation performed more or less similar to fu s equation at the monthly scale their proposed model performed better than the original fu equation for the defined evaporation ratios less than 1 e p e 1 and performed the same for evaporation ratios close to 1 e p e 1 they suggested that their new equation could be applied for water balance interpretations over extremely dry regions with non steady state conditions considering water storage changes in the watershed moussa and lhomme 2016 proposed a new physically based formulation by introducing the parameter of h e δ s e p which represents the variable δ s in a dimensionless form their equation can be applied under non steady state conditions at any time scale with various budyko functions using the fu zhang equation the new formulation was similar to the

formulations of chen et al 2013 and du et al 2016 they found that the upper limit of all formulations was similar while the lower limit was different they presented their formulation in both budyko e

interpreted as the ratio between initial evaporation and total evaporation tang et al 2017 concluded that their new proposed budyko type equation integrated with grace data would result in a useful method for assessing the long term groundwater storage change in the regions with large scale irrigation despite developing the new budyko equations condon and maxwell 2017 suggested that the ability to estimate or measure groundwater storage changes is limited and therefore the implication of the modified budyko approaches should be more evaluated for this purpose they investigated the effect of storage change on the budyko hypothesis using the evaporation ratio estimated by three common approaches 1 direct evaporation quantified from field observations divided by precipitation e p 2 evaporation calculated from precipitation and surface runoff divided by precipitation p q p and 3 direct evaporation divided by effective precipitation by taking groundwater contribution g into account e p g when groundwater surface water exchanges are occurring their results for 25 000 nested watersheds 100 3 000 000 km2 showed that the groundwater storage would shift the budyko curve depending on the approach to estimate the evaporation ratio as expected for the first approach e p some points fell above the water limit line with evaporation ratios higher than 1 this is explained by the fact that in these conditions the partitioning occurs between evaporation and runoff plus groundwater storage change instead of precipitation and runoff only their results also showed that in the case with g 0 i e storage change negligible the three approaches were equivalent a comparison among the developed models at non steady state conditions is provided in table 2 as shown in the table most of the studies are developed for arid and semi arid regions where precipitation is not enough for meeting the water demand of the watersheds and thus water is provided through groundwater depletion or inter basin transfer which increases the available water of the watersheds leading to a deviation from the original budyko framework 4 on the value of the budyko framework for future hydrological studies although several attempts to apply the budyko framework under non steady state conditions resulted in more complexity in the framework its simplicity and accuracy are still enough to be widely applied the framework is nowadays still highly valuable maybe not for studying the process of evaporation in detail therefore the framework is too simplistic but it can serve purposes like 4 1 validation of remote sensing data the budyko framework can be used for validation of remote sensing data of precipitation and evaporation as done by koppa and gebremichael 2017 they used fu s equation and showed that in comparison to the complex distributed hydrological models the simple budyko curves can be applied effectively for validation of observational data 4 2 down sampling of remote sensing data rouholahnejad freund and kirchner 2017 applied the budyko curves to derive a simple sub grid closure relation that estimates how spatial heterogeneity and lateral moisture redistribution affect average evaporation as seen from the atmosphere they mentioned that they used the budyko curve as a simple model to find how the supply of available water and evaporative demand control evaporation they believed that the budyko framework can be applied instead of complex ecohydrological models which obey the same energy and water constraints and their behavior is not greatly different from the budyko curves the budyko curves estimate evaporation as a function of its main drivers e g precipitation and potential evaporation allowing a general analytical derivation which might be difficultly derived from the complex models however their finding could be compared by further analysis through physically distributed models with high resolution data 4 3 constraining hydrological models evaporation estimates obtained from the budyko framework may constrain the parameter search space significantly for example besides two daily and eight daily remote sensing products lsa saf and mod16 nijzink et al 2018 applied the analytical budyko framework to obtain a long term estimate of evaporation as the constraint of five rainfall runoff models their results showed that the budyko framework was helpful with strong improvements in model calibration and performance 4 4 quantification of the relative impacts of climate variability and direct human activities on mean annual runoff in continuationoffu s equation application mo et al 2018 found that the effect of human activities on decline in mean annual runoff is more considerable than climate change in the bahe river in china 4 5 identifying the main source of uncertainty in a complex hydrological model using budyko coefficients malago et al 2018 stated that when the simulated data derived from swat are too far from the budyko curves in wet conditions it could be related to the uncertainties of the model parameterization this research tried to use the budyko curve as a criterion for model calibration so that significant departure from the curve is interpreted as high potential inconsistency of model parameterization 4 6 determining the crop coefficient one of the works in applying budyko curves for its simplicity is the work done by zhang et al 2017 who determined the crop coefficient under non standard conditions by integrating the budyko framework under both steady state and non steady state conditions into the traditional crop coefficient approach to assess the volume of the agricultural virtual water content by minimum data they showed that despite using less data their model calculated virtual water content in a good agreement with some previous research studies while the above mentioned studies show that the original budyko framework performs reasonably well for their given aims they suggested that the framework is still limited for some cases and the extended framework can be used for dealing with these limitations for example koppa and gebremichael 2017 mentioned that fu s equation is limited to consider the catchment storage at long term temporal scale therefore the developed error metric characterizes the bias in precipitation and evaporation datasets and not the variance thus they suggested using the extended budyko curves under non steady state conditions for example the equation of greve et al 2016 to validate remotely sensed precipitation and evaporation at monthly and daily time scales or at the catchments with considerable long term water storage changes moreover mo et al 2018 suggested that more details on runoff change could be revealed using the extended budyko curves at inter and intra annual scales e g non steady state conditions malago et al 2018 also noted that in their study the points above the water limit line can indicate the non steady state conditions in the catchments rather than the uncertainties and therefore the extended budyko curves should be considered accordingly in spite of being more complex than the original framework using the extended budyko framework under non steady state conditions for different purposes of hydrological modeling would lead to more accurate and reliable results it is a great advance in hydrological modeling because most of the watersheds worldwide are nowadays under the influence of human interventions and are not steady and natural any longer such situations mostly occur in developing countries with insufficient data availability which limits using complex hydrological models the contribution of runoff and evaporation into the water balance of each catchment is influenced by human activities and it changes the water cycle of the catchments leading to the need for a deeper understanding of the human water system interactions moreover model calibration as the most important part of the hydrological modeling should consider the interactions between human and water systems therefore traditional calibration makes the results less reliable to take into account the role of human activities in hydrological modeling the budyko framework at non steady state conditions would be a very functional approach which can efficiently model and assess water balance components especially at large scale modeling for example recently lei et al 2018 presented a new type budyko model which is potentially a generalized constraint in water resources system models simplifying the structure of the current hydrological models to develop new models for the non steady state conditions these new models can be applied for the prediction of future human interventions in the water balance of the catchments especially for large scale spatial and temporal modeling according to these studies the extended budyko framework is an efficient alternative that can be used instead of the original budyko framework and complex hydrological models however this requires more reliable data such as irrigation and available soil water additionally a novel issue that may take advantage of the budyko framework is the design of an efficient water resources planning strategy with improvement in runoff estimation as inflow to dam reservoirs especially in arid regions with high complexity in groundwater modeling this may be proposed as future contributions in hydrology and water resources context moreover the budyko framework can be used in hydrological modeling for partitioning total evaporation into interception soil evaporation and transpiration e g gerrits et al 2009 mianabadi et al 2019 or for evaluation of evaporation fluxes estimated by the new proposed hydrological or land surface models for example while good et al 2017 by using field studies and remotely sensed estimates found that the ratio of transpiration to precipitation has a unimodal distribution their finding was also identified by porporato et al 2004 s model equation 18 within the budyko framework furthermore they applied the porporato s model to partition actual evaporation into interception ground surface evaporation and transpiration relative to precipitation however they mentioned the appropriate application of the budyko framework for the steady state conditions thus future studies can focus on the way of applying the budyko framework for partitioning evaporation at non steady state conditions 5 perspectives of the budyko framework generally in spite of some limitations of the budyko framework it is expected that the natural and anthropogenic changes such as climate change land use alteration and inter basin water transfer can increase the contribution of the budyko framework in hydrological modeling thus attempts for applying the framework in a changing world with an increasing role of human activities in the hydrological cycle of catchments might be helpful for hydrological studies in the future however it is not completely clear how the budyko framework can contribute herein especially under non steady state conditions for example the relationship between land cover change and evaporation in the future with considering the climate change effects has important impacts on catchment hydrology and might be potentially investigated by the budyko framework as it is slightly discussed by ning et al 2020 at steady state conditions response to the question on how such issues could be investigated under non steady state conditions needs efficient solutions with considering the extended budyko equations for this purpose taking advantage of the time series technique fathi et al 2019 and modification of the line integral based method zheng 2019 can be suggested for non steady state conditions it may need meta research or meta analysis of the previous researches to predict the future of hydrological modeling based on the budyko framework meanwhile there are still some other important unsolved questions involved with the budyko framework one question is how the relationship between model parameters and catchment properties would change at non steady state conditions for example while the greve s model greve et al 2016 has been analytically derived from the fu equation fu 1981 their parameters are differently related to the catchment properties at steady and non steady state conditions moreover due to human interference the water systems have become more complex with increasing interaction and co evolution of the different processes affecting the water balance accordingly the budyko framework might be widely used to capture the overall behaviour of the catchment zhang et al 2008 it is believed that the vegetation landscape co evolution can help a given watershed not to deviate from the budyko framework if it encounters with any possible climatic changes however the results showed that climate change can change the budyko curve van der velde et al 2014 through changing the interaction and co evolution between climate and catchment properties wang et al 2016 thus another question is how the extended budyko framework can help with this issue one issue that can also be considered is that more attempts have to be conducted for improving the budyko framework at smaller spatial scale with diversity controlling factors e g bai et al 2020 therefore calibration of major important factors through the intelligence search method in future studies can be more conducted on the application of the budyko hypothesis for smaller catchments and even for hydrological response units hrus in a catchment however one important question is how the interactions among the key processes affecting the catchment response would be changing at smaller temporal spatial scales last but not the least question might be the role of virtual water the amount of water needed to produce commodities which is then transported to other places for consumptions chapagain et al 2006 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 in hydrological modeling as sivapalan et al 2012 suggested that socio hydrology might address the virtual water trade the question might be that if it is possible to apply the holistic view of the budyko framework to help the experts of the socio hydrology to deal with this challenge 6 conclusion the budyko framework is a useful and more convenient tool which in some cases can be used instead of distributed hydrological models which are complex and time consuming with lots of data requirements and large uncertainties in the input data model structure and parameterization since it is firstly developed for spatially large scale catchment with low complexity of real world processes this may be known as the most important limitation of the budyko approach but it is still an effective tool for assessing the impacts of climate factors and catchment properties on the water energy balance and the interaction among them therefore the co evolution of the hydrological processes makes it possible to use the simple budyko framework to identify the overall behavior of the catchments on the whole in some ungauged catchments especially in developing countries the data is not sufficiently provided or if provided is inaccurate or publicly restricted to be used as input for the complex models and this can lead to large uncertainty in the models results in spite of simplicity the budyko framework can lead us to identify if our results are reasonable even if the extended budyko curves are not directly applicable for catchments with insufficient data the original budyko framework can help the researcher to determine that abnormal behavior of the catchments is arising from the catchments characteristics or from the uncertainty of the data for example when a data point is located above the water limit line it shows that either the input data are uncertain or the catchment is under non steady state conditions such a finding cannot be obtained by complex hydrological models on the other hand in a changing world with human interferes in the hydrological cycle of the water systems e g groundwater withdrawal and or inter basin water transfer some watersheds are under non steady state conditions and the water balance of the watersheds does not follow the original budyko framework any longer furthermore since the original budyko framework was developed for long term temporal and large spatial scales its application at finer scales where the water storage change is an important component of the water balance is challenging in such situations the extended budyko curves have to be used these extended budyko equations can enhance our understanding of the overall behavior of ecohydrological processes which are valuable for practical applications while the extended equations are more complex than the original ones they still are simpler with less data requirements than the complex distributed models in developing countries in which the hydrological cycle of the catchments is considerably under the influence of anthropogenic activities the application of the original budyko framework is limited moreover in these countries applying complex models is also limited due to unavailable or insufficient data therefore the extended budyko equations are useful tools for the estimation of evaporation in these regions despite all the advantages provided by the budyko framework it is likely still too simple to represent the full complexity of real world processes and thus might be subject to over interpretations leading to flawed and false conclusions several studies showed that using budyko equations especially the parametric equations resulted in inconclusive and sometimes potentially contradicting outcomes padrón et al 2017 zhou et al 2015a b nonetheless extending the budyko framework at both temporal and spatial scales might be helpful for some watershed with less complexity for evaluating the complex models or for the situations in which very accurate estimations are not needed accordingly the next generation of the hydrological modeling may need to go toward applying the budyko framework to estimate the hydrological components at steady and non steady state conditions in a changing world however some questions within the budyko framework remain unsolved like the interactions among the key processes affecting the catchment response at different temporal spatial time scales the relationship between land cover change and evaporation in the future the relationship between models parameters and catchment properties at non steady state conditions using extended budyko framework to capture the overall behaviour of the catchment considering the co evolution of the processes and the role of virtual water in hydrological modeling these questions might be further investigated in

5367,climate change will likely trigger shifts in rainfall regimes that may intensify water scarcity in semi arid regions in the semi arid region of brazil the seasonally dry ecosystem is the primary source of forage for livestock because the correct stocking rate of livestock animals per area is not well understood overgrazing tends to advance rangeland degradation in this ecosystem this implies that the region may become even more vulnerable under changing rainfall regimes which in turn may exacerbate livestock and food insecurity we developed a coupled soil water balance vegetation and cattle biomass model to illustrate the impacts of rainfall seasonality on the dynamics of vegetation and animal growth the outcomes were simulated by considering different stocking rates and the timing of animal placement and removal from the rangeland a more pronounced reduction in vegetation biomass was found in grazed vs non grazed paddocks under strongly seasonal rainfall patterns the maximum animal weight gain decreases with average rainfall inter arrival time and increases with total annual rainfall thus a forecast of dry spells could benefit farmers in planning grazing management strategies our model can be used to test different management scenarios and give feedback for local herders and to guide future experiments to reduce the time and cost of acquiring data keywords ecohydrology soil moisture caatinga semi arid region 1 introduction in the semi arid region of ne brazil annual rainfall typically varies between 300 and 800 mm and is concentrated over 3 to 4 months in order to contend with rainfall seasonality the plants of the native seasonally dry tropical forest sdtf vegetation known as caatinga have developed various physiological adaptations with a deciduous strategy being found frequently among trees and shrubs sampaio 1995 after the first rainfall events of the wet season the vegetation can reestablish its canopy in about 15 days parente et al 2012 the plant density contributes to litter production and is strongly affected by rainfall amount particularly in the period occurring 60 to 90 days after the onset of the wet season lopes et al 2015 these physiological adaptations allow species in sdtfs to buffer some of the hydroclimatic variability souza et al 2016 in addition to the adversity of climate conditions human activities such as cattle raising and wood extraction can exert a strong external pressure on the ecosystem leal et al 2005 and may lead to ecosystem degradation due to overgrazing deforestation and inadequate land management menezes et al 2012 cattle raising can be carried out in grasslands where the natural vegetation was previously replaced by grasses or within the herbaceous plant community that grows under natural conditions after deforestation because most areas are not fenced these areas are used as extensive pastures for livestock essentially without any control and the stocking rates number of animals per area associated with native grasslands are high enough that they constitute a predatory extraction activity araújo filho 2013 high stocking rates are expected to cause an increase in soil compaction and erosion along with a decrease in nutrient and carbon stocks and cycling rates parente et al 2010 aubault et al 2015 schulz et al 2016 under rainfed conditions the biomass of both grassland and natural vegetation depends on the annual rainfall amount and distribution due to seasonality in biomass production large areas are required to supply all annual fodder requirements over the course of many years for example according to salviano et al 2004 a rangeland area at or above 13 3 ha animal 1 is necessary for reasonable results nevertheless a more reliable way to estimate vegetation biomass could produce better information to adjust the stocking rate in order to limit soil degradation and achieve greater vegetation and livestock productivity there are two primary strategies for raising cattle on the caatinga the first strategy involves leaving animals on the pasture year round while the second consists of placing animals on the field at the start of the rainy season and removing them some months later as studied in santana et al 2010 in either scenario livestock growth and pricing are subject to rainfall variability within each year which affect the maximum weight achieved and may necessitate an extra input of fodder increasing costs despite its importance for sustainable management of natural resources food and economic security few studies have addressed this topic some studies such as salviano et al 2004 and santana et al 2010 have measured the initial and final weight of the cattle under different stocking rates in native vegetation but there is a scarcity of data on changes in bodyweight over time since the whole vegetation cattle system is influenced by rainfall questions remain regarding how cattle management in this region can be optimized for different rainfall regimes this lack of information may be related to the costs of running experiments with livestock that also depend on rainfall and management strategies for representative results venter et al 2019 in addition there is little information on the hydrology of stdfs although it is known that the stocking rate can affect the water partitioning because of changes in leaf area index and soil compaction stavi et al 2011 byrnes et al 2018 thus we aimed to develop a coupled vegetation biomass animal growth and economic model based on a stochastic hydrological model rodríguez iturbe and porporato 2005 to simulate some scenarios of animal management under semi arid conditions then we address some related questions i what are the maximum biomass and revenue that can be attained under a given rainfall regime and ii what is the maximum time for which animals may be left grazing in the caatinga without incurring degradation of vegetation we also analyzed the stability of the vegetation and animal growth under constant soil moisture conditions to better understand the system dynamics 2 materials and methods this section is divided into three main subsections firstly the models are described beginning with hydrological components and including vegetation growth animal growth and economics section 2 1 secondly a description of the site and data collection is given in section 2 2 finally the biomass and ndvi relationships and model parameterization are described in section 2 3 2 1 modeling framework 2 1 1 soil water balance and vegetation growth model the soil water balance at the daily scale was modeled using a stochastic model given by rodríguez iturbe and porporato 2005 and laio et al 2001 considering a homogeneous soil profile and negligible lateral water fluxes the change in the soil water balance over time is given by 1 nz r ds t dt r t i r t q s t et s t l s t where n is the porosity z r is the depth of active soil or root depth s t is the relative soil moisture content at time t 0 s t 1 dimensionless averaged over the rooting depth i r t is the canopy interception and q r t s t is the runoff the portion of water that is infiltrated into soil is lost by evapotranspiration et s t and leakage l s t in this study we modeled canopy interception using an empirical relationship based on measured data in ne brazil izidio et al 2013 relating the plant phenology to biomass 2 i r φ φ r r r φ a r r r r r where r represents a threshold of rainfall that can be completely intercepted by vegetation r 0 5 cm a is an empirical slope coefficient equal to 0 10 based on izidio et al 2013 and φ is a parameter to adjust the canopy storage capacity which ranges from 0 to 1 and is given as 3 φ k 1 e k 2 b t b max where k 1 0 14 and k 2 1 96 based on costa et al 2001 evapotranspiration is a piecewise linear function of s t given by eq 4 of laio et al 2001 4 et s b t e w s s h s w s h s h s s w e w e max b t e w s s w s s w s w s s e max b t s s 1 where e w is the minimum evapotranspiration and e max b t is the maximum evapotranspiration for a given biomass b t s is the soil moisture and s h s w and s are the soil moisture at the hygroscopic point wilting point and a threshold below which et decreases linearity with s because of the variation of maximum evapotranspiration with biomass we assumed a linear relationship between available biomass and e max b t souza et al 2016 5 e max b t e max 0 1 η 2 b t b max 1 where b t represents the available biomass at a given time t and e max 0 is the average biomass over time we assumed the e w and e max 0 respectively to be equal to 0 05 and 0 5 cm day 1 based on souza et al 2016 the parameter η allows us to vary the intensity of the e max b feedback around e max 0 0 5 cm day 1 here we assumed η 0 40 so that e max could vary from 0 3 to 0 7 cm day 1 according to observed minimum and maximum biomass leakage losses are modelled as gravity drainage at the lowest boundary of the soil layer as 6 l s k s s 2 b 3 where k s is the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity cm day 1 b is the exponent of the soil retention curve ψ ψ s s b and ψ s is the suction at saturation clapp and hornberger 1978 the available biomass without grazing effects which affects the rate of evapotranspiration et was modeled according to souza et al 2016 as 7 db t dt k a a s b max b t k r b t where the maximum available biomass b max is related to the observed maximum and minimum ndvi see eq 14 k a is a constant associated with assimilation and k r a constant associated with respiration a s represents the gross normalized assimilation and is a piecewise linear function of soil moisture based on daly et al 2004 and feng et al 2012 8 a s 0 s s w s s w s s w s w s s 1 s s 1 this coupled soil water balance and vegetation model has performed well when comparing the simulation with data of soil moisture and ndvi in the semi arid region of brazil as shown in souza et al 2016 2 1 2 animal growth the animal growth depends on many factors such as animal genetics food and water availability and quality and environmental conditions assuming that some conditions are constant over time and for non limiting resources the bodyweight of an individual animal will increase up to the animal s maximum capacity the variation of weight of all animals c in time has a sigmoidal shape and can be expressed as 9 dc t dt k g c t 1 c t n c c max k d c t where k g and k d are parameters related to the increase and decrease of the animals weight c max is the maximum weight a single animal can reach and n c is the number of animals in this case because there was no food limitation the growth of animals depended mainly on genetics from now on we will use the term bodyweight to refer to the weight of a single animal or the average weight of many animals and the term cow weight or animal weight to refer to the weight of several animals to evaluate this model performance eq 9 we used the data acquired from lippke et al 2000 for different stocking rates in four irrigated wheat pastures the initial average weight of animals was 189 kg and they were weighed continuously every 28 days for 180 days with a maximum weight of about 376 kg fig 1 the model has shown good performance with a high coefficient of determination r 2 and low root mean square error rmse between the observed and modeled bodyweight fig 1 the parameters fitted to eq 9 based on data from lippke et al 2000 were k g 0 0103 k d 0 0014 c max 578 5 kg 2 1 3 animal growth under limited resources for the livestock in natural conditions where there is no irrigation the environmental conditions play an essential role in animal weight gain especially in semi arid regions where rainfall fluctuations have a substantial impact on water storage and fodder production because of rainfall seasonality and vegetation adaptation fodder availability b t should be taken into account to perform a more realistic modeling of animal growth considering a given amount of cows in the natural pasture e g caatinga the weight gain of individual cows also depends on the availability of grass and leaves furthermore as the cows gain weight the volume of grass and leaves will be reduced due to the consumption to represent the relative availability of fodder through the biomass we consider a relative fodder availability g b t as a function related to the biomass defined based on the net biomass and two thresholds b 0 1 b max and b 0 5 b max 10 g b t 0 b t b b t b b b b b t b 1 b t b thus eq 9 becomes 11 dc t dt g b t k g c t 1 c t n c c max k d c t once there are grazing effects on the system the feedback of livestock on vegetation is directly proportional to the total weight of animals c in the area we assume that n animals of equal weight c 0 n are initially introduced to the pasture thus the total bodyweight of the cows at time t is equal to c t following these assumptions eq 7 becomes 12 db t dt k a a s b max b t k r b t f c c t h b t b where f c is a fraction of daily consumption that ranges between 1 5 and 6 of the total animal weight h represents the heaviside step function so that the last term of eq 12 reduces the animals consumption when biomass is not available 2 1 4 economics we model the average price per kilogram of cattle as exponentially decreasing function of animal weight based on data from susana and ramirez 2016 the relationship is given by 13 p av p 0 p s exp rbw p s where bw is the weight of the individual cow in kg cow 1 and p 0 p s and r are parameters equal to 1 78 usd kg 1 1 3 usd kg 1 and 1 300 cow kg 1 respectively 2 2 site description and data collection we took the parameters of soil and vegetation as well as data series of rainfall and ndvi from a site located in the municipality of serra talhada 7 9681 s 38 3841 w in the semi arid region of ne brazil the vegetation at this site is characterized by dry spiny and predominantly deciduous shrub forest vegetation most of which are tree species with a height between 6 0 and 8 0 m da silva et al 2017 the mean annual rainfall is about 640 mm mainly distributed between the months of december to march and potential evapotranspiration is greater than 1 800 mm year 1 the soil is classified as luvisol with a sandy loam texture profile average followed by the standard deviation clay 11 87 3 33 silt 24 01 0 98 sand 64 12 2 61 in the 40 cm depth rainfall data at the daily scale were obtained from the pernambuco agency of water and climate apac we used the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to estimate biomass and the data were obtained from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images product mod13q1 with a spatial resolution of 250 m and recorded at 16 day intervals from google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 we removed very low and spurious ndvi values and those gaps were filled with the average between the anterior and posterior values 2 3 biomass and ndvi relationship the vegetation model described in section 2 1 1 was adapted from souza et al 2016 which simulates ndvi n t however since animals eat the leaves and fine shoots of plants it is necessary to convert n t into biomass in order to model the interactions between animal load and vegetation to achieve this we measured the litter every two weeks in the second half of the wet season of 2016 using 20 collectors of 0 5 m2 each randomly distributed in the caatinga the collected material was oven dried at 65 c for 48 h and then weighed to obtain the dry mass during the sampling period the ndvi ranged between 0 72 and 0 291 and the accumulated litter ranged between 43 and 1 990 kg ha 1 fig 2 a at the beginning of the measurement period the ndvi was high due to reflectance of green leaves and the litter was almost zero because of high water availability as the soil moisture decreased due to a lack of rainfall the ndvi reduced in an almost linear manner and the accumulated litter started to increase in this period there is a negative relationships between ndvi and accumulated litter the maximum ndvi implies the minimum litter and vice versa however high ndvi is indicative of greenness which means that food availability should also be high to simply the conversion of ndvi into biomass that could be grazed the accumulated litter series was inverted and defined as biomass fig 2b thus we can relate the net ndvi n t n min to the potential litterfall b in order to estimate the dry mass of edible leaves i e 14 b t κ n t n min where κ is a fitted constant equal to 4387 when compared to the litter data this shows a strong relationship with r 2 0 951 fig 2c a linear relationship between vegetation indices and the leaf area index lai was found by miranda et al 2020 in the caatinga area which supports our assumption that vegetation reflectance may be converted into biomass using a linear equation the parameters for the models described in section 2 1 are shown in table 1 the simulations were performed for each hydrological year as defined in feng et al 2013 and the results were interpreted at the daily timescale we did not consider the effects of previous years grazing and the simulated grazing began 15 days after a rainfall event of at least 1 0 cm we simulated the same year five times considering the number of animals ha 1 n c equal to 0 1 2 3 and 4 each starting with 180 kg these stocking rates are exceedingly high compared with the recommended rate which is between 6 and 10 hectares per animal salviano et al 1982 however the available biomass that we considered here is also higher than that reported in some experiments our main goal here was to simulate the trajectories and interactions of water balance biomass animal growth and economics for different management strategies to accomplish this two management scenarios were considered both assuming that each individual animal starts at 180 kg at the beginning of grazing in the first scenario the animals stay in the area all year long while in the second one more animals start grazing but they are removed when their maximum weights have been reached all simulations were performed using the python programming language python software foundation 2019 the model code is available at https github com rodolfomssouza wavegrad 3 results 3 1 effects of grazing on hydrology in a typical hydrological year the bulk of the total rainfall 62 3 cm is mainly distributed during the period from january to april days 121 to 241 fig 3 a the mean rainfall event was 0 7 cm and only 21 of the events registered in this year were greater than 1 0 cm the maximum rain event was 5 2 cm after the first rainfall events around day 60 there was a dry spell between days 70 and 125 which was reflected in soil moisture and evapotranspiration the simulated soil moisture ranged between the hygroscopic point s h 0 10 and a maximum value of 0 53 fig 3b this maximum value was not affected by cattle grazing however there was a slight effect of the amount of cattle on the rate of soil moisture decay although some rainfall events occurred after the rainy season most of them were smaller than 0 5 cm and the soil moisture remained close to the hygroscopic point s h evapotranspiration showed a similar seasonal variation fig 3c in the periods with higher water availability maximum et was higher for the condition with no animals but during the soil drying process et was slightly higher if there were animals grazing in general for this set of scenarios the water balance was not significantly affected by grazing management and only small variations were observed in hydrologic fluxes fig 4 in the annual water balance et was the main loss component as is typical for semi arid regions it ranged between 78 5 and 83 2 of the total rainfall for n c 0 and n c 4 respectively the et was partitioned into a non stressed condition et ns when s was higher than s and a stressed condition et s when s was lower than s there was a small increase in both et ns and et s with grazing intensity the canopy interception i decreased with grazing intensity due to the dependence of interception on vegetation biomass fig 4 in this case i varied between 13 4 and 10 1 cm for n c 0 and n c 4 respectively the difference in rainfall interception between the non grazed and heavily grazed scenarios represents about 5 3 of annual rainfall and once infiltrated into the soil it results in more favorable conditions for evapotranspiration without increasing water loss by leakage there was an increase in total et representing 4 8 of rainfall due to the 5 3 decrease in i which was allocated into et ns when there were more animals in the area due to the relatively low soil moisture leakage l represented less than 1 of total rainfall in all management conditions 3 2 effects of rainfall fluctuations on biomass and economics although changes in the grazing intensity did not significantly affect the ecosystem water balance at the annual timescale it strongly affected the vegetation biomass fig 5 a maximum vegetation growth occurred under the non grazed condition n c 0 with biomass reaching a total of 2391 kg ha 1 because of the consumption of vegetation by livestock which is about 3 of bodyweight daily vegetation biomass was up to 1136 kg ha 1 lower under a high stocking rate than in the non grazed condition after the end of the wet season grazing effects on vegetation became more evident and larger differences in biomass were observed fig 5a shows that biomass would decrease to a level close to zero if more than one animal were kept grazing the more animals there are in the area the sooner it would be necessary to remove them to prevent degradation of vegetation the animals should be removed from the area around day 258 for n c 1 and day 239 for n c 4 the animal growth at the daily scale is shown in fig 5b once grazing has started animal growth is also affected by dry spells which occur during the wet season the maximum bodyweight bw max was reached after the peak of rainfall and vegetation growth for all grazing intensities and was earlier at higher grazing intensities comparing n c 1 with n c 4 there was a difference of 19 days between bw max in these conditions the mean bw max values were 258 248 242 and 239 kg respectively for 1 2 3 and 4 animals ha 1 the rate of livestock weight gain was only somewhat influenced by grazing intensity from the beginning of grazing to bw max there was an average daily gain varying between 0 54 and 0 50 kg day 1 for n c 1 and n c 4 respectively which represents about an 8 difference the maximum gain per animal was 0 75 kg day 1 regardless of the stocking rate on the other hand after the wet season livestock lost weight more quickly with higher grazing intensity the average rate of decrease was 0 66 kg animal 1 day 1 for n c 1 and 0 77 kg animal 1 day 1 for n c 4 fig 5b a difference of about 14 it is important to note that if animals stay in the area year round stocking rates of more than one animal ha 1 in addition to being most likely causing vegetation degradation will also result in lower animal weight at the end than at the beginning of grazing after the animals reach bw max they start to lose weight fig 5b since rainfall and soil moisture are already low fig 3a b if animals remain in the area until the end of the year the final weight would be 181 161 149 and 140 kg animal 1 respectively for 1 2 3 and 4 animals ha 1 thus more animals still have more total weight but this management can compromise the vegetation and biomass production for future growing seasons in terms of revenue the results suggest that a maximum of 1 2 cows ha 1 may be left on the pasture year round without incurring losses due to decreased bodyweight and possibly death of the animals fig 5c there is little difference in the final revenue for a stocking rate of one vs two cows ha 1 and since the analysis does not account for the risk of death and other incidental costs a maximum stocking rate of less than 1 cow ha 1 is preferred for year round management in order to maximize revenue in the scenario where the animals do not stay in the area all year a substantially higher stocking rate may prove more profitable fig 5b if cattle are removed and sold at the maximum bodyweight the anticipated revenue increases with the stocking rate for up to 10 animals ha 1 although the marginal revenue drastically decreases for stocking rates above 4 5 cows ha 1 the optimal selling time also decreases with stocking rate from around 180 days after the cows are first introduced with 1 cow ha 1 to around 160 days after they are introduced with 10 cows ha 1 for stocking rates as low as 1 cow ha 1 the anticipated revenue when selling cows near the end of the rainy season vs some months later is much higher suggesting that the best management strategy under these stocking rates is to keep the cows on the caatinga for only 4 5 months to evaluate the effect of interannual rainfall variability and seasonality on animal growth we examined maximum bodyweight as a function of total rainfall and the average rainfall interarrival time 1 λ for 18 hydrological years between 2000 and 2019 fig 6 during this period annual rainfall varied between 26 2 and 90 4 cm which is equivalent to 51 and 175 of the mean annual rainfall respectively the maximum animal weight showed a strong sensitivity to total rainfall increasing with total rainfall up to a certain limit which occurred around 70 cm yr 1 fig 6 depending on the stocking rate when rainfall was higher than average bw max either reached a plateau or decreased this relationship can be described using quadratic regressions with a coefficient of correlation r 2 varying between 0 831 and 0 726 in addition to the total rainfall amount bw max was affected by the mean rainfall interarrival time 1 λ bw max decreased linearly as the average time between rainfall events increased fig 6 however the correlation between bw max and 1 λ was smaller than that with total rainfall overall these results show that the interaction between hydrology vegetation and animal growth has a strong sensitivity to rainfall fluctuations which is mediated by livestock management 3 3 simulation of higher stocking rates in order to show how livestock management affects the vegetation we have simulated the trajectories of the vegetation biomass animal growth and revenue after removing the animals when they reached maximum weight fig 7 under higher stocking rates the vulnerability to rainfall fluctuations increased since any dry spell which occurs after animals start grazing can significantly reduce vegetation biomass as well as the livestock bodyweight this kind of management under rainfall fluctuation also poses more risk to the expected revenue as showed in the previous simulation fig 5 bw max is reached earlier for higher stocking rates fig 7 when the animals are removed from the area vegetation can regain some biomass if more rainfall events occur before the dry season begins although total bodyweight is higher for higher stocking rates the average bw max decreases when more animals are grazing at the same time in this way the revenue is also affected by the stocking rate and for 7 10 animals the resulting revenue is very similar 3 4 dynamics of animal biomass interaction fig 8 shows the phase space dynamics of the vegetation biomass eq 12 and and bodyweight of animals eq 11 when soil moisture levels are constant in time with no stochastic rainfall forcing the red dots represent fixed stable points to which the system tends to converge regardless of initial conditions the minimum relative assimilation rate a s eq 8 required for animals to at least maintain their initial weight 180 kg is about 0 2 for sandy soil the soil moisture level which produces this relative assimilation rate is equal to 0 16 the stable values of vegetation biomass and animal bodyweight increase quickly with the relative assimilation rate and the stable bodyweight with maximum relative assimilation is about 310 kg ha 1 in all scenarios of assimilation rates 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 there is an almost vertical trajectory which results in animals attaining the stable bodyweight with almost no change in vegetation biomass for the assimilation rate of 0 2 if the initial conditions of vegetation biomass are low the animal will rapidly lose weight afterward its weight will increase up to the stable point which is around 180 kg in this case on the other hand if the initial vegetation biomass and the initial animal bodyweight are high above the fixed point there will first be a reduction in biomass and then a reduction in the animal weight in this scenario even though the soil moisture provides conditions for substantial vegetation growth it would be challenging to have an overall gain of animal bodyweight since the stable point is only about 180 kg we summarized the fixed points of vegetation biomass and animal weight for assimilation rates ranging between 0 2 and 1 0 in fig 9 higher assimilation rates increase the equilibrium point as shown in fig 8 and since it is not a linear increase there is an optimal tradeoff point between water inputs soil moisture vegetation and animal weight gain considering the highest assimilation rate a s 1 the equilibrium point between vegetation and animal weight is reached with 2361 kg of biomass and a bodyweight of 308 kg in such condition if the animal started with 180 kg there would be a gain of 128 kg during its lifetime 4 discussion in this study we have developed a modeling approach to simulate the hydrology vegetation cattle system dynamics applied to the semi arid region of brazil two scenarios of grazing management were simulated and analyzed based on their effects on hydrology vegetation biomass cattle weight and economic outcomes the rainfall distribution over the wet season especially at the beginning of this season controls the dynamics of all water balance components and vegetation biomass production the amount of water in the first rainfall events of the season will trigger the leaf flushing in many caatinga species this will serve as an indicator of the timing of fodder availability when the animals can be placed in the caatinga area to start grazing our coupled modeling approach shows that the partitioning of main water fluxes runoff drainage and et was not significantly affected by animal grazing at the annual timescale the grazing intensity redistributed about 5 of rainfall into different water loss components and had a negligible effect on the soil moisture figs 3 and 4 these results are consistent with previous findings of water balance in the caatinga for example runoff usually represents less than 0 5 of rainfall and it is more dependent on rainfall intensity de figueiredo et al 2016 although low runoff is also observed in grasslands of semi arid regions hoshino et al 2009 in other management settings the grazing intensity may lead to greater vegetation degradation and runoff may comprise between 25 and 54 of rainfall depending on the degradation level souza et al 2015 da costa et al 2013 similarly to the effects on runoff our results show only a slight increase in soil moisture and et for higher stocking rates the biomass consumption by the livestock reduces the leaf area index the maximum evapotranspiration rate and the amount of transpiration this result is consistent with previous reports which show an increase in a bare soil evaporation bisigato and laphitz 2009 that resulted in a higher total annual evapotranspiration zhang et al 2019 under higher stocking rates generally in other water controlled environments with high atmospheric demands the evaporation may compensate for transpiration and et may not be significantly affected by animal grazing wang et al 2012 this suggests that the water balance may not be the first process to be affected by animal grazing especially on a short timescale some negative effects of grazing management on soil physical properties such as infiltration bulk density soil penetration resistance stavi et al 2011 and soil moisture zhao et al 2011 are reported to impact the upper 10 cm of the soil with the effect of grazing decreasing with soil depth stavi et al 2011 in addition higher grazing intensity can overload the ecosystem growth capacity and reduce biomass covered areas soil nutrients and soil organic carbon storage bakhshi et al 2019 oliveira filho et al 2019 schulz et al 2016 high stocking rates could cause long term changes to soil hydrological properties such as porosity and infiltration rates leading to further changes in rainfall partitioning and vegetation growth on the other hand woody plants may buffer the adverse effects of grazing on soil properties and keep infiltration higher than in open areas marquart et al 2019 although grazing did not significantly affect the water balance it did have a strong effect on the amount of vegetation biomass remaining at the end of the season fig 5 in addition to the grazing effects biomass production is also a function of total rainfall schaffer and rodriguez iturbe 2018 and its distribution during the wet season similar studies have found a variation in biomass production ranging between 2 288 and 1 205 kg ha 1 at the beginning and end of the wet season respectively araújo filho 2013 and liang et al 2018 have found that rainfall had a more substantial effect on vegetation biomass than did grazing intensity in addition to extent of vegetation and soil degradation due to grazing the bodyweight gain and anticipated revenue must also be taken into account when planning for cattle management according to holechek et al 2010 selection of the correct stocking rate is the most important of all grazing management decisions from the standpoint of vegetation livestock wildlife and economic return since the system is very sensitive to rainfall fluctuations a fixed stocking rate may not be the best option for optimizing the cattle weight and revenue because the results of our simulations are consistent with the maximum bodyweight observed by santana et al 2010 and also captured the negative weight gain depending on the stocking rate salviano et al 2004 we can apply this coupled hydrological vegetation animal model to simulate the system dynamics and reduce the uncertainties the recommended stocking rate in the caatinga ranges between 4 6 and 13 ha per animal in order to compensate for the low vegetation biomass density during the dry season salviano et al 2004 santana et al 2010 araújo filho 2013 using the model different scenarios can be simulated prior to and during the wet season to adjust the stocking rate during the year and optimize the resources based on observed rainfall we observed a slight reduction in maximum livestock weight for years with a higher amount of rainfall distributed over the same wet season duration this can happen especially if a large amount of water accelerates growth early in the season causing a detrimental impact on biomass production later in the season in this way the results of our simulations indicate that there is a certain amount of rainfall that maximizes total seasonal animal growth at high stocking rates it would be necessary to remove animals before the biomass decreases below a critical threshold to avoid degradation of biomass which would cause lower biomass growth in the following seasons fig 7 finally by applying the presented model it is possible to observe the equilibrium point between animal weight and vegetation biomass under steady state conditions of soil moisture and assimilation rate figs 8 and 9 once this equilibrium is reached there will be no changes in the animal weight unless external conditions change e g soil moisture or supplementation extra fodder this information may help guide the management strategies since depending on the assimilation rate no more bodyweight gain is expected and the farmer may decide to sell or adopt another management strategy to increase the revenue furthermore it is possible to calculate the time to reach the equilibrium conditions and determine whether it will occur within the wet season the model presented here can be used as a part of a warning system in order to prevent economic losses due to rainfall fluctuations such as that which occurred in the 2012 2013 drought in the semi arid region of brazil 5 conclusion the water balance of the caatinga ecosystem was only slightly affected by animal grazing with only 5 of total rainfall being redistributed to other loss components within one year under different management strategies on the other hand the grazing pressure on vegetation drastically reduced the biomass compared with the non grazed condition the optimal time to remove cattle from the ecosystem to maximize weight gain and profit was after the peak of the wet season and depending on the stocking rates and biomass production capacity the animals sometimes achieved a net weight loss at the end of the year in order to keep the animals grazing for a longer time it is necessary to provide much larger areas for food supply during the dry season the model presented here is sensitive to parameterization and rainfall fluctuations and when combined with rainfall forecasts it can act as a warning system to help in grazing management in addition it is possible to adjust the model for different areas and even for other species such as goats and sheep and to use its results to inform future experiments credit authorship contribution statement rodolfo

5367,climate change will likely trigger shifts in rainfall regimes that may intensify water scarcity in semi arid regions in the semi arid region of brazil the seasonally dry ecosystem is the primary source of forage for livestock because the correct stocking rate of livestock animals per area is not well understood overgrazing tends to advance rangeland degradation in this ecosystem this implies that the region may become even more vulnerable under changing rainfall regimes which in turn may exacerbate livestock and food insecurity we developed a coupled soil water balance vegetation and cattle biomass model to illustrate the impacts of rainfall seasonality on the dynamics of vegetation and animal growth the outcomes were simulated by considering different stocking rates and the timing of animal placement and removal from the rangeland a more pronounced reduction in vegetation biomass was found in grazed vs non grazed paddocks under strongly seasonal rainfall patterns the maximum animal weight gain decreases with average rainfall inter arrival time and increases with total annual rainfall thus a forecast of dry spells could benefit farmers in planning grazing management strategies our model can be used to test different management scenarios and give feedback for local herders and to guide future experiments to reduce the time and cost of acquiring data keywords ecohydrology soil moisture caatinga semi arid region 1 introduction in the semi arid region of ne brazil annual rainfall typically varies between 300 and 800 mm and is concentrated over 3 to 4 months in order to contend with rainfall seasonality the plants of the native seasonally dry tropical forest sdtf vegetation known as caatinga have developed various physiological adaptations with a deciduous strategy being found frequently among trees and shrubs sampaio 1995 after the first rainfall events of the wet season the vegetation can reestablish its canopy in about 15 days parente et al 2012 the plant density contributes to litter production and is strongly affected by rainfall amount particularly in the period occurring 60 to 90 days after the onset of the wet season lopes et al 2015 these physiological adaptations allow species in sdtfs to buffer some of the hydroclimatic variability souza et al 2016 in addition to the adversity of climate conditions human activities such as cattle raising and wood extraction can exert a strong external pressure on the ecosystem leal et al 2005 and may lead to ecosystem degradation due to overgrazing deforestation and inadequate land management menezes et al 2012 cattle raising can be carried out in grasslands where the natural vegetation was previously replaced by grasses or within the herbaceous plant community that grows under natural conditions after deforestation because most areas are not fenced these areas are used as extensive pastures for livestock essentially without any control and the stocking rates number of animals per area associated with native grasslands are high enough that they constitute a predatory extraction activity araújo filho 2013 high stocking rates are expected to cause an increase in soil compaction and erosion along with a decrease in nutrient and carbon stocks and cycling rates parente et al 2010 aubault et al 2015 schulz et al 2016 under rainfed conditions the biomass of both grassland and natural vegetation depends on the annual rainfall amount and distribution due to seasonality in biomass production large areas are required to supply all annual fodder requirements over the course of many years for example according to salviano et al 2004 a rangeland area at or above 13 3 ha animal 1 is necessary for reasonable results nevertheless a more reliable way to estimate vegetation biomass could produce better information to adjust the stocking rate in order to limit soil degradation and achieve greater vegetation and livestock productivity there are two primary strategies for raising cattle on the caatinga the first strategy involves leaving animals on the pasture year round while the second consists of placing animals on the field at the start of the rainy season and removing them some months later as studied in santana et al 2010 in either scenario livestock growth and pricing are subject to rainfall variability within each year which affect the maximum weight achieved and may necessitate an extra input of fodder increasing costs despite its importance for sustainable management of natural resources food and economic security few studies have addressed this topic some studies such as salviano et al 2004 and santana et al 2010 have measured the initial and final weight of the cattle under different stocking rates in native vegetation but there is a scarcity of data on changes in bodyweight over time since the whole vegetation cattle system is influenced by rainfall questions remain regarding how cattle management in this region can be optimized for different rainfall regimes this lack of information may be related to the costs of running experiments with livestock that also depend on rainfall and management strategies for representative results venter et al 2019 in addition there is little information on the hydrology of stdfs although it is known that the stocking rate can affect the water partitioning because of changes in leaf area index and soil compaction stavi et al 2011 byrnes et al 2018 thus we aimed to develop a coupled vegetation biomass animal growth and economic model based on a stochastic hydrological model rodríguez iturbe and porporato 2005 to simulate some scenarios of animal management under semi arid conditions then we address some related questions i what are the maximum biomass and revenue that can be attained under a given rainfall regime and ii what is the maximum time for which animals may be left grazing in the caatinga without incurring degradation of vegetation we also analyzed the stability of the vegetation and animal growth under constant soil moisture conditions to better understand the system dynamics 2 materials and methods this section is divided into three main subsections firstly the models are described beginning with hydrological components and including vegetation growth animal growth and economics section 2 1 secondly a description of the site and data collection is given in section 2 2 finally the biomass and ndvi relationships and model parameterization are described in section 2 3 2 1 modeling framework 2 1 1 soil water balance and vegetation growth model the soil water balance at the daily scale was modeled using a stochastic model given by rodríguez iturbe and porporato 2005 and laio et al 2001 considering a homogeneous soil profile and negligible lateral water fluxes the change in the soil water balance over time is given by 1 nz r ds t dt r t i r t q s t et s t l s t where n is the porosity z r is the depth of active soil or root depth s t is the relative soil moisture content at time t 0 s t 1 dimensionless averaged over the rooting depth i r t is the canopy interception and q r t s t is the runoff the portion of water that is infiltrated into soil is lost by evapotranspiration et s t and leakage l s t in this study we modeled canopy interception using an empirical relationship based on measured data in ne brazil izidio et al 2013 relating the plant phenology to biomass 2 i r φ φ r r r φ a r r r r r where r represents a threshold of rainfall that can be completely intercepted by vegetation r 0 5 cm a is an empirical slope coefficient equal to 0 10 based on izidio et al 2013 and φ is a parameter to adjust the canopy storage capacity which ranges from 0 to 1 and is given as 3 φ k 1 e k 2 b t b max where k 1 0 14 and k 2 1 96 based on costa et al 2001 evapotranspiration is a piecewise linear function of s t given by eq 4 of laio et al 2001 4 et s b t e w s s h s w s h s h s s w e w e max b t e w s s w s s w s w s s e max b t s s 1 where e w is the minimum evapotranspiration and e max b t is the maximum evapotranspiration for a given biomass b t s is the soil moisture and s h s w and s are the soil moisture at the hygroscopic point wilting point and a threshold below which et decreases linearity with s because of the variation of maximum evapotranspiration with biomass we assumed a linear relationship between available biomass and e max b t souza et al 2016 5 e max b t e max 0 1 η 2 b t b max 1 where b t represents the available biomass at a given time t and e max 0 is the average biomass over time we assumed the e w and e max 0 respectively to be equal to 0 05 and 0 5 cm day 1 based on souza et al 2016 the parameter η allows us to vary the intensity of the e max b feedback around e max 0 0 5 cm day 1 here we assumed η 0 40 so that e max could vary from 0 3 to 0 7 cm day 1 according to observed minimum and maximum biomass leakage losses are modelled as gravity drainage at the lowest boundary of the soil layer as 6 l s k s s 2 b 3 where k s is the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity cm day 1 b is the exponent of the soil retention curve ψ ψ s s b and ψ s is the suction at saturation clapp and hornberger 1978 the available biomass without grazing effects which affects the rate of evapotranspiration et was modeled according to souza et al 2016 as 7 db t dt k a a s b max b t k r b t where the maximum available biomass b max is related to the observed maximum and minimum ndvi see eq 14 k a is a constant associated with assimilation and k r a constant associated with respiration a s represents the gross normalized assimilation and is a piecewise linear function of soil moisture based on daly et al 2004 and feng et al 2012 8 a s 0 s s w s s w s s w s w s s 1 s s 1 this coupled soil water balance and vegetation model has performed well when comparing the simulation with data of soil moisture and ndvi in the semi arid region of brazil as shown in souza et al 2016 2 1 2 animal growth the animal growth depends on many factors such as animal genetics food and water availability and quality and environmental conditions assuming that some conditions are constant over time and for non limiting resources the bodyweight of an individual animal will increase up to the animal s maximum capacity the variation of weight of all animals c in time has a sigmoidal shape and can be expressed as 9 dc t dt k g c t 1 c t n c c max k d c t where k g and k d are parameters related to the increase and decrease of the animals weight c max is the maximum weight a single animal can reach and n c is the number of animals in this case because there was no food limitation the growth of animals depended mainly on genetics from now on we will use the term bodyweight to refer to the weight of a single animal or the average weight of many animals and the term cow weight or animal weight to refer to the weight of several animals to evaluate this model performance eq 9 we used the data acquired from lippke et al 2000 for different stocking rates in four irrigated wheat pastures the initial average weight of animals was 189 kg and they were weighed continuously every 28 days for 180 days with a maximum weight of about 376 kg fig 1 the model has shown good performance with a high coefficient of determination r 2 and low root mean square error rmse between the observed and modeled bodyweight fig 1 the parameters fitted to eq 9 based on data from lippke et al 2000 were k g 0 0103 k d 0 0014 c max 578 5 kg 2 1 3 animal growth under limited resources for the livestock in natural conditions where there is no irrigation the environmental conditions play an essential role in animal weight gain especially in semi arid regions where rainfall fluctuations have a substantial impact on water storage and fodder production because of rainfall seasonality and vegetation adaptation fodder availability b t should be taken into account to perform a more realistic modeling of animal growth considering a given amount of cows in the natural pasture e g caatinga the weight gain of individual cows also depends on the availability of grass and leaves furthermore as the cows gain weight the volume of grass and leaves will be reduced due to the consumption to represent the relative availability of fodder through the biomass we consider a relative fodder availability g b t as a function related to the biomass defined based on the net biomass and two thresholds b 0 1 b max and b 0 5 b max 10 g b t 0 b t b b t b b b b b t b 1 b t b thus eq 9 becomes 11 dc t dt g b t k g c t 1 c t n c c max k d c t once there are grazing effects on the system the feedback of livestock on vegetation is directly proportional to the total weight of animals c in the area we assume that n animals of equal weight c 0 n are initially introduced to the pasture thus the total bodyweight of the cows at time t is equal to c t following these assumptions eq 7 becomes 12 db t dt k a a s b max b t k r b t f c c t h b t b where f c is a fraction of daily consumption that ranges between 1 5 and 6 of the total animal weight h represents the heaviside step function so that the last term of eq 12 reduces the animals consumption when biomass is not available 2 1 4 economics we model the average price per kilogram of cattle as exponentially decreasing function of animal weight based on data from susana and ramirez 2016 the relationship is given by 13 p av p 0 p s exp rbw p s where bw is the weight of the individual cow in kg cow 1 and p 0 p s and r are parameters equal to 1 78 usd kg 1 1 3 usd kg 1 and 1 300 cow kg 1 respectively 2 2 site description and data collection we took the parameters of soil and vegetation as well as data series of rainfall and ndvi from a site located in the municipality of serra talhada 7 9681 s 38 3841 w in the semi arid region of ne brazil the vegetation at this site is characterized by dry spiny and predominantly deciduous shrub forest vegetation most of which are tree species with a height between 6 0 and 8 0 m da silva et al 2017 the mean annual rainfall is about 640 mm mainly distributed between the months of december to march and potential evapotranspiration is greater than 1 800 mm year 1 the soil is classified as luvisol with a sandy loam texture profile average followed by the standard deviation clay 11 87 3 33 silt 24 01 0 98 sand 64 12 2 61 in the 40 cm depth rainfall data at the daily scale were obtained from the pernambuco agency of water and climate apac we used the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to estimate biomass and the data were obtained from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images product mod13q1 with a spatial resolution of 250 m and recorded at 16 day intervals from google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 we removed very low and spurious ndvi values and those gaps were filled with the average between the anterior and posterior values 2 3 biomass and ndvi relationship the vegetation model described in section 2 1 1 was adapted from souza et al 2016 which simulates ndvi n t however since animals eat the leaves and fine shoots of plants it is necessary to convert n t into biomass in order to model the interactions between animal load and vegetation to achieve this we measured the litter every two weeks in the second half of the wet season of 2016 using 20 collectors of 0 5 m2 each randomly distributed in the caatinga the collected material was oven dried at 65 c for 48 h and then weighed to obtain the dry mass during the sampling period the ndvi ranged between 0 72 and 0 291 and the accumulated litter ranged between 43 and 1 990 kg ha 1 fig 2 a at the beginning of the measurement period the ndvi was high due to reflectance of green leaves and the litter was almost zero because of high water availability as the soil moisture decreased due to a lack of rainfall the ndvi reduced in an almost linear manner and the accumulated litter started to increase in this period there is a negative relationships between ndvi and accumulated litter the maximum ndvi implies the minimum litter and vice versa however high ndvi is indicative of greenness which means that food availability should also be high to simply the conversion of ndvi into biomass that could be grazed the accumulated litter series was inverted and defined as biomass fig 2b thus we can relate the net ndvi n t n min to the potential litterfall b in order to estimate the dry mass of edible leaves i e 14 b t κ n t n min where κ is a fitted constant equal to 4387 when compared to the litter data this shows a strong relationship with r 2 0 951 fig 2c a linear relationship between vegetation indices and the leaf area index lai was found by miranda et al 2020 in the caatinga area which supports our assumption that vegetation reflectance may be converted into biomass using a linear equation the parameters for the models described in section 2 1 are shown in table 1 the simulations were performed for each hydrological year as defined in feng et al 2013 and the results were interpreted at the daily timescale we did not consider the effects of previous years grazing and the simulated grazing began 15 days after a rainfall event of at least 1 0 cm we simulated the same year five times considering the number of animals ha 1 n c equal to 0 1 2 3 and 4 each starting with 180 kg these stocking rates are exceedingly high compared with the recommended rate which is between 6 and 10 hectares per animal salviano et al 1982 however the available biomass that we considered here is also higher than that reported in some experiments our main goal here was to simulate the trajectories and interactions of water balance biomass animal growth and economics for different management strategies to accomplish this two management scenarios were considered both assuming that each individual animal starts at 180 kg at the beginning of grazing in the first scenario the animals stay in the area all year long while in the second one more animals start grazing but they are removed when their maximum weights have been reached all simulations were performed using the python programming language python software foundation 2019 the model code is available at https github com rodolfomssouza wavegrad 3 results 3 1 effects of grazing on hydrology in a typical hydrological year the bulk of the total rainfall 62 3 cm is mainly distributed during the period from january to april days 121 to 241 fig 3 a the mean rainfall event was 0 7 cm and only 21 of the events registered in this year were greater than 1 0 cm the maximum rain event was 5 2 cm after the first rainfall events around day 60 there was a dry spell between days 70 and 125 which was reflected in soil moisture and evapotranspiration the simulated soil moisture ranged between the hygroscopic point s h 0 10 and a maximum value of 0 53 fig 3b this maximum value was not affected by cattle grazing however there was a slight effect of the amount of cattle on the rate of soil moisture decay although some rainfall events occurred after the rainy season most of them were smaller than 0 5 cm and the soil moisture remained close to the hygroscopic point s h evapotranspiration showed a similar seasonal variation fig 3c in the periods with higher water availability maximum et was higher for the condition with no animals but during the soil drying process et was slightly higher if there were animals grazing in general for this set of scenarios the water balance was not significantly affected by grazing management and only small variations were observed in hydrologic fluxes fig 4 in the annual water balance et was the main loss component as is typical for semi arid regions it ranged between 78 5 and 83 2 of the total rainfall for n c 0 and n c 4 respectively the et was partitioned into a non stressed condition et ns when s was higher than s and a stressed condition et s when s was lower than s there was a small increase in both et ns and et s with grazing intensity the canopy interception i decreased with grazing intensity due to the dependence of interception on vegetation biomass fig 4 in this case i varied between 13 4 and 10 1 cm for n c 0 and n c 4 respectively the difference in rainfall interception between the non grazed and heavily grazed scenarios represents about 5 3 of annual rainfall and once infiltrated into the soil it results in more favorable conditions for evapotranspiration without increasing water loss by leakage there was an increase in total et representing 4 8 of rainfall due to the 5 3 decrease in i which was allocated into et ns when there were more animals in the area due to the relatively low soil moisture leakage l represented less than 1 of total rainfall in all management conditions 3 2 effects of rainfall fluctuations on biomass and economics although changes in the grazing intensity did not significantly affect the ecosystem water balance at the annual timescale it strongly affected the vegetation biomass fig 5 a maximum vegetation growth occurred under the non grazed condition n c 0 with biomass reaching a total of 2391 kg ha 1 because of the consumption of vegetation by livestock which is about 3 of bodyweight daily vegetation biomass was up to 1136 kg ha 1 lower under a high stocking rate than in the non grazed condition after the end of the wet season grazing effects on vegetation became more evident and larger differences in biomass were observed fig 5a shows that biomass would decrease to a level close to zero if more than one animal were kept grazing the more animals there are in the area the sooner it would be necessary to remove them to prevent degradation of vegetation the animals should be removed from the area around day 258 for n c 1 and day 239 for n c 4 the animal growth at the daily scale is shown in fig 5b once grazing has started animal growth is also affected by dry spells which occur during the wet season the maximum bodyweight bw max was reached after the peak of rainfall and vegetation growth for all grazing intensities and was earlier at higher grazing intensities comparing n c 1 with n c 4 there was a difference of 19 days between bw max in these conditions the mean bw max values were 258 248 242 and 239 kg respectively for 1 2 3 and 4 animals ha 1 the rate of livestock weight gain was only somewhat influenced by grazing intensity from the beginning of grazing to bw max there was an average daily gain varying between 0 54 and 0 50 kg day 1 for n c 1 and n c 4 respectively which represents about an 8 difference the maximum gain per animal was 0 75 kg day 1 regardless of the stocking rate on the other hand after the wet season livestock lost weight more quickly with higher grazing intensity the average rate of decrease was 0 66 kg animal 1 day 1 for n c 1 and 0 77 kg animal 1 day 1 for n c 4 fig 5b a difference of about 14 it is important to note that if animals stay in the area year round stocking rates of more than one animal ha 1 in addition to being most likely causing vegetation degradation will also result in lower animal weight at the end than at the beginning of grazing after the animals reach bw max they start to lose weight fig 5b since rainfall and soil moisture are already low fig 3a b if animals remain in the area until the end of the year the final weight would be 181 161 149 and 140 kg animal 1 respectively for 1 2 3 and 4 animals ha 1 thus more animals still have more total weight but this management can compromise the vegetation and biomass production for future growing seasons in terms of revenue the results suggest that a maximum of 1 2 cows ha 1 may be left on the pasture year round without incurring losses due to decreased bodyweight and possibly death of the animals fig 5c there is little difference in the final revenue for a stocking rate of one vs two cows ha 1 and since the analysis does not account for the risk of death and other incidental costs a maximum stocking rate of less than 1 cow ha 1 is preferred for year round management in order to maximize revenue in the scenario where the animals do not stay in the area all year a substantially higher stocking rate may prove more profitable fig 5b if cattle are removed and sold at the maximum bodyweight the anticipated revenue increases with the stocking rate for up to 10 animals ha 1 although the marginal revenue drastically decreases for stocking rates above 4 5 cows ha 1 the optimal selling time also decreases with stocking rate from around 180 days after the cows are first introduced with 1 cow ha 1 to around 160 days after they are introduced with 10 cows ha 1 for stocking rates as low as 1 cow ha 1 the anticipated revenue when selling cows near the end of the rainy season vs some months later is much higher suggesting that the best management strategy under these stocking rates is to keep the cows on the caatinga for only 4 5 months to evaluate the effect of interannual rainfall variability and seasonality on animal growth we examined maximum bodyweight as a function of total rainfall and the average rainfall interarrival time 1 λ for 18 hydrological years between 2000 and 2019 fig 6 during this period annual rainfall varied between 26 2 and 90 4 cm which is equivalent to 51 and 175 of the mean annual rainfall respectively the maximum animal weight showed a strong sensitivity to total rainfall increasing with total rainfall up to a certain limit which occurred around 70 cm yr 1 fig 6 depending on the stocking rate when rainfall was higher than average bw max either reached a plateau or decreased this relationship can be described using quadratic regressions with a coefficient of correlation r 2 varying between 0 831 and 0 726 in addition to the total rainfall amount bw max was affected by the mean rainfall interarrival time 1 λ bw max decreased linearly as the average time between rainfall events increased fig 6 however the correlation between bw max and 1 λ was smaller than that with total rainfall overall these results show that the interaction between hydrology vegetation and animal growth has a strong sensitivity to rainfall fluctuations which is mediated by livestock management 3 3 simulation of higher stocking rates in order to show how livestock management affects the vegetation we have simulated the trajectories of the vegetation biomass animal growth and revenue after removing the animals when they reached maximum weight fig 7 under higher stocking rates the vulnerability to rainfall fluctuations increased since any dry spell which occurs after animals start grazing can significantly reduce vegetation biomass as well as the livestock bodyweight this kind of management under rainfall fluctuation also poses more risk to the expected revenue as showed in the previous simulation fig 5 bw max is reached earlier for higher stocking rates fig 7 when the animals are removed from the area vegetation can regain some biomass if more rainfall events occur before the dry season begins although total bodyweight is higher for higher stocking rates the average bw max decreases when more animals are grazing at the same time in this way the revenue is also affected by the stocking rate and for 7 10 animals the resulting revenue is very similar 3 4 dynamics of animal biomass interaction fig 8 shows the phase space dynamics of the vegetation biomass eq 12 and and bodyweight of animals eq 11 when soil moisture levels are constant in time with no stochastic rainfall forcing the red dots represent fixed stable points to which the system tends to converge regardless of initial conditions the minimum relative assimilation rate a s eq 8 required for animals to at least maintain their initial weight 180 kg is about 0 2 for sandy soil the soil moisture level which produces this relative assimilation rate is equal to 0 16 the stable values of vegetation biomass and animal bodyweight increase quickly with the relative assimilation rate and the stable bodyweight with maximum relative assimilation is about 310 kg ha 1 in all scenarios of assimilation rates 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 there is an almost vertical trajectory which results in animals attaining the stable bodyweight with almost no change in vegetation biomass for the assimilation rate of 0 2 if the initial conditions of vegetation biomass are low the animal will rapidly lose weight afterward its weight will increase up to the stable point which is around 180 kg in this case on the other hand if the initial vegetation biomass and the initial animal bodyweight are high above the fixed point there will first be a reduction in biomass and then a reduction in the animal weight in this scenario even though the soil moisture provides conditions for substantial vegetation growth it would be challenging to have an overall gain of animal bodyweight since the stable point is only about 180 kg we summarized the fixed points of vegetation biomass and animal weight for assimilation rates ranging between 0 2 and 1 0 in fig 9 higher assimilation rates increase the equilibrium point as shown in fig 8 and since it is not a linear increase there is an optimal tradeoff point between water inputs soil moisture vegetation and animal weight gain considering the highest assimilation rate a s 1 the equilibrium point between vegetation and animal weight is reached with 2361 kg of biomass and a bodyweight of 308 kg in such condition if the animal started with 180 kg there would be a gain of 128 kg during its lifetime 4 discussion in this study we have developed a modeling approach to simulate the hydrology vegetation cattle system dynamics applied to the semi arid region of brazil two scenarios of grazing management were simulated and analyzed based on their effects on hydrology vegetation biomass cattle weight and economic outcomes the rainfall distribution over the wet season especially at the beginning of this season controls the dynamics of all water balance components and vegetation biomass production the amount of water in the first rainfall events of the season will trigger the leaf flushing in many caatinga species this will serve as an indicator of the timing of fodder availability when the animals can be placed in the caatinga area to start grazing our coupled modeling approach shows that the partitioning of main water fluxes runoff drainage and et was not significantly affected by animal grazing at the annual timescale the grazing intensity redistributed about 5 of rainfall into different water loss components and had a negligible effect on the soil moisture figs 3 and 4 these results are consistent with previous findings of water balance in the caatinga for example runoff usually represents less than 0 5 of rainfall and it is more dependent on rainfall intensity de figueiredo et al 2016 although low runoff is also observed in grasslands of semi arid regions hoshino et al 2009 in other management settings the grazing intensity may lead to greater vegetation degradation and runoff may comprise between 25 and 54 of rainfall depending on the degradation level souza et al 2015 da costa et al 2013 similarly to the effects on runoff our results show only a slight increase in soil moisture and et for higher stocking rates the biomass consumption by the livestock reduces the leaf area index the maximum evapotranspiration rate and the amount of transpiration this result is consistent with previous reports which show an increase in a bare soil evaporation bisigato and laphitz 2009 that resulted in a higher total annual evapotranspiration zhang et al 2019 under higher stocking rates generally in other water controlled environments with high atmospheric demands the evaporation may compensate for transpiration and et may not be significantly affected by animal grazing wang et al 2012 this suggests that the water balance may not be the first process to be affected by animal grazing especially on a short timescale some negative effects of grazing management on soil physical properties such as infiltration bulk density soil penetration resistance stavi et al 2011 and soil moisture zhao et al 2011 are reported to impact the upper 10 cm of the soil with the effect of grazing decreasing with soil depth stavi et al 2011 in addition higher grazing intensity can overload the ecosystem growth capacity and reduce biomass covered areas soil nutrients and soil organic carbon storage bakhshi et al 2019 oliveira filho et al 2019 schulz et al 2016 high stocking rates could cause long term changes to soil hydrological properties such as porosity and infiltration rates leading to further changes in rainfall partitioning and vegetation growth on the other hand woody plants may buffer the adverse effects of grazing on soil properties and keep infiltration higher than in open areas marquart et al 2019 although grazing did not significantly affect the water balance it did have a strong effect on the amount of vegetation biomass remaining at the end of the season fig 5 in addition to the grazing effects biomass production is also a function of total rainfall schaffer and rodriguez iturbe 2018 and its distribution during the wet season similar studies have found a variation in biomass production ranging between 2 288 and 1 205 kg ha 1 at the beginning and end of the wet season respectively araújo filho 2013 and liang et al 2018 have found that rainfall had a more substantial effect on vegetation biomass than did grazing intensity in addition to extent of vegetation and soil degradation due to grazing the bodyweight gain and anticipated revenue must also be taken into account when planning for cattle management according to holechek et al 2010 selection of the correct stocking rate is the most important of all grazing management decisions from the standpoint of vegetation livestock wildlife and economic return since the system is very sensitive to rainfall fluctuations a fixed stocking rate may not be the best option for optimizing the cattle weight and revenue because the results of our simulations are consistent with the maximum bodyweight observed by santana et al 2010 and also captured the negative weight gain depending on the stocking rate salviano et al 2004 we can apply this coupled hydrological vegetation animal model to simulate the system dynamics and reduce the uncertainties the recommended stocking rate in the caatinga ranges between 4 6 and 13 ha per animal in order to compensate for the low vegetation biomass density during the dry season salviano et al 2004 santana et al 2010 araújo filho 2013 using the model different scenarios can be simulated prior to and during the wet season to adjust the stocking rate during the year and optimize the resources based on observed rainfall we observed a slight reduction in maximum livestock weight for years with a higher amount of rainfall distributed over the same wet season duration this can happen especially if a large amount of water accelerates growth early in the season causing a detrimental impact on biomass production later in the season in this way the results of our simulations indicate that there is a certain amount of rainfall that maximizes total seasonal animal growth at high stocking rates it would be necessary to remove animals before the biomass decreases below a critical threshold to avoid degradation of biomass which would cause lower biomass growth in the following seasons fig 7 finally by applying the presented model it is possible to observe the equilibrium point between animal weight and vegetation biomass under steady state conditions of soil moisture and assimilation rate figs 8 and 9 once this equilibrium is reached there will be no changes in the animal weight unless external conditions change e g soil moisture or supplementation extra fodder this information may help guide the management strategies since depending on the assimilation rate no more bodyweight gain is expected and the farmer may decide to sell or adopt another management strategy to increase the revenue furthermore it is possible to calculate the time to reach the equilibrium conditions and determine whether it will occur within the wet season the model presented here can be used as a part of a warning system in order to prevent economic losses due to rainfall fluctuations such as that which occurred in the 2012 2013 drought in the semi arid region of brazil 5 conclusion the water balance of the caatinga ecosystem was only slightly affected by animal grazing with only 5 of total rainfall being redistributed to other loss components within one year under different management strategies on the other hand the grazing pressure on vegetation drastically reduced the biomass compared with the non grazed condition the optimal time to remove cattle from the ecosystem to maximize weight gain and profit was after the peak of the wet season and depending on the stocking rates and biomass production capacity the animals sometimes achieved a net weight loss at the end of the year in order to keep the animals grazing for a longer time it is necessary to provide much larger areas for food supply during the dry season the model presented here is sensitive to parameterization and rainfall fluctuations and when combined with rainfall forecasts it can act as a warning system to help in grazing management in addition it is possible to adjust the model for different areas and even for other species such as goats and sheep and to use its results to inform future experiments credit authorship contribution statement rodolfo

5368,climate change increases the uncertainties associated with the future urban stormwater management this study employed the personal computer stormwater management model to evaluate the impact of climate change on problems associated with stormwater management at the city scale these include urban flooding non point source nps pollution and combined sewer overflow cso pollution multiple methods were adopted to overcome the difficulties when building credible modellings time partitioning and sectional difference were used during the calibration of hydrological and hydraulic parameters the groundwater river infiltration was assessed via extensive monitoring the field rainfall simulator system was used to determine nps parameters promising adaptions of sponge city construction in response to climate change were further evaluated the adaption strategies were set in strict accordance with the sponge city construction systematization program the results showed that future climate change will increase the urban flooding risk both nps and cso pollution loads and will worsen river water quality sponge city construction was demonstrated to be a no regrets adaption strategy toward the reduction of the combined pressures induced by changing climate however the adaptability was insufficient and varies largely with regard to concentration pathways rainfall intensities and pollutants in best case scenarios the flooding risk as well as diffuse pollution loads can be decreased to or below their current level under future climate change however the current level needs to be considered since the urban drainage function was far from sufficient and the water quality was very poor the increased nps pollution risk was noticed after sponge city construction especially for chemical oxygen demand and suspended solids the increased nps loads could even offset the decreased cso pollution loads thus flexibility is suggested to be allowed in the design of storm drainage and pollution control measures in future urban stormwater management keywords climate change drainage modeling urban flooding diffuse pollution 1 introduction the management of urban stormwater has become a common theme that has been recognized across the world because of its potential for diverse damages and societal impacts jiang et al 2018 obropta and kardos 2007 in china a series of urban stormwater issues e g urban flooding non point source nps pollution combined sewer overflow cso pollution and water shortages strongly threaten human security in light of the rapid and continuous urban development since 2008 hundreds of cities e g beijing wuhan shanghai and shenzhen were almost annually affected by flooding disasters jiang et al 2018 shi et al 2007 xia et al 2017 xu et al 2018 related nps and cso pollutants are increasingly discharged into and degrade urban rivers shen et al 2010 murla et al 2016 in 2014 the chinese government announced a national initiative which introduced sponge cities as a holistic strategy to overcome the problems associated with urban stormwater issues mohurd 2014 climate change has imposed many uncertainties and new challenges on stormwater management chan et al 2018 changes in climatic conditions such as shifted precipitation patterns increased rainfall intensity and more extreme rainfall events will directly affect the quantity and quality of stormwater and thus the effect of management astaraie imani et al 2012 xia et al 2017 it is of significance to evaluate the impact of climate change on the joint pressures originating from flooding nps pollution and cso pollution moreover in light of the impacts of the continuing climate change it is questionable whether the sponge city constructions will be able to solve every urban stormwater issue that arises in the future it is more realistic to expect a gradual and continuous change based on feedback on what needs to be improved in the future to implement such a highly ambitious program as the sponge city concept previous research addressed the assessment of the impact of climate change mainly on watershed hydrology and water quality franco et al 2018 yang et al 2018 urban stormwater modeling bears many complexities e g inherent complexity of stormwater quality processes data collection and model calibration obropta kardos 2007 the available data rarely enable a satisfactory calibration and validation of the nps models hou et al 2019a kanso et al 2003 the complex urban conditions e g the coexistence of combined and separate drainage systems and severe pipeline defects are complicated and difficult to express consequently the impact assessment of climate change has hitherto concentrated on hydrology in urban areas egger and maurer 2015 moghadas et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 few studies examined future trends in stormwater quality or pollutant release from overflows in response to the changing climate borris et al 2013 semadeni davies et al 2008 however little research addressed the joint pressures of flooding drainage capacity as well as nps and cso pollutions to generate a comprehensive understanding of the impact of future climate change on urban stormwater management especially due to the complex conditions problems associated with the adoption of relevant strategy at city scale and a lack of drainage data research regarding city scale adaption assessment is difficult and therefore basically non existent therefore the main objectives of this paper were to 1 provide inspiration for urban stormwater models by adopting multiple methods to express complex urban factors and to determine simulation parameters 2 explore the responses of urban stormwater systems urban flooding risk as well as nps and cso pollution to climate change 3 verify if sponge city construction can mitigate the increasing risk of flooding and diffuse pollution at the city scale under future climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area qian an is located in the northeast of the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration and belongs to hebei province fig 1 the topography is high in the northwest and lower in the southeast the region has a warm and semi humid continental climate with an annual mean temperature of 10 3 c the annual mean precipitation is approximately 672 mm with 80 occurring during the rainy season from june to september because of the inter annual variation of precipitation and the uneven precipitation distribution within a year rainstorms or continuous rains occur frequently during summer which often cause floods qian an was selected as the only city within the first batch of sponge city pilot in north china in 2014 qian an suffers from the typical problems of many other cities in china for example fast urbanization and outdated drainage system severe pipeline defects frequent urban flooding and poor water quality the built up area of qian an occupies an area of 2500 ha approximately 49 of which are residential zones and 20 9 are green areas and open spaces the pilot area for the sponge city project is located in the central area with a total area of 2150 ha accounting for 86 of the built up area of the city this area includes 700 ha of old urban area and 1450 ha of new urban area as shown in fig 1 the central and northeast areas of the city are served by a combined sewer system and the sewer mains are buried along the sanli river with six overflow orifices overflows occur frequently and are associated with heavy rainfall events during summer the western and southern areas of the city are served by a separate storm sewer system consisting of sewer pipes that range in size from 0 3 to 1 8 m a hobo automated weather station onset bourne ma usa was installed in the study area to record meteorological data atmospheric pressure temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and rainfall were recorded at 1 min intervals 2 2 model construction 2 2 1 storm water management model set up the usepa s storm water management model swmm was first developed in 1971 and has experienced several major upgrades since then as a dynamic hydrology hydraulic water quantity and quality simulation model swmm has been used in many sewer and storm water studies across the world tsihrintzis and hamid 1998 zhou et al 2019 the personal computer stormwater management model pcswmm was developed by computational hydraulics international chi based on swmm engines pcswmm provides user friendly pre and post processors that decrease input errors and offer tools to improve the understanding of results consequently pcswmm was selected for this study the catchment was first delineated according to the digital elevation model dem processed from a 1 10000 topographic map using arcgis 10 2 environmental systems research institute inc redlands ca usa further delineation was conducted based on the sewer network layer using the thiessen polygon function and was adjusted based on the land use map the subcatchment runoff was assigned to the sewer system through the sewer inlet which was closest to the subcatchment area centroid borris et al 2013 a total of 472 subcatchments were finally obtained the area of these subcatchments ranged from 0 068 ha to 39 56 ha fig 2 2 2 2 expression of the urban complex condition both combined and separate drainage systems coexist in qian an according to the results of geophysical prospecting severe groundwater river infiltration affects the study area especially for the sewer mains along the river therefore the following boundary conditions are required in the model the discharge data of domestic sewage during the dry season and the infiltration of groundwater river a monitoring network covering the pollution source pipeline network sewage treatment plant was set up including a total of 26 monitoring sites two residential districts which constructed a combined sewer system and a separate sewer system were monitored the key nodes of sewer pipeline including 16 nodes of combined sewer system 7 nodes of separate sewer system and the waste water treatment plant wwtp were also monitored online flowmeters fl900 hach loveland colorado usa were installed to record the flow data manual samplings lasted for 7 days with a sampling frequency of 2 h based on the monitoring results the per capita sewage discharge was calculated to be 155 l person day the sewage discharge i e population per capita sewage discharge volume was added at the corresponding sewage inflow points the average concentrations of chemical oxygen demand codcr nitrogen ammonia nh3 n total phosphorus tp and suspended solids ss were 334 0 mg l 92 3 mg l 7 3 mg l and 79 mg l respectively the groundwater river infiltration of each monitored node was calculated by comparing the theoretical sewage discharge volume calculated by population within the catchment area of this node with the monitored sewage discharge volume the groundwater river infiltration of the whole sewage system was identified as 32 5 more details can be found in hou et al 2019b then groundwater river infiltration was allocated to nodes in the model based on the calculation results 2 3 parameter determination 2 3 1 hydrological and hydraulic parameters most of the physical catchment parameters such as catchment area and percentage of impervious area were derived from land use data by arcgis the subcatchment slope was estimated by dem diameter length and slope of pipelines were derived from network data the other hydrological and hydraulic parameters were separately calibrated for dry season and rainy season matlab version 7 1 www mathworks com was used to sample the values in the swmm input file within the calibration ranges the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used to evaluate the fitness between measured data and simulated data during the dry season the manning s roughness for conduit n cdry which indicates the degree of pipeline roughness was calibrated and validated according to the swmm manual the calibration ranged from 0 010 to 0 020 and the calibrated value was 0 012 the simulated and observed sewage flow during the dry season in both the calibration period 2017 11 28 2017 12 4 and the validation period 2017 12 2017 12 11 was presented fig s1 in the in the supplementary material the nses were 0 9017 and 0 9448 for calibration period and validation period respectively during the rainy season parameter sensitivity was tested by using the sensitivity based radio tuning calibration srtc function of pcswmm which designates uncertainty percent rankings for each parameter of interest parameter depression storage impervious s imperv depression storage pervious s perv and the percentage of impervious area with no depression storage zero imperv were found to be insensitive and were set to 4 mm 8 mm and 15 respectively following the swmm user manual horton infiltration parameters maximum infiltration rate maxrate minimum infiltration rate minrate and decay rate with moderate sensitivity were calibrated according to the field rainfall data of the green area as described in section 2 3 2 by adjusting the values of infiltration parameters the relative errors of simulated and calculated runoff coefficients of green area were 6 7 and 1 3 for 3 and 5 year return period rainfall events respectively the values of maxrate minrate and decay rate were 120 mm h 12 mm h and 4 h 1 respectively the four parameters width parameter k width and the manning s roughness for pervious n perv for impervious n imperv and for conduit n cwet were selected as the most sensitive parameters and were subjected to auto calibration by matlab considering the differences between catchment and pipeline network characteristics of old and new urban districts these parameters were separately calibrated for old and new urban districts during the rainy season table s1 in the supplementary material in this calibration the nse ranged from 0 529 to 0 873 for old urban districts while new urban districts achieved better simulation results the nse values in validation were all above 0 5 which indicates an acceptable prediction accuracy moriasi et al 2007 fig s2 and fig s3 in the supplementary material present the typical measured and predicted hydrographs during both calibration and validation 2 3 2 non point source pollution parameters nps pollutants were simulated according to runoff volume and catchment antecedent conditions i e antecedent dry periods street cleaning frequency and land use four metrics including codcr nh3 n tp and ss were simulated the build up and wash off mechanisms formed the main model for the water quality simulation in swmm rossman

completely mixed first order decay model runoff flow was rapid and was only present in the pipeline for a very short time thus the attenuation of pollutants was not considered zoppou 2001 and rauch et al 2002 argued that the lack of data is a greater hindrance for stormwater quality models than the lack of suitable algorithms the rainfall in the study area is concentrated during the rainy season with sudden onset and mostly occurring at night therefore it is difficult to capture effective rainfall runoff data consequently a field rainfall simulator system was used for rainfall runoff experiments fig s4 it is consisted of water supply unit supercharging and control unit and water spray unit the rainfall area can reach 0 01 ha adjustable according to the demand the rainfall height can reach 3 5 6 m and the rainfall intensity ranges 6 250 mm h three underlying surfaces of the field including green area roof and road with areas of 0 01 ha for each were used for artificial rainfall simulation at least 3 days of pollution accumulation on the underlying surfaces were included before each experiment a total of 15 rainfall events with a group of return periods including 0 3 0 5 1 2 and 3 year events were simulated the local rainfall intensity formula was used to define the rainfall intensity 3 q 4098 06 1 0 9021 lg p t 20 798 0 840 where q represents the rainfall intensity mm min t represents the rainfall duration min and p represents the return period year onsite automatic flow monitoring devices fl900 hach loveland co usa were installed at outfall of each site to monitor the flow rate and water level at 5 min intervals once runoff was initiated samples were manually collected at 5 min intervals during the first 30 min of the rainfall event which was followed by 10 min intervals for the next 30 60 min subsequently samples were collected at 30 min intervals until runoff had ceased after sampling the samples were transported to the laboratory for codcr nh3 n tp and ss analyses using standard methods apha 2012 four parameters c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 for each land use type roof green area and road were determined via latin hypercube sampling 10000 times table s2 in the supplementary material the parameter sets with the best performance in terms of nse were selected to make the parameters applicable to all rainfall types the data for each underlying surface type were pooled together in the process the predictions with these parameters performed well for all pollutants except for nh3 n for roads with an nse of 0 30 the model performance for green areas was most excellent and the nse values reached up to 0 9 therefore the adopted artificial rainfall simulator system provided a realistic method for runoff data collection especially for manual monitoring which is the main monitoring method in china figs s5 s7 in the supplementary material present the detailed pollutgraphs in the process of parameter determination 2 3 3 low impact development parameters lids are represented in the pcswmm model via parameterization of several vertical layers the lid parameters of these layers can be divided into two categories structural parameters such as thickness and porosity and non structural parameters such as surface roughness seepage rate field capacity wilting point and conductivity table s3 in the supplementary material the values of structural parameters were basically obtained from design drawings to accurately express each lid practice the parameter conductivity of the soil layer greatly influenced the simulation results and it was measured using the double loop method the rest of the non structural parameters were determined according to the annual total runoff control rate atrcr in pilot areas it is reasonable to assume that the key target of sponge city could be reached otherwise the question of how well sponge city construction can respond to climate change is not meaningful 2 4 sponge city construction the primary aims of sponge city construction are to decrease runoff delay peak flows and mitigate nps pollution the atrcr of the qian an pilot area was calculated and set to 76 the annual nps pollution load control rate was set to 45 in terms of ss the sponge city construction scenario was set up in complete accordance with the sponge city construction system plan therefore the landing sponge city construction scenario instead of imaging adoption scenario was assessed the entire measures of sponge city contain the source control practices the gray infrastructure system for midway control and the terminal control approaches the total area of lid implementation is 1283 96 ha including 727 20 ha of residential areas 206 07 ha of public buildings 350 69 ha of parks and green areas 479 21 ha of unused land and 236 54 ha of roads the different lid amounts implemented in each subcatchment ranged from 0 to 23 bio retention cells infiltration trenches permeable pavements rain barrels and vegetative wales were included the drainage system rehabilitation and renovation were implemented as midway control measures a total of 102 km of pipeline was dredged and repaired combined sewer separation projects were designed for drainage and water quality benefits a total of 18 pipelines were renovated including stormwater and sewage pipelines the intercepting sewer system was also restored and only one overflow orifice remained after restoration to further solve the csos problems a terminal storage with a volume of 9696 m3 was defined in the sponge city construction systematization program 2 5 future climate change the projections of climate change effects were obtained using bias corrected climate from gcm from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 archive hadgem2 es under three representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 were considered rcp 2 6 assumes that the greenhouse gases peak during 2010 2020 and then substantially decline which represent the climate mitigation scenario rcp 4 5 assumes that greenhouse gases peak around 2040 then decline which represent the medium emission scenario rcp 8 5 assumes that greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise throughout the 21st century which exhibits the highest levels of forcing and the largest possibility of climate change qiu et al 2019 the benefit of climate mitigation for reducing flood and pollution risks could be represented by comparing the projections under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 with rcp8 5 watch forcing data wfd weedon et al 2011 for the period from 1960 to 1999 was used as reference period firstly an additive approach which preserves the absolute changes for temperature and a multiplicative approach which preserves the relative changes for precipitation were applied to adjust for differences between the monthly mean gcm data and wfd data over the reference period parametric quantile mapping was then applied to the residual or normalized data to adjust the daily variability of gcm data to match the climatology of the wfd the monthly correction factors were interpolated toward daily factors and were applied to future periods this obtained the projected gcm data for future periods the details of this bias correction method are described in hempel et al 2013 considering the notable uncertainties associated with climate model simulations the impact of climate change on extreme precipitation intensities was represented using a change factor cf methodology which was commonly used in previous urban drainage modelling studies kaspersen et al 2017 rosbjerg 2017 willems et al 2012 zhou et al 2019 cf was estimated as the relative difference between the outputs of the climate model i e extreme precipitation intensities for future and present day conditions for a range of return periods the distribution of the generalized extreme value gev was then separately fitted to the two sets of daily values coles 2001 katz et al 2002 4 g z μ σ ε e x p 1 ε z μ σ 1 ε where μ σ and ε represent the location scale and shape parameters respectively the maximum likelihood method was used to estimate the fitting parameters of gev distribution the likelihood function of which is 5 l xq x n μ σ ε l n σ 1 ε y i e y i 6 y i 1 ε ln 1 ε x i μ σ ε 0 x i μ σ ε 0 then the extreme value of return periods was estimated by the follow formula 7 x p μ σ ε 1 log 1 p ε ε 0 μ σ l o g log 1 p ε 0 where μ σ and ε represent the estimated location scale and shape parameters respectively the cfs were calculated for each return period and the future climate simulations were divided by historical climate simulations then the cfs are applied to the statistic of present day design precipitation events yielding the characteristics of future precipitation two hour rainfall time series were assigned according to the local rainfall intensity formula 2 6 simulations the first step was a vulnerability assessment which was used to determine the impacts of climate change without any adaptation simulations across various return periods 2 3 5 10 20 50 and 100 years under historical and three projected climate change scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were performed the simulation results from historical climate and before sponge city construction were used as baseline for comparison to reflect the impacts of climate change on urban flooding and diffused pollution the second step consisted of an adaption assessment to determine the effect of the respective sponge city construction except for the climate scenarios during the first step above two city scenarios were considered before and after sponge city construction the simulation results from historical climate data and before sponge city construction were also used as baseline to evaluate the adaption potential of sponge city construction 3 results and discussion 3 1 future climate projections the nonparametric mann kendall mk test kendall 1975 mann 1945 was used to determine the significance of trends in annual precipitation and annual mean temperature from 2020 to 2099 as shown in table 1 significant uptrends in annual precipitation under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 scenarios were observed at the 5 significance level annual mean temperature increased significantly under all future scenarios the other studies obtained similar results in the north china xiao et al 2020 the cfs were estimated as the relative difference between the extreme precipitation intensities for future and present day conditions as shown in fig 3 the extreme precipitation intensities increased largely under future climate change cf values were in the ranges of 1 268 1 291 1 356 1 708 and 1 433 1 876 for the pathways of rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively consistent with other studies there is a large uncertainty bound associated with the cfs under different rcps zhou et al 2019 3 2 urban flooding risk under future climate it has generally been acknowledged that urban pluvial and flooding will increase through climate change herslund et al 2016 miller hutchins 2017 moore et al 2016 in the present study although differences exist among climate projections negative impacts of climate change on urban flood conditions became clear with increasing values of total inflow volume tiv and total flood volume tfv for all return periods in comparison to baseline i e the historical climate fig 4 a and 4b compared with baseline the average change rate of tivs ranged from 33 58 to 47 23 at various return periods with a peak at the 20 year return period fig 4c the average increase of tfv ranged from 81 16 to 98 87 which exceeds that of tivs this poses an enormous challenge to the current drainage system which has been designed based on a certain return period clearly the drainage system of the city faces severe capacity problems in coping with the increasing amount of water because of the impacts of climate change in line with previous results the benefits of climate change mitigation toward reducing urban floods became evident kaspersen et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 the simulated tivs and tfvs were much larger under rcp 8 5 i e a business as usual scenario than under rcp 2 6 i e a climate change mitigation scenario fig 4a and fig 4b notably the uncertainty bound associated with different scenarios was large because of the uncertainty induced by projections of future precipitations and temperatures for example the relative increase of tfv ranged from 63 08 to 99 96 for a 2 year period and from 41 09 to 140 72 for a 100 year period more effort is required to distil complex science into adaptive strategies in response to climate change to ensure the policies reflect the evolving science and the associated uncertainty the change patterns of the system overloaded percentage i e the ratio of tfv to tiv were similar to those for tiv and tfv fig 5 the overloading percentage increased as a function of the return periods under all climate scenarios indicating that the conveyance capability of drainage is subject to stronger limitations in response to large precipitation events zhou et al 2019 to maintain an acceptable frequency of system overload future drainage design needs to consider the increased frequency and intensity of precipitation zhou 2014 notably the highest overloaded percentage peaked under a 100 year return period of the business as usual scenario rcp 8 5 due to the high greenhouse gas emissions and extreme events under this scenario fig 6 presents the spatial distributions of overloaded manholes and pipes at a 2 year return period under present and future climate conditions almost all stormwater manholes and pipelines in the area were flooded suggesting that basically all manholes in this city are currently very vulnerable to the 2 year rainfall and will even be more vulnerable under future climate projections the limited capacity of the urban drainage systems the degree of urbanization and heavy rainfalls are the main reasons for urban flooding hu et al 2015 wang et al 2017 currently most chinese cities are equipped with drainage systems that operate in conditions that exceed those for which they were initially designed consequently they are only able to withstand rainfall at the 1 year return period thus a systematic and dynamic adaptation of the urban drainage systems is required chan et al 2018 3 3 diffuse urban pollution under future climate first absolute and relative changes of produced nps loads were compared for the underlying surfaces across a series of climate scenarios fig 7 clearly climate change will lead to an increase in nps pollution loads which will greatly vary depending on projected climate change scenarios and events with various rainfall intensity the nps loads under rcp 8 5 showed the most obvious increasing trend compared with baseline it is clear that the washed off pollutants from underlying surfaces increase with increasing rainfall depth and rainfall intensity hou et al 2018 nazahiyah et al 2007 with the highest intensity of precipitation events under rcp 8 5 the intensity of surface erosion is strongest jalliffier verne et al 2015 jeon et al 2018 however under the rcp 2 6 scenario energy consumption and climate warming can be decreased and the increasing trend of nps loads caused by climate change can also be inhibited to a certain extent similarly to reduce the uncertainty of different emission scenarios the relative change in nps loads under the three emission scenarios was averaged the average increase in nps ranged from about 40 to 80 for various return periods compared to the baseline results under the same designed rainfall conditions the increasing rates of nps loads affected by climate change were similar for the different pollutants few studies investigated the nps load associated with the changing climate especially for the urban nps pollution qiu et al 2019 explored the impact of climate change on agricultural sediment and nutrient loads according to their results sediment tn and tp loads at sub basin scale increased by averages of 12 95 7 26 and 9 56 respectively under future climate variability in urban areas the combined sewer system separate sewer system and wwtps are all pollution sources for local receiving waters semadeni davies et al 2008 therefore the pollution loads that flow into the wwtp stormwater outlet and overflow orifices represent the point pollution that will be treated nps pollution and cso pollution respectively these were further analyzed fig 8 due to the increased nps production in response to climate change an uplift of nps pollution discharge was clearly identified with regard to the environmental impact the mass of pollutants released from overflows is greatly important for the receiving waters semadeni davies et al 2008 basically the increasing trend of the cso pollution load was more obvious than that of the nps load with stronger increases for heavier precipitation events the pollution load discharge into wwtps decreased under future climate scenarios clearly combined the increased diffuse pollution discharge and decreased treated discharge under future climate are set to worsen the current pollution problems this will induce enormous uncertainties and complexity for the future urban water management 3 4 adaptation potential of sponge city to the projected flood risk increases fig 9 presents the relative changes in tiv and tfv caused by climate change before and after the construction of sponge city the control effect of sponge city on stormwater quantity could be identified from the gap between the tiv or tfv values before and after the sponge city construction the larger the gap the better the control effect clearly sponge city construction can decrease the increasing tendencies of tiv and tfv caused by climate change to a certain extent under all scenarios and at various return periods fig 9 particularly after sponge city construction tiv and tfv could be decreased to close to baseline across all precipitation events under rcp 2 6 scenarios except for tiv under the 100 year return period with a 10 52 increase the benefits of sponge city construction in reducing the urban flooding risk caused by climate change are evident the relative changes in tfv ranged from 12 29 to 96 24 after sponge construction while before sponge city construction these ranged from 41 87 to 141 1 under large precipitation events at both the 20 and 100 year return periods the controls for total runoff tiv were very limited it is therefore understandable that the role of the lid approach is limited if the rainfall intensity is very high and exceeds the storage capacity xia et al 2017 the performance of the tfv control was better highlighting the advantages of combined approaches adopted in sponge city construction including lid pipeline network reconstruction and storage pond construction under extreme rainfall events all measures for sponge city construction are likely less ineffective than under normal rainfall events guhathakurta et al 2011 in the present study in extreme cases i e under the rcp 8 5 scenario at a 100 year return period changes in tfv before and after sponge construction were 141 10 and 96 24 respectively this indicates a certain ability for climate adaption for urban flooding control it s worthy to note that in the optimal cases the construction of sponge city can decrease the tiv or tfv to the current level i e values of baseline scenarios under future climate scenarios which shows its strong adaptability however awareness needs to be directed to the current level under which the urban drainage function is far from sufficient and thus flooding occurs frequently apparently the strategy in the sponge city construction systematization program which was designed by using historical rainfall data could not meet the goal of significantly improving the urban drainage capacity in response to changing climate the impact of climate change is suggested to be reflected in the associated designs of the sponge city construction for example storm drainage design methods implemented by the uk employ a 30 uplift of rainfall intensities to depth duration frequency ddf estimates which accounts for both climate change to 2085 20 and an urban creep factor of 10 miller and hutchins 2017 3 5 adaptation potential of sponge city to the projected increases in diffuse pollution fig 10 shows the adaptation of sponge city construction to cope with the impact of climate change with regard to the production of nps loads on underlying surfaces the changing trends of different pollutants were similar nps loads could be decreased to below than or close to the baseline for 2 year return period events under scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 however similar to the observed changes in tiv and tfv the effect of sponge city construction for nps pollution control remained limited for large precipitation events 20 year 100 year return period or rcp 8 5 scenario using codcr as example in extreme cases rcp 8 5 100 year return period the increases in codcr load were 104 31 and 82 58 due to climate change before and after sponge city construction respectively changes in hydrology strongly influence water quality processes especially nps pollution driven by precipitation and runoff geng et al 2015 to explore the adaption of sponge city construction for pollution control benefits for receiving rivers the pollutant loads flowing into wwtps stormwater outlet and overflow orifices were further analyzed fig 11 before sponge city construction cso pollution was clearly the primary pollution source for the receiving river which was followed by nps pollution after sponge city construction significant decreases in cso pollution were identified for all scenarios showing the important role of combined sewer separation projects for mitigating cso pollution the pollutant loads into wwtps representing the pollution which will be treated will increase after sponge city construction this indicates an increased sewage collection efficiency it is interesting to note however that nps pollution will become the primary pollution source due to the combined effect of sewer separation and changing climate for codcr and ss especially the increased nps load could even offset the decreased cso pollution load during large precipitation events therefore the target of nps pollution control is suggested to be increased in the sponge city planning and the related design of lid practices riparian zones potentially are recommended to protect aquatic ecosystems against nps pollutants input with the low cost easy operation and maintenance requirements mckergow et al 2016 the relative changes in the summed cso and nps pollution loads expressed relative to the baseline scenarios was represented for a more intuitive understanding fig 12 china aims to shape water sponge cities through sponge city construction to better cope with climate change köster 2019 the results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of sponge city construction as a no regrets adaption strategy to reduce pollution levels associated with climate change nh3 n and tp loadings were lower than at baseline under all predicted rainfall conditions and changing climate scenarios even in extreme cases under the rcp 8 5 scenario at the 100 year return period nh3 n loading was 29 71 lower than at baseline however the increased pollution risk must be noticed the control effect for codcr and ss loadings was not ideal which could only be reduced to baseline under the rcp 2 6 scenario under rcp 4 5 or rcp 8 5 scenarios the results suggested that the current levels of adaption are insufficient to offset projected increases during large precipitation events even if the loading can be decreased to or below baseline level it remains unclear whether such a reduction will be sufficient for the urban water environment the water quality of the receiving rivers under the baseline is very poor exceeding class v according to the national surface water environmental quality stand gb3838 2002 prc 2002 4 conclusions to adapt to climate change and associated stormwater management pressures this study employed the pcswmm model to predict the impact of climate change on problems associated with stormwater management at the city scale multiple methods were adopted to build credible models and determine relevant parameters which provides references to overcome difficulties in urban stormwater modelling the coexistence of combined and separate drainage systems was considered in parameter calibration via time and sectional partitioning severe pipeline defects and therefore infiltration of groundwater river were calculated and expressed a field rainfall simulator system was used to determine nps simulation parameters to reflect real sponge city construction scenarios adaption strategies were set according to the sponge city construction systematization program and the structures of each lid practice were determined based on design drawings the simulation results showed that despite the large uncertainties among projected climate scenarios climate change would lead to a higher urban flooding risk an increased nps and cso pollution and an associated deterioration of water quality sponge city construction can effectively release the pressures of urban flooding and diffused pollution caused by climate change however the current levels of adaption are insufficient to adequately offset the projected increases depending on the concentration pathways rainfall intensities and pollutants notably nps pollution will become the primary pollution source after sponge city construction in particular for codcr and ss the increased nps load could even offset the decreased cso pollution load during large precipitation events policies associated with future urban stormwater management should reflect the predicted impact of climate change for example the sponge city construction should integrate the storm drainage allowance in the design of drainage pipelines while better controlling nps pollution uncertainties within projected climate scenarios should also be considered thus requiring a balancing act by policy makers credit authorship

5368,climate change increases the uncertainties associated with the future urban stormwater management this study employed the personal computer stormwater management model to evaluate the impact of climate change on problems associated with stormwater management at the city scale these include urban flooding non point source nps pollution and combined sewer overflow cso pollution multiple methods were adopted to overcome the difficulties when building credible modellings time partitioning and sectional difference were used during the calibration of hydrological and hydraulic parameters the groundwater river infiltration was assessed via extensive monitoring the field rainfall simulator system was used to determine nps parameters promising adaptions of sponge city construction in response to climate change were further evaluated the adaption strategies were set in strict accordance with the sponge city construction systematization program the results showed that future climate change will increase the urban flooding risk both nps and cso pollution loads and will worsen river water quality sponge city construction was demonstrated to be a no regrets adaption strategy toward the reduction of the combined pressures induced by changing climate however the adaptability was insufficient and varies largely with regard to concentration pathways rainfall intensities and pollutants in best case scenarios the flooding risk as well as diffuse pollution loads can be decreased to or below their current level under future climate change however the current level needs to be considered since the urban drainage function was far from sufficient and the water quality was very poor the increased nps pollution risk was noticed after sponge city construction especially for chemical oxygen demand and suspended solids the increased nps loads could even offset the decreased cso pollution loads thus flexibility is suggested to be allowed in the design of storm drainage and pollution control measures in future urban stormwater management keywords climate change drainage modeling urban flooding diffuse pollution 1 introduction the management of urban stormwater has become a common theme that has been recognized across the world because of its potential for diverse damages and societal impacts jiang et al 2018 obropta and kardos 2007 in china a series of urban stormwater issues e g urban flooding non point source nps pollution combined sewer overflow cso pollution and water shortages strongly threaten human security in light of the rapid and continuous urban development since 2008 hundreds of cities e g beijing wuhan shanghai and shenzhen were almost annually affected by flooding disasters jiang et al 2018 shi et al 2007 xia et al 2017 xu et al 2018 related nps and cso pollutants are increasingly discharged into and degrade urban rivers shen et al 2010 murla et al 2016 in 2014 the chinese government announced a national initiative which introduced sponge cities as a holistic strategy to overcome the problems associated with urban stormwater issues mohurd 2014 climate change has imposed many uncertainties and new challenges on stormwater management chan et al 2018 changes in climatic conditions such as shifted precipitation patterns increased rainfall intensity and more extreme rainfall events will directly affect the quantity and quality of stormwater and thus the effect of management astaraie imani et al 2012 xia et al 2017 it is of significance to evaluate the impact of climate change on the joint pressures originating from flooding nps pollution and cso pollution moreover in light of the impacts of the continuing climate change it is questionable whether the sponge city constructions will be able to solve every urban stormwater issue that arises in the future it is more realistic to expect a gradual and continuous change based on feedback on what needs to be improved in the future to implement such a highly ambitious program as the sponge city concept previous research addressed the assessment of the impact of climate change mainly on watershed hydrology and water quality franco et al 2018 yang et al 2018 urban stormwater modeling bears many complexities e g inherent complexity of stormwater quality processes data collection and model calibration obropta kardos 2007 the available data rarely enable a satisfactory calibration and validation of the nps models hou et al 2019a kanso et al 2003 the complex urban conditions e g the coexistence of combined and separate drainage systems and severe pipeline defects are complicated and difficult to express consequently the impact assessment of climate change has hitherto concentrated on hydrology in urban areas egger and maurer 2015 moghadas et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 few studies examined future trends in stormwater quality or pollutant release from overflows in response to the changing climate borris et al 2013 semadeni davies et al 2008 however little research addressed the joint pressures of flooding drainage capacity as well as nps and cso pollutions to generate a comprehensive understanding of the impact of future climate change on urban stormwater management especially due to the complex conditions problems associated with the adoption of relevant strategy at city scale and a lack of drainage data research regarding city scale adaption assessment is difficult and therefore basically non existent therefore the main objectives of this paper were to 1 provide inspiration for urban stormwater models by adopting multiple methods to express complex urban factors and to determine simulation parameters 2 explore the responses of urban stormwater systems urban flooding risk as well as nps and cso pollution to climate change 3 verify if sponge city construction can mitigate the increasing risk of flooding and diffuse pollution at the city scale under future climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area qian an is located in the northeast of the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration and belongs to hebei province fig 1 the topography is high in the northwest and lower in the southeast the region has a warm and semi humid continental climate with an annual mean temperature of 10 3 c the annual mean precipitation is approximately 672 mm with 80 occurring during the rainy season from june to september because of the inter annual variation of precipitation and the uneven precipitation distribution within a year rainstorms or continuous rains occur frequently during summer which often cause floods qian an was selected as the only city within the first batch of sponge city pilot in north china in 2014 qian an suffers from the typical problems of many other cities in china for example fast urbanization and outdated drainage system severe pipeline defects frequent urban flooding and poor water quality the built up area of qian an occupies an area of 2500 ha approximately 49 of which are residential zones and 20 9 are green areas and open spaces the pilot area for the sponge city project is located in the central area with a total area of 2150 ha accounting for 86 of the built up area of the city this area includes 700 ha of old urban area and 1450 ha of new urban area as shown in fig 1 the central and northeast areas of the city are served by a combined sewer system and the sewer mains are buried along the sanli river with six overflow orifices overflows occur frequently and are associated with heavy rainfall events during summer the western and southern areas of the city are served by a separate storm sewer system consisting of sewer pipes that range in size from 0 3 to 1 8 m a hobo automated weather station onset bourne ma usa was installed in the study area to record meteorological data atmospheric pressure temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and rainfall were recorded at 1 min intervals 2 2 model construction 2 2 1 storm water management model set up the usepa s storm water management model swmm was first developed in 1971 and has experienced several major upgrades since then as a dynamic hydrology hydraulic water quantity and quality simulation model swmm has been used in many sewer and storm water studies across the world tsihrintzis and hamid 1998 zhou et al 2019 the personal computer stormwater management model pcswmm was developed by computational hydraulics international chi based on swmm engines pcswmm provides user friendly pre and post processors that decrease input errors and offer tools to improve the understanding of results consequently pcswmm was selected for this study the catchment was first delineated according to the digital elevation model dem processed from a 1 10000 topographic map using arcgis 10 2 environmental systems research institute inc redlands ca usa further delineation was conducted based on the sewer network layer using the thiessen polygon function and was adjusted based on the land use map the subcatchment runoff was assigned to the sewer system through the sewer inlet which was closest to the subcatchment area centroid borris et al 2013 a total of 472 subcatchments were finally obtained the area of these subcatchments ranged from 0 068 ha to 39 56 ha fig 2 2 2 2 expression of the urban complex condition both combined and separate drainage systems coexist in qian an according to the results of geophysical prospecting severe groundwater river infiltration affects the study area especially for the sewer mains along the river therefore the following boundary conditions are required in the model the discharge data of domestic sewage during the dry season and the infiltration of groundwater river a monitoring network covering the pollution source pipeline network sewage treatment plant was set up including a total of 26 monitoring sites two residential districts which constructed a combined sewer system and a separate sewer system were monitored the key nodes of sewer pipeline including 16 nodes of combined sewer system 7 nodes of separate sewer system and the waste water treatment plant wwtp were also monitored online flowmeters fl900 hach loveland colorado usa were installed to record the flow data manual samplings lasted for 7 days with a sampling frequency of 2 h based on the monitoring results the per capita sewage discharge was calculated to be 155 l person day the sewage discharge i e population per capita sewage discharge volume was added at the corresponding sewage inflow points the average concentrations of chemical oxygen demand codcr nitrogen ammonia nh3 n total phosphorus tp and suspended solids ss were 334 0 mg l 92 3 mg l 7 3 mg l and 79 mg l respectively the groundwater river infiltration of each monitored node was calculated by comparing the theoretical sewage discharge volume calculated by population within the catchment area of this node with the monitored sewage discharge volume the groundwater river infiltration of the whole sewage system was identified as 32 5 more details can be found in hou et al 2019b then groundwater river infiltration was allocated to nodes in the model based on the calculation results 2 3 parameter determination 2 3 1 hydrological and hydraulic parameters most of the physical catchment parameters such as catchment area and percentage of impervious area were derived from land use data by arcgis the subcatchment slope was estimated by dem diameter length and slope of pipelines were derived from network data the other hydrological and hydraulic parameters were separately calibrated for dry season and rainy season matlab version 7 1 www mathworks com was used to sample the values in the swmm input file within the calibration ranges the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used to evaluate the fitness between measured data and simulated data during the dry season the manning s roughness for conduit n cdry which indicates the degree of pipeline roughness was calibrated and validated according to the swmm manual the calibration ranged from 0 010 to 0 020 and the calibrated value was 0 012 the simulated and observed sewage flow during the dry season in both the calibration period 2017 11 28 2017 12 4 and the validation period 2017 12 2017 12 11 was presented fig s1 in the in the supplementary material the nses were 0 9017 and 0 9448 for calibration period and validation period respectively during the rainy season parameter sensitivity was tested by using the sensitivity based radio tuning calibration srtc function of pcswmm which designates uncertainty percent rankings for each parameter of interest parameter depression storage impervious s imperv depression storage pervious s perv and the percentage of impervious area with no depression storage zero imperv were found to be insensitive and were set to 4 mm 8 mm and 15 respectively following the swmm user manual horton infiltration parameters maximum infiltration rate maxrate minimum infiltration rate minrate and decay rate with moderate sensitivity were calibrated according to the field rainfall data of the green area as described in section 2 3 2 by adjusting the values of infiltration parameters the relative errors of simulated and calculated runoff coefficients of green area were 6 7 and 1 3 for 3 and 5 year return period rainfall events respectively the values of maxrate minrate and decay rate were 120 mm h 12 mm h and 4 h 1 respectively the four parameters width parameter k width and the manning s roughness for pervious n perv for impervious n imperv and for conduit n cwet were selected as the most sensitive parameters and were subjected to auto calibration by matlab considering the differences between catchment and pipeline network characteristics of old and new urban districts these parameters were separately calibrated for old and new urban districts during the rainy season table s1 in the supplementary material in this calibration the nse ranged from 0 529 to 0 873 for old urban districts while new urban districts achieved better simulation results the nse values in validation were all above 0 5 which indicates an acceptable prediction accuracy moriasi et al 2007 fig s2 and fig s3 in the supplementary material present the typical measured and predicted hydrographs during both calibration and validation 2 3 2 non point source pollution parameters nps pollutants were simulated according to runoff volume and catchment antecedent conditions i e antecedent dry periods street cleaning frequency and land use four metrics including codcr nh3 n tp and ss were simulated the build up and wash off mechanisms formed the main model for the water quality simulation in swmm rossman 2009 the following exponential functions were selected to evaluate pollutant build up and wash off processes in this study 1 b c 1 1 e c 2 t 2 w c 3 q c 4 b where b represents the build up per unit area kg ha c 1 represents the maximum possible build up per unit area kg ha c 2 represents the cumulative rate constant d 1 w represents the wash off kg h c 3 represents the wash off coefficient c 4 represents the wash off exponent q represents the runoff volume per unit area mm h and b represents the residual pollutant accumulation kg the water quality in the pipeline was simulated using a completely mixed first order decay model runoff flow was rapid and was only present in the pipeline for a very short time thus the attenuation of pollutants was not considered zoppou 2001 and rauch et al 2002 argued that the lack of data is a greater hindrance for stormwater quality models than the lack of suitable algorithms the rainfall in the study area is concentrated during the rainy season with sudden onset and mostly occurring at night therefore it is difficult to capture effective rainfall runoff data consequently a field rainfall simulator system was used for rainfall runoff experiments fig s4 it is consisted of water supply unit supercharging and control unit and water spray unit the rainfall area can reach 0 01 ha adjustable according to the demand the rainfall height can reach 3 5 6 m and the rainfall intensity ranges 6 250 mm h three underlying surfaces of the field including green area roof and road with areas of 0 01 ha for each were used for artificial rainfall simulation at least 3 days of pollution accumulation on the underlying surfaces were included before each experiment a total of 15 rainfall events with a group of return periods including 0 3 0 5 1 2 and 3 year events were simulated the local rainfall intensity formula was used to define the rainfall intensity 3 q 4098 06 1 0 9021 lg p t 20 798 0 840 where q represents the rainfall intensity mm min t represents the rainfall duration min and p represents the return period year onsite automatic flow monitoring devices fl900 hach loveland co usa were installed at outfall of each site to monitor the flow rate and water level at 5 min intervals once runoff was initiated samples were manually collected at 5 min intervals during the first 30 min of the rainfall event which was followed by 10 min intervals for the next 30 60 min subsequently samples were collected at 30 min intervals until runoff had ceased after sampling the samples were transported to the laboratory for codcr nh3 n tp and ss analyses using standard methods apha 2012 four parameters c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 for each land use type roof green area and road were determined via latin hypercube sampling 10000 times table s2 in the supplementary material the parameter sets with the best performance in terms of nse were selected to make the parameters applicable to all rainfall types the data for each underlying surface type were pooled together in the process the predictions with these parameters performed well for all pollutants except for nh3 n for roads with an nse of 0 30 the model performance for green areas was most excellent and the nse values reached up to 0 9 therefore the adopted artificial rainfall simulator system provided a realistic method for runoff data collection especially for manual monitoring which is the main monitoring method in china figs s5 s7 in the supplementary material present the detailed pollutgraphs in the process of parameter determination 2 3 3 low impact development parameters lids are represented in the pcswmm model via parameterization of several vertical layers the lid parameters of these layers can be divided into two categories structural parameters such as thickness and porosity and non structural parameters such as surface roughness seepage rate field capacity wilting point and conductivity table s3 in the supplementary material the values of structural parameters were basically obtained from design drawings to accurately express each lid practice the parameter conductivity of the soil layer greatly influenced the simulation results and it was measured using the double loop method the rest of the non structural parameters were determined according to the annual total runoff control rate atrcr in pilot areas it is reasonable to assume that the key target of sponge city could be reached otherwise the question of how well sponge city construction can respond to climate change is not meaningful 2 4 sponge city construction the primary aims of sponge city construction are to decrease runoff delay peak flows and mitigate nps pollution the atrcr of the qian an pilot area was calculated and set to 76 the annual nps pollution load control rate was set to 45 in terms of ss the sponge city construction scenario was set up in complete accordance with the sponge city construction system plan therefore the landing sponge city construction scenario instead of imaging adoption scenario was assessed the entire measures of sponge city contain the source control practices the gray infrastructure system for midway control and the terminal control approaches the total area of lid implementation is 1283 96 ha including 727 20 ha of residential areas 206 07 ha of public buildings 350 69 ha of parks and green areas 479 21 ha of unused land and 236 54 ha of roads the different lid amounts implemented in each subcatchment ranged from 0 to 23 bio retention cells infiltration trenches permeable pavements rain barrels and vegetative wales were included the drainage system rehabilitation and renovation were implemented as midway control measures a total of 102 km of pipeline was dredged and repaired combined sewer separation projects were designed for drainage and water quality benefits a total of 18 pipelines were renovated including stormwater and sewage pipelines the intercepting sewer system was also restored and only one overflow orifice remained after restoration to further solve the csos problems a terminal storage with a volume of 9696 m3 was defined in the sponge city construction systematization program 2 5 future climate change the projections of climate change effects were obtained using bias corrected climate from gcm from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 archive hadgem2 es under three representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 were considered rcp 2 6 assumes that the greenhouse gases peak during 2010 2020 and then substantially decline which represent the climate mitigation scenario rcp 4 5 assumes that greenhouse gases peak around 2040 then decline which represent the medium emission scenario rcp 8 5 assumes that greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise throughout the 21st century which exhibits the highest levels of forcing and the largest possibility of climate change qiu et al 2019 the benefit of climate mitigation for reducing flood and pollution risks could be represented by comparing the projections under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 with rcp8 5 watch forcing data wfd weedon et al 2011 for the period from 1960 to 1999 was used as reference period firstly an additive approach which preserves the absolute changes for temperature and a multiplicative approach which preserves the relative changes for precipitation were applied to adjust for differences between the monthly mean gcm data and wfd data over the reference period parametric quantile mapping was then applied to the residual or normalized data to adjust the daily variability of gcm data to match the climatology of the wfd the monthly correction factors were interpolated toward daily factors and were applied to future periods this obtained the projected gcm data for future periods the details of this bias correction method are described in hempel et al 2013 considering the notable uncertainties associated with climate model simulations the impact of climate change on extreme precipitation intensities was represented using a change factor cf methodology which was commonly used in previous urban drainage modelling studies kaspersen et al 2017 rosbjerg 2017 willems et al 2012 zhou et al 2019 cf was estimated as the relative difference between the outputs of the climate model i e extreme precipitation intensities for future and present day conditions for a range of return periods the distribution of the generalized extreme value gev was then separately fitted to the two sets of daily values coles 2001 katz et al 2002 4 g z μ σ ε e x p 1 ε z μ σ 1 ε where μ σ and ε represent the location scale and shape parameters respectively the maximum likelihood method was used to estimate the fitting parameters of gev distribution the likelihood function of which is 5 l xq x n μ σ ε l n σ 1 ε y i e y i 6 y i 1 ε ln 1 ε x i μ σ ε 0 x i μ σ ε 0 then the extreme value of return periods was estimated by the follow formula 7 x p μ σ ε 1 log 1 p ε ε 0 μ σ l o g log 1 p ε 0 where μ σ and ε represent the estimated location scale and shape parameters respectively the cfs were calculated for each return period and the future climate simulations were divided by historical climate simulations then the cfs are applied to the statistic of present day design precipitation events yielding the characteristics of future precipitation two hour rainfall time series were assigned according to the local rainfall intensity formula 2 6 simulations the first step was a vulnerability assessment which was used to determine the impacts of climate change without any adaptation simulations across various return periods 2 3 5 10 20 50 and 100 years under historical and three projected climate change scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were performed the simulation results from historical climate and before sponge city construction were used as baseline for comparison to reflect the impacts of climate change on urban flooding and diffused pollution the second step consisted of an adaption assessment to determine the effect of the respective sponge city construction except for the climate scenarios during the first step above two city scenarios were considered before and after sponge city construction the simulation results from historical climate data and before sponge city construction were also used as baseline to evaluate the adaption potential of sponge city construction 3 results and discussion 3 1 future climate projections the nonparametric mann kendall mk test kendall 1975 mann 1945 was used to determine the significance of trends in annual precipitation and annual mean temperature from 2020 to 2099 as shown in table 1 significant uptrends in annual precipitation under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 scenarios were observed at the 5 significance level annual mean temperature increased significantly under all future scenarios the other studies obtained similar results in the north china xiao et al 2020 the cfs were estimated as the relative difference between the extreme precipitation intensities for future and present day conditions as shown in fig 3 the extreme precipitation intensities increased largely under future climate change cf values were in the ranges of 1 268 1 291 1 356 1 708 and 1 433 1 876 for the pathways of rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively consistent with other studies there is a large uncertainty bound associated with the cfs under different rcps zhou et al 2019 3 2 urban flooding risk under future climate it has generally been acknowledged that urban pluvial and flooding will increase through climate change herslund et al 2016 miller hutchins 2017 moore et al 2016 in the present study although differences exist among climate projections negative impacts of climate change on urban flood conditions became clear with increasing values of total inflow volume tiv and total flood volume tfv for all return periods in comparison to baseline i e the historical climate fig 4 a and 4b compared with baseline the average change rate of tivs ranged from 33 58 to 47 23 at various return periods with a peak at the 20 year return period fig 4c the average increase of tfv ranged from 81 16 to 98 87 which exceeds that of tivs this poses an enormous challenge to the current drainage system which has been designed based on a certain return period clearly the drainage system of the city faces severe capacity problems in coping with the increasing amount of water because of the impacts of climate change in line with previous results the benefits of climate change mitigation toward reducing urban floods became evident kaspersen et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 the simulated tivs and tfvs were much larger under rcp 8 5 i e a business as usual scenario than under rcp 2 6 i e a climate change mitigation scenario fig 4a and fig 4b notably the uncertainty bound associated with different scenarios was large because of the uncertainty induced by projections of future precipitations and temperatures for example the relative increase of tfv ranged from 63 08 to 99 96 for a 2 year period and from 41 09 to 140 72 for a 100 year period more effort is required to distil complex science into adaptive strategies in response to climate change to ensure the policies reflect the evolving science and the associated uncertainty the change patterns of the system overloaded percentage i e the ratio of tfv to tiv were similar to those for tiv and tfv fig 5 the overloading percentage increased as a function of the return periods under all climate scenarios indicating that the conveyance capability of drainage is subject to stronger limitations in response to large precipitation events zhou et al 2019 to maintain an acceptable frequency of system overload future drainage design needs to consider the increased frequency and intensity of precipitation zhou 2014 notably the highest overloaded percentage peaked under a 100 year return period of the business as usual scenario rcp 8 5 due to the high greenhouse gas emissions and extreme events under this scenario fig 6 presents the spatial distributions of overloaded manholes and pipes at a 2 year return period under present and future climate conditions almost all stormwater manholes and pipelines in the area were flooded suggesting that basically all manholes in this city are currently very vulnerable to the 2 year rainfall and will even be more vulnerable under future climate projections the limited capacity of the urban drainage systems the degree of urbanization and heavy rainfalls are the main reasons for urban flooding hu et al 2015 wang et al 2017 currently most chinese cities are equipped with drainage systems that operate in conditions that exceed those for which they were initially designed consequently they are only able to withstand rainfall at the 1 year return period thus a systematic and dynamic adaptation of the urban drainage systems is required chan et al 2018 3 3 diffuse urban pollution under future climate first absolute and relative changes of produced nps loads were compared for the underlying surfaces across a series of climate scenarios fig 7 clearly climate change will lead to an increase in nps pollution loads which will greatly vary depending on projected climate change scenarios and events with various rainfall intensity the nps loads under rcp 8 5 showed the most obvious increasing trend compared with baseline it is clear that the washed off pollutants from underlying surfaces increase with increasing rainfall depth and rainfall intensity hou et al 2018 nazahiyah et al 2007 with the highest intensity of precipitation events under rcp 8 5 the intensity of surface erosion is strongest jalliffier verne et al 2015 jeon et al 2018 however under the rcp 2 6 scenario energy consumption and climate warming can be decreased and the increasing trend of nps loads caused by climate change can also be inhibited to a certain extent similarly to reduce the uncertainty of different emission scenarios the relative change in nps loads under the three emission scenarios was averaged the average increase in nps ranged from about 40 to 80 for various return periods compared to the baseline results under the same designed rainfall conditions the increasing rates of nps loads affected by climate change were similar for the different pollutants few studies investigated the nps load associated with the changing climate especially for the urban nps pollution qiu et al 2019 explored the impact of climate change on agricultural sediment and nutrient loads according to their results sediment tn and tp loads at sub basin scale increased by averages of 12 95 7 26 and 9 56 respectively under future climate variability in urban areas the combined sewer system separate sewer system and wwtps are all pollution sources for local receiving waters semadeni davies et al 2008 therefore the pollution loads that flow into the wwtp stormwater outlet and overflow orifices represent the point pollution that will be treated nps pollution and cso pollution respectively these were further analyzed fig 8 due to the increased nps production in response to climate change an uplift of nps pollution discharge was clearly identified with regard to the environmental impact the mass of pollutants released from overflows is greatly important for the receiving waters semadeni davies et al 2008 basically the increasing trend of the cso pollution load was more obvious than that of the nps load with stronger increases for heavier precipitation events the pollution load discharge into wwtps decreased under future climate scenarios clearly combined the increased diffuse pollution discharge and decreased treated discharge under future climate are set to worsen the current pollution problems this will induce enormous uncertainties and complexity for the future urban water management 3 4 adaptation potential of sponge city to the projected flood risk increases fig 9 presents the relative changes in tiv and tfv caused by climate change before and after the construction of sponge city the control effect of sponge city on stormwater quantity could be identified from the gap between the tiv or tfv values before and after the sponge city construction the larger the gap the better the control effect clearly sponge city construction can decrease the increasing tendencies of tiv and tfv caused by climate change to a certain extent under all scenarios and at various return periods fig 9 particularly after sponge city construction tiv and tfv could be decreased to close to baseline across all precipitation events under rcp 2 6 scenarios except for tiv under the 100 year return period with a 10 52 increase the benefits of sponge city construction in reducing the urban flooding risk caused by climate change are evident the relative changes in tfv ranged from 12 29 to 96 24 after sponge construction while before sponge city construction these ranged from 41 87 to 141 1 under large precipitation events at both the 20 and 100 year return periods the controls for total runoff tiv were very limited it is therefore understandable that the role of the lid approach is limited if the rainfall intensity is very high and exceeds the storage capacity xia et al 2017 the performance of the tfv control was better highlighting the advantages of combined approaches adopted in sponge city construction including lid pipeline network reconstruction and storage pond construction under extreme rainfall events all measures for sponge city construction are likely less ineffective than under normal rainfall events guhathakurta et al 2011 in the present study in extreme cases i e under the rcp 8 5 scenario at a 100 year return period changes in tfv before and after sponge construction were 141 10 and 96 24 respectively this indicates a certain ability for climate adaption for urban flooding control it s worthy to note that in the optimal cases the construction of sponge city can decrease the tiv or tfv to the current level i e values of baseline scenarios under future climate scenarios which shows its strong adaptability however awareness needs to be directed to the current level under which the urban drainage function is far from sufficient and thus flooding occurs frequently apparently the strategy in the sponge city construction systematization program which was designed by using historical rainfall data could not meet the goal of significantly improving the urban drainage capacity in response to changing climate the impact of climate change is suggested to be reflected in the associated designs of the sponge city construction for example storm drainage design methods implemented by the uk employ a 30 uplift of rainfall intensities to depth duration frequency ddf estimates which accounts for both climate change to 2085 20 and an urban creep factor of 10 miller and hutchins 2017 3 5 adaptation potential of sponge city to the projected increases in diffuse pollution fig 10 shows the adaptation of sponge city construction to cope with the impact of climate change with regard to the production of nps loads on underlying surfaces the changing trends of different pollutants were similar nps loads could be decreased to below than or close to the baseline for 2 year return period events under scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 however similar to the observed changes in tiv and tfv the effect of sponge city construction for nps pollution control remained limited for large precipitation events 20 year 100 year return period or rcp 8 5 scenario using codcr as example in extreme cases rcp 8 5 100 year return period the increases in codcr load were 104 31 and 82 58 due to climate change before and after sponge city construction respectively changes in hydrology strongly influence water quality processes especially nps pollution driven by precipitation and runoff geng et al 2015 to explore the adaption of sponge city construction for pollution control benefits for receiving rivers the pollutant loads flowing into wwtps stormwater outlet and overflow orifices were further analyzed fig 11 before sponge city construction cso pollution was clearly the primary pollution source for the receiving river which was followed by nps pollution after sponge city construction significant decreases in cso pollution were identified for all scenarios showing the important role of combined sewer separation projects for mitigating cso pollution the pollutant loads into wwtps representing the pollution which will be treated will increase after sponge city construction this indicates an increased sewage collection efficiency it is interesting to note however that nps pollution will become the primary pollution source due to the combined effect of sewer separation and changing climate for codcr and ss especially the increased nps load could even offset the decreased cso pollution load during large precipitation events therefore the target of nps pollution control is suggested to be increased in the sponge city planning and the related design of lid practices riparian zones potentially are recommended to protect aquatic ecosystems against nps pollutants input with the low cost easy operation and maintenance requirements mckergow et al 2016 the relative changes in the summed cso and nps pollution loads expressed relative to the baseline scenarios was represented for a more intuitive understanding fig 12 china aims to shape water sponge cities through sponge city construction to better cope with climate change köster 2019 the results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of sponge city construction as a no regrets adaption strategy to reduce pollution levels associated with climate change nh3 n and tp loadings were lower than at baseline under all predicted rainfall conditions and changing climate scenarios even in extreme cases under the rcp 8 5 scenario at the 100 year return period nh3 n loading was 29 71 lower than at baseline however the increased pollution risk must be noticed the control effect for codcr and ss loadings was not ideal which could only be reduced to baseline under the rcp 2 6 scenario under rcp 4 5 or rcp 8 5 scenarios the results suggested that the current levels of adaption are insufficient to offset projected increases during large precipitation events even if the loading can be decreased to or below baseline level it remains unclear whether such a reduction will be sufficient for the urban water environment the water quality of the receiving rivers under the baseline is very poor exceeding class v according to the national surface water environmental quality stand gb3838 2002 prc 2002 4 conclusions to adapt to climate change and associated stormwater management pressures this study employed the pcswmm model to predict the impact of climate change on problems associated with stormwater management at the city scale multiple methods were adopted to build credible models and determine relevant parameters which provides references to overcome difficulties in urban stormwater modelling the coexistence of combined and separate drainage systems was considered in parameter calibration via time and sectional partitioning severe pipeline defects and therefore infiltration of groundwater river were calculated and expressed a field rainfall simulator system was used to determine nps simulation parameters to reflect real sponge city construction scenarios adaption strategies were set according to the sponge city construction systematization program and the structures of each lid practice were determined based on design drawings the simulation results showed that despite the large uncertainties among projected climate scenarios climate change would lead to a higher urban flooding risk an increased nps and cso pollution and an associated deterioration of water quality sponge city construction can effectively release the pressures of urban flooding and diffused pollution caused by climate change however the current levels of adaption are insufficient to adequately offset the projected increases depending on the concentration pathways rainfall intensities and pollutants notably nps pollution will become the primary pollution source after sponge city construction in particular for codcr and ss the increased nps load could even offset the decreased cso pollution load during large precipitation events policies associated with future urban stormwater management should reflect the predicted impact of climate change for example the sponge city construction should integrate the storm drainage allowance in the design of drainage pipelines while better controlling nps pollution uncertainties within projected climate scenarios should also be considered thus requiring a balancing act by policy makers credit authorship

5369,carbon retention within river corridors influences ecosystem processes of catchments and regulates regional to global carbon budgets previous studies lack focus of carbon retention associated with meandering river migration to fill the gap this study concentrated on particulate organic carbon poc retention by point bars that built via hydrogeomorphic processes within meandering river corridors we selected a typical meandering river white river in zoige basin of the tibetan plateau to conduct field works in the growing seasons of 2016 2018 and 2019 we found i concentration of poc retained within point bars was 0 17 2 52 three to five times significantly lower than on general areas of floodplain and did not show downstream trends ii poc was homogeneously distributed within individual point bars whereas the positions pioneer plants invaded had significantly higher concentrations iii the order for poc concentration within the river corridor was positions of bars without plants 1 08 positions of bars with pioneer plants 2 96 general area of floodplain 5 65 iv the frequency of pioneer plants invasion increased downstream by advantage of the widened channel hydrogeomorphic processes through building point bars exerted an intense influence in modifying the poc concentration within the meandering river corridor keywords carbon retention floodplain meandering river point bar river corridor 1 introduction rivers are active components of the global carbon cycle they work not only as neutral pipes that transport carbon from terrestrial ecosystems to oceans but also retain carbon within floodplains with potential for short 1 year to long term 102 years storage del giorgio and pace 2008 sutfin et al 2016 this retention alters the spatial distribution of carbon within river corridors thereby regulating the fluxes to oceans and atmosphere carbon dynamics within the geosphere and ecosystem processes within catchments vannote et al 1980 aufdenkampe et al 2011 one of the factors influencing carbon retention within floodplain is physical channel complexity the complexity mainly refers to i flow obstructions and channel boundary irregularity ii riparian vegetation in terms of type abundance and density and iii valley confinement specifically flow obstructions such as large wood facilitate flow divergence and provide shelter for aquatic organisms and microbes to decompose particulate organic matter pom allan and castillo 2007 channel spanning obstructions such as beaver dams and logjams wohl 2011 create pools and backwaters immediately downstream of them that delay organic matter om transport and become hotspots in which microbes mineralize organic carbon oc battin et al 2009 tank et al 2010 channelized streams decrease their lateral connectivity with floodplains and thus fail to support aggradation accumulation and storage of oc naiman et al 1986 noe and hupp 2005 riparian vegetation distributes oc throughout a catchment by inputting om into riparian ecosystems as large wood leaf litter and decayed roots and by altering flow regimes and channel geometry some riparian plants can resist high shear stress during stormflows and thus can maintain stability of channel banks by soil cohesion increased by root tensile strength abernethy and rutherfurd 2001 camporeale et al 2013 the tolerance to bank erosion compels flow velocity to decrease along vegetated banks enabling sediment and associated oc deposition downstream in turn creating new colonies for pioneer plants to grow tabacchi et al 1998 naiman et al 2005 camporeale et al 2013 valley confinement regulates hydraulic forces responsible for water and sediment transport and resulting channel form montgomery 1999 wohl et al 2012a fryirs et al 2016 o brien et al 2019 narrowly confined valleys concentrate flow and allow rapid increases in hydraulic force with increasing discharge thereby limiting deposition of sediment and associated oc broadly unconfined valleys dissipate kinetic energy during stormflows entailing deposition and storage of oc as well as promoting the development of channel planforms with stronger lateral activity such as meandering rivers naiman et al 2005 zinger et al 2011 wohl 2013 constantine et al 2014 therefore sinuous streams with dense logjams and lined by abundant riparian plants would have higher complexity thus stronger capacity to retain oc within their floodplains than highly incised straight channels confined by artificial concrete engineering this highlights the importance of floodplains of meandering rivers which generally developed in broadly unconfined valleys and characterized by high ratio of channel length to valley length and noticeable lateral migration leopold and wolman 1957 hickin and nanson 1975 nanson 1980 these characters contribute to the spatial heterogeneity across the meandering river corridors wohl et al 2018a different geomorphic units i e point bars with varying sizes and oxbow lakes with varying ages and levels of infilling thus different particle sizes of substrate different moisture levels and different types of vegetation collectively create a mosaic of floodplain environments that includes point bars and oxbow lakes with different levels of hydrologic connectivity to the active channel hudson et al 2012 li and gao 2019a greater spatial heterogeneity within floodplains results in greater retention of oc wohl et al 2018a because it generates surface and subsurface areas of low flow velocity and resulting low transport capacity leading to better opportunity for physical storage or biological consumption of oc schiemer et al 2001 battin et al 2009 as well as creates suitable and diverse habitats as reflected in greater biomass and biodiversity horan et al 2011 as conspicuous as the physical complexity of meandering rivers and the spatial heterogeneity of their floodplains limited studies have examined the retention of oc within meandering river corridors we classify existing researches on this topic into two categories i comparison between meandering segments and other planforms and ii comparison between different geomorphic units within meandering river floodplains the first focus for example at the river segment scale 10 102 km wohl et al 2018b compared large wood abundance between rivers with different planform geometries in northwestern montana and found braided and multi thread channel segments were likely more hotspots for large wood recruitment and storage than meandering channel segment lininger et al 2018 characterized oc along a subarctic river and its tributaries in alaska and found planform variations meandering wandering or braided channel segments was not strongly correlated with oc concentrations the second focus for example also in this subarctic river basin lininger et al 2018 compared different geomorphic units bars fills wetlands and higher floodplain surfaces at reach scale 1 km and found bars were coarser drier and with less oc compared to other geomorphic units and differences in oc concentration among geomorphic units were larger than among studied rivers they certainly extended our knowledge of the influence of meandering rivers on oc retention however i the relatively low retentiveness of meandering rivers in terms of large wood does not suggest they either cannot retain oc in other forms e g sediments deposited point bars since retention mechanisms are likely to partly depend on the forms of oc ii is it a possibility that the collectively outcome of different geomorphic units with varying oc contents that compose a meandering river segment covered and diminished its difference with other planforms iii since the retention of oc within floodplains rests on the interaction between active channels and floodplains what is the role fluvial processes assume in the retention consequently the knowledge gaps are i lacking focus of a certain type of retention e g particulate organic carbon poc that represented by a certain geomorphic unit e g point bar at the scale larger than river segment e g from the river source to the outlet or smaller than river reach e g within a point bar ii lacking integration of fluvial processes into the discussion of geomorphic controls on oc retention since those controls are associated with fluvial processes investigating one certain geomorphic unit from site to river scale and considering the related fluvial processes facilitate a thorough interpretation of hydrogeomorphic controls on oc retention therefore this study focuses on poc retained within point bars a typical geomorphic unit that developed near the inner banks of meander bends though lateral accretion leopold and wolman 1960 nanson 1980 kawai and julien 1975 pyrce and ashmore 2005 lotsari et al 2014 hagstrom et al 2018 we aim to fill the gaps by answering the questions and testing the related hypotheses as in table 1 the first three questions are about characterizing poc retention within point bars at site to river scales which could be extended by answering the last question the difference in poc concentration c poc between point bars and general floodplain in this paper general floodplain refers to floodplain that excluding point bars oxbow lakes and any land altered by human activities general floodplain occupies the majority area of the studied floodplain whilst point bars occupied a relatively smaller proportion to address these questions we selected white river in the source region of yellow river a typical high sinuosity meandering river located at zoige basin the northeastern tibetan plateau to conduct field measurement and sampling in the growing seasons of 2016 2018 and 2019 along the mainstream of white river we sampled sediments on point bars and general floodplain and then measured and compared their poc concentrations and spatial patterns and discussed the related influences this work helps to achieve comprehensive knowledge of poc retention within point bars and the associated hydrogeomorphic processes and thus a better understanding of changing flows and fluxes of nutrients between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the typical meandering river selected in this study is named white river a main tributary of the upper yellow river that located at zoige basin northeastern of the tibetan plateau fig 1 high altitude 3 500 m subjects white river catchment 5 488 km2 to cold and windy alpine climate with mean annual air temperature 0 7 1 1 and mean annual precipitation 649 mm mostly concentrated in the growing season may to october the catchment is a hilly area covered with meadows and peatlands vegetation here is dominated by herbaceous species such as carex muliensis and carex meyeriana since the hydrothermal condition is not suitable for woody species shrub species such as potentilla fruticosa and sibiraea angustata exist in riparian zones the tolerance to stressful conditions davidson 1995 enables shrub species as pioneers to colonize new formed lands that mainly induced by meandering river lateral migration the catchment is abundant in organic rich peat soils which cover over 17 of the area with an average storage of 98 kg m 2 zhou et al 2016 due to the frequent saturation that limits aerobic microbial activity and metabolism and thus contributes to accumulation of om in soils xue et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 cold and wet alpine climate and meadows and peatlands with abundant peat soils characterize the ecoregion white river corridor belongs to severe alpine climate restricts the population density to a very low level 5 8 persons per km2 compared with other regions of china as a result industries and constructions barely affect the environment peatland degradation induced by overgrazing and ditches drainage is the major environmental problem in this area li et al 2015 li and gao 2019b li et al 2019 meadows are fenced for local residents to graze tibetan sheep and yak herdsmen have excavated thousands of ditches in peatlands to lower water table and thereby to change peatlands into meadows in order to hold more livestock wang et al 2019 fortunately in terms of conducting this study the majority area of the floodplain is escaped from the influence of intense human activities allowing point bars not to be disturbed and thus purely reflect the lateral accretion processes the annual mean discharge and mean sediment load of white river are 20 7 108 m 3 and 42 9 104 t respectively precipitation snowmelt mainly from april to june and groundwater are major water resources of the river thus discharge begins to increase in april peaks during june to september and followed by decrease zhao et al 2016 li et al 2019 length sinuosity gradient and mean channel width of white river are 277 km 1 91 2 4 and 75 m respectively fig 2 a river gradient g r follows the trend of altitude demonstrates a rapid decrease from upper stream to middle and lower parts mean channel width w r shows the reverse trend that sharply increases at the last 30 km near the outlet sinuosity s r has an increasing trend downstream suggesting that lower stream tends to have more high sinuosity meander bends if unconfined valley is defined as 10 times wider than bankfull channel width wohl et al 2012b then only the first 20 km of the river is confined fig 1 b the valley widens downstream and anabranching segments begin to appear at the last 20 km near the outlet 2 2 field and laboratory works the main channel of white river was annually sampled in july 2016 may 2018 and may 2019 all fell into the growing seasons table 2 and fig 2 show details of field sampling and measurement in general sampling sites were evenly distributed along the river limited to inconvenient transportation however river segment near the source 40 km long was not sampled avoiding human altered floodplain mainly at hongyuan and tangke town the river goes through fig 1 b was another concern in choosing sampling sites this caused the relative larger interval between no 10 and 11 and between no 23 and 24 in fig 2 a crescent shaped point bars are near the inner banks of meander bends and they are easy to be discerned both in google earth imagery and on the spot according to the color fig 1 c fig 2 b and c because they mainly are bare lands and seldomly have vegetation the process that in the long term accreted point bars attach to the floodplain is associated with the colonization of pioneer plants crosato 2008 parker et al 2011 xu and bai 2013 which thus could be found both within point bars and within general floodplain consequently we identified the boundary between point bars and general floodplain fig 2 c as i a point bar includes deposited sediments and pioneer plants ii ground contains plants other than pioneer plants belongs to general floodplain iii ground contains pioneer plants only belongs to point bar point bar samples were collected using a shovel rather than a soil auger limited to inconvenient transportation and severe alpine climate from the top 10 cm layers after roots manually removed we deem this depth reflects recent deposition according to the hydrologic regime of white river and common deposition thickness of point bars along the river only seven sites were sampled to 40 50 cm depth depending on deposition thickness for two reasons first point bars are formed layer by layer through lateral accretion van de lageweg et al 2014 on point bars of white river however field observation found that boundaries between different deposited layers were not obvious this probably because the size of white river is not large enough since sizes of point bars are proportional to size of the river and larger bars tend to have more distinctive layers leopold and wolman 1960 second inevitable logistical constraints restricted the application of efficient sampling devices eighteen out of the sampled point bars had pioneer plants scattered distributed within them many of these pioneer plants were shrub species making them easy to be distinguished from herbaceous species that dominate general floodplain within point bars where available samples were also collected from the ground pioneer plants grew on general floodplain sampling positions were 20 m in distance from the associated point bars samples were collected using shovel as a mix from the top 30 cm layers but not from different layers two reasons explain this first the focus of this study is poc retention within point bars second though many previous studies have focused on this their intention were mostly to recognize whether oc were autochthonous or allochthonous e g scott and wohl 2018 declining c poc with depth indicates autochthonous litter inputs while vertical heterogeneity indicates allochthonous deposited by overbank flows appling et al 2014 lininger et al 2018 scott and wohl 2018 in our study area however it has been a common knowledge that governed by ecoregion low temperature and frequent saturation inhibit microbial activity to decompose oc that mainly comes from dead biomass resulting relatively high oc concentration of general floodplain e g huo et al 2013 xue et al 2015 yang et al 2017 thus the mixed soils from the top 30 cm layers rather than the top 10 cm layers as on point bars because floodplain had longer deposition time could represent the recent oc storage within general floodplain point bar and general floodplain samples were then dried for analysis of poc content using elemental analyzer vario el chns o particle size distribution of sediments on point bars top 10 cm layer from the middle position and on general floodplain were measured in laboratory using laser granulometer malvern ms 2000 soil temperature conductivity salinity and moisture were measured in situ using moisture meter shunkeda tr 6d 2 3 statistical analysis and source of data in order to identify whether c poc on point bars and general floodplain had increasing decreasing trends downstream or randomly fluctuated we applied a simple linear regression model to describe the downstream trends of c poc as response variable using the distance from the river source d km as predictor variable and then tested the significance of the regression coefficient using t test α 0 05 existence of a significant regression coefficient suggests a significant trend of c poc downstream the downstream trends of i point bars in terms of length m maximum width m area m2 and density per 10 km and ii particle size distribution in sediments were tested using the same method to determine whether significant differences in c poc and particle size distribution existed i between point bars including positions with and without pioneer plants and general floodplain and ii within point bars we used i t test α 0 05 if data obeyed normal distribution otherwise ii wilcoxon rank sum test α 0 05 to recognize whether correlation existed i between c poc and physical chemical factors and ii between channel geometry and point bars in terms of area density and whether had plants we applied i pearson correlation analysis α 0 05 which results shown as r 2 if data obeyed normal distribution otherwise ii spearman rank correlation α 0 05 which results shown as ρ statistical works were done with spss statistics ibm hereafter by significant we mean statistically significant α 0 05 unless otherwise specified point bars and their boundaries including pioneer plants were recognized from field observation combined with google earth imagery since the imagery of our study area is of high resolution 0 5 m 3 results 3 1 point bars distribution a total of 337 bars 1 22 per km were recognized along the meandering river length l b maximum width w b area a b of bars ranged between 7 and 2 351 m 2 432 m and 151 179 109 m2 respectively with mean values 410 m 82 m and 25 862 m2 respectively and median values 349 m 70 m and 14 261 m2 respectively 87 bars 26 did not have pioneer plants grown within them while 250 bars did sinuosity s c and width w c of meander bends these bars belong to ranged between 1 02 and 13 91 m and 2 301 m respectively with mean values 2 14 and 36 m respectively and median values 1 65 and 29 m respectively all these parameters definitions as shown in fig 2 c had significant increasing trends downstream fig 3 the number of point bars n b otherwise demonstrated a different trend fig 4 on the basis of a 10 km interval it sharply increased at the channel segment 40 60 km away from river source and then decreased gradually downstream fig 4 both the two trends were significant the ratio of the number of bars with pioneer plants n b p to n b was stable no significant trends across the river suggesting that n b p followed the downstream trend of n b fig 4 mean area of point bars a mb followed the similar increasing trend downstream of a b fig 4 3 2 physical chemical features of sediments retained within point bars in terms of the proportion in total sediments all the five levels of particle size did not show significant trends downstream suggesting a stable distribution pattern across the river fig 5 a this pattern was characterized by i particle size 2 mm averagely accounted for 67 of point bar sediments whilst ii particle size 1 mm averagely accounted for 29 together making iii the least contribution of particle size 2 1 mm 4 among all the five levels no significant differences in particle size distribution were found between bars with pioneer plants and without pioneer plants temperature moisture conductivity and salinity of point bar sediments did not show significant trends downstream and their mean values were 12 5 5 8 2 3 mg l 1 and 4 6 μs cm 1 respectively fig 5 b moisture conductivity and salinity were significantly positively pairwise correlated but none of them were significantly correlated with temperature 3 3 physical chemical features of general floodplain soil the proportion of sediments with particle size 10 mm significantly decreased downstream whilst particle size 10 mm that divided into four levels fig 6 a were found no significant trends downstream general floodplain was dominated by soils with particle size 0 25 mm which averagely contributed 66 making coarser soils 0 25 mm collectively accounted for about one third temperature moisture conductivity and salinity of general floodplain soil did not have significant trends downstream and their mean values were 11 6 18 0 10 6 mg l 1 and 19 4 μs cm 1 respectively fig 6 b similar to point bars significantly positive pairwise correlations were found between moisture conductivity and salinity temperature was significantly negatively correlated with moisture but not correlated with conductivity and salinity 3 4 poc concentration within point bars vertically no significant trends in c poc were found in all the seven sites fig 7 b except for no 16 in which declining c poc with depth was significant at site no 12 c poc also decreased with depth but with a non significant trend inclining c poc with depth e g no 13 and vertical heterogeneity e g no 14 were found at the other five sites longitudinally poc concentration did not have significant differences between upper middle and lower positions fig 7 a the mean values of c poc at upper middle and lower positions of point bars were 0 95 1 21 and 1 09 respectively the maximum values could exist both at upper e g no 7 middle e g no 5 and lower positions e g no 9 and so did the minimum values suggesting that distribution of c poc did not have longitudinally predictable patterns within individual point bars sediment samples from the ground where pioneer plants grew had significantly higher c poc mean value 2 96 than from the ground without pioneer plants mean value 1 08 demonstrating a notable spatial heterogeneity within individual point bars fig 7 a 3 5 downstream pattern poc concentration of point bar sediments poc concentration of point bar sediments were between 0 70 and 1 44 in 2016 0 17 2 52 in 2018 and 0 29 2 36 in 2019 fig 8 c poc in all the three years did not have significant trends downstream implying that along the river poc concentration of sediments retained within point bars tended to fluctuate in a same range rather than following predictable longitudinal variations this range however is relatively large according to the variances of c poc 0 48 and 0 38 in 2018 and 2019 respectively nearly half their mean values generally along the river poc concentration of point bar sediments was trendless but unstable 3 6 downstream pattern poc concentration of general floodplain soils poc concentration of general floodplain soils ranged between 1 09 and 6 48 in 2016 1 55 9 55 in 2018 and 1 71 11 01 in 2019 fig 9 variances of c poc in 2016 2018 and 2019 were 1 9 3 5 and 6 6 respectively similar to point bars in all the three years c poc of floodplain soils neither shows significant trends downstream suggesting a stable range in which c poc fluctuated rather than increasing or decreasing tendencies 4 discussion our core concept is that within the meandering river corridor hydrogeomorphic processes through building point bars prominently alter poc concentration of floodplain that mainly determined by ecoregion hydrogeomorphic processes in this study refers to that in meander bends of meandering rivers water flow influenced by channel and valley geometry laterally deposits transported sediments and organic matters onto the inner banks and thereby building point bars ecoregion controls the poc concentration of floodplain through climate landscape and soil refer to sections 2 1 and 2 2 4 1 point bars distribution where hydrogeomorphic processes retained poc we characterize the downstream trends of point bars distribution as i increasing length and maximum width and resulting area of individual bars fig 3 ii decreasing number of bars fig 4 did not offset the increasing area of individual bars entailing iii inclined mean area of bars fig 4 and table 3 but still iv much smaller relative to general floodplain fig 1 c therefore at river scale point bars were not evenly distributed along the river h1b but with predictable patterns river engineers fluvial geomorphologists and ecologists have argued that channel and valley geometry regulate the distribution of hydraulic forces that responsible for sediments transport and resulting point bars building leopold et al 1964 montgomery 1999 wohl et al 2012a xu and bai 2013 thus we tested the correlations between point bar geometry and channel valley geometry at site to segment scales table 3 at site scale individual bars were largely shaped by the geometry of their related meander bends size of point bars responded positively to increases in width and sinuosity of meander bends as expected since point bars are a typical geomorphic unit belongs to meandering rivers that portrayed as with high sinuosity usually 1 5 leopold and wolman 1957 and unconfined valleys parsapour moghaddam and rennie 2018 that facilitate channel widening at segment scale the increasing trend of number of point bars in the first 60 km of the river where water flows from confined to unconfined valleys fig 1 b was significantly negatively correlated with river gradient indicating the influence of available space for energy dissipation that controlled by valley geometry on lateral accretion of alluvial sediments sutfin et al 2016 meandering is an energy shedding mechanism constantine et al 2014 nanson and huang 2017 because rivers flow with imposed water and sediments down valley gradients they mainly inherited they self regulate energy expenditure to maintain stable nanson and huang 2017 while downstream unconfined valley offered space for the channel to adjust its bedform and cross section form to develop point bars near the source narrowly confined valley and steep channel concentrated flow and helped prominent increases in hydraulic force thereby limiting the deposition of sediments and om leopold et al 1964 knighton 1998 naiman et al 2005 wohl 2013 at segment scale the decreasing trend of number of point bars in the last 217 km of the river however was not significantly correlated with any of the channel geometry parameters the complex feedback between process and form that rules migration of meandering rivers is still incompletely understood güneralp and rhoads 2008 even so channel depth might play a role the increasing trend downstream of channel sinuosity suggested increases in channel depth because they are positively correlated leliavsk 1955 leopold and wolman 1960 inclined channel depth might reduce the vertical velocity gradient thereby weakening helical circulation causing the thread of high velocity hugged the inner banks and did not cross the channel resulting the absence of the mechanism for building point bars leopold and wolman 1960 nanson 1980 in summary channel and valley geometry governed the strength of hydrogeomorphic processes that responsible for the development and the features of point bars by controlling the space available for the river to conduct self regulation as the river flowed from confined valley to unconfined valley and widened and meandered greater influence of hydrogeomorphic processes became more intense caused the increasing area of point bars implying the amplified retention of poc downstream 4 2 poc within point bars retention capacity of hydrogeomorphic processes we hypothesized that within point bars c poc was not homogeneously distributed h1a it was partly refused by the results fig 7 vertically both inclining declining tendencies and vertical heterogeneity of c poc were found fig 7 b suggesting that poc concentration did not follow obvious vertical trends we believe this was associated with the correlation between c poc and sediment particle sizes on point bars c poc was significantly positively correlated with the proportion of the finest sediments 0 25 mm but not significantly correlated with coarser sediments fig 10 b this was in accordance with previous studies pinay et al 1992 jobbagy and jackson 2000 hoffmann et al 2009 and has been thoroughly explained sorption of oc is governed by particle size and resulting available surface area as well as the availability of calcium iron and aluminum such that finer textured soils typically contain more oc than coarser soils kaiser and guggenberger 2000 rasmussen et al 2018 consequently the changes in the proportion of fine sediments could to some extent represent the changes in poc concentration on the average fine sediments can be carried higher up the bar than coarse ones thus point bars roughly show a gradation of particle size from coarse near the base to fine near the flood plain level leopold and wolman 1960 sometimes however this fining upward tendency is not obvious or even could be replaced by upward coarsening sequences słowik 2016 therefore in this case lacking vertical trends of poc concentration might because the proportion of fine sediments changed unpredictably with depth longitudinally we found c poc was evenly distributed along the long axes of point bars rather than had predictable patterns fig 7 a suggesting that at site scale hydrogeomorphic processes uniformly deposited sediments and om to build point bars this was not beyond our expectation because i point bars are fluvial deposits that characterized by a hierarchy of lateral accretion surfaces and within the same surfaces point bars are built of a uniform material well sorted van de lageweg et al 2014 słowik 2016 durkin et al 2018 and ii at site scale mean bar length 410 m it was not likely to have factors destructive enough to cause poorly sorted particle size distribution poc concentration at positions with pioneer plants was about three times higher than at positions without pioneer plants fig 7 a this spatial heterogeneity demonstrated the role of vegetation plays in om distribution that has been widely recognized in riparian ecosystems fierke and kauffman 2005 sutfin et al 2016 scott and wohl 2018 vegetation contributes to poc concentration through the input of i recently fallen branches twigs and leaves that compose surface organic layers ii decomposed organic matters and litter that compose humus layers naiman et al 2005 lutes et al 2006 and iii recently highlighted by sokol et al 2019 the contribution from living root i e rhizodeposits hence the presence of vegetation governed whether poc could be inputted through biological paths thus determined the marked differences in poc concentration between positions with and without pioneer plants combining sections 4 1 and 4 2 we summarize the influence of hydrogeomorphic processes on poc retention as i at site scale the processes longitudinally and vertically evenly distributed poc whilst spatial heterogeneity occurred due to the interference of pioneer plants ii at river scale the processes became more intense downstream and caused amplified retention of poc 4 3 differences in poc concentration between point bars and general floodplain hydrogeomorphic processes locally disturbed ecoregion in this section poc concentration of point bars refers to the positions without vegetation which occupied most of the area fig 2 c the positions in which pioneer plants grew will be discussed in section 4 4 c poc of point bars did not have significant trends downstream fig 8 thus verified our hypothesis that poc concentration distributed homogeneously among point bars across the river h1c c poc of general floodplain neither had significant trends downstream fig 9 therefore we found that in all the three sampled years throughout the river poc concentration of point bars was significantly lower than of general floodplain h2 about three to five times fig 10 d immediate causes we believe the differed particle size distribution and resulting physical chemical features were directly responsible for the distinctive differences in poc concentration between point bars and general floodplain the reasons are as follows i particle size itself affects the capacity of sediments to adsorb organic carbon as mentioned in section 4 2 and this influence has been verified in the study area according to the observation that the increased proportion of fine sediments led to the increased poc concentration of point bars fig 10 b ii particle size differences result in varying soil moisture because fine size fraction is of greater capacity than coarse size fraction to promote lower evaporation rate and thus to keep higher moisture content dingman 2008 and moisture is closely related to conductivity that partly determines salinity rhoades et al 1989 iii these factors affect oc through mechanisms such as saturation hinders decomposition and increases potential for long term storage of oc jobbagy and jackson 2000 falloon et al 2011 and iv some of the mechanisms have been verified in the study area e g co2 and ch4 emissions that regulate the storage of oc reservoirs were strongly affected by soil moisture gao et al 2011 yang et al 2014 yang et al 2017 therefore the finer soils fig 10 a and c and resulting environmental features fig 10 e might together contribute to the higher poc concentration of general floodplain relative to point bars one may argue that c poc of general floodplain was not significantly correlated with i any levels of particle size fig 10 b and ii temperature fig 10 e our explanations are i the coefficients suggested the positive correlation between c poc and finer soils and the negative correlation between c poc and coarser soils though not significant fig 10 b and ii temperature apparently influences moisture and has been proved of great importance in regulating soil oc storage in the study area yang et al 2017 root causes the differed particle size distribution reflected the varying sources of point bar sediments and general floodplain soils that governed by hydrogeomorphic processes and ecoregion respectively which we believe were root causes that ultimately determined the differences in poc concentration between point bars and general floodplain ecoregion might influence particle size distribution in floodplain soils and resulting poc concentration through two mechanisms i litter decomposition degree of decomposition regulates soil particle size distribution because the more undecomposed fibrous the material the coarser the particle size levesque and dinel 1977 within white river corridor animal activities such as earthworm invasion wu et al 2017 and plateau zokors burrow zhang et al 2003 and microbial metabolism that resulted from the trade off between cold and wet alpine climate and lowered water table gao et al 2014 combined increased temperature xue et al 2015 together enabled the decomposition of litter that sourced vertically from the relatively large aboveground and belowground biomass ma et al 2017 ii plant root system controlling soil erosion root architecture and density contribute to slope steadiness and soil erosion control reubens et al 2007 ola et al 2015 thus help the stability of fine soils basic et al 2004 wang et al 2019 the mean root shoot ratio for the study area according to ma et al 2017 was 10 and the top 30 cm soils contributed 80 of the root biomass suggesting the capacity for the root system to retain soils with finer particle sizes and accompanied higher poc concentration the relatively coarse sediments of point bars and resulting lower c poc might result from two mechanisms that associated with hydrogeomorphic processes i limited to the lower water temperature deficiency of nutrients and high discharge the river lacked microbes and invertebrates to physically and biologically break down coarse sediments before their accretion onto point bars wipfli et al 2007 zhao et al 2016 ii except for sediments deposition high discharge also enables water flowing over point bars and as a result triggering the erosion process even with relatively low kinetic energy of flow nicoll and hickin 2010 because coarse sediments are more capable to resist physical disturbances the erosion might further decrease the proportion of fine sediments therefore at site scale hydrogeomorphic processes regulated poc distribution and caused poc concentration hollows relative to general floodplain through the development of point bars this difference was consistent across the river suggesting that the influence of hydrogeomorphic processes were stable at river scale this was in accordance with previous studies that argued that at landscape scale 102 106 km2 ecoregions characterize biogeographic regions through climate soil type and biotic communities whilst at local scale of individual channel segments 10 103 m in length valley channel geometry and biotic factors determine oc distribution through the influence on the decomposition transport and accumulation of om schumm 1977 tabacchi et al 1998 benda et al 2005 camporeale et al 2013 dodds et al 2015 sutfin et al 2016 moreover it has been argued that ecoregions are characterized by distinct vegetation types at region scale but they cannot differentiate vegetation in river corridor ecosystems from adjacent uplands sutfin et al 2016 in our case however point bars that barely had plants indicated that hydrogeomorphic processes at site scale were able to distinguish vegetation near the inner banks from both riparian zones and adjacent uplands in this view although hydrogeomorphic processes were not comparable in functional scope to ecoregion they might bear greater strength to locally regulate the distribution and types of vegetation and thus biological poc inputs 4 4 pioneer plants invading point bars ecoregion struggled against hydrogeomorphic processes vegetation at site scale reflects geomorphology with floodplain primary succession occurring from bare alluvial surfaces e g point bars created through river lateral migration and vegetation reflecting processes of sedimentation flooding and fluvial disturbance viereck et al 1993 whited et al 2007 lateral connectivity of floodplain river system to some extent mirrors channel geometry and influences germination establishment and survival of riparian species cooper et al 1999 camporeale et al 2013 during baseflows and falling stages the highest velocity thread gradually shifts towards outer banks exposing the higher positions of point bars thereby providing space and time for pioneer plant species to colonize if the durations of low flow stages are long enough the presence of roots and plants together with sediment consolidation and compaction can provide extra soil resistance to the newly formed terraces thus contribute to point bar stabilization to resist the erosion during stormflows this resistance creates a positive feedback flow velocity decreases along banks and facilitates sediment deposition by which creating new germination sites for pioneer plants in turn contribute to bar stability and continued aggradation tabacchi et al 1998 naiman et al 2005 camporeale et al 2013 in the long term accreted point bars attach to the floodplain and new formed point bars restart the same bank advance process crosato 2008 güneralp and rhoads 2008 parker et al 2011 xu and bai 2013 parsapour moghaddam and rennie 2018 4 4 1 struggled at river scale the mechanism of pioneer plants invasion suggests the interaction between hydroclimatic regime and fluvial geomorphology and reflects the struggle of ecoregion against hydrogeomorphic processes therefore within the river corridor we attempt to find out i whether the progress of plants invasion was associated with valley geometry fig 11 and ii whether differences in point bar geometry existed between bars invaded and not invaded table 4 the proportion of point bars with pioneer plants was significantly negatively correlated with river gradient and significantly positively correlated with mean channel length but not significantly correlated with sinuosity fig 11 this probably because decreased gradient and widened channel together reduced flow velocity thus weakened the erosion processes occurred on point bars point bars colonized by pioneer plants were significantly larger in size than bars have not been colonized table 4 this further supported the correlations between the frequency of pioneer plants invasion and valley geometry because of the negative correlation between bar size and gradient and the positive correlation between bar size and channel width table 3 both fig 11 and table 4 point to the conclusion that pioneer plants invaded point bars more frequently downstream because of the decreasing trend of gradient and the increasing trend of channel width downstream fig 2 a this suggested that ecoregion gradually prevailed hydrogeomorphic processes and gained mastery downstream the question is how because i at river scale climatic factors that characterize ecoregion vary slightly and ii the correlations between hydrologic and geomorphic factors that control hydrogeomorphic processes and the frequency of pioneer plants invasion fig 11 we argue that it was the gradually undermined hydrogeomorphic processes that enabled the prevalence of ecoregion rather than the intensification of the ecoregion itself 4 4 2 struggled at site scale at site scale we are interested in whether differences in poc concentration existed between general floodplain and the positions of point bars pioneer plants grew as we already know they both had higher c poc than the positions of bars without pioneer plants results show that except for site no 12 and 16 c poc was significantly higher on general floodplain than on the positions of point bars with pioneer plants fig 7 a and 9 hence the order for poc concentration was positions of bars without plants mean value 1 08 positions of bars with plants mean value 2 96 general floodplain mean value 5 65 we infer this sequence was associated with the successional stage of vegetation which as we observed refer to section 2 1 and fig 2 c was positions of bars without plants bare land positions of bars with plants pioneer plants that mainly were shrub species general floodplain both shrub and herbaceous species existed because i vegetation contributes to soil oc through the input of litter and humus layers which is the function of time benfield 1997 and according to previous studies ii channel lateral migration can reset floodplain vegetation primary succession viereck et al 1993 and globally the wide ranging values for riparian biomass oc directly reflect vegetation successional stage sutfin et al 2016 at site scale the gradually advanced ecoregion might neither because of its self intensification but also resulted from that the weakened hydrogeomorphic processes gave an opportunity that could be exploited to ecoregion s advantage because i the farther away from river channel the weaker the influence of hydrogeomorphic processes ii the continuous deposition of point bars drives early formed point bars away from the channel and thus gradually isolates them from hydrogeomorphic influences and iii at site scale climatic factors e g sunlight and precipitation that control ecoregion neither change much 4 5 spatial consequences of the struggle hotspots depending upon scale biogeochemical hotspots are defined as the areas in which individual reactants for specific biogeochemical reactions coincide and result in disproportionately high reaction rates relative to the surrounding area mcclain et al 2003 researchers have found that i hotspots are often enhanced at terrestrial aquatic interfaces mcclain et al 2003 ii any physical feature that facilitates flow separation lower velocity and at least temporary storage of poc can promote the formation of hotspots beckman and wohl 2014 iii physical channel complexity helps creating hotspots by providing opportunities for microorganisms to metabolize carbon and other nutrients for energy and growth battin et al 2009 and iv continued source of reactants often supplied by hydrologic flow paths is necessary to maintain high processing rates mcclain et al 2003 in meandering river corridors iii sinuous channel induces ii flow separation vermeulen et al 2015 and iv through sediments deposition build point bars that i connect floodplain and stream it seems like point bars met all conditions to qualify as hotspots in this case the lower poc concentration relative to adjacent general floodplain however explicitly suggested that point bars actually were not hotspots so why we seek for reasons by browsing through river to site scales table 5 from river to segment scales because climatic controls on landscape were not likely to vary much general floodplain inherited the landscape of unconfined valley thus shared the similar mechanism of biological om accumulation and decomposition and as a result oc content therefore at segment scale the fact that general floodplain was more likely a hotspot relative to point bars was not because disturbances happened within the unconfined valley and caused localized dramatic increases in oc concentration but resulted from the relatively lower oc concentration of point bars at site scale point bars colonized by pioneer plants represented the struggle of ecoregion against hydrogeomorphic processes and caused higher oc concentration relative to surroundings thereby making positions with pioneer plants hotspots therefore though point bars bore many characters of hotspots they were anything but hotspots instead they were a disturbance to hotspots at segment scale that resulted from hydrogeomorphic processes ecoregion resisted this interference by invading point bars with pioneer plants further creating hotspots within bars through locally increased oc content consequently what hydrogeomorphic processes actually created is spatial heterogeneity that represented as point bars biogeochemical hotspots are a specific form of spatial heterogeneity mcclain et al 2003 represented in this case by the higher poc concentration relative to surroundings however spatial heterogeneity not only refers to hotspots but also refers to coldspots that in this case can be explained as point bars that had lower poc concentration relative to surroundings 5 conclusion in meandering channels of white river in zoige basin that developed as the result of the complex interaction between hydrodynamics sediments transport and morphology hydrogeomorphic processes laterally deposit sediments and organic matters onto the inner banks of active channel thereby building point bars and retaining organic carbon under the influence of valley and channel geometry this retention amplified downstream as reflected by the increased area of point bars but within individual point bars particulate organic carbon was homogeneously distributed unless interfered by pioneer plants point bars had much lower particulate organic carbon concentration than the general areas of floodplain in which organic carbon storage mainly controlled by ecoregion demonstrating the crucial role of hydrogeomorphic processes played at local scale in modifying the effect of ecoregion on organic carbon concentration within the meandering river corridor however ecoregion resisted this disturbance both within individual point bars and across the river pioneer plants were dispatched to point bars in order to first locally increase organic carbon concentration and finally completely merge point bars and the frequency of pioneer plants invasion increased downstream by advantage of the changed channel geometry the interaction between ecoregion and hydrogeomorphic processes caused varying biogeochemical hotspots that depending upon spatial scales credit authorship contribution

5369,carbon retention within river corridors influences ecosystem processes of catchments and regulates regional to global carbon budgets previous studies lack focus of carbon retention associated with meandering river migration to fill the gap this study concentrated on particulate organic carbon poc retention by point bars that built via hydrogeomorphic processes within meandering river corridors we selected a typical meandering river white river in zoige basin of the tibetan plateau to conduct field works in the growing seasons of 2016 2018 and 2019 we found i concentration of poc retained within point bars was 0 17 2 52 three to five times significantly lower than on general areas of floodplain and did not show downstream trends ii poc was homogeneously distributed within individual point bars whereas the positions pioneer plants invaded had significantly higher concentrations iii the order for poc concentration within the river corridor was positions of bars without plants 1 08 positions of bars with pioneer plants 2 96 general area of floodplain 5 65 iv the frequency of pioneer plants invasion increased downstream by advantage of the widened channel hydrogeomorphic processes through building point bars exerted an intense influence in modifying the poc concentration within the meandering river corridor keywords carbon retention floodplain meandering river point bar river corridor 1 introduction rivers are active components of the global carbon cycle they work not only as neutral pipes that transport carbon from terrestrial ecosystems to oceans but also retain carbon within floodplains with potential for short 1 year to long term 102 years storage del giorgio and pace 2008 sutfin et al 2016 this retention alters the spatial distribution of carbon within river corridors thereby regulating the fluxes to oceans and atmosphere carbon dynamics within the geosphere and ecosystem processes within catchments vannote et al 1980 aufdenkampe et al 2011 one of the factors influencing carbon retention within floodplain is physical channel complexity the complexity mainly refers to i flow obstructions and channel boundary irregularity ii riparian vegetation in terms of type abundance and density and iii valley confinement specifically flow obstructions such as large wood facilitate flow divergence and provide shelter for aquatic organisms and microbes to decompose particulate organic matter pom allan and castillo 2007 channel spanning obstructions such as beaver dams and logjams wohl 2011 create pools and backwaters immediately downstream of them that delay organic matter om transport and become hotspots in which microbes mineralize organic carbon oc battin et al 2009 tank et al 2010 channelized streams decrease their lateral connectivity with floodplains and thus fail to support aggradation accumulation and storage of oc naiman et al 1986 noe and hupp 2005 riparian vegetation distributes oc throughout a catchment by inputting om into riparian ecosystems as large wood leaf litter and decayed roots and by altering flow regimes and channel geometry some riparian plants can resist high shear stress during stormflows and thus can maintain stability of channel banks by soil cohesion increased by root tensile strength abernethy and rutherfurd 2001 camporeale et al 2013 the tolerance to bank erosion compels flow velocity to decrease along vegetated banks enabling sediment and associated oc deposition downstream in turn creating new colonies for pioneer plants to grow tabacchi et al 1998 naiman et al 2005 camporeale et al 2013 valley confinement regulates hydraulic forces responsible for water and sediment transport and resulting channel form montgomery 1999 wohl et al 2012a fryirs et al 2016 o brien et al 2019 narrowly confined valleys concentrate flow and allow rapid increases in hydraulic force with increasing discharge thereby limiting deposition of sediment and associated oc broadly unconfined valleys dissipate kinetic energy during stormflows entailing deposition and storage of oc as well as promoting the development of channel planforms with stronger lateral activity such as meandering rivers naiman et al 2005 zinger et al 2011 wohl 2013 constantine et al 2014 therefore sinuous streams with dense logjams and lined by abundant riparian plants would have higher complexity thus stronger capacity to retain oc within their floodplains than highly incised straight channels confined by artificial concrete engineering this highlights the importance of floodplains of meandering rivers which generally developed in broadly unconfined valleys and characterized by high ratio of channel length to valley length and noticeable lateral migration leopold and wolman 1957 hickin and nanson 1975 nanson 1980 these characters contribute to the spatial heterogeneity across the meandering river corridors wohl et al 2018a different geomorphic units i e point bars with varying sizes and oxbow lakes with varying ages and levels of infilling thus different particle sizes of substrate different moisture levels and different types of vegetation collectively create a mosaic of floodplain environments that includes point bars and oxbow lakes with different levels of hydrologic connectivity to the active channel hudson et al 2012 li and gao 2019a greater spatial heterogeneity within floodplains results in greater retention of oc wohl et al 2018a because it generates surface and subsurface areas of low flow velocity and resulting low transport capacity leading to better opportunity for physical storage or biological consumption of oc schiemer et al 2001 battin et al 2009 as well as creates suitable and diverse habitats as reflected in greater biomass and biodiversity horan et al 2011 as conspicuous as the physical complexity of meandering rivers and the spatial heterogeneity of their floodplains limited studies have examined the retention of oc within meandering river corridors we classify existing researches on this topic into two categories i comparison between meandering segments and other planforms and ii comparison between different geomorphic units within meandering river floodplains the first focus for example at the river segment scale 10 102 km wohl et al 2018b compared large wood abundance between rivers with different planform geometries in northwestern montana and found braided and multi thread channel segments were likely more hotspots for large wood recruitment and storage than meandering channel segment lininger et al 2018 characterized oc along a subarctic river and its tributaries in alaska and found planform variations meandering wandering or braided channel segments was not strongly correlated with oc concentrations the second focus for example also in this subarctic river basin lininger et al 2018 compared different geomorphic units bars fills wetlands and higher floodplain surfaces at reach scale 1 km and found bars were coarser drier and with less oc compared to other geomorphic units and differences in oc concentration among geomorphic units were larger than among studied rivers they certainly extended our knowledge of the influence of meandering rivers on oc retention however i the relatively low retentiveness of meandering rivers in terms of large wood does not suggest they either cannot retain oc in other forms e g sediments deposited point bars since retention mechanisms are likely to partly depend on the forms of oc ii is it a possibility that the collectively outcome of different geomorphic units with varying oc contents that compose a meandering river segment covered and diminished its difference with other planforms iii since the retention of oc within floodplains rests on the interaction between active channels and floodplains what is the role fluvial processes assume in the retention consequently the knowledge gaps are i lacking focus of a certain type of retention e g particulate organic carbon poc that represented by a certain geomorphic unit e g point bar at the scale larger than river segment e g from the river source to the outlet or smaller than river reach e g within a point bar ii lacking integration of fluvial processes into the discussion of geomorphic controls on oc retention since those controls are associated with fluvial processes investigating one certain geomorphic unit from site to river scale and considering the related fluvial processes facilitate a thorough interpretation of hydrogeomorphic controls on oc retention therefore this study focuses on poc retained within point bars a typical geomorphic unit that developed near the inner banks of meander bends though lateral accretion leopold and wolman 1960 nanson 1980 kawai and julien 1975 pyrce and ashmore 2005 lotsari et al 2014 hagstrom et al 2018 we aim to fill the gaps by answering the questions and testing the related hypotheses as in table 1 the first three questions are about characterizing poc retention within point bars at site to river scales which could be extended by answering the last question the difference in poc concentration c poc between point bars and general floodplain in this paper general floodplain refers to floodplain that excluding point bars oxbow lakes and any land altered by human activities general floodplain occupies the majority area of the studied floodplain whilst point bars occupied a relatively smaller proportion to address these questions we selected white river in the source region of yellow river a typical high sinuosity meandering river located at zoige basin the northeastern tibetan plateau to conduct field measurement and sampling in the growing seasons of 2016 2018 and 2019 along the mainstream of white river we sampled sediments on point bars and general floodplain and then measured and compared their poc concentrations and spatial patterns and discussed the related influences this work helps to achieve comprehensive knowledge of poc retention within point bars and the associated hydrogeomorphic processes and thus a better understanding of changing flows and fluxes of nutrients between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the typical meandering river selected in this study is named white river a main tributary of the upper yellow river that located at zoige basin northeastern of the tibetan plateau fig 1 high altitude 3 500 m subjects white river catchment 5 488 km2 to cold and windy alpine climate with mean annual air temperature 0 7 1 1 and mean annual precipitation 649 mm mostly concentrated in the growing season may to october the catchment is a hilly area covered with meadows and peatlands vegetation here is dominated by herbaceous species such as carex muliensis and carex meyeriana since the hydrothermal condition is not suitable for woody species shrub species such as potentilla fruticosa and sibiraea angustata exist in riparian zones the tolerance to stressful conditions davidson 1995 enables shrub species as pioneers to colonize new formed lands that mainly induced by meandering river lateral migration the catchment is abundant in organic rich peat soils which cover over 17 of the area with an average storage of 98 kg m 2 zhou et al 2016 due to the frequent saturation that limits aerobic microbial activity and metabolism and thus contributes to accumulation of om in soils xue et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 cold and wet alpine climate and meadows and peatlands with abundant peat soils characterize the ecoregion white river corridor belongs to severe alpine climate restricts the population density to a very low level 5 8 persons per km2 compared with other regions of china as a result industries and constructions barely affect the environment peatland degradation induced by overgrazing and ditches drainage is the major environmental problem in this area li et al 2015 li and gao 2019b li et al 2019 meadows are fenced for local residents to graze tibetan sheep and yak herdsmen have excavated thousands of ditches in peatlands to lower water table and thereby to change peatlands into meadows in order to hold more livestock wang et al 2019 fortunately in terms of conducting this study the majority area of the floodplain is escaped from the influence of intense human activities allowing point bars not to be disturbed and thus purely reflect the lateral accretion processes the annual mean discharge and mean sediment load of white river are 20 7 108 m 3 and 42 9 104 t respectively precipitation snowmelt mainly from april to june and groundwater are major water resources of the river thus discharge begins to increase in april peaks during june to september and followed by decrease zhao et al 2016 li et al 2019 length sinuosity gradient and mean channel width of white river are 277 km 1 91 2 4 and 75 m respectively fig 2 a river gradient g r follows the trend of altitude demonstrates a rapid decrease from upper stream to middle and lower parts mean channel width w r shows the reverse trend that sharply increases at the last 30 km near the outlet sinuosity s r has an increasing trend downstream suggesting that lower stream tends to have more high sinuosity meander bends if unconfined valley is defined as 10 times wider than bankfull channel width wohl et al 2012b then only the first 20 km of the river is confined fig 1 b the valley widens downstream and anabranching segments begin to appear at the last 20 km near the outlet 2 2 field and laboratory works the main channel of white river was annually sampled in july 2016 may 2018 and may 2019 all fell into the growing seasons table 2 and fig 2 show details of field sampling and measurement in general sampling sites were evenly distributed along the river limited to inconvenient transportation however river segment near the source 40 km long was not sampled avoiding human altered floodplain mainly at hongyuan and tangke town the river goes through fig 1 b was another concern in choosing sampling sites this caused the relative larger interval between no 10 and 11 and between no 23 and 24 in fig 2 a crescent shaped point bars are near the inner banks of meander bends and they are easy to be discerned both in google earth imagery and on the spot according to the color fig 1 c fig 2 b and c because they mainly are bare lands and seldomly have vegetation the process that in the long term accreted point bars attach to the floodplain is associated with the colonization of pioneer plants crosato 2008 parker et al 2011 xu and bai 2013 which thus could be found both within point bars and within general floodplain consequently we identified the boundary between point bars and general floodplain fig 2 c as i a point bar includes deposited sediments and pioneer plants ii ground contains plants other than pioneer plants belongs to general floodplain iii ground contains pioneer plants only belongs to point bar point bar samples were collected using a shovel rather than a soil auger limited to inconvenient transportation and severe alpine climate from the top 10 cm layers after roots manually removed we deem this depth reflects recent deposition according to the hydrologic regime of white river and common deposition thickness of point bars along the river only seven sites were sampled to 40 50 cm depth depending on deposition thickness for two reasons first point bars are formed layer by layer through lateral accretion van de lageweg et al 2014 on point bars of white river however field observation found that boundaries between different deposited layers were not obvious this probably because the size of white river is not large enough since sizes of point bars are proportional to size of the river and larger bars tend to have more distinctive layers leopold and wolman 1960 second inevitable logistical constraints restricted the application of efficient sampling devices eighteen out of the sampled point bars had pioneer plants scattered distributed within them many of these pioneer plants were shrub species making them easy to be distinguished from herbaceous species that dominate general floodplain within point bars where available samples were also collected from the ground pioneer plants grew on general floodplain sampling positions were 20 m in distance from the associated point bars samples were collected using shovel as a mix from the top 30 cm layers but not from different layers two reasons explain this first the focus of this study is poc retention within point bars second though many previous studies have focused on this their intention were mostly to recognize whether oc were autochthonous or allochthonous e g scott and wohl 2018 declining c poc with depth indicates autochthonous litter inputs while vertical heterogeneity indicates allochthonous deposited by overbank flows appling et al 2014 lininger et al 2018 scott and wohl 2018 in our study area however it has been a common knowledge that governed by ecoregion low temperature and frequent saturation inhibit microbial activity to decompose oc that mainly comes from dead biomass resulting relatively high oc concentration of general floodplain e g huo et al 2013 xue et al 2015 yang et al 2017 thus the mixed soils from the top 30 cm layers rather than the top 10 cm layers as on point bars because floodplain had longer deposition time could represent the recent oc storage within general floodplain point bar and general floodplain samples were then dried for analysis of poc content using elemental analyzer vario el chns o particle size distribution of sediments on point bars top 10 cm layer from the middle position and on general floodplain were measured in laboratory using laser granulometer malvern ms 2000 soil temperature conductivity salinity and moisture were measured in situ using moisture meter shunkeda tr 6d 2 3 statistical analysis and source of data in order to identify whether c poc on point bars and general floodplain had increasing decreasing trends downstream or randomly fluctuated we applied a simple linear regression model to describe the downstream trends of c poc as response variable using the distance from the river source d km as predictor variable and then tested the significance of the regression coefficient using t test α 0 05 existence of a significant regression coefficient suggests a significant trend of c poc downstream the downstream trends of i point bars in terms of length m maximum width m area m2 and density per 10 km and ii particle size distribution in sediments were tested using the same method to determine whether significant differences in c poc and particle size distribution existed i between point bars including positions with and without pioneer plants and general floodplain and ii within point bars we used i t test α 0 05 if data obeyed normal distribution otherwise ii wilcoxon rank sum test α 0 05 to recognize whether correlation existed i between c poc and physical chemical factors and ii between channel geometry and point bars in terms of area density and whether had plants we applied i pearson correlation analysis α 0 05 which results shown as r 2 if data obeyed normal distribution otherwise ii spearman rank correlation α 0 05 which results shown as ρ statistical works were done with spss statistics ibm hereafter by significant we mean statistically significant α 0 05 unless otherwise specified point bars and their boundaries including pioneer plants were recognized from field observation combined with google earth imagery since the imagery of our study area is of high resolution 0 5 m 3 results 3 1 point bars distribution a total of 337 bars 1 22 per km were recognized along the meandering river length l b maximum width w b area a b of bars ranged between 7 and 2 351 m 2 432 m and 151 179 109 m2 respectively with mean values 410 m 82 m and 25 862 m2 respectively and median values 349 m 70 m and 14 261 m2 respectively 87 bars 26 did not have pioneer plants grown within them while 250 bars did sinuosity s c and width w c of meander bends these bars belong to ranged between 1 02 and 13 91 m and 2 301 m respectively with mean values 2 14 and 36 m respectively and median values 1 65 and 29 m respectively all these parameters definitions as shown in fig 2 c had significant increasing trends downstream fig 3 the number of point bars n b otherwise demonstrated a different trend fig 4 on the basis of a 10 km interval it sharply increased at the channel segment 40 60 km away from river source and then decreased gradually downstream fig 4 both the two trends were significant the ratio of the number of bars with pioneer plants n b p to n b was stable no significant trends across the river suggesting that n b p followed the downstream trend of n b fig 4 mean area of point bars a mb followed the similar increasing trend downstream of a b fig 4 3 2 physical chemical features of sediments retained within point bars in terms of the proportion in total sediments all the five levels of particle size did not show significant trends downstream suggesting a stable distribution pattern across the river fig 5 a this pattern was characterized by i particle size 2 mm averagely accounted for 67 of point bar sediments whilst ii particle size 1 mm averagely accounted for 29 together making iii the least contribution of particle size 2 1 mm 4 among all the five levels no significant differences in particle size distribution were found between bars with pioneer plants and without pioneer plants temperature moisture conductivity and salinity of point bar sediments did not show significant trends downstream and their mean values were 12 5 5 8 2 3 mg l 1 and 4 6 μs cm 1 respectively fig 5 b moisture conductivity and salinity were significantly positively pairwise correlated but none of them were significantly correlated with temperature 3 3 physical chemical features of general floodplain soil the proportion of sediments with particle size 10 mm significantly decreased downstream whilst particle size 10 mm that divided into four levels fig 6 a were found no significant trends downstream general floodplain was dominated by soils with particle size 0 25 mm which averagely contributed 66 making coarser soils 0 25 mm collectively accounted for about one third temperature moisture conductivity and salinity of general floodplain soil did not have significant trends downstream and their mean values were 11 6 18 0 10 6 mg l 1 and 19 4 μs cm 1 respectively fig 6 b similar to point bars significantly positive pairwise correlations were found between moisture conductivity and salinity temperature was significantly negatively correlated with moisture but not correlated with conductivity and salinity 3 4 poc concentration within point bars vertically no significant trends in c poc were found in all the seven sites fig 7 b except for no 16 in which declining c poc with depth was significant at site no 12 c poc also decreased with depth but with a non significant trend inclining c poc with depth e g no 13 and vertical heterogeneity e g no 14 were found at the other five sites longitudinally poc concentration did not have significant differences between upper middle and lower positions fig 7 a the mean values of c poc at upper middle and lower positions of point bars were 0 95 1 21 and 1 09 respectively the maximum values could exist both at upper e g no 7 middle e g no 5 and lower positions e g no 9 and so did the minimum values suggesting that distribution of c poc did not have longitudinally predictable patterns within individual point bars sediment samples from the ground where pioneer plants grew had significantly higher c poc mean value 2 96 than from the ground without pioneer plants mean value 1 08 demonstrating a notable spatial heterogeneity within individual point bars fig 7 a 3 5 downstream pattern poc concentration of point bar sediments poc concentration of point bar sediments were between 0 70 and 1 44 in 2016 0 17 2 52 in 2018 and 0 29 2 36 in 2019 fig 8 c poc in all the three years did not have significant trends downstream implying that along the river poc concentration of sediments retained within point bars tended to fluctuate in a same range rather than following predictable longitudinal variations this range however is relatively large according to the variances of c poc 0 48 and 0 38 in 2018 and 2019 respectively nearly half their mean values generally along the river poc concentration of point bar sediments was trendless but unstable 3 6 downstream pattern poc concentration of general floodplain soils poc concentration of general floodplain soils ranged between 1 09 and 6 48 in 2016 1 55 9 55 in 2018 and 1 71 11 01 in 2019 fig 9 variances of c poc in 2016 2018 and 2019 were 1 9 3 5 and 6 6 respectively similar to point bars in all the three years c poc of floodplain soils neither shows significant trends downstream suggesting a stable range in which c poc fluctuated rather than increasing or decreasing tendencies 4 discussion our core concept is that within the meandering river corridor hydrogeomorphic processes through building point bars prominently alter poc concentration of floodplain that mainly determined by ecoregion hydrogeomorphic processes in this study refers to that in meander bends of meandering rivers water flow influenced by channel and valley geometry laterally deposits transported sediments and organic matters onto the inner banks and thereby building point bars ecoregion controls the poc concentration of floodplain through climate landscape and soil refer to sections 2 1 and 2 2 4 1 point bars distribution where hydrogeomorphic processes retained poc we characterize the downstream trends of point bars distribution as i increasing length and maximum width and resulting area of individual bars fig 3 ii decreasing number of bars fig 4 did not offset the increasing area of individual bars entailing iii inclined mean area of bars fig 4 and table 3 but still iv much smaller relative to general floodplain fig 1 c therefore at river scale point bars were not evenly distributed along the river h1b but with predictable patterns river engineers fluvial geomorphologists and ecologists have argued that channel and valley geometry regulate the distribution of hydraulic forces that responsible for sediments transport and resulting point bars building leopold et al 1964 montgomery 1999 wohl et al 2012a xu and bai 2013 thus we tested the correlations between point bar geometry and channel valley geometry at site to segment scales table 3 at site scale individual bars were largely shaped by the geometry of their related meander bends size of point bars responded positively to increases in width and sinuosity of meander bends as expected since point bars are a typical geomorphic unit belongs to meandering rivers that portrayed as with high sinuosity usually 1 5 leopold and wolman 1957 and unconfined valleys parsapour moghaddam and rennie 2018 that facilitate channel widening at segment scale the increasing trend of number of point bars in the first 60 km of the river where water flows from confined to unconfined valleys fig 1 b was significantly negatively correlated with river gradient indicating the influence of available space for energy dissipation that controlled by valley geometry on lateral accretion of alluvial sediments sutfin et al 2016 meandering is an energy shedding mechanism constantine et al 2014 nanson and huang 2017 because rivers flow with imposed water and sediments down valley gradients they mainly inherited they self regulate energy expenditure to maintain stable nanson and huang 2017 while downstream unconfined valley offered space for the channel to adjust its bedform and cross section form to develop point bars near the source narrowly confined valley and steep channel concentrated flow and helped prominent increases in hydraulic force thereby limiting the deposition of sediments and om leopold et al 1964 knighton 1998 naiman et al 2005 wohl 2013 at segment scale the decreasing trend of number of point bars in the last 217 km of the river however was not significantly correlated with any of the channel geometry parameters the complex feedback between process and form that rules migration of meandering rivers is still incompletely understood güneralp and rhoads 2008 even so channel depth might play a role the increasing trend downstream of channel sinuosity suggested increases in channel depth because they are positively correlated leliavsk 1955 leopold and wolman 1960 inclined channel depth might reduce the vertical velocity gradient thereby weakening helical circulation causing the thread of high velocity hugged the inner banks and did not cross the channel resulting the absence of the mechanism for building point bars leopold and wolman 1960 nanson 1980 in summary channel and valley geometry governed the strength of hydrogeomorphic processes that responsible for the development and the features of point bars by controlling the space available for the river to conduct self regulation as the river flowed from confined valley to unconfined valley and widened and meandered greater influence of hydrogeomorphic processes became more intense caused the increasing area of point bars implying the amplified retention of poc downstream 4 2 poc within point bars retention capacity of hydrogeomorphic processes we hypothesized that within point bars c poc was not homogeneously distributed h1a it was partly refused by the results fig 7 vertically both inclining declining tendencies and vertical heterogeneity of c poc were found fig 7 b suggesting that poc concentration did not follow obvious vertical trends we believe this was associated with the correlation between c poc and sediment particle sizes on point bars c poc was significantly positively correlated with the proportion of the finest sediments 0 25 mm but not significantly correlated with coarser sediments fig 10 b this was in accordance with previous studies pinay et al 1992 jobbagy and jackson 2000 hoffmann et al 2009 and has been thoroughly explained sorption of oc is governed by particle size and resulting available surface area as well as the availability of calcium iron and aluminum such that finer textured soils typically contain more oc than coarser soils kaiser and guggenberger 2000 rasmussen et al 2018 consequently the changes in the proportion of fine sediments could to some extent represent the changes in poc concentration on the average fine sediments can be carried higher up the bar than coarse ones thus point bars roughly show a gradation of particle size from coarse near the base to fine near the flood plain level leopold and wolman 1960 sometimes however this fining upward tendency is not obvious or even could be replaced by upward coarsening sequences słowik 2016 therefore in this case lacking vertical trends of poc concentration might because the proportion of fine sediments changed unpredictably with depth longitudinally we found c poc was evenly distributed along the long axes of point bars rather than had predictable patterns fig 7 a suggesting that at site scale hydrogeomorphic processes uniformly deposited sediments and om to build point bars this was not beyond our expectation because i point bars are fluvial deposits that characterized by a hierarchy of lateral accretion surfaces and within the same surfaces point bars are built of a uniform material well sorted van de lageweg et al 2014 słowik 2016 durkin et al 2018 and ii at site scale mean bar length 410 m it was not likely to have factors destructive enough to cause poorly sorted particle size distribution poc concentration at positions with pioneer plants was about three times higher than at positions without pioneer plants fig 7 a this spatial heterogeneity demonstrated the role of vegetation plays in om distribution that has been widely recognized in riparian ecosystems fierke and kauffman 2005 sutfin et al 2016 scott and wohl 2018 vegetation contributes to poc concentration through the input of i recently fallen branches twigs and leaves that compose surface organic layers ii decomposed organic matters and litter that compose humus layers naiman et al 2005 lutes et al 2006 and iii recently highlighted by sokol et al 2019 the contribution from living root i e rhizodeposits hence the presence of vegetation governed whether poc could be inputted through biological paths thus determined the marked differences in poc concentration between positions with and without pioneer plants combining sections 4 1 and 4 2 we summarize the influence of hydrogeomorphic processes on poc retention as i at site scale the processes longitudinally and vertically evenly distributed poc whilst spatial heterogeneity occurred due to the interference of pioneer plants ii at river scale the processes became more intense downstream and caused amplified retention of poc 4 3 differences in poc concentration between point bars and general floodplain hydrogeomorphic processes locally disturbed ecoregion in this section poc concentration of point bars refers to the positions without vegetation which occupied most of the area fig 2 c the positions in which pioneer plants grew will be discussed in section 4 4 c poc of point bars did not have significant trends downstream fig 8 thus verified our hypothesis that poc concentration distributed homogeneously among point bars across the river h1c c poc of general floodplain neither had significant trends downstream fig 9 therefore we found that in all the three sampled years throughout the river poc concentration of point bars was significantly lower than of general floodplain h2 about three to five times fig 10 d immediate causes we believe the differed particle size distribution and resulting physical chemical features were directly responsible for the distinctive differences in poc concentration between point bars and general floodplain the reasons are as follows i particle size itself affects the capacity of sediments to adsorb organic carbon as mentioned in section 4 2 and this influence has been verified in the study area according to the observation that the increased proportion of fine sediments led to the increased poc concentration of point bars fig 10 b ii particle size differences result in varying soil moisture because fine size fraction is of greater capacity than coarse size fraction to promote lower evaporation rate and thus to keep higher moisture content dingman 2008 and moisture is closely related to conductivity that partly determines salinity rhoades et al 1989 iii these factors affect oc through mechanisms such as saturation hinders decomposition and increases potential for long term storage of oc jobbagy and jackson 2000 falloon et al 2011 and iv some of the mechanisms have been verified in the study area e g co2 and ch4 emissions that regulate the storage of oc reservoirs were strongly affected by soil moisture gao et al 2011 yang et al 2014 yang et al 2017 therefore the finer soils fig 10 a and c and resulting environmental features fig 10 e might together contribute to the higher poc concentration of general floodplain relative to point bars one may argue that c poc of general floodplain was not significantly correlated with i any levels of particle size fig 10 b and ii temperature fig 10 e our explanations are i the coefficients suggested the positive correlation between c poc and finer soils and the negative correlation between c poc and coarser soils though not significant fig 10 b and ii temperature apparently influences moisture and has been proved of great importance in regulating soil oc storage in the study area yang et al 2017 root causes the differed particle size distribution reflected the varying sources of point bar sediments and general floodplain soils that governed by hydrogeomorphic processes and ecoregion respectively which we believe were root causes that ultimately determined the differences in poc concentration between point bars and general floodplain ecoregion might influence particle size distribution in floodplain soils and resulting poc concentration through two mechanisms i litter decomposition degree of decomposition regulates soil particle size distribution because the more undecomposed fibrous the material the coarser the particle size levesque and dinel 1977 within white river corridor animal activities such as earthworm invasion wu et al 2017 and plateau zokors burrow zhang et al 2003 and microbial metabolism that resulted from the trade off between cold and wet alpine climate and lowered water table gao et al 2014 combined increased temperature xue et al 2015 together enabled the decomposition of litter that sourced vertically from the relatively large aboveground and belowground biomass ma et al 2017 ii plant root system controlling soil erosion root architecture and density contribute to slope steadiness and soil erosion control reubens et al 2007 ola et al 2015 thus help the stability of fine soils basic et al 2004 wang et al 2019 the mean root shoot ratio for the study area according to ma et al 2017 was 10 and the top 30 cm soils contributed 80 of the root biomass suggesting the capacity for the root system to retain soils with finer particle sizes and accompanied higher poc concentration the relatively coarse sediments of point bars and resulting lower c poc might result from two mechanisms that associated with hydrogeomorphic processes i limited to the lower water temperature deficiency of nutrients and high discharge the river lacked microbes and invertebrates to physically and biologically break down coarse sediments before their accretion onto point bars wipfli et al 2007 zhao et al 2016 ii except for sediments deposition high discharge also enables water flowing over point bars and as a result triggering the erosion process even with relatively low kinetic energy of flow nicoll and hickin 2010 because coarse sediments are more capable to resist physical disturbances the erosion might further decrease the proportion of fine sediments therefore at site scale hydrogeomorphic processes regulated poc distribution and caused poc concentration hollows relative to general floodplain through the development of point bars this difference was consistent across the river suggesting that the influence of hydrogeomorphic processes were stable at river scale this was in accordance with previous studies that argued that at landscape scale 102 106 km2 ecoregions characterize biogeographic regions through climate soil type and biotic communities whilst at local scale of individual channel segments 10 103 m in length valley channel geometry and biotic factors determine oc distribution through the influence on the decomposition transport and accumulation of om schumm 1977 tabacchi et al 1998 benda et al 2005 camporeale et al 2013 dodds et al 2015 sutfin et al 2016 moreover it has been argued that ecoregions are characterized by distinct vegetation types at region scale but they cannot differentiate vegetation in river corridor ecosystems from adjacent uplands sutfin et al 2016 in our case however point bars that barely had plants indicated that hydrogeomorphic processes at site scale were able to distinguish vegetation near the inner banks from both riparian zones and adjacent uplands in this view although hydrogeomorphic processes were not comparable in functional scope to ecoregion they might bear greater strength to locally regulate the distribution and types of vegetation and thus biological poc inputs 4 4 pioneer plants invading point bars ecoregion struggled against hydrogeomorphic processes vegetation at site scale reflects geomorphology with floodplain primary succession occurring from bare alluvial surfaces e g point bars created through river lateral migration and vegetation reflecting processes of sedimentation flooding and fluvial disturbance viereck et al 1993 whited et al 2007 lateral connectivity of floodplain river system to some extent mirrors channel geometry and influences germination establishment and survival of riparian species cooper et al 1999 camporeale et al 2013 during baseflows and falling stages the highest velocity thread gradually shifts towards outer banks exposing the higher positions of point bars thereby providing space and time for pioneer plant species to colonize if the durations of low flow stages are long enough the presence of roots and plants together with sediment consolidation and compaction can provide extra soil resistance to the newly formed terraces thus contribute to point bar stabilization to resist the erosion during stormflows this resistance creates a positive feedback flow velocity decreases along banks and facilitates sediment deposition by which creating new germination sites for pioneer plants in turn contribute to bar stability and continued aggradation tabacchi et al 1998 naiman et al 2005 camporeale et al 2013 in the long term accreted point bars attach to the floodplain and new formed point bars restart the same bank advance process crosato 2008 güneralp and rhoads 2008 parker et al 2011 xu and bai 2013 parsapour moghaddam and rennie 2018 4 4 1 struggled at river scale the mechanism of pioneer plants invasion suggests the interaction between hydroclimatic regime and fluvial geomorphology and reflects the struggle of ecoregion against hydrogeomorphic processes therefore within the river corridor we attempt to find out i whether the progress of plants invasion was associated with valley geometry fig 11 and ii whether differences in point bar geometry existed between bars invaded and not invaded table 4 the proportion of point bars with pioneer plants was significantly negatively correlated with river gradient and significantly positively correlated with mean channel length but not significantly correlated with sinuosity fig 11 this probably because decreased gradient and widened channel together reduced flow velocity thus weakened the erosion processes occurred on point bars point bars colonized by pioneer plants were significantly larger in size than bars have not been colonized table 4 this further supported the correlations between the frequency of pioneer plants invasion and valley geometry because of the negative correlation between bar size and gradient and the positive correlation between bar size and channel width table 3 both fig 11 and table 4 point to the conclusion that pioneer plants invaded point bars more frequently downstream because of the decreasing trend of gradient and the increasing trend of channel width downstream fig 2 a this suggested that ecoregion gradually prevailed hydrogeomorphic processes and gained mastery downstream the question is how because i at river scale climatic factors that characterize ecoregion vary slightly and ii the correlations between hydrologic and geomorphic factors that control hydrogeomorphic processes and the frequency of pioneer plants invasion fig 11 we argue that it was the gradually undermined hydrogeomorphic processes that enabled the prevalence of ecoregion rather than the intensification of the ecoregion itself 4 4 2 struggled at site scale at site scale we are interested in whether differences in poc concentration existed between general floodplain and the positions of point bars pioneer plants grew as we already know they both had higher c poc than the positions of bars without pioneer plants results show that except for site no 12 and 16 c poc was significantly higher on general floodplain than on the positions of point bars with pioneer plants fig 7 a and 9 hence the order for poc concentration was positions of bars without plants mean value 1 08 positions of bars with plants mean value 2 96 general floodplain mean value 5 65 we infer this sequence was associated with the successional stage of vegetation which as we observed refer to section 2 1 and fig 2 c was positions of bars without plants bare land positions of bars with plants pioneer plants that mainly were shrub species general floodplain both shrub and herbaceous species existed because i vegetation contributes to soil oc through the input of litter and humus layers which is the function of time benfield 1997 and according to previous studies ii channel lateral migration can reset floodplain vegetation primary succession viereck et al 1993 and globally the wide ranging values for riparian biomass oc directly reflect vegetation successional stage sutfin et al 2016 at site scale the gradually advanced ecoregion might neither because of its self intensification but also resulted from that the weakened hydrogeomorphic processes gave an opportunity that could be exploited to ecoregion s advantage because i the farther away from river channel the weaker the influence of hydrogeomorphic processes ii the continuous deposition of point bars drives early formed point bars away from the channel and thus gradually isolates them from hydrogeomorphic influences and iii at site scale climatic factors e g sunlight and precipitation that control ecoregion neither change much 4 5 spatial consequences of the struggle hotspots depending upon scale biogeochemical hotspots are defined as the areas in which individual reactants for specific biogeochemical reactions coincide and result in disproportionately high reaction rates relative to the surrounding area mcclain et al 2003 researchers have found that i hotspots are often enhanced at terrestrial aquatic interfaces mcclain et al 2003 ii any physical feature that facilitates flow separation lower velocity and at least temporary storage of poc can promote the formation of hotspots beckman and wohl 2014 iii physical channel complexity helps creating hotspots by providing opportunities for microorganisms to metabolize carbon and other nutrients for energy and growth battin et al 2009 and iv continued source of reactants often supplied by hydrologic flow paths is necessary to maintain high processing rates mcclain et al 2003 in meandering river corridors iii sinuous channel induces ii flow separation vermeulen et al 2015 and iv through sediments deposition build point bars that i connect floodplain and stream it seems like point bars met all conditions to qualify as hotspots in this case the lower poc concentration relative to adjacent general floodplain however explicitly suggested that point bars actually were not hotspots so why we seek for reasons by browsing through river to site scales table 5 from river to segment scales because climatic controls on landscape were not likely to vary much general floodplain inherited the landscape of unconfined valley thus shared the similar mechanism of biological om accumulation and decomposition and as a result oc content therefore at segment scale the fact that general floodplain was more likely a hotspot relative to point bars was not because disturbances happened within the unconfined valley and caused localized dramatic increases in oc concentration but resulted from the relatively lower oc concentration of point bars at site scale point bars colonized by pioneer plants represented the struggle of ecoregion against hydrogeomorphic processes and caused higher oc concentration relative to surroundings thereby making positions with pioneer plants hotspots therefore though point bars bore many characters of hotspots they were anything but hotspots instead they were a disturbance to hotspots at segment scale that resulted from hydrogeomorphic processes ecoregion resisted this interference by invading point bars with pioneer plants further creating hotspots within bars through locally increased oc content consequently what hydrogeomorphic processes actually created is spatial heterogeneity that represented as point bars biogeochemical hotspots are a specific form of spatial heterogeneity mcclain et al 2003 represented in this case by the higher poc concentration relative to surroundings however spatial heterogeneity not only refers to hotspots but also refers to coldspots that in this case can be explained as point bars that had lower poc concentration relative to surroundings 5 conclusion in meandering channels of white river in zoige basin that developed as the result of the complex interaction between hydrodynamics sediments transport and morphology hydrogeomorphic processes laterally deposit sediments and organic matters onto the inner banks of active channel thereby building point bars and retaining organic carbon under the influence of valley and channel geometry this retention amplified downstream as reflected by the increased area of point bars but within individual point bars particulate organic carbon was homogeneously distributed unless interfered by pioneer plants point bars had much lower particulate organic carbon concentration than the general areas of floodplain in which organic carbon storage mainly controlled by ecoregion demonstrating the crucial role of hydrogeomorphic processes played at local scale in modifying the effect of ecoregion on organic carbon concentration within the meandering river corridor however ecoregion resisted this disturbance both within individual point bars and across the river pioneer plants were dispatched to point bars in order to first locally increase organic carbon concentration and finally completely merge point bars and the frequency of pioneer plants invasion increased downstream by advantage of the changed channel geometry the interaction between ecoregion and hydrogeomorphic processes caused varying biogeochemical hotspots that depending upon spatial scales credit authorship contribution
