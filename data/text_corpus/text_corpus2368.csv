11840,a new second order stabilised numerical method for the richards equation with source term is proposed to solve the water infiltration in porous soil this new method to solve richard s equation is based on a modification of the head pressure representation with respect to the water content together with the hydraulic conductivity we show that the modified relations provide stability while preserving the order and accuracy of the numerical solution furthermore a new second order positivity preserving scheme in time is implemented in substitution of the popular crank nicolson technique applications to root suction in critical situations such as water saturation or rarefaction are carried out to highlight the benefits of the method we also present a strategy to deal with multi layers problem by introducing a fixed point strategy to determine the complete solution on the whole domain graphical abstract image 1 keywords numerical scheme stability richards equation evapotranspiration

conditions requires forecasts for the management of irrigation and underground hydrodynamics knowledge of water and solute transport in soils is a trade off between rain runoff irrigation and evapotranspiration water uptake groundwater the roots capacity to absorb water and nutrients is strongly dependent on the local pressure head hence the volumetric water content since 1950s de vries 1958 simulation of saturated and unsaturated zones is fundamental for management and forecast of plant growth to provide a rational and optimal use of irrigation and groundwater resources different numerical technologies have been developed to simulate the interactions between soil plant and water traditional models are based on partial differential equations to describe the flow evolution in the soil ahmadi 2021 assouline 2013 but recently innovate methods such as machine learning are applied to the groundwater problem malekzadeh et al 2019 richards equation is the most popular approach for describing flow in rigid porous media the highly nonlinear terms together with the degeneracy that arises for dry and saturated situations makes richards equation quite difficult to solve using straightforwards numerical techniques farthing and ogden 2017 cavalcante and zornberg 2017 zha et al 2019 for example mass balance is guaranteed by using finite volume methods for the moisture content but this approach may encounter difficulties in stability and convergence for a sharp dry wetting front or for critical configurations such as dry soil or water saturation more sophisticated numerical techniques are then required to overcome convergence difficulties and poor computational efficiency linearization schemes based on the picard and newton iterative methods paniconi and putti 1994 islam and hasan 2014 list and radu 2016 represent the most common approaches to solve numerically the nonlinear richards equation the picard fixed point scheme usually converges well except for strongly nonlinear situations as saturated unsaturated interfaces where it may converge very slowly or even fail there exists a vast literature about the numerical scheme dedicated to the richards equation with particular focus on the resolution with coefficients degeneracy fassino and manzini 1998 manzini and ferraris 2004 another issue concerns the source term approximation for the water uptake feddes et al 1978 2001 2004 kumar et al 2015 broadbridge et al 2017 most of the techniques indicated in the literature are based on the strang splitting and use the crank nicolson or the second order backward differentiation formula bdf2 jacques et al 2006 the first one is unconditionally stable but does not preserve the positivity while the second one is stable and positivity preserving but requires to store two former stages since the source term is stiff both properties are desirable for the sake of physical admissibility only with a one stage scheme a formulation with a new variable η 0 1 representing the rate of saturation is proposed together with modified relations to evaluate the pressure head and the hydraulic conductivity that avoids numerical oscillations still preserving the accuracy we propose a new unconditionally positivity preserving scheme for the source term that guarantees the physical admissibility of the solution i e η remains in the admissible interval 0 1 2 modelling 2 1 the richards equation infiltration is characterized by flow through variably saturated porous media modelled with the classical richards equation we assume that the porous media is rigid the fluid is incompressible and isothermal the fluid density is unaffected by solute concentrations and the air phase does not affect water flow two main functions determine the state of the soil the volumetric water content θ and the pressure head φ p ρ wat g where p is the pressure ρ wat is the water density and g is the gravity we consider the one dimensional richards equation problem where z represents the vertical direction the domain is the open interval ω l 0 with l 0 cf fig 1 on the one hand mass conservation reads 1 θ t u z f z t s z t φ where u is the water velocity f is a given source term independent of the plants activity irrigation river etc and s is the plant suction sink term on the other hand the darcy s law yields 2 u k z φ z k φ z 1 where k k φ is called the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity coefficient and φ z represents the fluid pressure together with the gravitational head we get a θ φ system that requires an additional relation to be solved moreover a description of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity coefficient k k φ with respect to the pressure head is needed we adopt the semi empirical constitutive relationships of haverkamp et al 1977 given by manzini and ferraris 2004 pour et al 2011 3 θ φ θ rar θ sat θ rar 1 a φ α k φ k sat 1 1 b φ β where θ sat and θ rar θ sat represent the saturation and rarefaction volumetric water contents respectively k sat characterizes the saturated hydraulic conductivity coefficient of the soil and a α b β are free parameters depending on the type of soil of the problem we stress that function φ θ presents an asymptotic behaviour when we reach rarefaction i e θ θ rar in this work the numerical tests will assume that the soil roughly corresponds to a clay loam soil cf 2012 and engineering 2012 with a 2 707 m 1 α 3 96 b 5 240 8 m 1 β 4 74 and k sat 9 55e 5 m1 s 1 and we plot in fig 2 the constitutive laws with θ rar 0 2 and θ sat 0 4 notice that the previous relations are slightly different from the original van genuchten and mualem relations van genuchten 1980 given with respect to the rate of saturation 4 η θ θ rar θ sat θ rar and written as η φ 1 1 a φ n m k η k sat η 1 2 1 1 η 1 m m 2 where the authors consider the particular case n 1 1 m to draw the second equation where m is a positive parameter which characterizes the soil 2 2 source term the root water uptake is modelled considering three main ingredients dos santos et al 2017 the evapotranspiration the mass root density and the pressure head the sink term reads s z t φ e t t r z w φ where e t t is the optimal evapotranspiration depending on the weather and atmospheric conditions and is given as a function of time t r z 0 is the root density that satisfies the normalization condition 0 r z d z 1 and w φ is a stress reduction factor induced by water shortage we have 1 optimal evapotranspiration is the flow of water that the plant should release in the atmosphere under optimal condition for the roots namely enough water in the soil to ensure a perfect working of the plant such function depends among other parameters on the temperature sun radiation and air humidity for the optimal situation w φ 1 all along the vertical axis and we recover the mass conservation 0 s z t φ d z 0 e t t r z d z e t t 2 the root density describes the distribution of the root in function of the depth in this work we will consider a constant distribution given by r z 1 r 0 if z r 0 0 0 if z r 0 where r 0 0 approximates the length of the roots cf fig 1 3 the plant suction rate indicates the roots capacity to drag water with respect to the pressure head the classical model was proposed by feddes feddes et al 2001 this is represented in fig 3 where parameters φ 1 φ 2 φ 3 and φ 4 0 φ 1 φ 2 φ 3 φ 4 depend on the plant and the soil 2 3 the η reformulation from relations 3 and 4 we deduce that 5 η φ θ rar θ sat θ rar 1 a φ α θ rar θ sat θ rar 1 1 a φ α function η is then an explicit function with respect to φ and reciprocally we have 6 φ η 1 a 1 η η 1 α notice that lim η 0 φ η and lim η 1 φ η 0 and 7 φ z 1 a 1 α 1 η η 1 α 1 z 1 η η 1 a α η 2 1 η η 1 α 1 η z on the other hand substituting 6 in relation 3 we obtain an explicit expression of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity coefficient with respect to η given by 8 k η k sat η β α η β α b a β 1 η β α k sat η β α a β a β η β α b β 1 η β α then considering 7 and 8 darcy s law 2 reads u η k sat η β α a β a β η β α b β 1 η β α 1 a α η 2 1 η η 1 α 1 η z 1 k η η z v η η with k η k sat a β 1 α 1 η 1 α α η β α 1 α a β η β α b β 1 η β α v η k sat a β η β α 1 a β η β α b β 1 η β α going back to richards equation 1 we obtain a scalar nonlinear convection diffusion equation 9 θ sat θ rar η t z v η η z k η η z f s boundary conditions are prescribed to take into account the external factors air moisture rain dry weather in this work and written in terms of η we will consider the following ones dirichlet condition by setting η 0 t η top t for example rainy weather yields η 0 t 1 while dry condition gives η 0 t 0 the dirichlet condition can be substituted with the wall condition at the top of domain z η 0 t 0 to prescribe an impervious soil dirichlet condition by setting η l t η bot t neumann s condition on the bottom gives z η l t q t 2 4 the degenerated problem when η is close to the extreme values 0 and 1 equation 9 presents strong singularities leading to important numerical difficulties since k η diverges since β α 1 moreover one has to fulfill t η 0 and z η 0 on the subdomains charaterized by η 0 or η 1 hence the time component degenerates leading to a time parametrized problem over the two subdomains to deal with the singularities we change the variable in order to eliminate the singularity contained in the diffusive part to this end we isolate the local singularity at η 1 by introducing k η k η 1 α 1 η 1 α α k η k sat a β 1 η β α 1 α a β η β α b β 1 η β α notice that k η now does not degenerate when η 1 noting that 1 α 1 η 1 α α η z z 1 η 1 α we suggest the new variable η 1 ζ α and we get k η η z k η ζ z we then get the formulation 10 θ sat θ rar t ζ α z v η 1 ζ α z k η ζ z f note that we maintain the variable η for coefficients v η and k η since we shall employ a semi implicit formulation using the value of η at the previous time while we perform a modified fixed point algorithm for the non linearity we highlight the very recent document bassetto et al 2021 where a more general but complex non linear transformation similar to the one we have proposed has been recently published for the case where η is close to 0 a similar procedure can be followed 3 finite volume scheme a second order finite volume method is presented to provide a numerical approximation of the richards equation the built in conservation property of the method is the main motivation to design a scheme that preserves the mass of the water 3 1 method of lines we first deal with the non degenerated situation the nonlinear convection diffusion equation without the plant suction sink term under its conservative form reads 11 θ sat θ rar η t z v η η z k η η z f in l 0 0 t fin with η z 0 η 0 z at the initial time boundary conditions are also prescribed as indicated in the previous section we denote by δz l i the size of the mesh cells which are given by c i z i 1 2 z i 1 2 i 1 i with z i 1 2 iδz l i 0 i and z i the midpoint of c i note that z 1 2 l while z i 1 2 0 cf fig 4 to produce a finite volume scheme we apply the method of lines patankar 1980 starting by integrating equation 11 over cell c i

of degree 2 centred at point z 1 2 namely π bot z a 0 a 1 z z 1 2 a 2 2 z z 1 2 2 then we prescribe the conditions π bot z 1 2 δ z 2 η 1 π bot z 1 2 3 δ z 2 η 2 π bot z 1 2 5 δ z 2 η 3 where η i η i t

additional relation by imposing the dirichlet condition at π top 0 η top t obtaining 3 η i 2 10 η i 1 15 η i 8 η top t for a neumann condition at z 1 2 l or at z i 1 2 0 we inject directly in the numerical equation the physical flux 3 3 time schemes we consider a grid of n points on the time line and set t n nδt with δt t fin n we denote by η i n an approximation of the mean value of function η in cell c i at time t n that is η i n η i t n we substitute the conservation relation with the time implicit scheme θ sat θ rar η i n 1 η i n δ t 1 δ z f i 1 2 f i 1 2 f i n 1 2 0 where f i 1 2 are the numerical fluxes across the interfaces z i 1 2 and f i n 1 2 f z i t n δ t 2 3 3 1 the semi implicit second order scheme in space and first order in time euler implicit considering the numerical flux 12 f i 1 2 f i 1 2 n 1 v η i 1 2 n η i n 1 η i 1 n 1 2 k η i 1 2 n η i 1 n 1 η i n 1 δ z where η i 1 2 n 1 2 η i n η i 1 n the first order euler implicit scheme reads v η i 1 2 n 2 δ z k η i 1 2

the linear system is closed with the two equations coming from the boundary conditions 3 3 2 the semi implicit second order scheme in time and space the crank nicolson scheme we now consider the numerical flux f i 1 2 1 2 f i 1 2 n 1 f i 1 2 n where f i 1 2 n 1 is the numerical flux given in relation 12 and f i 1 2 n v η i 1 2 n η i n η i 1 n 2 k η i 1 2 n η i 1 n η i n δ z the second order unconditionally stable crank nicolson scheme reads v η i 1 2 n 4 δ z k η i 1 2 n 2 δ z 2 η i 1 n 1 θ sat θ rar δ t v η i 1 2 n v η i 1 2 n 4 δ z k η i 1 2 n k η i 1 2 n 2 δ z 2 η i n 1 v η i 1 2 n 4 δ

2 δ z 2 η i 1 n f i n 1 2 for i 2 i 1 the linear system is again closed with the two equations coming from the boundary conditions 3 4 the degenerated case we now turn to the degenerated case where η is very close to 1 starting from the conservative equation 10 the discrete semi implicit euler scheme in time reads θ sat θ rar ζ i n 1 α ζ i n α δ t v η i 1 2 n 2 ζ i n 1 α ζ i 1 n 1 α 2 k η i 1 2 n ζ i 1 n 1 ζ i n 1 δ z v η i 1 2 n 2 ζ i n 1 α ζ i 1 n 1 α 2 k η i 1 2 n ζ i n 1 ζ i 1 n 1 δ z f i n 1 adopting the notation ζ n α ζ 1 n α ζ i n α t the system has the non linear matrix form m η n ζ n 1 α k η n ζ n 1 f η n ζ n t n 1 a first attempt consists in solving the non linear problem with a fixed point method by elaborating a sequence ζ n m m 0 solution of the linearized problem m η n ζ n m α 1 ζ n m 1 k η n ζ n m 1 f η n ζ n t n 1 where is the vector hadamard product component piecewise product notice that α 1 0 hence the term ζ n m α 1 remains bounded even if some components are zeroed unfortunately there are no guarantees that the sequence converges even with an initial guess close to the solution because the operator is not a contraction indeed we have experienced divergent approximations even for n 1 to overcome the problem let us consider a simplified version by assuming that ζ is scalar and skip index n for the sake of clarity we confront the fixed point left equation with the newton raphson method right equation ζ m 1 f m ζ m α 1 k ζ m 1 ζ m m ζ m α k ζ m f α m ζ m α 1 k α 1 m ζ m α f α m ζ m α 1 k if for one instant we neglect the linear and non problematic part by setting k 0 we observe that the newton raphson corresponds to a convex combination between the fixed point method and the former solution with respective coefficients α 1 α 1 α hence inspired from this remark we propose the two stage algorithm 13 m η n ζ n m α 1 ζ n m 1 2 k η n ζ n m 1 2 f η n ζ n t n 1 ζ n m 1 α 1 α ζ n m 1 α ζ n m 1 2 the scheme 13 then provides a sequence that converges to the non linear solution remark that the non linear issue has been addressed in different context such as discontinuous galerkin by ersoy et al 2021 and clément et al 2021 3 5 benchmarking table 1 presents the data used for benchmark 1 following manzini and ferraris 2004 and we display in fig 5 the variables η φ and θ for different times in function of the z variable using the euler implicit and the crank nicolson methods we observe that the first order method is less accurate than the second order one and no oscillations are reported since the values range in the interval 0 117 3 0 908 3 far from the critical situations as a variation of benchmark 1 benchmark 2 aims to assess the stabilisation of the scheme using the ζ formulation 13 we now consider a dirichlet condition η 0 t 1 which leads to the saturated water situation and n 480 fig 6 displays the solution for several times using again the euler implicit and the crank nicolson methods where we observe that the new formulation avoids spurious oscillations while function η is very close to the saturated situation benchmark 3 is a new variation of benchmark 1 where we provide a neumann boundary condition at the top of the domain where we impose the flux f i 1 2 t 0 2 k sat fig 7 displays the solution for several times using the euler implicit and the crank nicolson methods where we again observe that the new formulation avoids spurious oscillations as a final consideration we assess the regime of the flow by computing the cell péclet number given by p e δ z v k α a l η 1 α 1 η α 1 α notice that we have pe η 0 for η 0 and η 1 and we reach the maximum with η 1 α i e p e 1 α a δ z α 1 α 1 α numerical simulations provide the estimate p e o 1 0 1 that proves the flow is mainly driven by the diffusive contribution consequently the centred scheme suits very well and no upwind trick is necessary to stabilize the method 4 source term the nonlinear source term contribution s z t φ is treated apart with a numerical method for the ordinary differential equation for s since we will consider the strang splitting method that decouples the convection diffusion contribution and the source term indeed we first solve problem 11 without the nonlinear source term on interval t n t n 1 that provides a guess solution η n then we solve the ordinary differential equation in interval t n t n 1 d η i d t t s z i t η i t with η i t n η i n and set η i n 1 η i t n 1 4 1 crank nicolson scheme a popular scheme to solve the ordinary differential equation is the crank nicolson cn scheme given by η i n 1 η i n δ t 1 2 s z i t n 1 η i n 1 s z i t n η i n solving the nonlinear problem in η i n 1 produces the solution although the scheme is unconditional stable for a large time step δt the solution sign may change indeed setting s η λη λ 0 we have η i n 1 2 λ δ t 2 λ δ t η i n and for λδt 2 the sign changes leading to a non admissible solution 4 2 new scheme since the model requires a sign invariant algorithm to guarantee the physical admissibility of the solution we propose a new technique combining a backward differentiation formula bdf method with the centred scheme for instance the bdf2 scheme is a robust and stable technique but requires the two previous stages to overcome that point we mimic the bdf2 scheme using an intermediate point between t n and t n 1 that reads 3 η i n 1 4 η i n 1 2 η n δ t s z i t n 1 η i n 1 where η i n 1 2 is a second order approximation of η i t n δ t 2 on the other hand we use the second order approximation centred on time t n 1 2 η n 1 η n δ t s z i t n 1 2 η n 1 2 to check the sign and stability issues we consider s η λη λ 0 obtaining 3 η i n 1 4 η i n 1 2 η n λ δ t η i n 1 η n 1 η λ δ t η n 1 2 whose solution is η i n 1 4 λ δ t 4 3 λ δ t λ δ t 2 η i n note that for η i n 0 1 we have η i n 1 0 1 we seek the solution by solving the fixed point problem g η n 1 2 η n 1 z i t n 1 2 t n 1 η i n η n 1 2 η n 1 t where the vector valued function g is given by g η n 1 2 η n 1 z τ t η η n 1 η η n 1 2 δ t s z t η n 1 3 η δ t s z τ η n 1 2 4 3 benchmarking for benchmark 4 we consider the ordinary differential equation y t y t in t 0 0 5 with y 0 1 whose exact solution is y t exp t we consider a grid of n points on the time domain and set t n nδt with δt 0 5 n to assess the error and convergence rate we compute e e n y n y 0 5 where y n is the numerical approximation at time t n n 1 n we further define the rate of convergence between two numerical solutions characterized by n 1 and n 2 with n 1 n 2 as o o n 1 n 2 log e n 1 e n 2 log n 1 n 2 table 2 confirms that both schemes are second order with respect to δt to check the positivity preserving property benchmark 5 is dedicated to the ordinary differential equation y t 50y t in t 0 0 5 with y 0 1 fig 8 displays the numerical solution for n 10 we observe that the crank nicolson scheme presents the characteristic of a method that does not preserve the positivity with a red point below the horizontal axis on the contrary the new scheme is more stable since no sign inversion is reported and the solution is always physically admissible 5 the strang splitting the strang splitting technique strang 1968 has been extensively used to decouple the main equation from the source term in particular for stiffness contributions following tang et al 2015 we detail hereafter the method adding our new contribution by introducing the positivity preserving scheme in time we have presented in the previous section 5 1 formulation richards equation can be decomposed into two operators d η d t a η b η 0 where a represents the convection diffusion contribution including source f independent of η given in section 3 and b concerns the nonlinear source term solved in section 4 since we are dealing with a second order scheme in time we apply the strang splitting namely given η n the solution at time t n 1 compute η n 1 3 with d η d t b η 0 in interval t n t n δt 2 2 compute η n 2 3 with d η d t a η 0 in interval t n t n δt 3 compute η n 1 with d η d t b η 0 in interval t n δt 2 t n δt we identify this sequence of steps as the bab splitting scheme and by aba the other alternative order notice that the boundary conditions for a operator have to be evaluated at time t n δt 2 to preserve the second order in time 5 2 benchmarking benchmark 5 which aims to check the strang splitting considers the partial differential equation ζ t ζ z 2 ζ z 2 f ζ in 1 0 0 1 with dirichlet boundary conditions following the method of manufactured solutions the source term f is determined to satisfy the differential equation in this benchmark we consider ζ z t z 1 2 exp t which implies that f z t 2z 4 exp t to assess the error and convergence rate we use the l 1 and l errors computed by e 1 e 1 i n i 2 i 1 ζ i n ζ z i t n δ z e e i n max i 2 i 1 ζ i n ζ z i t n we further define the rate of convergence between two numerical solutions characterized by i n 1 and i n 2 with n 1 n 2 as o α o α i n 1 i n 2 log e α i n 1 e α i n 2 log n 1 n 2 α 1 table 3 checks that the splitting technique provides a second order method in time where the numerical simulations have been carried out with i 40 although we get a second order for both methods the accuracy for the bab version is improved by three magnitudes when compared with the aba version in conclusion we will use the first formula for the applications 6 applications water infiltration and water uptake are the two fundamental issues of the model in subsections 6 1 and 6 2 we tackle the water infiltration while subsections 6 3 and 6 4 are dedicated to the full problem with the combination of water infiltration and water uptake we report in table 4 the common data we use all along the applications of this section 6 1 infiltration rate saturation case we first consider the situation where we assume that the surface is saturated of water runoff by prescribing the dirichlet condition η 0 1 the specific data of application 1 is given in table 5 we present in fig 9 the numerical approximations for different times we report that no oscillations are present in the curves 6 2 infiltration rate drought case we now turn to the simulation of an extreme drought scenario application 2 we prescribe an initial condition η 0 z 0 all over the domain and wall condition at the top of the domain no water inflow or outflow on the other hand we assume that the groundwater is saturated at the bottom by setting the dirichlet boundary condition η l t 1 data are summed up in table 6 and the numerical results are presented in fig 10 again we do not observe oscillations 6 3 water uptake rate square uptake rate function the complete model includes the source term of the evapotranspiration as presented in section 2 2 for the sake of simplicity the optimal evapotranspiration et t is assumed to be constant in time and a uniform root density in space r on the interval r 0 0 is considered see dos santos et al 2017 abdelfattah et al 2003 table 7 presents the data used in the numerical simulations in this application 3 in the present experience the root uptake rate capacity w φ is the square function with respect to φ and thus a square function in order to η as plotted in fig 11 with the following characteristics φ 1 φ 2 0 15 i e η 1 η 2 0 972 6 and φ 3 φ 4 100 0 i e η 3 η 4 2 3e 10 using the notations introduced in fig 3 to measure the impact of the source term we introduce two quantifications for the uptake on the one hand we define the partial uptake on the interval t t δt given by u p t t t δ t l 0 s z τ w d z d τ while the total uptake until time t is given by u p t 0 t l 0 s z τ w d z d τ fig 12 shows two scenarios with a low suction e t 3 5 10 8 m s 1 and a high suction e t 3 3 5 10 8 m s 1 numerical simulations have been carried out using the crank nicolson and the new time scheme methods in order to check the stability we observe no differences for the two cases since the suction is constant in time and the pressure head ranges in the interval φ 2 φ 3 we have w φ 1 optimal regime hence a linear curve characterizes the total uptake u p t at last the zone where the roots are up taking the water is well identified from 0 8 to 0 and transfer mechanism of water from the areas z 0 8 to the root area is well simulated η at the final time is lower than the initial value η 0 6 4 water uptake rate trapezoidal uptake rate function in this subsection application 4 deals with a more complex suction rate function where function w φ has a trapezoidal shape given by w φ 0 i f φ φ 4 λ 34 φ τ 34 i f φ φ 4 φ 3 1 i f φ φ 3 φ 2 λ 12 φ τ 12 i f φ φ 2 φ 1 0 i f φ φ 1 0 w η 0 i f η 0 η 4 λ 34 1 a 1 η η 1 α τ 34 i f η η 4 η 3 1 i f η η 3 η 2 λ 12 1 a 1 η η 1 α τ 12 i f η η 2 η 1 0 i f η η 1 0 in the present benchmark we consider φ 1 0 15 η 1 0 972 6 φ 2 0 3 η 2 0 695 1 φ 3 0 5 η 3 0 231 7 and φ 4 1 0 η 4 0 019 0 fig 13 displays the uptake capacity of the plant with respect to variable φ left panel and variable η right panel we give in table 8 the other data we use in the simulation notice that we prescribe the homogeneous neumann condition on the two boundaries to avoid inflow or outflow and guarantee that the water mass reduction is only due to the evapotranspiration mechanism we plot in fig 14 the rate η the partial uptake up and the total uptake up of the water the critical issue is that the roots face a water shortage situation with a high pressure head corresponding to a dry ground situation the pressure head around the roots ranges outside of the optimal pressure interval i e the interval where w φ 1 and the total uptake curve is under the optimal curve dashed line such a situation is magnified by a larger evapotranspiration function red curve versus blue curve 7 the multi layer problem we consider now a soil constituted of several layers with different characteristics each layer has a solution that satisfies the local richards equation with specific parameters two main assumptions are stated to guarantee the transition between layers the continuity of the flux and the pressure namely u 0 and φ 0 at the interface at the top and bottom of the domain the usual dirichlet or neumann conditions are prescribed we present the algorithm we employ to solve the multi layer problem for the simplified case that involves two layers then several benchmarks are proposed based on the steady state analytical solutions given in section a to validate the method 7 1 the model the domain ω l 0 is parted into two equal subdomains ω1 l 2 0 and ω2 l l 2 with characteristics a ℓ α ℓ and b ℓ β ℓ ℓ 1 2 together with different values for θ rar and θ sat we denote by η ℓ φ ℓ the respective solutions on domain ω ℓ ℓ 1 2 the coupling between the two layers is obtained by solving dirichlet to neumann or neumann to dirichlet problems at the interface z l 2 more precisely we prescribe the dirichlet conditions η 1 0 η top and η 2 l η bot on the top and bottom boundary of the whole domain ω respectively we seek the steady state solutions corresponding to a long time simulation to describe our method we need some additional definitions for a given value φ and a domain ω ℓ we denote by φ η φ a ℓ α ℓ the application that provides the value η with respect to the parameters of domain ω ℓ in the same way we define the reciprocal function η φ η a ℓ α ℓ given the dirichlet condition at the top η 1 0 η top and the dirichlet condition at the intermediate position η 1 l 2 η 1 we solve the richards problem on domain ω1 up to reach the stationary solution then we compute the outward flux u 1 l 2 η 1 we deduce the dirichlet to neumann operator η 1 u 1 η 1 b 1 β 1 u 1 l 2 η 1 notice that the limit solution when t does not depend on a and α similarly we define the neumann to dirichlet operator by solving the richards equation using u 2 l 2 u 1 l 2 η 1 at the intermediate point and η 2 l η bot at the bottom of the domain we then deduce the value of the solution η 2 l 2 u 2 l 2 η 1 and get η 1 η 2 η 2 u 2 l 2 η 1 b 2 β 2 η 2 l 2 u 2 l 2 η 1 we seek for η 1 such that the intermediate pressures satisfy the equality φ 1 l 2 η 1 φ 2 l 2 η 2 7 2 computation of the intermediate pressure function φ is not available analytically hence the zero would be provided numerically the fixed point algorithm consists in constructing the sequence η 1 k k 1 with repeat hsp hsp u 1 k u 1 η 1 k b 1 β 1 hsp hsp η 2 k η 2 u 1 k b 2 β 2 hsp hsp φ 2 k φ 2 k φ η 2 k a 2 α 2 hsp hsp η 1 k 1 η φ 2 k a 1 α 1 until η 1 k 1 η 1 k ε tol where η 1 0 and ε tol are given 7 3 benchmarks in order to validate the procedure described before we considered a benchmark where we have a steady state exact solution the way to produce this solution is described in appendix a first we validate the one layer case appendix a 1 considering this example we have one layer of soil with dirichlet boundary conditions the exact solution calculated produces η top 0 799 1 and η bot 0 409 3 table 9 presents the results obtained analytically versus the ones produced numerically as t the error analysis is based on l norm and converges to the steady state exact solution as t with a second order of accuracy a second benchmark tackles the two layer problem as described in appendix a 2 these two regions differ from each other with parameters b 1 1 2 2 and b 2 1 2 the exact solution provides the boundary condition η top 0 726 6 and η bot 0 249 4 cf fig 15 once again the numeric solution as t converges to the exact steady state solution however the rate of convergence is now only one as shown in table 10 in both benchmarks presented so far a 1 1 α 1 1 a 2 1 and α 2 1 although the solution still continuous at the interface it is no longer smooth due to the lack of regularity of the derivative resulting from the coefficients variation we perform a third benchmark but with a 1 1 α 1 1 a 2 0 8 and α 2 1 cf fig 16 the fact that a 2 a 1 produces a discontinuity for η at the interface we recover a first order of convergence as reported in table 11 8 conclusion a new second order finite volume method for the richards equation is proposed the new method is coupled with a new positivity preserving scheme for the source term to guarantee the physical admissibility of the quantities namely the water content moreover a formulation with a new variable η 0 1 representing the rate of saturation is proposed together with modified relations to evaluate the pressure head and the hydraulic conductivity that avoid numerical oscillations still preserving the accuracy the numerical simulations address two issues the stability of the method for critical situations drought and saturation and the evaluation of the root uptake with respect to the pressure head we also present a strategy to deal with multi layers problem by introducing a fixed point strategy to determine the complete solution on the whole domain the contribution is relevant since it provides a

11840,a new second order stabilised numerical method for the richards equation with source term is proposed to solve the water infiltration in porous soil this new method to solve richard s equation is based on a modification of the head pressure representation with respect to the water content together with the hydraulic conductivity we show that the modified relations provide stability while preserving the order and accuracy of the numerical solution furthermore a new second order positivity preserving scheme in time is implemented in substitution of the popular crank nicolson technique applications to root suction in critical situations such as water saturation or rarefaction are carried out to highlight the benefits of the method we also present a strategy to deal with multi layers

conditions requires forecasts for the management of irrigation and underground hydrodynamics knowledge of water and solute transport in soils is a trade off between rain runoff irrigation and evapotranspiration water uptake groundwater the roots capacity to absorb water and nutrients is strongly dependent on the local pressure head hence the volumetric water content since 1950s de vries 1958 simulation of saturated and unsaturated zones is fundamental for management and forecast of plant growth to provide a rational and optimal use of irrigation and groundwater resources different numerical technologies have been developed to simulate the interactions between soil plant and water traditional models are based on partial differential equations to describe the flow evolution in the soil ahmadi 2021 assouline 2013 but recently innovate methods such as machine learning are applied to the groundwater problem malekzadeh et al 2019 richards equation is the most popular approach for describing flow in rigid porous media the highly nonlinear terms together with the degeneracy that arises for dry and saturated situations makes richards equation quite difficult to solve using straightforwards numerical techniques farthing and ogden 2017 cavalcante and zornberg 2017 zha et al 2019 for example mass balance is guaranteed by using finite volume methods for the moisture content but this approach may encounter difficulties in stability and convergence for a sharp dry wetting front or for critical configurations such as dry soil or water saturation more sophisticated numerical techniques are then required to overcome convergence difficulties and poor computational efficiency linearization schemes based on the picard and newton iterative methods paniconi and putti 1994 islam and hasan 2014 list and radu 2016 represent the most common approaches to solve numerically the nonlinear richards equation the picard fixed point scheme usually converges well except for strongly nonlinear situations as saturated unsaturated interfaces where it may converge very slowly or even fail there exists a vast literature about the numerical scheme dedicated to the richards equation with particular focus on the resolution with coefficients degeneracy fassino and manzini 1998 manzini and ferraris 2004 another issue concerns the source term approximation for the water uptake feddes et al 1978 2001 2004 kumar et al 2015 broadbridge et al 2017 most of the techniques indicated in the literature are based on the strang splitting and use the crank nicolson or the second order backward differentiation formula bdf2 jacques et al 2006 the first one is unconditionally stable but does not preserve the positivity while the second one is stable and positivity preserving but requires to store two former stages since the source term is stiff both properties are desirable for the sake of physical admissibility only with a one stage scheme a formulation with a new variable η 0 1 representing the rate of saturation is proposed together with modified relations to evaluate the pressure head and the hydraulic conductivity that avoids numerical oscillations still preserving the accuracy we propose a new unconditionally positivity preserving scheme for the source term that guarantees the physical admissibility of the solution i e η remains in the admissible interval 0 1 2 modelling 2 1 the richards equation infiltration is characterized by flow through variably saturated porous media modelled with the classical richards equation we assume that the porous media is rigid the fluid is incompressible and isothermal the fluid density is unaffected by solute concentrations and the air phase does not affect water flow two main functions determine the state of the soil the volumetric water content θ and the pressure head φ p ρ wat g where p is the pressure ρ wat is the water density and g is the gravity we consider the one dimensional richards equation problem where z represents the vertical direction the domain is the open interval ω l 0 with l 0 cf fig 1 on the one hand mass conservation reads 1 θ t u z f z t s z t φ where u is the water velocity f is a given source term independent of the plants activity irrigation river etc and s is the plant suction sink term on the other hand the darcy s law yields 2 u k z φ z k φ z 1 where k k φ is called the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity coefficient and φ z represents the fluid pressure together with the gravitational head we get a θ φ system that requires an additional relation to be solved moreover a description of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity coefficient k k φ with respect to the pressure head is needed we adopt the semi empirical constitutive relationships of haverkamp et al 1977 given by manzini and ferraris 2004 pour et al 2011 3 θ φ θ rar θ sat θ rar 1 a φ α k φ k sat 1 1 b φ β where θ sat and θ rar θ sat represent the saturation and rarefaction volumetric water contents respectively k sat characterizes the saturated hydraulic conductivity coefficient of the soil and a α b β are free parameters depending on the type of soil of the problem we stress that function φ θ presents an asymptotic behaviour when we reach rarefaction i e θ θ rar in this work the numerical tests will assume that the soil roughly corresponds to a clay loam soil cf 2012 and engineering 2012 with a 2 707 m 1 α 3 96 b 5 240 8 m 1 β 4 74 and k sat 9 55e 5 m1 s 1 and we plot in fig 2 the constitutive laws with θ rar 0 2 and θ sat 0 4 notice that the previous relations are slightly different from the original van genuchten and mualem relations van genuchten 1980 given with respect to the rate of saturation 4 η θ θ rar θ sat θ rar and written as η φ 1 1 a φ n m k η k sat η 1 2 1 1 η 1 m m 2 where the authors consider the particular case n 1 1 m to draw the second equation where m is a positive parameter which characterizes the soil 2 2 source term the root water uptake is modelled considering three main ingredients dos santos et al 2017 the evapotranspiration the mass root density and the pressure head the sink term reads s z t φ e t t r z w φ where e t t is the optimal evapotranspiration depending on the weather and atmospheric conditions and is given as a function of time t r z 0 is the root density that satisfies the normalization condition 0 r z d z 1 and w φ is a stress reduction factor induced by water shortage we have 1 optimal evapotranspiration is the flow of water that the plant should release in the atmosphere under optimal condition for the roots namely enough water in the soil to ensure a perfect working of the plant such function depends among other parameters on the temperature sun radiation and air humidity for the optimal situation w φ 1 all along the vertical axis and we recover the mass conservation 0 s z t φ d z 0 e t t r z d z e t t 2 the root density describes the distribution of the root in function of the depth in this work we will consider a constant distribution given by r z 1 r 0 if z r 0 0 0 if z r 0 where r 0 0 approximates the length of the roots cf fig 1 3 the plant suction rate indicates the roots capacity to drag water with respect to the pressure head the classical model was proposed by feddes feddes et al 2001 this is represented in fig 3 where parameters φ 1 φ 2 φ 3 and φ 4 0 φ 1 φ 2 φ 3 φ 4 depend on the plant and the soil 2 3 the η reformulation from relations 3 and 4 we deduce that 5 η φ θ rar θ sat θ rar 1 a φ α θ rar θ sat θ rar 1 1 a φ α function η is then an explicit function with respect to φ and reciprocally we have 6 φ η 1 a 1 η η 1 α notice that lim η 0 φ η and lim η 1 φ η 0 and 7 φ z 1 a 1 α 1 η η 1 α 1 z 1 η η 1 a α η 2 1 η η 1 α 1 η z on the other hand substituting 6 in relation 3 we obtain an explicit expression of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity coefficient with respect to η given by 8 k η k sat η β α η β α b a β 1 η β α k sat η β α a β a β η β α b β 1 η β α then considering 7 and 8 darcy s law 2 reads u η k sat η β α a β a β η β α b β 1 η β α 1 a α η 2 1 η η 1 α 1 η z 1 k η η z v η η with k η k sat a β 1 α 1 η 1 α α η β α 1 α a β η β α b β 1 η β α v η k sat a β η β α 1 a β η β α b β 1 η β α going back to richards equation 1 we obtain a scalar nonlinear convection diffusion equation 9 θ sat θ rar η t z v η η z k η η z f s boundary conditions are prescribed to take into account the external factors air moisture rain dry weather in this work and written in terms of η we will consider the following ones dirichlet condition by setting η 0 t η top t for example rainy weather yields η 0 t 1 while dry condition gives η 0 t 0 the dirichlet condition can be substituted with the wall condition at the top of domain z η 0 t 0 to prescribe an impervious soil dirichlet condition by setting η l t η bot t neumann s condition on the bottom gives z η l t q t 2 4 the degenerated problem when η is close to the extreme values 0 and 1 equation 9 presents strong singularities leading to important numerical difficulties since k η diverges since β α 1 moreover one has to fulfill t η 0 and z η 0 on the subdomains charaterized by η 0 or η 1 hence the time component degenerates leading to a time parametrized problem over the two subdomains to deal with the singularities we change the variable in order to eliminate the singularity contained in the diffusive part to this end we isolate the local singularity at η 1 by introducing k η k η 1 α 1 η 1 α α k η k sat a β 1 η β α 1 α a β η β α b β 1 η β α notice that k η now does not degenerate when η 1 noting that 1 α 1 η 1 α α η z z 1 η 1 α we suggest the new variable η 1 ζ α and we get k η η z k η ζ z we then get the formulation 10 θ sat θ rar t ζ α z v η 1 ζ α z k η ζ z f note that we maintain the variable η for coefficients v η and k η since we shall employ a semi implicit formulation using the value of η at the previous time while we perform a modified fixed point algorithm for the non linearity we highlight the very recent document bassetto et al 2021 where a more general but complex non linear transformation similar to the one we have proposed has been recently published for the case where η is close to 0 a similar procedure can be followed 3 finite volume scheme a second order finite volume method is presented to provide a numerical approximation of the richards equation the built in conservation property of the method is the main motivation to design a scheme that preserves the mass of the water 3 1 method of lines we first deal with the non degenerated situation the

unfortunately there are no guarantees that the sequence converges even with an initial guess close to the solution because the operator is not a contraction indeed we have experienced divergent approximations even for n 1 to overcome the problem let us consider a simplified version by assuming that ζ is scalar and skip index n for the sake of clarity we confront the fixed point left equation

by setting k 0 we observe that the newton raphson corresponds to a convex combination between the fixed point method and the former solution with respective coefficients α 1 α 1 α hence inspired from

the non linear solution remark that the non linear issue has been addressed in different context such as discontinuous galerkin by ersoy et al 2021 and clément et al 2021 3 5 benchmarking table 1 presents the data used for benchmark 1 following manzini and ferraris 2004 and we display in fig 5 the variables η φ and θ for different times in function of the z variable using the euler implicit and the crank nicolson methods we observe that the first order method is less accurate than the second order one and no oscillations are reported since the values range in the interval 0 117 3 0 908 3 far from the critical situations as a variation of benchmark 1 benchmark 2 aims to assess the stabilisation of the scheme using the ζ formulation 13 we now consider a dirichlet condition η 0 t 1 which leads to the saturated water situation and n 480 fig 6 displays the solution for several times using again the euler implicit and the crank nicolson methods where we observe that the new formulation avoids spurious oscillations while function η is very close to the saturated situation benchmark 3 is a new variation of benchmark 1 where we provide a neumann boundary condition at the top of the domain where we impose the flux f i 1 2 t 0 2 k sat fig 7 displays the solution for several times using the euler implicit and the crank nicolson methods where we again observe that the new formulation avoids spurious oscillations as a final consideration we assess the regime of the flow by computing the cell péclet number given by p e δ z v k α a l η 1 α 1 η α 1 α notice that we have pe η 0 for η 0 and η 1 and we reach the maximum with η 1 α i e p e 1 α a δ z α 1 α 1 α numerical simulations provide the estimate p e o 1 0 1 that proves the flow is mainly driven by the diffusive contribution consequently the centred scheme suits very well and no upwind trick is necessary to stabilize the method 4 source term the nonlinear source term contribution s z t φ is treated apart with a numerical method for the ordinary differential equation for s since we will consider the strang splitting method that decouples the convection diffusion contribution and the source term indeed we first solve problem 11 without the nonlinear source term on interval t n t n 1 that provides a guess solution η n then we solve the ordinary differential equation in interval t n t n 1 d η i d t t s z i t η i t with η i t n η i n and set η i n 1 η i t n 1 4 1 crank nicolson scheme a popular scheme to solve the ordinary differential equation is the crank nicolson cn scheme given by η i n 1 η i n δ t 1 2 s z i t n 1 η i n 1 s z i t n η i n solving the nonlinear problem in η i n 1 produces the solution although the scheme is unconditional stable for a large time step δt the solution sign may change indeed setting s η λη λ 0 we have η i n 1 2 λ δ t 2 λ δ t η i n and for λδt 2 the sign changes leading to a non admissible solution 4 2 new scheme since the model requires a sign invariant algorithm to guarantee the physical admissibility of the solution we propose a new technique combining a backward differentiation formula bdf method with the centred scheme for instance the bdf2 scheme is a robust and stable technique but requires the two previous stages to overcome that point we mimic the bdf2 scheme using an intermediate point between t n and t n 1 that reads 3 η i n 1 4 η i n 1 2 η n δ t s z i t n 1 η i n 1 where η i n 1 2 is a second order approximation of η i t n δ t 2 on the other hand we use the second order approximation centred on time t n 1 2 η n 1 η n δ t s z i t n 1 2 η n 1 2 to check the sign and stability issues we consider s η λη λ 0 obtaining 3 η i n 1 4 η i n 1 2 η n λ δ t η i n 1 η n 1 η λ δ t η n 1 2 whose solution is η i n 1 4 λ δ t 4 3 λ δ t λ δ t 2 η i n note that for η i n 0 1 we have η i n 1 0 1 we seek the solution by solving the fixed point problem g η n 1 2 η n 1 z i t n 1 2 t n 1 η i n η n 1 2 η n 1 t where the vector valued function g is given by g η n 1 2 η n 1 z τ t η η n 1 η η n 1 2 δ t s z t η n 1 3 η δ t s z τ η n 1 2 4 3 benchmarking for benchmark 4 we consider the ordinary differential equation y t y t in t 0 0 5 with y 0 1 whose exact solution is y t exp t we consider a grid of n points on the time domain and set t n nδt with δt 0 5 n to assess the error and convergence rate we compute e e n y n y 0 5 where y n is the numerical approximation at time t n n 1 n we further define the rate of convergence between two numerical solutions characterized by n 1 and n 2 with n 1 n 2 as o o n 1 n 2 log e n 1 e n 2 log n 1 n 2 table 2 confirms that both schemes are second order with respect to δt to check the positivity preserving property benchmark 5 is dedicated to the ordinary differential equation y t 50y t in t 0 0 5 with y 0 1 fig 8 displays the numerical solution for n 10 we observe that the crank nicolson scheme presents the characteristic of a method that does not preserve the positivity with a red point below the horizontal axis on the contrary the new scheme is more stable since no sign inversion is reported and the solution is always physically admissible 5 the strang splitting the strang splitting technique strang 1968 has been extensively used to decouple the main equation from the source term in particular for stiffness contributions following tang et al 2015 we detail hereafter the method adding our new contribution by introducing the positivity preserving scheme in time we have presented in the previous section 5 1 formulation richards equation can be decomposed into two operators d η d t a η b η 0 where a represents the convection diffusion contribution including source f independent of η given in section 3 and b concerns the nonlinear source term solved in section 4 since we are dealing with a second order scheme in time we apply the strang splitting namely given η n the solution at time t n 1 compute η n 1 3 with d η d t b η 0 in interval t n t n δt 2 2 compute η n 2 3 with d η d t a η 0 in interval t n t n δt 3 compute η n 1 with d η d t b η 0 in interval t n δt 2 t n δt we identify this sequence of steps as the bab splitting scheme and by aba the other alternative order notice that the boundary conditions for a operator have to be evaluated at time t n δt 2 to preserve the second order in time 5 2 benchmarking benchmark 5 which aims to check the strang splitting considers the partial differential equation ζ t ζ z 2 ζ z 2 f ζ in 1 0 0 1 with dirichlet boundary conditions following the method of manufactured solutions the source term f is determined to satisfy the differential equation in this benchmark we consider ζ z t z 1 2 exp t which implies that f z t 2z 4 exp t to assess the error and convergence rate we use the l 1 and l errors computed by e 1 e 1 i n i 2 i 1 ζ i n ζ z i t n δ z e e i n max i 2 i 1 ζ i n ζ z i t n we further define the rate of convergence between two numerical solutions characterized by i n 1 and i n 2 with n 1 n 2 as o α o α i n 1 i n 2 log e α i n 1 e α i n 2 log n 1 n 2 α 1 table 3 checks that the splitting technique provides a second order method in time where the numerical simulations have been carried out with i 40 although we get a second order for both methods the accuracy for the bab version is improved by three magnitudes when compared with the aba version in conclusion we will use the first formula for the applications 6 applications water infiltration and water uptake are the two fundamental issues of the model in subsections 6 1 and 6 2 we tackle the water infiltration while subsections 6 3 and 6 4 are dedicated to the full problem with the combination of water infiltration and water uptake we report in table 4 the common data we use all along the applications of this section 6 1 infiltration rate saturation case we first consider the situation where we assume that the surface is saturated of water runoff by prescribing the dirichlet condition η 0 1 the specific data of application 1 is given in table 5 we present in fig 9 the numerical approximations for different times we report that no oscillations are present in the curves 6 2 infiltration rate drought case we now turn to the simulation of an extreme drought scenario application 2 we prescribe an initial condition η 0 z 0 all over the domain and wall condition at the top of the domain no water inflow or outflow on the other hand we assume that the groundwater is saturated at the bottom by setting the dirichlet boundary condition η l t 1 data are summed up in table 6 and the numerical results are presented in fig 10 again we do not observe oscillations 6 3 water uptake rate square uptake rate function the complete model includes the source term of the evapotranspiration as presented in section 2 2 for the sake of simplicity the optimal evapotranspiration et t is assumed to be constant in time and a uniform root density in space r on the interval r 0 0 is considered see dos santos et al 2017 abdelfattah et al 2003 table 7 presents the data used in the numerical simulations in this application 3 in the present experience the root uptake rate capacity w φ is the square function with respect to φ and thus a square function in order to η as plotted in fig 11 with the following characteristics φ 1 φ 2 0 15 i e η 1 η 2 0 972 6 and φ 3 φ 4 100 0 i e η 3 η 4 2 3e 10 using the notations introduced in fig 3 to measure the impact of the source term we introduce two quantifications for the uptake on the one hand we define the partial uptake on the interval t t δt given by u p t t t δ t l 0 s z τ w d z d τ while the total uptake until time t is given by u p t 0 t l 0 s z τ w d z d τ fig 12 shows two scenarios with a low suction e t 3 5 10 8 m s 1 and a high suction e t 3 3 5 10 8 m s 1 numerical simulations have been carried out using the crank nicolson and the new time scheme methods in order to check the stability we observe no differences for the two cases since the suction is constant in time and the pressure head ranges in the interval φ 2 φ 3 we have w φ 1 optimal regime hence a linear curve characterizes the total uptake u p t at last the zone where the roots are up taking the water is well identified from 0 8 to 0 and transfer mechanism of water from the areas z 0 8 to the root area is well simulated η at the final time is lower than the initial value η 0 6 4 water uptake rate trapezoidal uptake rate function in this subsection application 4 deals with a more complex suction rate function where function w φ has a trapezoidal shape given by w φ 0 i f φ φ 4 λ 34 φ τ 34 i f φ φ 4 φ 3 1 i f φ φ 3 φ 2 λ 12 φ τ 12 i f φ φ 2 φ 1 0 i f φ φ 1 0 w η 0 i f η 0 η 4 λ 34 1 a 1 η η 1 α τ 34 i f η η 4 η 3 1 i f η η 3 η 2 λ 12 1 a 1 η η 1 α τ 12 i f η η 2 η 1 0 i f η η 1 0 in the present benchmark we consider φ 1 0 15 η 1 0 972 6 φ 2 0 3 η 2 0 695 1 φ 3 0 5 η 3 0 231 7 and φ 4 1 0 η 4 0 019 0 fig 13 displays the uptake capacity of the plant with respect to variable φ left panel and variable η right panel we give in table 8 the other data we use in the simulation notice that we prescribe the homogeneous neumann condition on the two boundaries to avoid inflow or outflow and guarantee that the water mass reduction is only due to the evapotranspiration mechanism we plot in fig 14 the rate η the partial uptake up and the total uptake up of the water the critical issue is that the roots face a water shortage situation with a high pressure head corresponding to a dry ground situation the pressure head around the roots ranges outside of the optimal pressure interval i e the interval where w φ 1 and the total uptake curve is under the optimal curve dashed line such a situation is magnified by a larger evapotranspiration function red curve versus blue curve 7 the multi layer problem we consider now a soil constituted of several layers with different characteristics each layer has a solution that satisfies the local richards equation with specific parameters two main assumptions are stated to guarantee the transition between layers the continuity of the flux and the pressure namely u 0 and φ 0 at the interface at the top and bottom of the domain the usual dirichlet or neumann conditions are prescribed we present the algorithm we employ to solve the multi layer problem for the simplified case that involves two layers then several benchmarks are proposed based on the steady state analytical solutions given in section a to validate the method 7 1 the model the domain ω l 0 is parted into two equal subdomains ω1 l 2 0 and ω2 l l 2 with characteristics a ℓ α ℓ and b ℓ β ℓ ℓ 1 2 together with different values for θ rar and θ sat we denote by η ℓ φ ℓ the respective solutions on domain ω ℓ ℓ 1 2 the coupling between the two layers is obtained by solving dirichlet to neumann or neumann to dirichlet problems at the interface z l 2 more precisely we prescribe the dirichlet conditions η 1 0 η top and η 2 l η bot on the top and bottom boundary of the whole domain ω respectively we seek the steady state solutions corresponding to a long time simulation to describe our method we need some additional definitions for a given value φ and a domain ω ℓ we denote by φ η φ a ℓ α ℓ the application that provides the value η with respect to the parameters of domain ω ℓ in the same way we define the reciprocal function η φ η a ℓ α ℓ given the dirichlet condition at the top η 1 0 η top and the dirichlet condition at the intermediate position η 1 l 2 η 1 we solve the richards problem on domain ω1 up to reach the stationary solution then we compute the outward flux u 1 l 2 η 1 we deduce the dirichlet to neumann operator η 1 u 1 η 1 b 1 β 1 u 1 l 2 η 1 notice that the limit solution when t does not depend on a and α similarly we define the neumann to dirichlet operator by solving the richards equation using u 2 l 2 u 1 l 2 η 1 at the intermediate point and η 2 l η bot at the bottom of the domain we then deduce the value of the solution η 2 l 2 u 2 l 2 η 1 and get η 1 η 2 η 2 u 2 l 2 η 1 b 2 β 2 η 2 l 2 u 2 l 2 η 1 we seek for η 1 such that the intermediate pressures satisfy the equality φ 1 l 2 η 1 φ 2 l 2 η 2 7 2 computation of the intermediate pressure function φ is not available analytically hence the zero would be provided numerically the fixed point algorithm consists in constructing the sequence η 1 k k 1 with repeat hsp hsp u 1 k u 1 η 1 k b 1 β 1 hsp hsp η 2 k η 2 u 1 k b 2 β 2 hsp hsp φ 2 k φ 2 k φ η 2 k a 2 α 2 hsp hsp η 1 k 1 η φ 2 k a 1 α 1 until η 1 k 1 η 1 k ε tol where η 1 0 and ε tol are given 7 3 benchmarks in order to validate the procedure described before we considered a benchmark where we have a steady state exact solution the way to produce this solution is described in appendix a first we validate the one layer case appendix a 1 considering this example we have one layer of soil with dirichlet boundary conditions the exact solution calculated produces η top 0 799 1 and η bot 0 409 3 table 9 presents the results obtained analytically versus the ones produced numerically as t the error analysis is based on l norm and converges to the steady state exact solution as t with a second order of accuracy a second benchmark tackles the two layer problem as described in appendix a 2 these two regions differ from each other with parameters b 1 1 2 2 and b 2 1 2 the exact solution provides the boundary condition η top 0 726 6 and η bot 0 249 4 cf fig 15 once again the numeric solution as t converges to the exact steady state solution however the rate of convergence is now only one as shown in table 10 in both benchmarks presented so far a 1 1 α 1 1 a 2 1 and α 2 1 although the solution still continuous at the interface it is no longer smooth due to the lack of regularity of the derivative resulting from the coefficients variation we perform a third benchmark but with a 1 1 α 1 1 a 2 0 8 and α 2 1 cf fig 16 the fact that a 2 a 1 produces a discontinuity for η at the interface we recover a first order of convergence as reported in table 11 8 conclusion a new second order finite volume method for the richards equation is proposed the new method is coupled with a new positivity preserving scheme for the source term to guarantee the physical admissibility of the quantities namely the water content moreover a formulation with a new variable η 0 1 representing the rate of saturation is proposed together with modified relations to evaluate the pressure head and the hydraulic conductivity that avoid numerical oscillations still preserving the accuracy the numerical simulations address two issues the stability of the method for critical situations drought and saturation and the evaluation of the root uptake with respect to the pressure head we also present a strategy to deal with multi layers problem by introducing a fixed point strategy to determine the complete solution on the whole domain the contribution is relevant since it provides a numerical tool to better understand how the cycle of water is in a crop field allowing the design of irrigation strategies for a better and sustainable management of the water declaration of competing

distinct solutions continuity of the flux u 0 and relation a 1 yields that the constant c is the same on both side of the domain moreover we set c 2k sat for the sake of simplicity denoting by φ 1 and

11841,the water quality of the aquifer of the el oued region algerian sahara is deteriorating in water quality due to anthropogenic effects and over exploitation of the groundwater resources this study assesses the quality of groundwater in the el oued shallow aquifer for domestic and irrigation purposes and highlights the various geochemical processes that contribute to the mineralization of this water twenty five water samples were collected the measured and analyzed parameters are ph ec tds na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 the assessment of water potability using the water quality index wqi method shows two classes of water quality namely the very poor class 8 and the unsuitable for drinking class 92 agricultural water quality was assessed using the parameters electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na kelly ratio kr permeability index pi magnesium hazard mh residual sodium carbonate rsc and chloride content the results showed that the water of this shallow aquifer is unsuitable for irrigation based on ec cl and ussl diagram this aquifer discloses three facies of water cl na ca 12 so4 na 36 and so4 ca mg 52 in addition an analysis of physicochemical data obtained from water samples was conducted using correlation matrices pca bivariate plots and gibbs diagrams the saturation indices of the main minerals was also calculated these analyses have shown that the main reactions responsible for the evolution of water types in the el oued shallow aquifer fall into four categories 1 a mixing process in the waters of deep aquifers the complexe terminal aquifer and the continental intercalaire aquifer 2 the dissolution of salts in particular gypsum and halite 3 cation exchange processes affecting the concentration of na k mg2 and ca2 and 4 anthropogenic influences from domestic sewerage and agricultural activities graphical abstract image 1 keywords el oued wqi irrigation shallow aquifers pca gibbs diagram 1 introduction water quality is an important issue for the health of people all around the world hydrochemical analysis of sampled waters is the fundamental stage to understand the quality of waters surface and groundwater there are also other approaches and methods that can be used to understand the evolution of the quality of waters in space and time such us gis geographic information system geostatistical remote sensing mappings and geophysical methods electrical and electromagnetic techniques aju et al 2021 kadam et al 2022 jesiya and gopinath 2018 the shallow aquifer of the north east of the algerian sahara has long been used by the population for irrigation purposes and for the supply of drinking water ouarekh et al 2021 the increasing demand for water in the study region requires recourse to deep water resources the complexe terminal aquifer and the continental intercalaire aquifer however the significant increase in flows and their discharge directly into the superficial aquifer without any treatment in addition to the lack of a sewerage network and natural outlet have caused the groundwater level to rise to the surface the phenomenon of rising water levels has affected most of the regions of the north east sahara the basin of ouargla el oued and oued righ the consequences of this phenomenon are harmful for man and the environment such as the flooding of palm groves and their asphyxiation and contamination of the shallow aquifer by pollutants of urban and agricultural origin anrh 1993 bg 2004 remini et al 2006 bouselsal et al 2014 in addition there is high water mineralization caused by intense evaporation from the surface water or leaching of soluble formations from the unsaturated zone currently the degradation of water quality in the el oued superficial aquifer makes these resources less used for drinking water supply dws however these resources are still being exploited for irrigation which generates very important wealth for the population and gives the region its name of agricultural pole par excellence but this agricultural system is threatened with the risk of soil salinization and the degradation of its structure under conditions of population growth and an even faster increase in food needs the quality of water in the algerian sahara is still a national issue and a factor that impacts the demographic and economic development of southern algeria this study is mainly concentrated on evaluating the quality of the groundwater for the purposes of consumption and irrigation as well as to more closely understand the processes that resulted in the mineralization of the shallow aquifer in el oued this was done by interpreting the chemical data of 25 water samples collected from wells in study area the quality of the water as well as its suitability for human consumption was assessed using the water quality index wqi the wqi metric which uses different physicochemical parameters to estimate the quality of groundwater for a majority of residential purposes is the most widely utilized water quality standard in the world it is a simple and effective method for determining water quality and categorizing it in terms of its suitability for human consumption in addition the water quality and its suitability for irrigation was assessed by studying factors that have an influence on soils and plants these include its electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc potential salinity ps magnesium hazard mh kelly ratio kr and permeability index pi identifying the processes that controlled the mineralization of the water was accomplished by using a piper diagram a gibbs diagram bivariate plots principal component analysis pca and a pearson s correlation matrix analysis of the physicochemical data the results of this study are intended to be used to guide and improve the management of groundwater sources in el oued region 2 study area 2 1 geographical location and climate the study area fig 1 is part of the prefecture of el oued located in south eastern algeria it includes the most important urban centers of the wilaya which extends from the ogla in the south to kouinine in the north with agricultural areas on the eastern and western borders of the urban centers bouselsal 2016 the study area is located between latitudes 33 15 to 33 25 north and longitudes 6 45 to 7 00 east extending over an area of 500 km2 and with a population of around 250 000 inhabitants ons 2008 the study area is characterized by a hyper arid climate where the dry period is extended over the entire year results recorded at the guemar weather station over a 35 year period onm 1978 2012 recorded a mean annual rainfall in the region of 70 mm and a mean annual temperature of 28 4 c mean annual evapotranspiration calculated using the thornthwaite empirical formula is around 1164 mm with a maximum recorded in july 216 mm and a minimum recorded in january 9 4 mm the calculation of the water balance of the region shows that the effective rainfall recharge is negligible most shallow water recharge is done through the re infiltration of irrigation water and domestic wastewater under urban centers bouselsal et al 2015 the el oued region has undergone in recent years a constant expansion of its agricultural production making it one of the most important agricultural regions in the country it is considered among the leading date palm and potato producing regions this status of agricultural pole par excellence is reflected not only in the cultivation of potatoes and date palms which are the region s main vocations but also in the degree to which tobacco cultivation and market gardening have been achieved 2 2 geological and geomorphological context the field of study is a part of the northern sahara sedimentary basin whose extension covers an area of 780 000 km2 this basin constitutes an important topographic depression fig 2 which is underlain by a structural basin in the form of an asymmetrical syncline the sedimentary series is marked in the centre of the pit by important subvertical tectonic accidents bank dips are generally shallow with the exception of the edge zone in the northeast of the basin cornet 1964 busson 1967 castany 1982 this series comprises at its base palaeozoic marine formations surmounted in discordance by the continental formations of the secondary and tertiary which are several thousand metres thick busson 1970 the quaternary succeeded it the quaternary section is essentially composed of dune sands whose thickness can reach a few hundred metres only the upper series is of hydrogeological interest from a geomorphological point of view the study area is part of the large erg oriental which is characterized by a set of sand dunes the slope is generally oriented south north with altitude values ranging from 64 m to 120 m artificial troughs dug by the inhabitants to plant palm trees and vegetables called ghout can be seen here the latter symbolizes the shape taken by the traditional palm groves of oued souf the palm trees are planted in groups of 20 100 palm trees in the centre of an artificial basin 10 m deep and 80 200 m in diameter whose bottom has been brought to less than 1 m above the water table 2 3 hydrogeological context the el oued aquifer system is characterized by the superposition of three aquifers fig 2 unesco 1972 saibi et al 2009 these are from bottom to top the continental intercalaire ci aquifer the complexe terminal ct aquifer and the shallow aquifer the continental intercalaire ci aquifer is represented by lower cretaceous sandy sandstone and sandy clay continental deposits oss 2003 edmunds et al 2003 it is a multi layered aquifer system with a local roof depth of 1450 m and a thickness of between 400 and 460 m the boreholes capturing this aquifer are artesian intended for drinking water supply characterized by a flow rate of about 140 l s the aquifer of the complexe terminal includes the permeable bedrock of the senonian carbonate and the mio pliocene in fact it is possible to distinguish three aquifers separated locally by semi permeable or impermeable horizons these three aquifers are represented by the mio pliocene sands the first aquifer ct1 by the pontien sands sandstones and gravels the second aquifer ct2 and by the fissured limestone and carbonated eocene and senonian dolomite bouselsal 2016 limestone table ct3 the third aquifer top is at a depth of roughly 250 m and extends to 700 m the shallow aquifer fig 3 is unconfined and composed of quaternary age detrital formations represented by sands sandstones clayey sands and gypsum with bedrock consisting of clay and sandy clay the average depth of the bedrock is about 60 m senoussi et al 1992 meziani et al 2011 the piezometric map of the shallow aquifer for june 2017 fig 4 shows that the upstream part of the aquifer is located in the southwest with a height of nearly 76 m and the downstream part is located in the northeast with a height of 60 m the flow of the slick is generally from the sw to the ne the hydraulic gradient varies between 0 08 and 0 66 the urban centers el oued kouinine and nakhla and agricultural areas mehri soualah and nakhla gharbia plantations irrigated from the deep aquifers appear on the piezometric map as areas of divergence the latter form piezometric domes due to the rapid infiltration of urban water and irrigation water pumped from boreholes that capture the captive deep aquifers of the ct and the ci bg 2002 bouselsal et al 2014 remini et al 2011 zine et al 2017 on the other hand the agricultural areas khobna bayadha soualah and ogla irrigated from wells in the shallow aquifer depressions and the el oued discharge area appear on the map as convergence areas 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling twenty five water samples from wells in the el oued unconfined shallow aquifer fig 4 were collected and hydrochemical measurements were carried out in june 2017 the sampling points were selected to acquire data representative of the spatial variability of groundwater chemistry of the studied aquifer twenty one sampled water points are located in the agglomerations of el oued in the ghouts and cultivated areas between the dunes which are intensively irrigated by pivots in circular plots oss 2010 three sampled boreholes f22 f23 and f25 are located in flooded areas affected by the upwelling phenomenon meziani et al 2009 remini 2006 a fourth borehole f21 is located in the urban wastewater discharge area of the city of el oued 3 2 methods of analysis and reliability of results the physicochemical parameters were determined in situ immediately after sample collection using a portable multimeter these in situ measurements of conductivity accuracy of 0 5 of the measured value temperature accuracy of 0 1 c and ph accuracy of 0 1 ph unit were carried out using a multimeter of type hi 9829 the samples were collected using two polypropylene vials previously rinsed with the water to be sampled each sample was immediately filtered on site using 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filters the filtrates for the cations were collected in 250 ml polyethylene vials and immediately acidified to ph 2 by adding ultrapure nitric acid while the samples for the anions were not acidified all samples were stored in a cooler at a temperature below 4 c and transferred to the laboratory and kept in a refrigerator at a temperature below 4 c until they were analyzed within a maximum of five days analyses were carried out in the laboratory using standard techniques rodier 1996 nitrates sulphates and chlorides were determined using a dr2000 type spectrophotometer hach while calcium sodium and potassium were analyzed using a flame spectrophotometer 410 corning magnesium was determined by complexometry and deduced from the difference th ca2 the concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 were analyzed by titrimetry using a coloured indicator the calculation of the ionic balance of the results provides a secondary assessment on the reliability of the analyses performed the results obtained are of

drinking and irrigation water quality the assessment of drinking water chemical quality was carried out firstly by comparison with the world health organization who guideline values and the algerian standards for drinking water table 1 and secondly by using the water quality index wqi method the water suitability for irrigation purpose was determined by studying the potential parameters related to the quality of irrigation water which are electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na kelly ratio rk permeability index pi magnesium hazard mh residual sodium carbonate rsc and chloride content these parameters were obtained using the following formulas panpan and al 2019 mokhtar et al 2021 ouarekh et al 2021 2 s a r n a c a m g 2 3 n a n a k 100 n a k c a

the comparison of the averages of the different parameters measured the maxima minima and standard deviation were determined to assess the chemical quality of the water with respect to the drinking water standards all the statistical evaluations were performed using xlstat 2014 for windows the principal component analysis pca was conducted to identify the most important factors controlling groundwater geochemistry twelve hydrochemical variables including ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 cl no3 t ph tds and ec and twenty five samples were processed using multivariate statistical techniques the values of the different variables table 1 were normalized prior to the multivariate analyses table 5 presents the matrix of correlation coefficients for hydrochemical data in the shallow aquifer of el

correlation matrix transforms the original correlated p variables into uncorrelated orthogonal p variables called principal components which are weighted linear combinations of the original variables alassane et al 2015 meglen 1992 the characteristic roots of the main components eigenvalues are a representation of their corresponding variances and the sum of the own values corresponds with the total number of variables the correlation of the principal components and the original variables is given by the loadings and the individual transformed observations are called scores eigenvalues and own vectors for the matrix of covariances were determined then the data were transformed into factors the factor scores are calculated for each sample by matrix multiplication of the coefficient of the factor score with the standardized data the value of each factor score at the sample site reflects the significance of a given factor a factor score 1 indicates an intense influence of the process very negative values 1 represent areas that are completely uninfluenced by the process and values close to zero represent areas with modest process impact 3 5 water chemistry a piper diagram was used to evaluate the hydrogeochemical nature of the groundwater samples the gibbs diagram 1970 was used to specify the probable origin of the major elements contributing to water mineralization in addition the hypothetical combination of salts kraiem et al 2014 farid et al 2012 trabelsi et al 2012 ben moussa et al 2008 was also used to estimate different assemblages of nacl cacl2 caso4 na2so4 etc and to determine the water types using the piper diagram this combination was based on the lithological nature of the aquifer and the climatic conditions of the study area phreeqc software was used to determine the acquisition mechanisms of the mineralization to determine the saturation indices for some minerals calcite dolomite gypsum anhydrite and halite and to verify the mineral solution equilibrium using the specific interaction theory sit i e the extension of the debye hückel law of scatchard and guggenheim recently incorporated in phreeqc sracek et al 2004 mukherjee et al 2008 parkhurst and appelo 1999 the most commonly used saturation index for groundwater bouhlassa et al 2008 is as follows 8 s i l o g i a p k s p where iap is the product of the activity of the ions concerned and ksp is the product of the solubility of the mineral in question water is in equilibrium with a mineral when si 0 it is undersaturated when si 0 and supersaturated when si 0 when a solution is undersaturated with respect to a mineral the mineral will tend to dissolve 4 results and discussion 4 1 salinity and chemical facies salinity refers to the total concentration of soluble ions in a water supply it is largely related to the amount of total dissolved solids tds in the solution the tds is determined by evaporating the filtered water sample to dryness then weighing the residue water containing more than 500 mg l tds is unsuitable for drinking and cannot be used for many industrial and agricultural applications the high concentration of tds in groundwater may be due to the presence of bicarbonates carbonates sulfates chlorides and calcium in the study area the salinity values range from 3 25 g l f 17 to 46 1 g l f 21 in total dissolved solids tds table 1 the low values are recorded in the southern part of the study area in the agricultural areas irrigated from boreholes tapping the ct aquifer mean salinity 2 4 g l where the infiltration of less mineralized irrigation water leads to the dilution of the surface aquifer water the highest values are recorded in the northern part increasing according to the direction of groundwater flow as well as in topographic depressions as a result of the high evaporation impacting the shallow water depths and in the area of discharge of untreated domestic and industrial wastewater from the city of el oued f 21 the piper 1944 diagram fig 5 was used to characterize the water in the shallow aquifer the representation of the results of chemical analyses of the sampled waters generally shows three water types 1 na ca cl type which accounts for 12 of the drill holes and shows very high mineralization ranging from 11 g l f 22 to 46 1 g l f 21 the high miniralization is due to the strong evaporation of water at a shallow depth less than 0 4 m and also to the rapid infiltration of wastewater at the f 21 drilling level which is located near the uncontrolled wastewater discharge area of the city of el oued 2 na so4 type which accounts for 36 of the samples these water show strong mineralization 4 48 6 64 g l which appears to be related to the dissolution of gypsum and halite 3 ca mg so4 type which accounts for 52 of the sampled points located in the southern part of the study area with an average mineralization ranging from 3 25 g l f 17 to 4 77 g l f 12 these different water types emphasize the complexity of the hydrochemical processes that control the salinity of the surface water of el oued bekkoussa et al 2013 4 2 water suitability for human consumption and irrigation purposes 4 2 1 water suitability for human consumption the chemical analysis results in table 1 show the variability and order of magnitude of the different physico chemical variables in the groundwater samples collected as well as the world health organization who and algerian alg std water potability standards joradp 2011 the main water quality problems appear to be salinity hardness and nitrate pollution groundwater is characterized by a very high salinity which varies between 3 25 g l f17 and 46 10 g l f21 these values far exceed the who drinking water standard of 1 5 g l the high concentrations of calcium and magnesium contribute to the increase in total water hardness which ranges from 1040 f17 to 15101 f21 mg l in caco3 thus groundwater is characterized as very hard water freeze 1979 sawyer and mccarty 1967 and not suitable for most domestic uses us epa 1999 sappa et al 2014 concentrations of the other major elements sodium potassium sulfate chloride and bicarbonate are often above recommended standards as well another major problem with the shallow water appears to be its high content of nitrogen compounds nitrate values exceed the potability limit 50 mg l bouselsal et al 2014 who 2004 in 80 of the wells analyzed table 1 there were five boreholes under the potability limit f12 f21 f22 f24 and f25 high nitrate concentrations are an indication of anthropogenic pollution of urban and agricultural origin affecting the study area bekkoussa et al 2013 kraiem et al 2014 given the results of this assessment the waters of the surface aquifer of el oued are interpreted as unsuitable for drinking water supply the second method used to determine the quality of drinking water is the water quality index wqi method this method is based on equation 9 and is used to summarize the large amount of water quality data into a single number horton 1965 brown et al 1970 štambuk giljanović 1999 abbasi 2002 hamlat and azeddine 2018 abbasnia et al 2018 the chemical data of the analyzed water samples were compared to the algerian standard for drinking water joradp 2011 which was taken into account for the calculation of the wqi table 2 three steps are necessary to calculate the wqi in the first step a weight wi is allocated to each of the 11 parameters according to their relative significance in the overall quality of drinking water mokhtar et al 2021 ouarekh et al 2021 values show in table 2 the second step is calculating the relative weight wi table 2 lists the calculated relative weight of the wi values of each parameter in the third step a quality scale qi is determined for each parameter by dividing its concentration in each water sample by its standard concentration prescribed by the algerian norm and the result is multiplied by 100 as follows 9 w q i s i i w i q i w i n i 1 w i c i s i 100 10 w i q i n i 1 q i where ci concentration of each parameter si limit value of each parameter set by algerian standards table 2 wi the weight of each parameter according to its relative importance in drinking water quality qi quality rating for each parameter table 2 wi the relative weight equation 9 sii the sub index of parameter i the calculated values of the water quality index wqi are then classified into the different water quality classes shown in table 3 al hadithi 2012 al mamun et al 2019 the wqi defines five water quality classes excellent good poor very poor and unsuitable for drinking the values of the water quality index wqi calculated for the shallow aquifer of el oued range from 242 to 3755 with an average of 616 two water quality classes were determined fig 6 92 of the samples are in unsuitable for drinking water class and two boreholes f17 f18 8 of the analyzed samples are very poor water for drinking water class 4 2 2 water suitability for irrigation purposes the water quality used for irrigation is an important parameter for crop production and important to ensure that soil fertility is sustained and the environment preserved thus the physical and chemical properties of the soil such as its structure and permeability are very sensitive to the type of potentially exchangeable ions present in irrigation water generally irrigation water is determined by its mineral constituents and the type of plant and soil to be irrigated an identification of potential factors related to the quality of the water of the el oued superficial aquifer was carried out to assess its quality and its suitability for irrigation the irrigation water factors that appear to be most important in determining its quality are electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na kelly ratio kr permeability index pi magnesium hazard mh residual sodium carbonate rsc and chloride content mehdi et al 2014 ussl 1954 narsimha et al 2013 generally electrical conductivity ec is used to indicate the overall concentration of ionized constituents in natural water ec is closely correlated with the cations or anions total calculated by chemical analysis salinity changes the accessibility of water to crops because the osmotic pressure of soil water is increased by excess salts which reduces water absorption by plant roots and leads to physiological dryness there are three classes of conductivity classified by threshold values maynard and hochmuth 1997 the first class is no restriction for irrigation if conductivity is 750 μs cm the second class is light to medium restriction for irrigation if conductivity varies between 750 and 3000 μs cm and the third class is strong restriction for irrigation when conductivity is 3000 μs cm laboratory results show the waters of the shallow aquifer of el oued have a conductivity varying between 3334 μs cm and 47200 μs cm therefore these waters belong to the water class with high restriction ayers and westcot 1985 in comparison with the norm established by wilcox 1948 the surface water is also considered unsuitable for soil irrigation since it has an electrical conductivity of more than 2250 μs cm the sodium adsorption ratio sar was originally proposed by richards 1954 and is used to assess the tendency of na ions to adsorb to soil irrigation water with high sar levels can promote the accumulation of high levels of na in the soil over time which can adversely affect the rate of water infiltration into the soil due to soil dispersion in addition excessive sar levels can facilitate crusting in the soil and lead to poor aeration in addition high sodium content sar leads to the development of alkaline soil mousazadeh 2018 bouderbala et al 2017 rajau 2007 gupta 1987 the sar values calculated in the study area categorize the water of the shallow aquifer into three classes excellent 92 good 4 and inadequate 4 sar is also plotted as a function of ec according to the richards diagram 1954 in which ec is considered a salinity hazard and sar is considered a sodium hazard alkalinity the sar ec diagram fig 7 shows that a sample f17 is in class c4s1 indicating water with a very high salinity and a low sodium adsorption rate this sample could be suitable for plants with a good salt tolerance that limits their suitability for irrigation especially in soils with restricted drainage seventeen samples f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f8 f9 f10 f11 f12 f14 f15 f16 f18 f19 f20 and f24 or 68 of the samples belong to the c4s2 class indicating a very high salinity and an average sodium adsorption rate these samples are moderate sar and can be used to irrigate salt tolerant and semi tolerant crops under favorable drainage conditions four water samples f1 f7 f13 and f23 or 16 of the samples fall into the c4s3 class indicating water that is not suitable for irrigation but can be used in very permeable soil with good leaching for salt tolerant plants in addition three samples f21 f22 and f25 or 12 of the samples show very high conductivity ec 10 000 μs cm and or very high sar 32 indicating extremely salty water with very high levels of sodium which is unsatisfactory for irrigation the high salinity is due to very arid climatic conditions producing high evaporation which concentrates the soil solution saibi et al 2009 cheverry et al 1998 the risk of sodium in irrigation is also calculated using the sodium percentage na high sodium content has extremely adverse effects on the soil such as reduced soil permeability water infiltration problems and the risk of cation exchange with soil calcium and magnesium which further increases the sodium content of the soil todd et al 2004 high sodium content also causes leaf scorch and dead tissue along the outer edges of leaves in plants ayers 1977 calculated values in the study area range from 20 99 to 56 85 with an average of 33 12 according to the classification of eaton 1950 table 4 the groundwater of the shallow aquifer can be safely used in irrigation kelly ratio kr is another important parameter used here to examine groundwater quality and suitability for irrigation through considering sodium concentration a kelly ratio kelly 1963 of less than 1 is considered suitable for irrigation a kelly index between 1 and 2 is considered marginally suitable and a kelly ratio greater than 2 is unsuitable for irrigation because it indicates the presence of high sodium concentration the values calculated in the study area table 4 vary between 0 27 and 1 38 with an average of 0 53 according to the kr values obtained the samples from 24 wells are suitable for irrigation and one well is classified as marginally suitable for irrigation table 4 the permeability index pi of doneen 1964 is a standard developed to estimate the suitability of water for irrigation this index is strongly influenced by the concentration of sodium calcium magnesium and bicarbonate equation 4 three classes of pi were determined by raghunath 1987 class i is safe for irrigation which has a maximum permeability of 100 class ii is moderate for irrigation which has a 75 maximum permeability class iii is unsafe for irrigation which has a 25 maximum permeability in the study area the values of the permeability index vary between 25 05 and 58 30 with an average of 37 57 therefore the groundwater of the shallow aquifer of the study area is moderate for irrigation magnesium and calcium concentrations in groundwater also play a key role in determining the quality of groundwater for irrigation raghunath 1987 developed the magnesium mh risk ratio to examine these concentrations with respect to irrigation suitability classified as either suitable and unsuitable values below 50 are suitable and values above 50 are unsuitable for irrigation purposes as they decrease crop yield because the soils become more alkaline the values calculated in the study area table 4 ranged from 7 11 to 63 95 with only 60 of the water samples tested being suitable for irrigation in addition the level of bicarbonate ions hco3 in irrigation water was assessed if irrigation water contains high levels of bicarbonates there is a tendency for calcium and magnesium precipitation to occur which increases sar leading to soil infertility due to the increase calcium and magnesium concentration eaton 1950 determined irrigation water to be inadequate for irrigation when the residual sodium carbonate rsc concentration is greater than 2 5 meq l when rsc is between 1 25 and 2 5 meq l the water doubtful for irrigation whereas when rsc is less than 1 25 meq l the water is considered good for irrigation in the present study the calculated rsc values vary between 295 48 and 18 74 meq l so all the water samples analyzed 100 are of good quality for irrigation toxicity occurs if certain constituents ions in the water are absorbed by the plant and accumulate in high enough concentrations to damage crops or reduce crop yields among the ions of greatest concern is chloride which is the most common source of toxicity in irrigation water bachir et al 2017 when chloride concentration is high it can cause toxicity to sensitive crops its toxic effects are immediately manifested by burning or death of leaf tissue chloride toxicity initially damages the leaf tips of plants and progresses backwards along the edges as gravity increases if the chloride concentration is very high early leaf fall is observed ayers and westcot 1985 in general water with a chloride concentration of less than 140 mg l is considered good quality for irrigation simsek et al 2007 the chloride concentration in the groundwater of the shallow aquifer of el oued varies between 240 mg l f17 and 13650 mg l f21 with the exception of well f17 wells which has a moderate degree of chloride toxicity 240 mg l all wells tested have high chloride toxicity 350 mg l ayers and westcot 1985 and are therefore considered unacceptable for irrigation 4 3 statistical analysis a statistical analysis was carried out with 12 variables ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 cl no3 t ph tds and ec for the twenty five samples taken from the el oued water table the correlation matrix of chemical elements table 5 shows several significant positive correlations between the different ions ca2 vs so4 2 na vs cl k vs cl ca 2 vs cl k vs so4 2 et na vs so4 2 these correlations emphasize to the influence of evaporation on water chemistry on the other hand magnesium is weakly correlated with calcium r 0 5 which suggests water irrigation suitability is more closely controlled by the evaporites than that of the carbonates which is due to the low solubility of the latter compared to the evaporitic minerals ben alaya et al 2014 and also to the quasi absence of carbonates calcite and dolomite in the surface water table of the study area in the form of cement in sandstones the principal component analysis pca based on the 12 previously described parameters was limited to two factors f1 and f2 which explain 85 79 of the total variance the projection of the variables onto the f1 f2 plane fig 8 a shows that the f1 factor accounts for 71 23 of the total variance it is considered a major factor in water mineralization since it is highly correlated with most of the major elements ca2 na k so4 2 cl this indicates that the interaction of the waters with the surrounding rock particularly the evaporites nacl kcl cacl2 kcl caso42h2o and na2so4 played an important role in the concentration of water salinity ghebouli 2010 conversely the f1 axis when comparing nitrate with the rest of the major elements reflects the result of anthropogenic processes in particular nitrate contamination linked to the application of chemical fertilizers in agricultural areas and the infiltration of domestic wastewater due to the virtual absence of the sewerage network the f2 factor accounts for 14 56 of the total variance opposing magnesium mg and bicarbonate hco3 against the rest of the major elements which highlights the impact of mixing of deep groundwater ct and ci on the chemistry of the surface aquifer water the location of the water samples in the space of individuals fig 8b shows the complexity of the phenomena involved in the mineralization of the shallow aquifer of el oued two groups have been identified the first group is located on the positive side of axis f1 and groups together the samples of very high conductivity ec 7700 μs cm showing the relatively important influence of the phenomenon of evaporation on the chemistry of the surface aquifer water these samples represent the observation wells carried out in wet ghouts with a static level of less than 1 m the second group is placed on the negative side of the f1 axis and groups samples with conductivity lower than 7700 μs cm alassane et al 2015 4 4 salt load acquisition mechanism the lithology usually controls the concentration of the dissolved ions in groundwater schoeller 1962 with secondary influences of groundwater flow rate natural geochemical reactions human activities and mixing with deep groundwater ct and ci the study of the correlations established between the concentrations of the main major elements ca2 so4 2 na and cl and total dissolved solids tds fig 9 facilitated tracing the origin of water mineralization the presence of a positive correlation between these ions and tds reflects the participation of these elements in the acquisition of the saline load of groundwater and indicates the presence of a common source of mineralization which can only be the dissolution of evaporites such as halite and gypsum abid et al 2009 appelo and postma 1994 farid et al 2012 bahir et al 2020 in addition different mechanisms that contribute to the mineralization of groundwater in the shallow aquifer were studied by using binary diagrams between the major elements fig 10 the na vs cl diagram fig 10a shows a good correlation r 0 98 between the na and cl ions where the majority of points align with the halite dissolution line confirming halite dissolution in the study area bahir et al 2020 this relationship is also confirmed by the existence of the sodium chloride facies some points show an excess of sodium while others an excess of chlorides this potential discrepancy can be explained by the existence of another origin of these ions the diagram ca2 vs cl fig 10b shows a proportional evolution of chlorides and calcium this relationship confirms the existence of the calcium chloride facies it should be noted that this abnormal facies is the result of the mixing of water from the superficial aquifer with deep aquifers ct and ci through infiltrated residual irrigation water under urban areas the diagram ca2 vs so4 2 fig 10c shows a proportional evolution of sulfate and calcium r 0 98 this relationship reflects the dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite however the majority of the points are positioned below the straight line of gypsum dissolution through an excess of sulfate this excess of sulfate indicates the existence of an origin of so4 2 other than gypsum and anhydrite the lower ca2 can also be attributed to the phenomenon of base exchange by which ca2 is adsorbed on the surface of clay minerals against the release of na the na vs so4 2 diagram fig 10d shows a proportional evolution of sulfate and sodium r 0 97 however sulfate is in excess relative to sodium indicating a sulfate origin other than gypsum and anhydrite the excess sulfate is probably from the dissolution of the thenardite na2so4 whose deposition is favoured particularly in arid regions garrett 2001 kraiem et al 2014 this relationship also confirms the existence of the sodium sulfate facies of 36 of the water points analyzed the bivariate plot of na vs ca2 fig 10e separate the water into two classes one group contains a simultaneous evolution of sodium and calcium indicating that these two ions are subject to the effect of evaporite dissolution the second group is formed by the points where the decrease of calcium is observed while sodium remains increase which can be explained by the process of base exchange by which ca2 ions are absorbed on the surface of clay minerals releasing na or by the precipitation of gypsum which is less soluble than halite the diagram so4 2 vs cl fig 10f allows verification of the relationship between these two elements so4 2 and cl which produce the two dominant facies chloride and sulfate the graph shows a scattering of points which indicate a proportional evolution of the two elements and suggest a common saliferous origin in addition the graph shows that some points are characterized by an excess of sulfate and others by an excess of chlorides this reflects the dominance of one facies over the other indeed when the conductivity is less than 10000 μs cm the water points have a ratio so4 2 cl greater than 1 indicating an essentially gypsum origin which confirms the dominance of the calcium and sodium sulfate facies however when the conductivity is greater than 10000 μs cm water points f21 f22 and f25 have values of the ratio so4 2 cl lower than 1 indicating origins other than gypsum in which case the water is saturated with gypsum and anhydrite table 3 a gibb s diagram 1970 was produced to determine the processes controlling the mineralization of the waters of the el oued shallow aquifer this diagram shows three areas to which the different categories of water belong fig 11 the first domain is that of waters influenced by water rock interaction processes the second domain shows the waters influenced by evaporation phenomena the third area is that of waters influenced by precipitation the projection of the analyzed water samples shows that they are dominated by evaporation thise result is confirmed by the field data where the static level of 60 of the measured wells is at minus 4 m which favours water evaporation especially in summertime intense evaporation leads to the concentration of salts dissolved in water up to saturation saturation index calculations of calcite and dolomite fig 12 by the phreeqc software show different degrees of saturation the calcite saturation index varies from 0 27 to 2 49 and the dolomite saturation index varies from 0 46 to 4 04 these results suggest most of the water withdrawn from the shallow aquifer is saturated with these minerals evaporite minerals show lower degrees of saturation than carbonate minerals gypsum indices vary from 0 65 to 1 05 where 8 of the water points analyzed did not reach saturation followed by anhydrite whose index varies from 0 86 to 0 87 92 of the wells are undersaturated finally halite shows indices ranging from 6 16 to 2 74 i e under saturated the depletion of calcium relative to sulfate observed in the ca2 vs so4 2 diagram fig 10c can be attributed to the base exchange phenomenon whereby ca2 is adsorbed on the surface of clay minerals against the release of na this base exchange between groundwater and the sandy clay and sandy clayey formations of the aquifer is evidenced by the relationship mg2 ca2 so4 2 hco3 as a function of na k cl fig 13 garcia et al 2001 this relationship makes it possible to eliminate the ions due to the dissolution of halite anhydrite and gypsum which are particularly abundant in the reservoir of the el oued superficial aquifer in the absence of the base exchange phenomena all water points sampled must be located near the point of origin mc lean et al 2000 fig 13 shows that all samples fall below the line described by y x on a plot of mg ca so4 hco3 against na k cl which favors the base exchange process this indicates that the ca2 and mg2 ions in the water was exchanged for the na and k ions in the clay fraction of the aquifer however a group of three points f21 f22 and f25 stand out on the diagram with a so4 2 cl ratio less than 1 these samples are supersaturated in gypsum and anhydrite fig 12 as a consequence of the arid climate and the shallow depth of the aquifer 0 40 m 4 5 origins and spatial distribution of nitrates sources nitrate concentration in the groundwater varies between 0 mg l f25 and 247 5 mg l f11 80 of the twenty five boreholes analyzed far exceed the who acceptable limit 50 mg l who 2004 wccr 1991 the high spatial variability found in the study area is largely due to the heterogeneity of land use and the diversity of contaminants associated with agricultural activities salman et al 2019 elevated nitrate concentrations are indicative of anthropogenic pollution of urban or agricultural origin affecting the study area this result is demonstrated by subsequent studies on the origin of nitric and bacteriological pollution of the groundwater of the shallow aquifer in the study area bouselsal et al 2014 saibi et al 2009 bg 2002 oss 2003 nitrates show weak correlations with water depth fig 14 and with other major elements table 5 indeed the highest values seem to depend on land use bouselsal et al 2015 bg 2002 such as the immediate proximity of public toilets schools mosques etc this is the case of boreholes f3 f11 f14 f15 and f20 in urban areas bg 2002 boreholes f2 f3 f4 f10 and f19 in agricultural areas also show high nitrates values and are in close proximity to area use chicken manure brought from the northern regions batna and biskra for fertilizers bouselsal et al 2014 areas where the nitrate concentration is lower than 50 mg l include the south of kouinine f12 which is the result of dilution this result is demonstrated by subsequent studies on the origin of nitric and bacteriological pollution of the groundwater of the phreatic aquifers in the study area by water from deep captive aquifers ct and ci and in the flooded reed covered ghouts f22 f24 and f25 these studies show nitrate concentration is low as a result of the use of nitrates by plants for their growth and by complex in situ hydrochemical processes including denitrification anaerobic areas such as the el oued discharge f21 where the oxygen required for certain chemical reactions is no longer supplied by oxygen bg 2002 5 conclusion the shallow aquifer of el oued south east algeria is composed of sand sandstone clayey sand and gypsum of quaternary age the groundwater flow direction is generally from south to north this geochemical study of the waters assessed the quality of the waters intended for drinking water supply and irrigation and highlights different geochemical processes that contribute to the mineralization of these waters the chemical analysis shows that the shallow aquifer contains three facies of water cl na ca 12 so4 na 36 and so4 ca mg 52 the salinity of the waters is very high varying between 3 256 g l f17 and 46 100 g l f21 with an average of 7 427 g l the drinking water quality assessment was initially conducted by comparing the physicochemical parameters and major ions with world health organization who drinking water standards and algerian standards secondly the water quality index wqi method was used to report a single quality figure for each sample the results show that the water quality does not meet drinking water standards the shallow aquifer is highly mineralized and concentrations of major elements are often above recommended standards the water quality index wqi values calculated for the waters range from 242 to 3755 two water quality classes have been determined very poor 8 and unsuitable for drinking 92 water quality for irrigation purpose was assessed using the potential factors related to irrigation water quality namely electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio sar percent sodium na kelly ratio kr permeability index pi magnesium hazard mh residual sodium carbonate rcs and chloride content surface water in the study area is classified as ec very saline and unsuitable for irrigation 100 sar excellent 88 good 4 and unsuitable 8 sodium safe 100 kelly ratio suitable 96 and marginally suitable 4 pi moderate 100 mh acceptable 60 and unacceptable 40 rsc good quality for irrigation 100 and according to the risk of chloride toxicity moderate risk 4 and high risk 96 these results showed that the water of shallow aquifer is unsuitable for irrigation based on ec cl and ussl diagram moreover an analysis of the correlation matrix binary diagrams between the major elements and the gibbs diagram as well as calculations of the saturation indices of the main minerals showed that mineralization of the surface aquifer water is linked to the dissolution of evaporites gypsum and halite in particular mixing with deep water ct and ci the cation exchange phenomenon and pollution due to inputs from anthropogenic sources there is also strong evaporation caused by the shallow depth of the water table leading to excessive mineralization of the water and saturation of the water with carbonate minerals gypsum and anhydrite declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11841,the water quality of the aquifer of the el oued region algerian sahara is deteriorating in water quality due to anthropogenic effects and over exploitation of the groundwater resources this

this water twenty five water samples were collected the measured and analyzed parameters are ph ec tds na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 the assessment of water potability using the water quality

water of this shallow aquifer is unsuitable for irrigation based on ec cl and ussl diagram this aquifer discloses three facies of water cl na ca 12 so4 na 36 and so4 ca mg 52 in addition an analysis of physicochemical data obtained from water samples was conducted using correlation matrices pca bivariate plots and gibbs diagrams the saturation indices of the main minerals was also calculated these analyses have shown that the main reactions responsible for the evolution of water types in the el oued shallow aquifer fall into four categories 1 a mixing process in the waters of deep

introduction water quality is an important issue for the health of people all around the world hydrochemical analysis of sampled waters is the fundamental stage to understand the quality of waters surface and groundwater there are also other approaches and methods that can be used to understand the evolution of the quality of waters in space and time such us gis geographic information system geostatistical remote sensing mappings and geophysical methods electrical and electromagnetic techniques aju et al 2021 kadam et al 2022 jesiya and gopinath 2018 the shallow aquifer of the north east of the algerian sahara has long been used by the population for irrigation purposes and for the supply of drinking water ouarekh et al 2021 the increasing demand for water in the study region requires recourse to deep water resources the complexe terminal aquifer and the continental intercalaire aquifer however the significant increase in flows and their discharge directly into the superficial aquifer without any treatment in addition to the lack of a sewerage network and natural outlet have caused the groundwater level to rise to the surface the phenomenon of rising water levels has affected most of the regions of the north east sahara the basin of ouargla el oued and oued righ the consequences of this phenomenon are harmful for man and the environment such as the flooding of palm groves and their asphyxiation and contamination of the shallow aquifer by pollutants of urban and agricultural origin anrh 1993 bg 2004 remini et al 2006 bouselsal et al 2014 in addition there is high water mineralization caused by intense evaporation from the surface water or leaching of soluble formations from the unsaturated zone currently the degradation of water quality in the el oued superficial aquifer makes these resources less used for drinking water supply dws however these resources are still being exploited for irrigation which generates very important wealth for the population and gives the region its name of agricultural pole par excellence but this agricultural system is threatened with the risk of soil salinization and the degradation of its structure under conditions of population growth and an even faster increase in food needs the quality of water in the algerian sahara is still a national issue and a factor that impacts the demographic and economic development of southern algeria this study is mainly concentrated on evaluating the quality of the groundwater for the purposes of consumption and irrigation as well as to more closely understand the processes that resulted in the mineralization of the shallow aquifer in el oued this was done by interpreting the chemical data of 25 water samples collected from wells in study area the quality of the water as well as its suitability for human consumption was assessed using the water quality index wqi the wqi metric which uses different physicochemical parameters to estimate the quality of groundwater for a majority of residential purposes is the most widely utilized water quality standard in the world it is a simple and effective method for determining water quality and categorizing it in terms of its suitability for human consumption in addition the water quality and its suitability for irrigation was assessed by studying factors that have an influence on soils and plants these include its electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc potential salinity ps magnesium hazard mh kelly ratio kr and permeability index pi identifying the processes that controlled the mineralization of the water was accomplished by using a piper diagram a gibbs diagram bivariate plots principal component analysis pca and a pearson s correlation matrix analysis of the physicochemical data the results of this study are intended to be used to guide and improve the management of groundwater sources in el oued region 2 study area 2 1 geographical location and climate the study area fig 1 is part of the prefecture of el oued located in south eastern algeria it includes the most important urban centers of the wilaya which extends from the ogla in the south to kouinine in the north with agricultural areas on the eastern and western borders of the urban centers bouselsal 2016 the study area is located between latitudes 33 15 to 33 25 north and longitudes 6 45 to 7 00 east extending over an area of 500 km2 and with a population of around 250 000 inhabitants ons 2008 the study area is characterized by a hyper arid climate where the dry period is extended over the entire year results recorded at the guemar weather station over a 35 year period onm 1978 2012 recorded a mean annual rainfall in the region of 70 mm and a mean annual temperature of 28 4 c mean annual evapotranspiration calculated using the thornthwaite empirical formula is around 1164 mm with a maximum recorded in july 216 mm and a minimum recorded in january 9 4 mm the calculation of the water balance of the region shows that the effective rainfall recharge is negligible most shallow water recharge is done through the re infiltration of irrigation water and domestic wastewater under urban centers bouselsal et al 2015 the el oued region has undergone in recent years a constant expansion of its agricultural production making it one of the most important agricultural regions in the country it is considered among the leading date palm and potato producing regions this status of agricultural pole par excellence is reflected not only in the cultivation of potatoes and date palms which are the region s main vocations but also in the degree to which tobacco cultivation and market gardening have been achieved 2 2 geological and geomorphological context the field of study is a part of the northern sahara sedimentary basin whose extension covers an area of 780 000 km2 this basin constitutes an important topographic depression fig 2 which is underlain by a structural basin in the form of an asymmetrical syncline the sedimentary series is marked in the centre of the pit by important subvertical tectonic accidents bank dips are generally shallow with the exception of the edge zone in the northeast of the basin cornet 1964 busson 1967 castany 1982 this series comprises at its base palaeozoic marine formations surmounted in discordance by the continental formations of the secondary and tertiary which are several thousand metres thick busson 1970 the quaternary succeeded it the quaternary section is essentially composed of dune sands whose thickness can reach a few hundred metres only the upper series is of hydrogeological interest from a geomorphological point of view the study area is part of the large erg oriental which is characterized by a set of sand dunes the slope is generally oriented south north with altitude values ranging from 64 m to 120 m artificial troughs dug by the inhabitants to plant palm trees and vegetables called ghout can be seen here the latter symbolizes the shape taken by the traditional palm groves of oued souf the palm trees are planted in groups of 20 100 palm trees in the centre of an artificial basin 10 m deep and 80 200 m in diameter whose bottom has been brought to less than 1 m above the water table 2 3 hydrogeological context the el oued aquifer system is characterized by the superposition of three aquifers fig 2 unesco 1972 saibi et al 2009 these are from bottom to top the continental intercalaire ci aquifer the complexe terminal ct aquifer and the shallow aquifer the continental intercalaire ci aquifer is represented by lower cretaceous sandy sandstone and sandy clay continental deposits oss 2003 edmunds et al 2003 it is a multi layered aquifer system with a local roof depth of 1450 m and a thickness of between 400 and 460 m the boreholes capturing this aquifer are artesian intended for drinking water supply characterized by a flow rate of about 140 l s the aquifer of the complexe terminal includes the permeable bedrock of the senonian carbonate and the mio pliocene in fact it is possible to distinguish three aquifers separated locally by semi permeable or impermeable horizons these three aquifers are represented by the mio pliocene sands the first aquifer ct1 by the pontien sands sandstones and gravels the second aquifer ct2 and by the fissured limestone and carbonated eocene and senonian dolomite bouselsal 2016 limestone table ct3 the third aquifer top is at a depth of roughly 250 m and extends to 700 m the shallow aquifer fig 3 is unconfined and composed of quaternary age detrital formations represented by sands sandstones clayey sands and gypsum with bedrock consisting of clay and sandy clay the average depth of the bedrock is about 60 m senoussi et al 1992 meziani et al 2011 the piezometric map of the shallow aquifer for june 2017 fig 4 shows that the upstream part of the aquifer is located in the southwest with a height of nearly 76 m and the downstream part is located in the northeast with a height of 60 m the flow of the slick is generally from the sw to the ne the hydraulic gradient varies between 0 08 and 0 66 the urban centers el oued kouinine and nakhla and agricultural areas mehri soualah and nakhla gharbia plantations irrigated from the deep aquifers appear on the piezometric map as areas of divergence the latter form piezometric domes due to the rapid infiltration of urban water and irrigation water pumped from boreholes that capture the captive deep aquifers of the ct and the ci bg 2002 bouselsal et al 2014 remini et al 2011 zine et al 2017 on the other hand the agricultural areas khobna bayadha soualah and ogla irrigated from wells in the shallow aquifer depressions and the el oued discharge area appear on the map as convergence areas 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling twenty five water samples from wells in the el oued unconfined shallow aquifer fig 4 were collected and hydrochemical measurements were carried out in june 2017 the sampling points were selected to acquire data representative of the spatial variability of groundwater chemistry of the studied aquifer twenty one sampled water points are located in the agglomerations of el oued in the ghouts and cultivated areas between the dunes which are intensively irrigated by pivots in circular plots oss 2010 three sampled boreholes f22 f23 and f25 are located in flooded areas affected by the upwelling phenomenon meziani et al 2009 remini 2006 a fourth borehole f21 is located in the urban wastewater discharge area of the city of el oued 3 2 methods of analysis and reliability of results the physicochemical parameters were determined in situ immediately after sample collection using a portable multimeter these in situ measurements of conductivity accuracy of 0 5 of the measured value temperature accuracy of 0 1 c and ph accuracy of 0 1 ph unit were carried out using a multimeter of type hi 9829 the samples were collected using two polypropylene vials previously rinsed with the water to be sampled each sample was immediately filtered on site using 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filters the filtrates for the cations were collected in 250 ml polyethylene vials and immediately acidified to ph 2 by adding ultrapure nitric acid while the samples for the anions were not acidified all samples were stored in a cooler at a temperature below 4 c and transferred to the laboratory and kept in a refrigerator at a temperature below 4 c until they were analyzed within a maximum of five days analyses were carried out in the laboratory using standard techniques rodier 1996 nitrates sulphates and chlorides were determined using a dr2000 type spectrophotometer hach while calcium sodium and potassium were analyzed using a flame spectrophotometer 410 corning magnesium was determined by complexometry and deduced from the difference th ca2 the concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 were analyzed by titrimetry using a coloured indicator the calculation of the ionic balance of the results provides a secondary assessment on the reliability of the analyses performed the results obtained are of acceptable quality if the percentage of error is less than 5 this parameter expressed in is calculated according to the following equation 1 ionic balance σ cations σ anions σ cations σ anions 100 3 3 drinking and irrigation water quality the assessment of drinking water chemical quality was carried out firstly by comparison with the world health organization who guideline values and the algerian standards for drinking water table 1 and secondly by using the water quality index wqi method the water suitability for irrigation purpose was determined by studying the potential parameters related to the quality of irrigation water which are electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na kelly ratio rk permeability index pi magnesium hazard mh residual sodium carbonate rsc and chloride content these parameters were obtained using the following formulas panpan and al 2019 mokhtar et al 2021 ouarekh et al 2021 2 s a r n a c a m g 2 3 n a n a k 100 n a k c a

the comparison of the averages of the different parameters measured the maxima minima and standard deviation were determined to assess the chemical quality of the water with respect to the drinking water standards all the statistical evaluations were performed using xlstat 2014 for windows the principal component analysis pca was conducted to identify the most important factors controlling groundwater geochemistry twelve hydrochemical variables including ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 cl no3 t ph tds and ec and twenty five samples were processed using multivariate statistical techniques the values of the different variables table 1 were normalized prior to the multivariate analyses table 5 presents the matrix of correlation coefficients for hydrochemical data in the shallow aquifer of el oued the matrix of correlation coefficients indicates the extent to which the variance of each parameter can be explained by relationships with other constituents the diagonalization of the correlation matrix transforms the original correlated p variables into uncorrelated orthogonal p variables called principal components which are weighted linear combinations of the original variables alassane et al 2015 meglen 1992 the characteristic roots of the main components eigenvalues are a representation of their corresponding variances and the sum of the own values corresponds with the total number of variables the correlation of the principal components and the original variables is given by the loadings and the individual transformed observations are called scores eigenvalues and own vectors for the matrix of covariances were determined then the data were transformed into factors the factor scores are calculated for each sample by matrix multiplication of the coefficient of the factor score with the standardized data the value of each factor score at the sample site reflects the significance of a given factor a factor score 1 indicates an intense influence of the process very negative values 1 represent areas that are completely uninfluenced by the process and values close to zero represent areas with modest process impact 3 5 water chemistry a piper diagram was used to evaluate the hydrogeochemical nature of the groundwater samples the gibbs diagram 1970 was used to specify the probable origin of the major elements contributing to water mineralization in addition the hypothetical combination of salts kraiem et al 2014 farid et al 2012 trabelsi et al 2012 ben moussa et al 2008 was also used to estimate different assemblages of nacl cacl2 caso4 na2so4 etc and to determine the water types using the piper diagram this combination was based on the lithological nature of the aquifer and the climatic conditions of the study area phreeqc software was used to determine the acquisition mechanisms of the mineralization to determine the saturation indices for some minerals calcite dolomite gypsum anhydrite and halite and to verify the mineral solution equilibrium using the specific interaction theory sit i e the extension of the debye hückel law of scatchard and guggenheim recently incorporated in phreeqc sracek et al 2004 mukherjee et al 2008 parkhurst and appelo 1999 the most commonly used saturation index for groundwater bouhlassa et al 2008 is as follows 8 s i l o g i a p k s p where iap is the product of the activity of the ions concerned and ksp is the product of the solubility of the mineral in question water is in equilibrium with a mineral when si 0 it is undersaturated when si 0 and supersaturated when si 0 when a solution is undersaturated with respect to a mineral the mineral will tend to dissolve 4 results and discussion 4 1 salinity and chemical facies salinity refers to the total concentration of soluble ions in a water supply it is largely related to the amount of total dissolved solids tds in the solution the tds is determined by evaporating the filtered water sample to dryness then weighing the residue water containing more than 500 mg l tds is unsuitable for drinking and cannot be used for many industrial and agricultural applications the high concentration of tds in groundwater may be due to the presence of bicarbonates carbonates sulfates chlorides and calcium in the study area the salinity values range from 3 25 g l f 17 to 46 1 g l f 21 in total dissolved solids tds table 1 the low values are recorded in the southern part of the study area in the agricultural areas irrigated from boreholes tapping the ct aquifer mean salinity 2 4 g l where the infiltration of less mineralized irrigation water leads to the dilution of the surface aquifer water the highest values are recorded in the northern part increasing according to the direction of groundwater flow as well as in topographic depressions as a result of the high evaporation impacting the shallow water depths and in the area of discharge of untreated domestic and industrial wastewater from the city of el oued f 21 the piper 1944 diagram fig 5 was used to characterize the water in the shallow aquifer the representation of the results of chemical analyses of the sampled waters generally shows three water types 1 na ca cl type which accounts for 12 of the drill holes and shows very high mineralization ranging from 11 g l f 22 to 46 1 g l f 21 the high miniralization is due to the strong evaporation of water at a shallow depth less than 0 4 m and also to the rapid infiltration of wastewater at the f 21 drilling level which is located near the uncontrolled wastewater discharge area of the city of el oued 2 na so4 type which accounts for 36 of the samples these water show strong mineralization 4 48 6 64 g l which appears to be related to the dissolution of gypsum and halite 3 ca mg so4 type which accounts for 52 of the sampled points located in the southern part of the study area with an average mineralization ranging from 3 25 g l f 17 to 4 77 g l f 12 these different water types emphasize the complexity of the hydrochemical processes that control the salinity of the surface water of el oued bekkoussa et al 2013 4 2 water suitability for human consumption and irrigation purposes 4 2 1 water suitability for human consumption the chemical analysis results in table 1 show the variability and order of magnitude of the different physico chemical variables in the groundwater samples collected as well as the world health organization who and algerian alg std water potability standards joradp 2011 the main water quality problems appear to be salinity hardness and nitrate pollution groundwater is characterized by a very high salinity which varies between 3 25 g l f17 and 46 10 g l f21 these values far exceed the who drinking water standard of 1 5 g l the high concentrations of calcium and magnesium contribute to the increase in total water hardness which ranges from 1040 f17 to 15101 f21 mg l in caco3 thus groundwater is characterized as very hard water freeze 1979 sawyer and mccarty 1967 and not suitable for most domestic uses us epa 1999 sappa et al 2014 concentrations of the other major elements sodium potassium sulfate chloride and bicarbonate are often above recommended standards as well another major problem with the shallow water appears to be its high content of nitrogen compounds nitrate values exceed the potability limit 50 mg l bouselsal et al 2014 who 2004 in 80 of the wells analyzed table 1 there were five boreholes under the potability limit f12 f21 f22 f24 and f25 high nitrate concentrations are an indication of anthropogenic pollution of urban and agricultural origin affecting the study area bekkoussa et al 2013 kraiem et al 2014 given the results of this assessment the waters of the surface aquifer of el oued are interpreted as unsuitable for drinking water supply the second method used to determine the quality of drinking water is the water quality index wqi method this method is based on equation 9 and is used to summarize the large amount of water quality data into a single number horton 1965 brown et al 1970 štambuk giljanović 1999 abbasi 2002 hamlat and azeddine 2018 abbasnia et al 2018 the chemical data of the analyzed water samples were compared to the algerian standard for drinking water joradp 2011 which was taken into account for the calculation of the wqi table 2 three steps are necessary to calculate the wqi in the first step a weight wi is allocated to each of the 11 parameters according to their relative significance in the overall quality of drinking water mokhtar et al 2021 ouarekh et al 2021 values show in table 2 the second step is calculating the relative weight wi table 2 lists the calculated relative weight of the wi values of each parameter in the third step a quality scale qi is determined for each parameter by dividing its concentration in each water sample by its standard concentration prescribed by the algerian norm and the result is multiplied by 100 as follows 9 w q i s i i w i q i w i n i 1 w i c i s i 100 10 w i q i n i 1 q i where ci concentration of each parameter si limit value of each parameter set by algerian standards table 2 wi the weight of each parameter according to its relative importance in drinking water quality qi quality rating for each parameter table 2 wi the relative weight equation 9 sii the sub index of parameter i the calculated values of the water quality index wqi are then classified into the different water quality classes shown in table 3 al hadithi 2012 al mamun et al 2019 the wqi defines five water quality classes excellent good poor very poor and unsuitable for drinking the values of the water quality index wqi calculated for the shallow aquifer of el oued range from 242 to 3755 with an average of 616 two water quality classes were determined fig 6 92 of the samples are in unsuitable for drinking water class and two boreholes f17 f18 8 of the analyzed samples are very poor water for drinking water class 4 2 2 water suitability for irrigation purposes the water quality used for irrigation is an important parameter for crop production and important to ensure that soil fertility is sustained and the environment preserved thus the physical and chemical properties of the soil such as its structure and permeability are very sensitive to the type of potentially exchangeable ions present in irrigation water generally irrigation water is determined by its mineral constituents and the type of plant and soil to be irrigated an identification of potential factors related to the quality of the water of the el oued superficial aquifer was carried out to assess its quality and its suitability for irrigation the irrigation water factors that appear to be most important in determining its quality are electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na kelly ratio kr permeability index pi magnesium hazard mh residual sodium carbonate rsc and chloride content mehdi et al 2014 ussl 1954 narsimha et al 2013 generally electrical conductivity ec is used to indicate the overall concentration of ionized constituents in natural water ec is closely correlated with the cations or anions total calculated by chemical analysis salinity changes the accessibility of water to crops because the osmotic pressure of soil water is increased by excess salts which reduces water absorption by plant roots and leads to physiological dryness there are three classes of conductivity classified by threshold values maynard and hochmuth 1997 the first class is no restriction for irrigation if conductivity is 750 μs cm the second class is light to medium restriction for irrigation if conductivity varies between 750 and 3000 μs cm and the third class is strong restriction for irrigation when conductivity is 3000 μs cm laboratory results show the waters of the shallow aquifer of el oued have a conductivity varying between 3334 μs cm and 47200 μs cm therefore these waters belong to the water class with high restriction ayers and westcot 1985 in comparison with the norm established by wilcox 1948 the surface water is also considered unsuitable for soil irrigation since it has an electrical conductivity of more than 2250 μs cm the sodium adsorption ratio sar was originally proposed by richards 1954 and is used to assess the tendency of na ions to adsorb to soil irrigation water with high sar levels can promote the accumulation of high levels of na in the soil over time which can adversely affect the rate of water infiltration into the soil due to soil dispersion in addition excessive sar levels can facilitate crusting in the soil and lead to poor aeration in addition high sodium content sar leads to the development of alkaline soil mousazadeh 2018 bouderbala et al 2017 rajau 2007 gupta 1987 the sar values calculated in the study area categorize the water of the shallow aquifer into three classes excellent 92 good 4 and inadequate 4 sar is also plotted as a function of ec according to the richards diagram 1954 in which ec is considered a salinity hazard and sar is considered a sodium hazard alkalinity the sar ec diagram fig 7 shows that a sample f17 is in class c4s1 indicating water with a very high salinity and a low sodium adsorption rate this sample could be suitable for plants with a good salt tolerance that limits their suitability for irrigation especially in soils with restricted drainage seventeen samples f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f8 f9 f10 f11 f12 f14 f15 f16 f18 f19 f20 and f24 or 68 of the samples belong to the c4s2 class indicating a very high salinity and an average sodium adsorption rate these samples are moderate sar and can be used to irrigate salt tolerant and semi tolerant crops under favorable drainage conditions four water samples f1 f7 f13 and f23 or 16 of the samples fall into the c4s3 class indicating water that is not suitable for irrigation but can be used in very permeable soil with good leaching for salt tolerant plants in addition three samples f21 f22 and f25 or 12 of the samples show very high conductivity ec 10 000 μs cm and or very high sar 32 indicating extremely salty water with very high levels of sodium which is unsatisfactory for irrigation the high salinity is due to very arid climatic conditions producing high evaporation which concentrates the soil solution saibi et al 2009 cheverry et al 1998 the risk of sodium in irrigation is also calculated using the sodium percentage na high sodium content has extremely adverse effects on the soil such as reduced soil permeability water infiltration problems and the risk of cation exchange with soil calcium and magnesium which further increases the sodium content of the soil todd et al 2004 high sodium content also causes leaf scorch and dead tissue along the outer edges of leaves in plants ayers 1977 calculated values in the study area range from 20 99 to 56 85 with an average of 33 12 according to the classification of eaton 1950 table 4 the groundwater of the shallow aquifer can be safely used in irrigation kelly ratio kr is another important parameter used here to examine groundwater quality and suitability for irrigation through considering sodium concentration a kelly ratio kelly 1963 of less than 1 is considered suitable for irrigation a kelly index between 1 and 2 is considered marginally suitable and a kelly ratio greater than 2 is unsuitable for irrigation because it indicates the presence of high sodium concentration the values calculated in the study area table 4 vary between 0 27 and 1 38 with an average of 0 53 according to the kr values obtained the samples from 24 wells are suitable for irrigation and one well is classified as marginally suitable for irrigation table 4 the permeability index pi of doneen 1964 is a standard developed to estimate the suitability of water for irrigation this index is strongly influenced by the concentration of sodium calcium magnesium and bicarbonate equation 4 three classes of pi were determined by raghunath 1987 class i is safe for irrigation which has a maximum permeability of 100 class ii is moderate for irrigation which has a 75 maximum permeability class iii is unsafe for irrigation which has a 25 maximum permeability in the study area the values of the permeability index vary between 25 05 and 58 30 with an average of 37 57 therefore the groundwater of the shallow aquifer of the study area is moderate for irrigation magnesium and calcium concentrations in groundwater also play a key role in determining the quality of groundwater for irrigation raghunath 1987 developed the magnesium mh risk ratio to examine these concentrations with respect to irrigation suitability classified as either suitable and unsuitable values below 50 are suitable and values above 50 are unsuitable for irrigation purposes as they decrease crop yield because the soils become more alkaline the values calculated in the study area table 4 ranged from 7 11 to 63 95 with only 60 of the water samples tested being suitable for irrigation in addition the level of bicarbonate ions hco3 in irrigation water was assessed if irrigation water contains high levels of bicarbonates there is a tendency for calcium and magnesium precipitation to occur which increases sar leading to soil infertility due to the increase calcium and magnesium concentration eaton 1950 determined irrigation water to be inadequate for irrigation when the residual sodium carbonate rsc concentration is greater than 2 5 meq l when rsc is between 1 25 and 2 5 meq l the water doubtful for irrigation whereas when rsc is less than 1 25 meq l the water is considered good for irrigation in the present study the calculated rsc values vary between 295 48 and 18 74 meq l so all the water samples analyzed 100 are of good quality for irrigation toxicity occurs if certain constituents ions in the water are absorbed by the plant and accumulate in high enough concentrations to damage crops or reduce crop yields among the ions of greatest concern is chloride which is the most common source of toxicity in irrigation water bachir et al 2017 when chloride concentration is high it can cause toxicity to sensitive crops its toxic effects are immediately manifested by burning or death of leaf tissue chloride toxicity initially damages the leaf tips of plants and progresses backwards along the edges as gravity increases if the chloride concentration is very high early leaf fall is observed ayers and westcot 1985 in general water with a chloride concentration of less than 140 mg l is considered good quality for irrigation simsek et al 2007 the chloride concentration in the groundwater of the shallow aquifer of el oued varies between 240 mg l f17 and 13650 mg l f21 with the exception of well f17 wells which has a moderate degree of chloride toxicity 240 mg l all wells tested have high chloride toxicity 350 mg l ayers and westcot 1985 and are therefore considered unacceptable for irrigation 4 3 statistical analysis a statistical analysis was carried out with 12 variables ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 cl no3 t ph tds and ec for the twenty five samples taken from the el oued water table the correlation matrix of chemical elements table 5 shows several significant positive correlations between the different ions ca2 vs so4 2 na vs cl k vs cl ca 2 vs cl k vs so4 2 et na vs so4 2 these correlations emphasize to the influence of evaporation on water chemistry on the other hand magnesium is weakly correlated with calcium r 0 5 which suggests water irrigation suitability is more closely controlled by the evaporites than that of the carbonates which is due to the low solubility of the latter compared to the evaporitic minerals ben alaya et al 2014 and also to the quasi absence of carbonates calcite and dolomite in the surface water table of the study area in the form of cement in sandstones the principal component analysis pca based on the 12 previously described parameters was limited to two factors f1 and f2 which explain 85 79 of the total variance the projection of the variables onto the f1 f2 plane fig 8 a shows that the f1 factor accounts for 71 23 of the total variance it is considered a major factor in water mineralization since it is highly correlated with most of the major elements ca2 na k so4 2 cl this indicates that the interaction of the waters with the surrounding rock particularly the evaporites nacl kcl cacl2 kcl caso42h2o and na2so4 played an important role in the concentration of water salinity ghebouli 2010 conversely the f1 axis when comparing nitrate with the rest of the major elements reflects the result of anthropogenic processes in particular nitrate contamination linked to the application of chemical fertilizers in agricultural areas and the infiltration of domestic wastewater due to the virtual absence of the sewerage network the f2 factor accounts for 14 56 of the total variance opposing magnesium mg and bicarbonate hco3 against the rest of the major elements which highlights the impact of mixing of deep groundwater ct and ci on the chemistry of the surface aquifer water the location of the water samples in the space of individuals fig 8b shows the complexity of the phenomena involved in the mineralization of the shallow aquifer of el oued two groups have been identified the first group is located on the positive side of axis f1 and groups together the samples of very high conductivity ec 7700 μs cm showing the relatively important influence of the phenomenon of evaporation on the chemistry of the surface aquifer water these samples represent the observation wells carried out in wet ghouts with a static level of less than 1 m the second group is placed on the negative side of the f1 axis and groups samples with conductivity lower than 7700 μs cm alassane et al 2015 4 4 salt load acquisition mechanism the lithology usually controls the concentration of the dissolved ions in groundwater schoeller 1962 with secondary influences of groundwater flow rate natural geochemical reactions human activities and mixing with deep groundwater ct and ci the study of the correlations established between the concentrations of the main major elements ca2 so4 2 na and cl and total dissolved solids tds fig 9 facilitated tracing the origin of water mineralization the presence of a positive correlation between these ions and tds reflects the participation of these elements in the acquisition of the saline load of groundwater and indicates the presence of a common source of mineralization which can only be the dissolution of evaporites such as halite and gypsum abid et al 2009 appelo and postma 1994 farid et al 2012 bahir et al 2020 in addition different mechanisms that contribute to the mineralization of groundwater in the shallow aquifer were studied by using binary diagrams between the major elements fig 10 the na vs cl diagram fig 10a shows a good correlation r 0 98 between the na and cl ions where the majority of points align with the halite dissolution line confirming halite dissolution in the study area bahir et al 2020 this relationship is also confirmed by the existence of the sodium chloride facies some points show an excess of sodium while others an excess of chlorides this potential discrepancy can be explained by the existence of another origin of these ions the diagram ca2 vs cl fig 10b shows a proportional evolution of chlorides and calcium this relationship confirms the existence of the calcium chloride facies it should be noted that this abnormal facies is the result of the mixing of water from the superficial aquifer with deep aquifers ct and ci through infiltrated residual irrigation water under urban areas the diagram ca2 vs so4 2 fig 10c shows a proportional evolution of sulfate and calcium r 0 98 this relationship reflects the dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite however the majority of the points are positioned below the straight line of gypsum dissolution through an excess of sulfate this excess of sulfate indicates the existence of an origin of so4 2 other than gypsum and anhydrite the lower ca2 can also be attributed to the phenomenon of base exchange by which ca2 is adsorbed on the surface of clay minerals against the release of na the na vs so4 2 diagram fig 10d shows a proportional evolution of sulfate and sodium r 0 97 however sulfate is in excess relative to sodium indicating a sulfate origin other than gypsum and anhydrite the excess sulfate is probably from the dissolution of the thenardite na2so4 whose deposition is favoured particularly in arid regions garrett 2001 kraiem et al 2014 this relationship also confirms the existence of the sodium sulfate facies of 36 of the water points analyzed the bivariate plot of na vs ca2 fig 10e separate the water into two classes one group contains a simultaneous evolution of sodium and calcium indicating that these two ions are subject to the effect of evaporite dissolution the second group is formed by the points where the decrease of calcium is observed while sodium remains increase which can be explained by the process of base exchange by which ca2 ions are absorbed on the surface of clay minerals releasing na or by the precipitation of gypsum which is less soluble than halite the diagram so4 2 vs cl fig 10f allows verification of the relationship between these two elements so4 2 and cl which produce the two dominant facies chloride and sulfate the graph shows a scattering of points which indicate a proportional evolution of the two elements and suggest a common saliferous origin in addition the graph shows that some points are characterized by an excess of sulfate and others by an excess of chlorides this reflects the dominance of one facies over the other indeed when the conductivity is less than 10000 μs cm the water points have a ratio so4 2 cl greater than 1 indicating an essentially gypsum origin which confirms the dominance of the calcium and sodium sulfate facies however when the conductivity is greater than 10000 μs cm water points f21 f22 and f25 have values of the ratio so4 2 cl lower than 1 indicating origins other than gypsum in which case the water is saturated with gypsum and anhydrite table 3 a gibb s diagram 1970 was produced to determine the processes controlling the mineralization of the waters of the el oued shallow aquifer this diagram shows three areas to which the different categories of water belong fig 11 the first domain is that of waters influenced by water rock interaction processes the second domain shows the waters influenced by evaporation phenomena the third area is that of waters influenced by precipitation the projection of the analyzed water samples shows that they are dominated by evaporation thise result is confirmed by the field data where the static level of 60 of the measured wells is at minus 4 m which favours water evaporation especially in summertime intense evaporation leads to the concentration of salts dissolved in water up to saturation saturation index calculations of calcite and dolomite fig 12 by the phreeqc software show different degrees of saturation the calcite saturation index varies from 0 27 to 2 49 and the dolomite saturation index varies from 0 46 to 4 04 these results suggest most of the water withdrawn from the shallow aquifer is saturated with these minerals evaporite minerals show lower degrees of saturation than carbonate minerals gypsum indices vary from 0 65 to 1 05 where 8 of the water points analyzed did not reach saturation followed by anhydrite whose index varies from 0 86 to 0 87 92 of the wells are undersaturated finally halite shows indices ranging from 6 16 to 2 74 i e under saturated the depletion of calcium relative to sulfate observed in the ca2 vs so4 2 diagram fig 10c can be attributed to the base exchange phenomenon whereby ca2 is adsorbed on the surface of clay minerals against the release of na this base exchange between groundwater and the sandy clay and sandy clayey formations of the aquifer is evidenced by the relationship mg2 ca2 so4 2 hco3 as a function of na k cl fig 13 garcia et al 2001 this relationship makes it possible to eliminate the ions due to the dissolution of halite anhydrite and gypsum which are particularly abundant in the reservoir of the el oued superficial aquifer in the absence of the base exchange phenomena all water points sampled must be located near the point of origin mc lean et al 2000 fig 13 shows that all samples fall below the line described by y x on a plot of mg ca so4 hco3 against na k cl which favors the base exchange process this indicates that the ca2 and mg2 ions in the water was exchanged for the na and k ions in the clay fraction of the aquifer however a group of three points f21 f22 and f25 stand out on the diagram with a so4 2 cl ratio less than 1 these samples are supersaturated in gypsum and anhydrite fig 12 as a consequence of the arid climate and the shallow depth of the aquifer 0 40 m 4 5 origins and spatial distribution of nitrates sources nitrate concentration in the groundwater varies between 0 mg l f25 and 247 5 mg l f11 80 of the twenty five boreholes analyzed far exceed the who acceptable limit 50 mg l who 2004 wccr 1991 the high spatial variability found in the study area is largely due to the heterogeneity of land use and the diversity of contaminants associated with agricultural activities salman et al 2019 elevated nitrate concentrations are indicative of anthropogenic pollution of urban or agricultural origin affecting the study area this result is demonstrated by subsequent studies on the origin of nitric and bacteriological pollution of the groundwater of the shallow aquifer in the study area bouselsal et al 2014 saibi et al 2009 bg 2002 oss 2003 nitrates show weak correlations with water depth fig 14 and with other major elements table 5 indeed the highest values seem to depend on land use bouselsal et al 2015 bg 2002 such as the immediate proximity of public toilets schools mosques etc this is the case of boreholes f3 f11 f14 f15 and f20 in urban areas bg 2002 boreholes f2 f3 f4 f10 and f19 in agricultural areas also show high nitrates values and are in close proximity to area use chicken manure brought from the northern regions batna and biskra for fertilizers bouselsal et al 2014 areas where the nitrate concentration is lower than 50 mg l include the south of kouinine f12 which is the result of dilution this result is demonstrated by subsequent studies on the origin of nitric and bacteriological pollution of the groundwater of the phreatic aquifers in the study area by water from deep captive aquifers ct and ci and in the flooded reed covered ghouts f22 f24 and f25 these studies show nitrate concentration is low as a result of the use of nitrates by plants for their growth and by complex in situ hydrochemical processes including denitrification anaerobic areas such as the el oued discharge f21 where the oxygen required for certain chemical reactions is no longer supplied by oxygen bg 2002 5 conclusion the shallow aquifer of el oued south east algeria is composed of sand sandstone clayey sand and gypsum of quaternary age the groundwater flow direction is generally from south to north this geochemical study of the waters assessed the quality of the waters intended for drinking water supply and irrigation and highlights different geochemical processes that contribute to the mineralization of these waters the chemical analysis shows that the shallow aquifer contains three facies of water cl na ca 12 so4 na 36 and so4 ca mg 52 the salinity of the waters is very high varying between 3 256 g l f17 and 46 100 g l f21 with an average of 7 427 g l the drinking water quality assessment was initially conducted by comparing the physicochemical parameters and major ions with world health organization who drinking water standards and algerian standards secondly the water quality index wqi method was used to report a single quality figure for each sample the results show that the water quality does not meet drinking water standards the shallow aquifer is highly mineralized and concentrations of major elements are often above recommended standards the water quality index wqi values calculated for the waters range from 242 to 3755 two water quality classes have been determined very poor 8 and unsuitable for drinking 92 water quality for irrigation purpose was assessed using the potential factors related to irrigation water quality namely electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio sar percent sodium na kelly ratio kr permeability index pi magnesium hazard mh residual sodium carbonate rcs and chloride content surface water in the study area is classified as ec very saline and unsuitable for irrigation 100 sar excellent 88 good 4 and unsuitable 8 sodium safe 100 kelly ratio suitable 96 and marginally suitable 4 pi moderate 100 mh acceptable 60 and unacceptable 40 rsc good quality for irrigation 100 and according to the risk of chloride toxicity moderate risk 4 and high risk 96 these results showed that the water of shallow aquifer is unsuitable for irrigation based on ec cl and ussl diagram moreover an analysis of the correlation matrix binary diagrams between the major elements and the gibbs diagram as well as calculations of the saturation indices of the main minerals showed that mineralization of the surface aquifer water is linked to the dissolution of evaporites gypsum and halite in particular mixing with deep water ct and ci the cation exchange phenomenon and pollution due to inputs from anthropogenic sources there is also strong evaporation caused by the shallow depth of the water table leading to excessive mineralization of the water and saturation of the water with carbonate minerals gypsum and anhydrite declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11842,the primary intend of this research is to determine the standard drinking water quality build upon on the pollution index of groundwater pig and health risk index for this fifty groundwater samples were chosen and determined for chief cations anions in the southwestern part of cuddapah basin sw maximum samples are under the allowable level of w h o standards except fluoride and nitrate concentrations around 60 and 62 5 of the groundwater surpass the allowable range 1 5 mg l of fluoride and nitrate 45 mg l respectively as a result groundwater is not potable due to fluoride and nitrate levels and a health risk assessment was conducted in this area from the pig values 80 of the samples fall under insignificant pollution category nitrate pollution index value shows that 88 of the groundwater polluted with high nitrate content as per national guide lines for drinking purpose as per usepa guidelines non carcinogenic effect of nitrate and fluoride in this region vary from 0 01 to 14 48 adults 0 02 14 68 children 0 01 11 8 infants while 92 5 92 5 80 of groundwater is surpass the recommended value 1 of thi for adults children and infants higher fluoride concentration may be due to geogenic and higher levels of nitrate concentration may be due to human induced activities including fertilizers industrial effluent and service pipe leakage the predominant geochemical processes in this region are weathering ion exchange and to reduce fluoride and nitrate contaminated in water intake in the research area precautions should be adopted graphical abstract image 1 keywords human health risk assessment hhra nitrate pollution index pollution index of groundwater inactive mines 1 introduction in many countries such as india mine pollution has become a serious environmental problem mining activity creates an inactive abandoned mine lands aml it causes prolonged effects on physical chemical biological social system of the natural system mavarommatis 2017 in view of this most developing countries are facing environmental mhlongo 2016 the environmental concern related to the mining activity is more intense and apparent in the case of mine are inactive or abandoned mavrommatis 2017 high levels of nutrients in the groundwater table can cause drinking water to become toxic toxic ions such as fluorine and nitrates are enter into aquifers and may accumulate in crops and might have severe threat on health of humans davies 1983 subsurface water is used extensively for domestic and agricultural purposes in semi arid regions around the world therefore drinking water standards are directly related to public health bhattacharya et al 2015 sisanda et al 2020 li and qian 2018 sunitha et al 2012a as a result it is crucial to watch the quality of water systematically among them the groundwater quality is the main concern because this drinking water must be free of harmful elements if the drinking water contains excessive of mineral contents biological and non biological substances it may affect human health quino limo et al 2020 muralidhar reddy et al 2013 on a global scale the pollution of groundwater by f and no3 has developed into a significant health issue for the past two decades given their significance these work has been conducted in arid semi arid regions around the globe ajaykumar et al 2019 narasimha and wang 2018 wu et al 2015 ghaderpoori et al 2018 jafari et al 2014 massoudinejad et al 2016 sunitha et al 2016 sunitha and muralidharareddy 2018 the existence of f ions in potable water up to 1 0 mg l is advantage to children s health because it facilitates the production of caries resistant dental enamel the existence of f ions in potable water up to 1 0 mg l has been shown to be detrimental to human and animal physiology aside from a few beneficial effects the toxic effects on teeth include chalky white patches pitting and chipped off tips as well as premature tooth loss skeletal defects and joint pain occur at concentrations greater than 2 3 mg l concentrations of fluoride are relatively high all over the world especially in parts of india china south central africa and united states of america which have a profound impact on human health sunkaria et al 2020 susheela 1993 shahriari et al 2010 the concentration of fluoride is governed by a variety of factors such as availability of fluoride bearing rocks rock composition the mechanism of rock water interaction evaporation mineral dissolution etc narasimha and wang 2018 fluorides are found in three major forms fluorspar caf2 apatite ca3f po4 3 and cryolite na3alf6 with higher fluoride dosages 1 5 mg l sunitha et al 2012a in india particularly from andhra pradesh several groundwater quality studies have been conducted on fluoride contamination sunitha and muralidharareddy 2018 muralidhar reddy et al 2019 subba rao 2017 2018 according to the findings various factors such as the dissolution of fluorine ions in aquifers variations in borehole depths rock water interactions and anthropogenic activities all contribute to the deployment of f no3 ions in groundwater in the past 30 years the levels of no3 in groundwater in many countries might have been on the rise guo et al 2007 because of the higher amounts of nitrate in potable water it can have a negative impact on human health bulusu et al 1990 therefore the united states environmental protection agency usepa has designated the maximum pollutant level mcl as 10 mg l no3 n and 45 mg l for no3 ion us epa 2014 hadi et al 2018 mirzaei et al 2015 in india different parts of the states like andhra pradesh gujarat tamil nadu uttar pradesh karnataka kerala assam madhya pradesh bihar west bengal himachal pradesh and uttar pradesh consist of high nitrates in subsurface water 45 ppm c g w b 2013 sunitha et al 2012a narasimha and jianhua 2019 revealed of nitrogenous materials in the lithological topography therefore the production of nitrate in groundwater is mainly anthropogenic activates from leakage of soil layer along with nitrogenous fertilizers animal manure sewage and septic tanks vasanth et al 2019 yenugu et al pointed out in 2020 that in the vemula vemaplli area of the kadapa region of andhra pradesh in southern india the higher nitrate found in groundwater is through extensive usage of nitrate fertilizers in banana plantations this region occupies numerous underground and open cost inactive mines yellow ochre barites asbestos clay limestone socio economically rural inhabitants depend mostly on local mining industry as a result new communities around the mine have sprung up therefore groundwater is the chief resource for drinking water household and agricultural uses in this area due to insufficient previous research in the study region no attempt was made to clarify the quality of groundwater in inactive mining areas and its possible health effects therefore the main objective of this study was to assess groundwater quality through groundwater pollution index and its multiple exposure pathways to assess human health impacts using statistical and geospatial analysis for drinking purposes moreover the research indicates the implications of farming practices in view of natural and anthropogenic variables to assist farmers decision makers and stakeholders in attaining sustainable

were collected in 1 l plastic containers with 5 km radius over inactive mines in southwestern part of cuddapah basin out of 50 samples thirty five samples have been taken from bore well and 15 samples from hand pump the total depth of bore wells various from 100 to 250 feet the samples are stored at dark room at 35 c room temperature prior to sample collection all the containers are washed out with

applied to assess changes in groundwater quality caused by distinctive geochemical factors the pollution index measures the relative influence of various water quality parameters the index is determined by conceding water quality variables namely ph ec tds th ca2 mg2 na k cl hco3 so4 2 no3 f subba rao 2018 compared with other quality index equations ex wqi this equation gives detailed information about groundwater pollution and the impact of pollution sources in the study area the groundwater pollution index pig is calculated through the following successive steps subba rao et al 2012 2018 3 3 1 step i assigning weight according to the relative importance of groundwater the weight rw of each chemical parameter is between 1 and 5 3 3 2 step ii weight parameter the weight parameter wp is determined by the fallowing equation 2 w p r w r w where wp is the weight parameter rw is the weight of each constituent determined weight parameter wp values of each constituent were shown in table 2 3 3 3 step iii the concentration status of each parameter can be predicted by dividing the concentration of each chemical variable in each water sample by the relevant drinking water quality standard who 2011 3 s c c d s where sc is the status of concentration c is the chemical variable concentration of individual water sample and ds is the standard drinking water level who 2011 for individual chemical constituent 3 3 4 step iv overall chemical quality of water ow it is calculated by multiplying the wp with the sc 4 o w w p s c where wp is weight parameter sc is the status of concentration 3 3 5 step v pollution index pi of ground water the pi of groundwater is calculated relied on the sum of the overall chemical quality of the water obtained from water quality indicators of individual sample 5 p i g o w when evaluating pig the respective contribution of the concentration of water quality variables in individual water sample is considered according to the pig classification the groundwater quality is classified as i when pig 1 the pollution is not obvious 2 low pollution between 1 and 1 5 iii moderate pollution if between 1 5 and 2 iv high pollution ranging from 2 to 2 5 v when pig 2 5 the pollution is extremely high table 6 3 4 nitrate pollution index npi for this investigation nitrate pollution index npi was developed through the following two steps step 1 selection and demonstration on pollution index of no3 ions the most prominent origin of nitrate in aquifers is human activities like intense agricultural practices and sewage sanitation in densely populated areas wakida et al 2005 eternal exposure of excessive no3 levels in potable water harms human health ward et al 1996 knobeloch et al 2000 de roos et al 2003 when the concentration of no3 in groundwater exceeds 20 mg l it is considered pollution caused by human activities and is noted as the human impact value hav spalding and exner 1993 the maximum no3 level in potable water that is permitted is 50 mg l who 1993 step ii computation of the nitrogen pollution index npi 6 n p i cs hav hav calculate the following relationship with the npi of the study area where cs represents analytical range of nitrate in the water sample hav represent threshold value of human induced source 20 mg l according to the npi value the water quality is divided into five categories 0 clean no pollution 0 1 light pollution 1 2 moderate pollution 2 3 high pollution 3 very high pollution 3 5 health risk assessment hhra the hhra consists of four stages stage 1 is risk identification stage 2 is dose assessment stage 3 is assessment exposure and therefore the fourth stage was hazard characterization which is proposed by us environmental protection agency narsimha and rajitha 2018 li et al

for adding nitrates in to aquifers in addition to the agricultural practices poultry waste disposal and household cultivate animal dung contribute higher nitrate concentration are leached in groundwater raju et al 2009 lokesh 2013 oenema et al 2005 fluoride is good for human health in preventing dental caries and helps in enamel development at 0 8 1 0 mg l for children below 8 years of

consistently for 8 10 years high manifestations of dental fluorosis are mainly found in children under 12 years of age ijumulana et al 2021 dental fluorosis is observed in parts of vemula y s r district kadapa sunitha et al 2015 in parts of kadapa anantapur district sunitha et al 2013 in badvel y s r district sunitha et al 2014 and also in and around abandoned mines vemula y s r district sudharshan reddy et al 2018 sudharshan reddy and sunitha 2020 the presence of fluoride in groundwater of the study area are weathering and leaching of fluoride bearing minerals fluoride apatite and cryolite from the basement granitic rocks in most sampling sites geological formations were found to be the main source of fluoride concentration the correlation coefficients between fluoride and other parameters are studied fluoride is positively correlated with ph na ca2 and hco3 indicating that high concentrations of bicarbonate in groundwater can increase the solubility of fluorite in this area in addition seasonal spatial and depth changes are also possible reasons for changes in fluoride concentration in groundwater sunitha et al 2014 subba rao 2018 4 2 dominant factors and mechanism controlling components of groundwater chemistry gibb s diagram 1970 is prepared to assess the dominant mechanism controlling factors of groundwater chemistry in this area the diagram contained three dominant factors such as precipitation rock and evaporate dominance cations like na k na k ca2 and anions cl cl hco3 were plotted against tds gibbs 1970 these functions appear in interaction between groundwater and minerals composed aquifers in sub surface of the earth from fig 3 most of the groundwater samples fall in rock dominance portion and slightly inclination towards precipitation zone fig 2 divulges that chemistry of the groundwater in the study area influenced by rock weathering and rock water interaction rock dominance and the dissolution of carbonate precipitation dominance rocks in the study area 4 3 normalized bivariate plots for the most part various lithological cycles such as weathering and dissolution are controlling the chemical action of groundwater by denoting the relationship between ca2 na and hco3 na and ca2 na and mg2 na it is clear fig 4 that the chemistry of the groundwater depend on the weathering of silicate and partly on the dissolution of carbonate therefore the sodium potassium calcium and magnesium play a major role in silicate weathering 4 4 pollution index of groundwater pig pig is widely used and a vital procedure of assessing the water quality surface water and groundwater by many researchers over the world subba rao and chaudhary 2019 pig values of groundwater samples ranged from 0 45 to 2 49 with an average of 0 9 in pre monsoon prm season table 2 in the prm 4 of the groundwater samples are of high pollution 2 5 2 of the groundwater samples showed moderate pollution status 2 2 5 12 of the samples belongs to the low pollution class 1 5 2 and remaining 82 of the samples insignificant pollution class table 3 if the displayed pig value is higher than 2 5 they clearly indicate the influence of human induced activities rather than the influence of geological origin on the groundwater system it can be seen from the spatial distribution map that most of the samples belong to the low polluted areas in the central and southern regions and the high polluted areas are irregular patches from the north to the west of the study area fig 5 4 5 nitrate pollution index the nitrate pollution index is an innovative method to identify nitrate pollutants in groundwater according to the npi value five types of water are determined clean lightly polluted moderately polluted highly polluted and very high polluted water the corresponding npi values are 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 and 3 respectively from computation of npi values it ranged from 0 45 to 2 49 with an average of 0 9 in pre monsoon season table 2 only 8 2 of the samples belongs to low and light pollution category the nitrate content in the groundwater of the study area sw parts of cuddapah basin belonging to very high pollution categories 80 of the samples exceeds the maximum allowable level of potable water quality standards stipulated by who 1993 table 4 the spatial distribution of npi is shown in fig 6 two main areas with moderate to high pollution are revealed these are central northern and southeast part of the study area from the study there are two main possible sources of nitrates found groundwater are untreated domestic sewage and extensive usage of fertilizer appliance for enhancing crop yield 5 geospatial techniques 5 1 slope map slope is an essential map for determining constraints and assessing potential environmental impacts related to terrain changes soil erosion soil loss non point source pollution the slope map is an excellent tool for finding potential erosion areas drainage patterns topography soil patterns and land use suitability the steepness of the slope is expressed in light to dark colors flat surfaces are denoted as gray light slopes are noted as dark green medium slopes are expressed as light orange and steep slopes as reddish brown the slope is related to local and regional relief which shows a considerable influence on the flow of groundwater and its recharge to aquifers aster dem 30m resolution data is employed to develop the slope of the study region which exhibits the diversity of slopes and the undulations are very steep to gentle rajashekar et al 2020 the maximum 548 m and minimum 158 m topography exists in the western and north western part of the site leading to highest water flow and therefore much less chance of rainwater infiltration during this investigation three groups of slopes were determined based on slope percentage steep 300 moderate 100 300 and gentle slopes 10 100 fig 7 prabhakaran and raj 2018 the higher priority is the close to gentle grade category followed by medium grade and steep grade majority of the inactive mine impoundments are located in areas with gentle slope when heavy rain occurs during the monsoon rainwater has more runoff and less infiltration so that it will flow into low lying areas 30 steepness and be stored in inactive reservoirs 5 2 land use land cover dynamics and its effects on groundwater quality in this study satellite images irs p6 liss iii were used to generate lulc maps using erdas and arc gis 9 3 softwares for unsupervised classification in 2012 and 2019 fig 8 these maps show the spatial distribution of forests agriculture water resources etc and are prepared through visual interpretation of satellite images visual interpretation is depending on the combination of image features color tone size shape pattern texture etc with existing maps literary works the detection of lulc changes has revealed a significant impact on the occurrence and management of water resources from the analysis of lulc map the data reveals that the cropland has shown marked increase from 71 1 sq km in 2012 to 118 sq km in 2019 which constituted about 13 1 of the total area at present and thus registering an increase of 5 2 from last two few years which may the cost of decreasing of forest land and fallow land as well as increasing of water body resources to improve irrigational practices in the study area similarly 1 52 of water body resources were increased from 2012 to 2019 the sector built up land has shown a sharp increase from 60 sq km in 2012 to 80 sq km in 2019 which contributed about 8 8 of the land area of the region and thus experiences an increase of 2 2 similarly 1 14 of fallow land 0 61 of inactive mine dump was increased from 2012 to 2019 respectively table 5 from the investigations the relationship between changes in lulc and groundwater quality has been established subjectively and it is found that nitrate pollution is mainly confined to highly irrigated areas 5 3 groundwater flow direction map typically groundwater flows from high relief to low relief areas in this study dem satellite imagery was used to determine groundwater flow direction using arc hydro and arc gis software filled dem was applied to calculate the flow direction for each pixel which indicates the direction in which water is flowing from the pixel to surrounding pixels muralidara et al 2019 this difference in elevation is then divided by the center to center distance between the water flow directions various changing trends of the flow direction can be observed from the figure indicating that the overall flow direction of groundwater mainly flows from the south to the middle of the study area fig 9 thus the findings suggest that the indiscriminate disposal of agricultural waste the underground seepage activities of sewage in the area has had a detrimental effect on the groundwater quality in the area 6 no3 contamination at inactive mines the southwestern part of the cudappa basin is exposed to various underground and open pit inactive mines barite yellow stone asbestos posing a sever threat to the health and safety of the neighboring human communities specifically the lack of suitable ceasing procedures and greening measures most of the inactive landmines were established by nearby residential areas and agricultural land in the research area by virtue of abundant rainfall in the rainy season after the monsoon and due to the low slope huge amount of domestic and agricultural garbage chemical fertilizers pesticides etc are thrown into inactive mine impoundments and enter in to groundwater media by infiltration process and pollutes the underground aquifers sudharshan reddy et al 2020b inactive mine impoundment are causes various safety health and environmental problems that may include f and no3 that contaminate ground water surface water the risk constituted by inactive mine sites which comes mainly from surface underground impoundment of the inactive mines tailings with higher accumulation of f no3 ions are serious impacts on human health the inactive abandoned mines are widely diffused in southwestern part of cuddapah basin hence it is required to implement of human health risk assessment to be practiced rural areas around the mines bini 2012 wahsha and al rshaidat 2014 generally underground mines and open pit mines are flooded with natural surface water agricultural waste domestic waste poultry waste water inflow from rural villages these inactive mine reservoirs serve as strategic storage for agricultural waste they are in direct contact with the groundwater level and are easily entered by f no3 ions and pollute groundwater resources animal waste is one of the causes and issue for nitrate originates in ground water the study area rich with 10 000 dairy cows in rural villages the excreta of these animals dung and urine are profound source of contaminants such as no3 nitrate k potassium it could enter the water table via inactive abandoned surface mining impoundments resulting in contaminants being introduced into the direct aquifer fernando et al 2005 abandoned landfills are also a cause of nitrate pollutants in groundwater and impacts on groundwater quality albaiges et al 1986 flyammar 1995 most of the mines are within 5 km distance from rural inhabitants and their agriculture land in the study area table 6 therefore this study mainly focused on health impacts due to fluoride nitrate pollutants to surface and ground water in the rural inhabitants living nearby inactive abandoned mines 5 multivariate statistics the varimax rotated factor analysis was accomplished by spss software r mode factor analysis examines the relationship between the two variables by analyzing simple correlation matrix coefficients for all pairs of variables considered the r mode factor analysis also determines the main controlling factors of the hydrogeochemical parameters factor loads are classified as strong medium and weak corresponding to absolute load values 0 75 0 75 0 50 and 0 50 0 30 wagh et al 2020 wagh et al 2020 in this study this classification is applied to appraise the data the computed values of factor analysis was presented in table 7 factor 1 is weakly loaded with ec tds th mg2 cl and no3 these weakly loads tds th k co3 2 and no3 exhibit the natural hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater by water rock interaction that could explain the disintegration of rocks and minerals in sediments by chemical weathering no3 commonly originates from anthropogenic activities factor 2 has weakly positive loading with ec tds hco3 are probably indicates the signatures of water rock interaction as well as carbonate weathering and ion exchange process factor 3 is weakly positive loading of ca2 and f these loads originate from geogenic and ion exchange processes whenever groundwater interacts with dolomite and limestone ca2 ions will increase factor 4 is moderately loading of ph and f originates from geogenic activities and geochemical alternation of carbonate minerals 6 human health risk assessment hhra of f and no3 human health risk assessment is a modern method developed by usepa united states environmental protection agency which has wide applicability for assessing human health risk assessment li et al 2014 the development of non carcinogenic risks caused by fluoride and nitrate in groundwater has attracted more attention in many countries ajaykumar et al 2021 nadia et al 2015 continuous drinking of polluted water can affect on human health in many parts of the world fluoride and nitrate pollution in drinking water has caused greater public health concern these ions are considered to be non carcinogenic to the human health of adults children and infants therefore this study aims to assess the human health risks of drinking water as the main passage the computed values of the hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi as showed in table 1 denotes higher concentrations of f and no3 ions were observed in sw part of cuddapah basin the hq values of fluoride in this area range from 0 01 to 3 01 adults 0 01 to 3 06 children and 0 01 to 2 33 infants with the average values being 0 79 0 8 0 6 table 8 according to the usepa 2014 guidelines 30 30 and 12 5 of groundwater are higher than the acceptable limit 1 table 9 which may cause adverse health effects on adults children and infants respectively zhang et al 2018 the hq values of nitrate in the study area ranged from 0 001 to 14 6 adults 0 002 to 14 36 children and 0 001 to 11 8 infants the average values were 1 8 1 7 and 1 3 table 8 according to the usepa 2014 guidelines 70 70 37 5 of groundwater samples are above the acceptable limit 1 table 9 which may pose health risks to adults children and infants respectively as per the usepa guidelines the thi value must not be greater than 1 if the thi value is greater than 1 it indicates that there is non carcinogenic effect on humans it can be clearly seen from the results that the thi values in this area range from 0 01 to 14 8 adults 0 02 to 14 6 children and 0 01 to 11 8 infants with the average values being 2 6 2 5 and 1 9 respectively table 8 92 5 92 5 of samples exceed the standard limit of thi for adults and children while 80 of samples exceed the recommended limit of thi for infants table 9 children and infants are more prone to risk of fluoride and nitrate than infants in the study area from fig 10 higher values of the hazard quotient of fluoride hazard quotient of nitrate and total hazard index of the adults near by the inactive mine habitant areas therefore respective recommendations must be noted and appropriate precautions must be taken in the study brindha et al 2010area 7 conclusion groundwater water quality and its impact on human health were studied in the southwestern part of the cuddapah basin in y s r district south india the conclusion drawn from the research is that the concentration levels of nitrate and fluoride is greater than the allowable range of w h o and that groundwater is alkaline and hard in nature as far as nitrate and fluoride are concerned groundwater is not drinkable the fluoride levels in this area vary between 0 4 and 4 7 mg l about 36 of samples exceeds the prescribed limit of fluoride 1 5 mg l so appropriate defluorination technology is required to cleanse this water the attention of nitrate in potable water differs from 0 14 to 589 mg l 42 of groundwater is above the standard acceptable limit for nitrate the sources of fluoride and nitrate are geological and anthropogenic origin a large amount of input from agricultural and domestic waste into groundwater through runoff during rainfall the predominant geochemical processes in this region are weathering ion exchange and anthropogenic activities according to the pig value 30 and 27 5 of the samples showed high and very high pollution categories respectively in terms of npi value 88 of the samples belong to the very high nitrate pollution category this shows that nitrate groundwater is not safe to drink and preventive measures must be taken according to the usepa 2014 guidelines 30 30 12 5 and 70 70 37 5 of hazard quotient of the fluoride and nitrate in groundwater are higher than the acceptable limit 1 united states environmental protection agency usepa stated that thi value is less than 1 92 5 92 5 of samples exceed the recommended range of thi for adults and children while 80 of samples exceed the usepa nominate value of thi for infants children and infants are at higher exposure risk of fluoride and nitrate than infants as the groundwater chemistry of the water in this area is very complex and there is more scope to apply other technologies to conduct more detailed water quality studies to remediate the groundwater contamination 8 recommendations from the results of this study groundwater maybe consumed but local habitants facing some health problems as a result some alternative actions for managing groundwater quality in the research region must be permitted the following are the most important measures make people generally aware not to over exploit groundwater especially for mining industry and irrigation purposes before direct consumption of drinking water some fluoride and nitrate removal treatments must be taken such as reverse osmosis ro after the establishment of ordinary sewage treatment plants or the installation of small reverse osmosis devices in each house government agencies can supply treated water to people continue to monitor groundwater quality seasonally and spatially to better understand recharge and drainage mechanisms this will help recommend natural remedies such as artificial replenishment of groundwater to dilute

11842,the primary intend of this research is to determine the standard drinking water quality build upon on the pollution index of groundwater pig and health risk index for this fifty groundwater samples were chosen and determined for chief cations anions in the southwestern part of cuddapah basin sw maximum samples are under the allowable level of w h o standards except fluoride and nitrate concentrations around 60 and 62 5 of the groundwater surpass the allowable range 1 5 mg l of fluoride and nitrate 45 mg l respectively as a result groundwater is not potable due to fluoride and nitrate levels and a health risk assessment was conducted in this area from the pig values 80 of the samples fall under insignificant pollution category nitrate pollution index value shows that 88 of the groundwater polluted with high nitrate content as per national guide lines for drinking purpose as per usepa guidelines non carcinogenic effect of nitrate and fluoride in this region vary from 0 01 to 14 48 adults 0 02 14 68 children 0 01 11 8 infants while 92 5 92 5 80 of groundwater is surpass the recommended value 1 of thi for adults children and infants higher fluoride concentration may be due to geogenic and higher levels of nitrate concentration may be due to human induced activities including fertilizers industrial effluent and service pipe leakage the predominant geochemical processes in this region are weathering ion exchange and to reduce fluoride and nitrate contaminated in water intake in the research area precautions should be adopted graphical abstract image 1 keywords human health risk assessment hhra nitrate pollution index pollution index of groundwater inactive mines 1 introduction in many countries such as india mine pollution has become a serious environmental problem mining activity creates an inactive abandoned mine lands aml it causes prolonged effects on physical chemical biological social system of the natural system mavarommatis 2017 in view of this most developing countries are facing environmental mhlongo 2016 the environmental concern related to the mining activity is more intense and apparent in the case of mine are inactive or abandoned mavrommatis 2017 high levels of nutrients in the groundwater table can cause drinking water to become toxic toxic ions such as fluorine and nitrates are enter into aquifers and may accumulate in crops and might have severe threat on health of humans davies 1983 subsurface water is used extensively for domestic and agricultural purposes in semi arid regions around the world therefore drinking water standards are directly related to public health bhattacharya et al 2015 sisanda et al 2020 li and qian 2018 sunitha et al 2012a as a result it is crucial to watch the quality of water systematically among them the groundwater quality is the main concern because this drinking water must be free of harmful elements if the drinking water contains excessive of mineral contents biological and non biological substances it may affect human health quino limo et al 2020 muralidhar reddy et al 2013 on a global scale the pollution of groundwater by f and no3 has developed into a significant health issue for the past two decades given their significance these work has been conducted in arid semi arid regions around the globe ajaykumar et al 2019 narasimha and wang 2018 wu et al 2015 ghaderpoori et al 2018 jafari et al 2014 massoudinejad et al 2016 sunitha et al 2016 sunitha and muralidharareddy 2018 the existence of f ions in potable water up to 1 0 mg l is advantage to children s health because it facilitates the production of caries resistant dental enamel the existence of f ions in potable water up to 1 0 mg l has been shown to be detrimental to human and animal physiology aside from a few beneficial effects the toxic effects on teeth include chalky white patches pitting and chipped off tips as well as premature tooth loss skeletal defects and joint pain occur at concentrations greater than 2 3 mg l concentrations of fluoride are relatively high all over the world especially in parts of india china south central africa and united states of america which have a profound impact on human health sunkaria et al 2020 susheela 1993 shahriari et al 2010 the concentration of fluoride is governed by a variety of factors such as availability of fluoride bearing rocks rock composition the mechanism of rock water interaction evaporation mineral dissolution etc narasimha and wang 2018 fluorides are found in three major forms fluorspar caf2 apatite ca3f po4 3 and cryolite na3alf6 with higher fluoride dosages 1 5 mg l sunitha et al 2012a in india particularly from andhra pradesh several groundwater quality studies have been conducted on fluoride contamination sunitha and muralidharareddy 2018 muralidhar reddy et al 2019 subba rao 2017 2018 according to the findings various factors such as the dissolution of fluorine ions in aquifers variations in borehole depths rock water interactions and anthropogenic activities all contribute to the deployment of f no3 ions in groundwater in the past 30 years the levels of no3 in groundwater in many countries might have been on the rise guo et al 2007 because of the higher amounts of nitrate in potable water it can have a negative impact on human health bulusu et al 1990 therefore the united states environmental protection agency usepa has designated the maximum pollutant level mcl as 10 mg l no3 n and 45 mg l for no3 ion us epa 2014 hadi et al 2018 mirzaei et al 2015 in india different parts of the states like andhra pradesh gujarat tamil nadu uttar pradesh karnataka kerala assam madhya pradesh bihar west bengal himachal pradesh and uttar pradesh consist of high nitrates in subsurface water 45 ppm c g w b 2013 sunitha et al 2012a narasimha and jianhua 2019 revealed of nitrogenous materials in the lithological topography therefore the production of nitrate in groundwater is mainly anthropogenic activates from leakage of soil layer along with nitrogenous fertilizers animal manure sewage and septic tanks vasanth et al 2019 yenugu et al pointed out in 2020 that in the vemula vemaplli area of the kadapa region of andhra pradesh in southern india the higher nitrate found in groundwater is through extensive usage of nitrate fertilizers in banana plantations this region occupies numerous underground and open cost inactive mines yellow ochre barites asbestos clay limestone socio economically rural inhabitants depend mostly on local mining industry as a result new communities around the mine have sprung up therefore groundwater is the chief resource for drinking water household and agricultural uses in this area due to insufficient previous research in the study region no attempt was made to clarify the quality of groundwater in inactive mining areas and its possible health effects therefore the main objective of this study was to assess groundwater quality through groundwater pollution index and its multiple exposure pathways to assess human health impacts using statistical and geospatial analysis for drinking purposes moreover the research indicates the implications of farming practices in view of natural and anthropogenic variables to assist farmers decision makers and stakeholders in attaining sustainable

applied to assess changes in groundwater quality caused by distinctive geochemical factors the pollution index measures the relative influence of various water quality parameters the index is determined by conceding water quality variables namely ph ec tds th ca2 mg2 na k cl hco3 so4 2 no3 f subba rao 2018 compared with other quality index equations ex wqi this equation gives detailed information about groundwater pollution and the impact of pollution sources in the study area the groundwater pollution index pig is calculated through the following successive steps subba rao et al 2012 2018 3 3 1 step i assigning weight according to the relative importance of groundwater the weight rw of each chemical parameter is between 1 and 5 3 3 2 step ii weight parameter the weight parameter wp is determined by the fallowing equation 2 w p r w r w where wp is the weight parameter rw is the weight of each constituent determined weight parameter wp values of each constituent were shown in table 2 3 3 3 step iii the concentration status of each parameter can be predicted by dividing the concentration of each chemical variable in each water sample by the relevant drinking water quality standard who 2011 3 s c c d s where sc is the status of concentration c is the chemical variable concentration of individual water sample and ds is the standard drinking water level who 2011

concentration 3 3 5 step v pollution index pi of ground water the pi of groundwater is calculated relied on the sum of the overall chemical quality of the water obtained from water quality indicators of individual sample 5 p i g o w when evaluating pig the respective contribution of the concentration of water quality variables in individual water sample is considered according to the pig classification the groundwater quality is classified as i when pig 1 the pollution is not obvious 2 low pollution between 1 and 1 5 iii moderate pollution if between 1 5 and 2 iv high pollution ranging from 2 to 2 5 v when pig 2 5 the pollution is extremely high table 6 3 4 nitrate pollution index npi for this investigation nitrate pollution index npi was developed through the following two steps step 1 selection and demonstration on pollution index of no3 ions the most prominent origin of nitrate in aquifers is human activities like intense agricultural practices and sewage sanitation in densely populated areas wakida et al 2005 eternal exposure of excessive no3 levels in potable water harms human health ward et al 1996 knobeloch et al 2000 de roos et al 2003 when the concentration of no3 in groundwater exceeds 20 mg l it is considered pollution caused by human activities and is noted as the human impact value hav spalding and exner 1993 the maximum no3 level in potable water that is permitted is 50 mg l who 1993 step ii computation of the nitrogen pollution index npi 6 n p i cs hav hav calculate the following relationship with the npi of the study area where cs represents analytical range of nitrate in the water sample hav represent threshold value of human induced source 20 mg l according to the npi value the water quality is divided into five categories 0 clean no pollution 0 1 light pollution 1 2 moderate pollution 2 3 high pollution 3 very high pollution 3 5 health risk assessment hhra the hhra consists of four stages stage 1 is risk identification stage 2 is dose assessment stage 3 is assessment exposure and therefore the fourth stage was hazard characterization which is proposed by us environmental protection agency narsimha and rajitha 2018 li et al 2018 for this research the f and no3 concentrations in groundwater were chosen as parameters to determine the human health risk assessment us environmental protection agency 2014 in order to determine

sudharshan reddy et al 2018 sudharshan reddy and sunitha 2020 the presence of fluoride in groundwater of the study area are weathering and leaching of fluoride bearing minerals fluoride apatite and cryolite from the basement granitic rocks in most sampling sites geological formations were found to be the main source of fluoride concentration the correlation coefficients between fluoride and other parameters are studied fluoride is positively correlated with ph na ca2 and hco3 indicating that high concentrations of bicarbonate in groundwater can increase the solubility of fluorite in this area in addition seasonal spatial and depth changes are also possible reasons for changes in fluoride concentration in groundwater sunitha et al 2014 subba rao 2018 4 2 dominant factors and mechanism controlling components of groundwater chemistry gibb s diagram 1970 is prepared to assess the dominant mechanism controlling factors of groundwater chemistry in this area the diagram contained three dominant factors such as precipitation rock and evaporate dominance cations like na k na k ca2 and anions cl cl hco3 were plotted against tds gibbs 1970 these functions appear in interaction between groundwater and minerals composed aquifers in sub surface of the earth from fig 3 most of the groundwater samples fall in rock dominance portion and slightly inclination towards precipitation zone fig

the study area 4 3 normalized bivariate plots for the most part various lithological cycles such as weathering and dissolution are controlling the chemical action of groundwater by denoting the relationship between ca2 na and hco3 na and ca2 na and mg2 na it is clear fig 4 that the chemistry of the groundwater depend on the weathering of silicate and partly on the dissolution of carbonate therefore the sodium potassium calcium and magnesium play a major role in silicate weathering 4 4 pollution index of groundwater pig pig is widely used and a vital procedure of assessing the water quality surface water and groundwater by many researchers over the world subba rao and chaudhary 2019 pig values of groundwater samples ranged from 0 45 to 2 49 with an average of 0 9 in pre monsoon prm season table 2 in the prm 4 of the groundwater samples are of high pollution 2 5 2 of the groundwater samples showed moderate pollution status 2 2 5 12 of the samples belongs to the low pollution class 1 5 2 and remaining 82 of the samples insignificant pollution class table 3 if the displayed pig value is higher than 2 5 they clearly indicate the influence of human induced activities rather than the influence of geological origin on the groundwater system it can be seen from the spatial distribution map that most of the samples belong to the low polluted areas in the central and southern regions and the high polluted areas are irregular patches from the north to the west of the study area fig 5 4 5 nitrate pollution index the nitrate pollution index is an innovative method to identify nitrate pollutants in groundwater according to the npi value five types of water are determined clean lightly polluted moderately polluted highly polluted and very high polluted water the corresponding npi values are 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 and 3 respectively from computation of npi values it ranged from 0 45 to 2 49 with an average of 0 9 in pre monsoon season table 2 only 8 2 of the samples belongs to low and light pollution category the nitrate content in the groundwater of the study area sw parts of cuddapah basin belonging to very high pollution categories 80 of the samples exceeds the maximum allowable level of potable water quality standards stipulated by who 1993 table 4 the spatial distribution of npi is shown in fig 6 two main areas with moderate to high pollution are revealed these are central northern and southeast part of the study area from the study there are two main possible sources of nitrates found groundwater are untreated domestic sewage and extensive usage of fertilizer appliance for enhancing crop yield 5 geospatial techniques 5 1 slope map slope is an essential map for determining constraints and assessing potential environmental impacts related to terrain changes soil erosion soil loss non point source pollution the slope map is an excellent tool for finding potential erosion areas drainage patterns topography soil patterns and land use suitability the steepness of the slope is expressed in light to dark colors flat surfaces are denoted as gray light slopes are noted as dark green medium slopes are expressed as light orange and steep slopes as reddish brown the slope is related to local and regional relief which shows a considerable influence on the flow of groundwater and its recharge to aquifers aster dem 30m resolution data is employed to develop the slope of the study region which exhibits the diversity of slopes and the undulations are very steep to gentle rajashekar et al 2020 the maximum 548 m and minimum 158 m topography exists in the western and north western part of the site leading to highest water flow and therefore much less chance of rainwater infiltration during this investigation three groups of slopes were determined based on slope percentage steep 300 moderate 100 300 and gentle slopes 10 100 fig 7 prabhakaran and raj 2018 the higher priority is the close to gentle grade category followed by medium grade and steep grade majority of the inactive mine impoundments are located in areas with gentle slope when heavy rain occurs during the monsoon rainwater has more runoff and less infiltration so that it will flow into low lying areas 30 steepness and be stored in inactive reservoirs 5 2 land use land cover dynamics and its effects on groundwater quality in this study satellite images irs p6 liss iii were used to generate lulc maps using erdas and arc gis 9 3 softwares for unsupervised classification in 2012 and 2019 fig 8 these maps show the spatial distribution of forests agriculture water resources etc and are prepared through visual interpretation of satellite images visual interpretation is depending on the combination of image features color tone size shape pattern texture etc with existing maps literary works the detection of lulc changes has revealed a significant impact on the occurrence and management of water resources from the analysis of lulc map the data reveals that the cropland has shown marked increase from 71 1 sq km in 2012 to 118 sq km in 2019 which constituted about 13 1 of the total area at present and thus registering an increase of 5 2 from last two few years which may the cost of decreasing of forest land and fallow land as well as increasing of water body resources to improve irrigational practices in the study area similarly 1 52 of water body resources were increased from 2012 to 2019 the sector built up land has shown a sharp increase from 60 sq km in 2012 to 80 sq km in 2019 which contributed about 8 8 of the land area of the region and thus experiences an increase of 2 2 similarly 1 14 of fallow land 0 61 of inactive mine dump was increased from 2012 to 2019 respectively table 5 from the investigations the relationship between changes in lulc and groundwater quality has been established subjectively and it is found that nitrate pollution is mainly confined to highly irrigated areas 5 3 groundwater flow direction map typically groundwater flows from high relief to low relief areas in this study dem satellite imagery was used to determine groundwater flow direction using arc hydro and arc gis software filled dem was applied to calculate the flow direction for each pixel which indicates the direction in which water is flowing from the pixel to surrounding pixels muralidara et al 2019 this difference in elevation is then divided by the center to center distance between the water flow directions various changing trends of the flow direction can be observed from the figure indicating that the overall flow direction of groundwater mainly flows from the south to the middle of the study area fig 9 thus the findings suggest that the indiscriminate disposal of agricultural waste the underground seepage activities of sewage in the area has had a detrimental effect on the groundwater quality in the area 6 no3 contamination at inactive mines the southwestern part of the cudappa basin is exposed to various underground and open pit inactive mines barite yellow stone asbestos posing a sever threat to the health and safety of the neighboring human communities specifically the lack of suitable ceasing procedures and greening measures most of the inactive landmines were established by nearby residential areas and agricultural land in the research area by virtue of abundant rainfall in the rainy season after the monsoon and due to the low slope huge amount of domestic and agricultural garbage chemical fertilizers pesticides etc are thrown into inactive mine impoundments and enter in to groundwater media by infiltration process and pollutes the underground aquifers sudharshan reddy et al 2020b inactive mine impoundment are causes various safety health and environmental problems that may include f and no3 that contaminate ground water surface water the risk constituted by inactive mine sites which comes mainly from surface underground impoundment of the inactive mines tailings with higher accumulation of f no3 ions are serious impacts on human health the inactive abandoned mines are widely diffused in southwestern part of cuddapah basin hence it is required to implement of human health risk assessment to be practiced rural areas around the mines bini 2012 wahsha and al rshaidat 2014 generally underground mines and open pit mines are flooded with natural surface water agricultural waste domestic waste poultry waste water inflow from rural villages these inactive mine reservoirs serve as strategic storage for agricultural waste they are in direct contact with the groundwater level and are easily entered by f no3 ions and pollute groundwater resources animal waste is one of the causes and issue for nitrate originates in ground water the study area rich with 10 000 dairy cows in rural villages the excreta of these animals dung and urine are profound source of contaminants such as no3 nitrate k potassium it could enter the water table via inactive abandoned surface mining impoundments resulting in contaminants being introduced into the direct aquifer fernando et al 2005 abandoned landfills are also a cause of nitrate pollutants in groundwater and impacts on groundwater quality albaiges et al 1986 flyammar 1995 most of the mines are within 5 km distance from rural inhabitants and their agriculture land in the study area table 6 therefore this study mainly focused on health impacts due to fluoride nitrate pollutants to surface and ground water in the rural inhabitants living nearby inactive abandoned mines 5 multivariate statistics the varimax rotated factor analysis was accomplished by spss software r mode factor analysis examines the relationship between the two variables by analyzing simple correlation matrix coefficients for all pairs of variables considered the r mode factor analysis also determines the main controlling factors of the hydrogeochemical parameters factor loads are classified as strong medium and weak corresponding to absolute load values 0 75 0 75 0 50 and 0 50 0 30 wagh et al 2020 wagh et al 2020 in this study this classification is applied to appraise the data the computed values of factor analysis was presented in table 7 factor 1 is weakly loaded with ec tds th mg2 cl and no3 these weakly loads tds th k co3 2 and no3 exhibit the natural hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater by water rock interaction that could explain the disintegration of rocks and minerals in sediments by chemical weathering no3 commonly originates from anthropogenic activities factor 2 has weakly positive loading with ec tds hco3 are probably indicates the signatures of water rock interaction as well as carbonate weathering and ion exchange process factor 3 is weakly positive loading of ca2 and f these loads originate from geogenic and ion exchange processes whenever groundwater interacts with dolomite and limestone ca2 ions will increase factor 4 is moderately loading of ph and f originates from geogenic activities and geochemical alternation of carbonate minerals 6 human health risk assessment hhra of f and no3 human health risk assessment is a modern method developed by usepa united states environmental protection agency which has wide applicability for assessing human health risk assessment li et al 2014 the development of non carcinogenic risks caused by fluoride and nitrate in groundwater has attracted more attention in many countries ajaykumar et al 2021 nadia et al 2015 continuous drinking of polluted water can affect on human health in many parts of the world fluoride and nitrate pollution in drinking water has caused greater public health concern these ions are considered to be non carcinogenic to the human health of adults children and infants therefore this study aims to assess the human health risks of drinking water as the main passage the computed values of the hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi as showed in table 1 denotes higher concentrations of f and no3 ions were observed in sw part of cuddapah basin the hq values of fluoride in this area range from 0 01 to 3 01 adults 0 01 to 3 06 children and 0 01 to 2 33 infants with the average values being 0 79 0 8 0 6 table 8 according to the usepa 2014 guidelines 30 30 and 12 5 of groundwater are higher than the acceptable limit 1 table 9 which may cause adverse health effects on adults children and infants respectively zhang et al 2018 the hq values of nitrate in the study area ranged from 0 001 to 14 6 adults 0 002 to 14 36 children and 0 001 to 11 8 infants the average values were 1 8 1 7 and 1 3 table 8 according to the usepa 2014 guidelines 70 70 37 5 of groundwater samples are above the acceptable limit 1 table 9 which may pose health risks to adults children and infants respectively as per the usepa guidelines the thi value must not be greater than 1 if the thi value is greater than 1 it indicates that there is non carcinogenic effect on humans it can be clearly seen from the results that the thi values in this area range from 0 01 to 14 8 adults 0 02 to 14 6 children and 0 01 to 11 8 infants with the average values being 2 6 2 5 and 1 9 respectively table 8 92 5 92 5 of samples exceed the standard limit of thi for adults and children while 80 of samples exceed the recommended limit of thi for infants table 9 children and infants are more prone to risk of fluoride and nitrate than infants in the study area from fig 10 higher values of the hazard quotient of fluoride hazard quotient of nitrate and total hazard index of the adults near by the inactive mine habitant areas therefore respective recommendations must be noted and appropriate precautions must be taken in the study brindha et al 2010area 7 conclusion groundwater water quality and its impact on human health were studied in the southwestern part of the cuddapah basin in y s r district south india the conclusion drawn from the research is that the concentration levels of nitrate and fluoride is greater than the allowable range of w h o and that groundwater is alkaline and hard in nature as far as nitrate and fluoride are concerned groundwater is not drinkable the fluoride levels in this area vary between 0 4 and 4 7 mg l about 36 of samples exceeds the prescribed limit of fluoride 1 5 mg l so appropriate defluorination technology is required to cleanse this water the attention of nitrate in potable water differs from 0 14 to 589 mg l 42 of groundwater is above the standard acceptable limit for nitrate the sources of fluoride and nitrate are geological and anthropogenic origin a large amount of input from agricultural and domestic waste into groundwater through runoff during rainfall the predominant geochemical processes in this region are weathering ion exchange and anthropogenic activities according to the pig value 30 and 27 5 of the samples showed high and very high pollution categories respectively in terms of npi value 88 of the samples belong to the very high nitrate pollution category this shows that nitrate groundwater is not safe to drink and preventive measures must be taken according to the usepa 2014 guidelines 30 30 12 5 and 70 70 37 5 of hazard quotient of the fluoride and nitrate in groundwater are higher than the acceptable limit 1 united states environmental protection agency usepa stated that thi value is less than 1 92 5 92 5 of samples exceed the recommended range of thi for adults and children while 80 of samples exceed the usepa nominate value of thi for infants children and infants are at higher exposure risk of fluoride and nitrate than infants as the groundwater chemistry of the water in this area is very complex and there is more scope to apply other technologies to conduct more detailed water quality studies to remediate the groundwater contamination 8 recommendations from the results of this study groundwater maybe consumed but local habitants facing some health problems as a result some alternative actions for managing groundwater quality in the research region must be permitted the following are the most important measures make people generally aware not to over exploit groundwater especially for mining industry and irrigation purposes before direct consumption of drinking water some fluoride and nitrate removal treatments must be taken such as reverse osmosis ro after the establishment of ordinary sewage treatment plants or the installation of small reverse osmosis devices in each house government agencies can supply treated water to people continue to monitor groundwater quality seasonally and spatially to better understand recharge and drainage mechanisms this will help recommend natural remedies such as artificial replenishment of groundwater to dilute

11843,arsenic contamination is increasingly a serious global health concern especially in developing countries like ghana where the intensification of mining activities has resulted in adverse pollution of various water sources within mining communities to harness the early detection of arsenic contamination in multiple water supply systems this work aimed to assess and compare the prediction efficiency of different machine learning methods novel machine learning algorithms such as extreme gradient boosting xgb light gradient boosting lgb and generalized regression neural

with r2 0 93 nse 0 92 and mse 2 35 e 06 graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic machine learning algorithms modelling water supply systems 1 introduction arsenic one of the most toxic chemical elements usepa 2014 exists widely in the earth s crust and occurs in drinking water as one of the most hazardous substances to human health ahmad et al 2020 who 2017 shahid et al 2020 dias and fontes 2020 arsenic contamination as described by smith et al 2000 as the largest water poisoning has increasingly become a global issue and a serious global environmental challenge jain and ali 2000 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 hughes 2002 choong et al 2007 bhattacharya et al 2007 ahmad et al 2020 over 200 million people globally are estimated to be chronically exposed to arsenic from drinking contaminated water with a concentration above the world health organization who guideline limit of 0 01 mg l naujokas et al 2013 erickson et al 2021 this has resulted in several diseases including cancer in the skin lungs bladder and kidney smith et al 1992 marshall et al 2007 sengupta 2008 jovanovic et al 2013 who 2017 arsenic is primarily introduced into drinking water supply systems e g surface water and groundwater through the dissolution of naturally occurring minerals and ores who 2017 high concentration levels of arsenic in water are usually as a result of oxidation and dissolution of arsenic bearing minerals such as arsenopyrite welch et al 2000 according to abbas et al 2018 weathering and erosion of arsenic bearing rocks are considered the major and most widespread sources of arsenic in water besides the geogenic arsenic intensification of mining activities combined with increasing population and increased water requirements contributes to the rise in arsenic concentration in various water bodies asante et al 2007 bhardwaj et al 2020 nottebaum et al 2020 barats et al 2020 alonso et al 2020 chandio et al 2021 knowledge of arsenic concentrations in drinking water can help determine potential human exposure however quantification of arsenic contamination is a challenge especially in developing countries because it requires well trained technicians sophisticated equipment and expensive analysis park et al 2016 as a result there has been a growing need for alternative methods which is quicker robust and inexpensive to monitor arsenic concentration in water supply systems to ameliorate the challenges researchers have attempted to explore machine learning ml methods as an alternative technique due to their non parametric nature ability to accommodate more parameters and adequately model non linear and complex relationships between variables in fact literature is awash with several successful applications of machine learning in modelling arsenic concentration purkait et al 2008 chowdhury et al 2010 cho et al 2011 park et al 2016 podgorski and berg 2020 chakraborty et al 2020 podgorski et al 2020 tan et al 2020 liang et al 2021 wu et al 2021 lombard et al 2021 the most notable machine learning gathered from these studies include random forest rf boosted regression trees brt and artificial neural network ann table 1 presents a summary of some studies conducted on arsenic modelling using machine learning techniques it is evident that past studies have only applied machine learning to predict arsenic concentration using a single water source that is either surface water source lu et al 2019 or groundwater source ayotte et al 2016 chakraborty et al 2020 tan et al 2020 erickson et al 2021 liang et al 2021 wu et al 2021 lombard et al 2021 however the motivation underlying interest in arsenic concentration modelling suggests that a solution that could be useful in both scenarios surface and groundwater would be much advantageous especially for developing countries where a majority of people continue to rely on both groundwater and surface water for domestic use kemper 2004 howard et al 2006 who 2019 in addition a majority of the previous studies on arsenic modelling were conducted by using and comparing a few machine learning models hence a comparative analysis for a wider scope of machine learning models is yet to be discussed in the literature moreover since no single model fits all problems as according to the no free launch theorem proposed by wolpert and macready 1997 there is also the need for scholars to explore new machine learning models in arsenic concentration modelling furthermore interpretable machine learning models appear not to be widely applied in some parts of the world particularly in developing african countries hence the inability of end users to understand certain machine learning models is often problematic and may result in limited applications kim 2015 lipton 2018 in view of these gaps in the literature this study for the first time applied machine learning algorithms to model arsenic concentration for multiple water sources using combined monitoring data from groundwater surface water and drinking water sources further this study applied and assessed the prediction efficiency of extreme gradient boosting xgb light gradient boosting lgb and generalized regression neural network grnn as novel machine learning techniques in arsenic concentration modelling the choice of these methods was based on their successful application in related hydrological prediction studies cigizoglu 2005 wang et al 2008 rooki et al 2011 heddam 2014 eren et al 2019 fan et al 2019 su and zhao 2020 bhagat et al 2020 yingli et al 2020 to make the present study comprehensive unlike the existing studies involving fewer models additional machine learning models including interpretable models were considered in quantifying arsenic concentration the choice of these additional models was strongly influenced by the ease of interpretability i e decision trees dt and multivariate adaptive regression splines mars together with black box applied models i e multi layer perceptron mlp and random forest rf 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area lies between latitudes 4 0ʹ 0 n and 5 40ʹ 0 n and longitudes 1 45ʹ 0 w and 2 1ʹ 0 w ewusi et al 2017a 2017b osei et al 2021 fig 1 shows a map indicating the location of the study area the area is popularly known for intensive mining of gold and manganese ore with three major large scale mining companies namely goldfields ghana ltd gfgl ghana manganese company gmc and anglogold ashanti iduapriem limited aail and a great number of small scale mining companies operating ewusi et al 2017a 2017b according to the ghana statistical service 2014 groundwater boreholes pipe borne and hand dug wells constitute 70 of drinking water sources and surface water rivers and streams constitute 13 in the study area 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the study area is located lies within the ashanti gold belt of ghana on the unconformable contact between the younger tarkwaian formation to the west and birimian system to the east fig 1 the tarkwaian group considered to be a derived molassic facies of the birimian is made of a sequence in the direction of younging of fluviatile meta sedimentary rocks consisting of the kawere formation banket formation mineralised unit tarkwa phyllites and huni formation junner et al 1942 pigois et al 2003 kesse 1985 ewusi et al 2017a majeed et al 2022 the formation has gained much attention because of the placer gold deposit hosted in the banket formation the gold is mostly concentrated in the basal lowermost horizon with an enriched zone mostly associated with hematite common minerals found in the tarkwaian include chlorites chloritoids calcites sericites quartz and limonites kesse 1985 the style of gold mineralization in the birimian is an epigenetic gold quartz vein deposit associated with disseminated sulfides such as pyrite and arsenopyrite in fractured and sheared zones dzigbodi adjimah 1993 important aquifers in the study area are associated with the development of secondary porosity in the regolith through fissuring and weathering kuma and ewusi 2009 bhattacharya et al 2012 the area is also associated with localized groundwater flow due to the presence of numerous low hills acting as groundwater divides bhattacharya et al 2012 the groundwater is known to be hosted in the soft and easily weathered regolith of the banket and fracture zones within the tarkwaian kuma and ewusi 2009 in the weathered regolith aquifers are known to have relatively low permeability and high porosity and storage due to the presence of clay and silt whereas in the fracture zones they have relatively high transmissivity but low storage bhattacharya et al 2012 kortatsi 2004 estimated groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration are between 11 and 17 and 54 respectively of annual rainfall kuma 2007 the average well depth in the area is 35 4 m borehole yields range between 0 4 m3 h and 18 m3 h with an average of 2 4 m3 h bhattacharya et al 2012 ewusi et al 2021 the main source of recharge for streams and groundwater are the bonsa and ankobra rivers and their tributaries bhattacharya et al 2012 ewusi et al 2021 2 3 arsenic sources and pollution the quality of the water supply systems in the area is highly polluted especially with heavy metals particularly mercury and arsenic ewusi et al 2017b the arsenic in this region may have been derived from zones of gold mineralization in birimian volcano sedimentary rocks and altered sulphide minerals i e pyrite chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite besides the geogenic arsenic anthropogenic activities mining and agriculture in the area is also reported as the main contributor of elevated arsenic concentration in water sources with surface waters being more affected compared to groundwater kusimi and kusimi 2012 essumang 2009 the overall change in arsenic concentration can also be due to thermodynamic changes as a result of aquifer recharge as well as the resulting groundwater level fluctuation levitt et al 2019 sohrabi et al 2021 asante et al 2007 revealed much higher arsenic concentrations in surface waters within the tarkwa mining area 0 0005 0 073 mg l compared to the groundwater 0 0001 0 004 μmg l a high degree of human exposure to arsenic was also reported in a study by asante et al 2008 in their study the mean urinary arsenic concentration was reported to be 0 26 mg l kusimi and kusimi 2012 sampled both groundwater and surface water from 3 communities within the catchment of the major mining companies in the area and reported high arsenic concentration in water beyond the allowable limit 0 01 mg l of who 2017 a recent study by seidu and ewusi 2020 reported a higher carcinogenic risk for arsenic for people living in the area they indicated that consuming groundwater for a long period will increase one chance of acquiring cancer 2 4 sample collection and analysis a total of 387 water samples collected in 2015 were obtained from groundwater 189 surface water 110 and drinking water 87 systems in the study area the measured water parameters included arsenic as cyanide cn cadmium cd mercury hg copper cu total dissolved solids tds total suspended solids tss turbidity tub electrical conductivity ec and ph the statistical summary of all the measured parameters is presented in table 2 the samples were collected in 1 l polyethylene bottles which were washed with dilute hno3 and later rinsed with distilled water prior to the sample collection physicochemical parameters like ph tub tds and ec were measured in the field using hq40d18 series portable meter whiles as was determined using icp ms 2 5 determination of the most effective input variables first based on the ability of a parameter to control arsenic mobilisation ph and tss are widely reported to control arsenic mobilisation acidity and redox potential are sensitive to heavy metals lu et al 2019 and can influence the release of heavy metals wen and allen 1999 and affects their adsorption herut and kress 1997 gundersen and steinnes 2003 a study by zheng et al 2013 has also indicated dissolved solids ability to absorb heavy metals hence due to the sensitive nature of arsenic contamination feature selection of very important variables using variable importance scores by the best 3 performing models on all the 9 input variables was applied variables with a low degree of importance were eliminated from the modelling process as a result 4 important variables were finally extracted and used as input for building the final machine models 2 6 model development machine learning algorithms with few exceptions such as decision trees do not perform well when the input data have different scales geron 2019 therefore the input data was scaled predictor variables to fit the range from 0 to 1 using eq 1 geron 2019 1 x s c a l e x x m i n x m a x x m i n to effectively assess the models 80 of the dataset were used for training the machine learning models and the remaining 20 were used to evaluate their performance testing all 9 measured parameters were used as initial input variables to predict the arsenic concentration the variable importance scores from the best 3 performing models were then used to obtain the four most important variables which served as input in building the final set of models anaconda python was used in the implementation of the models the theoretical concept of the machine learning models is presented in the subsequent sections the workflow of the study is presented in fig 2 2 6 1 extreme gradient boosting xgb is a variant tree boosting algorithm efficient in handling both regression and classification problems chen et al 2015 the concept of the algorithm is to learn the functional relationship between the input and target features through an iterative process in which the individual trees are sequentially trained on the residuals from the previous tree chakraborty et al 2020 as shown in fig 3 this essential method is repeated several times before the stopping requirement is met the resultant is a final function f t representing all the predictions from the trees the final function is represented in eq 2 ullah et al 2021 as 2 f t k 1 t f k x i so doing the algorithm combines weak base learning models into a stronger learner in an iterative manner to optimize the objective function o b j friedman 2001 and it is made up of the training loss and regularisation parameter as defined by eq 3 ibrahim et al 2022 as 3 o b j t l θ s θ where tl is the training loss function θ represents the parameters to be learnt and s is the regularisation term the training loss is used to measure the model performance on training data the regularisation checks the model complexities gao et al 2018 simpler models tend to have a better performance against over fitting as earlier stated the algorithm starts from constant prediction and add a new function f t each time in deciding which function to add the best solution is to optimize the objective function the new optimized objective function represented by taylor s theorem is defined in eq 4 chen and guestrin 2016 as 4 o b j k 1 n q i f t v i 1 2 c i f t 2 v i b f t where q i and c i are taken as input the complexity of a decision tree in xgboost is defined in eq 5 as 5 b f t α a 1 2 λ j 1 l ω j 2 where the α is the complexity of each leaf l is the number of leaves in a decision tree λ is a parameter to scale the penalty and ω is the vector of scores on leaves 2 6 2 light gradient boosting lgb is an improved version of the gradient learning framework based on decision trees and the idea of weak learners ke et al 2017 lgb employs histogram based algorithms ranka and sing 1998 li et al 2007 fan et al 2019 which discretize continuous feature values into k bins and construct a histogram of width k this speeds up training and reduces memory usage unlike the decision tree based models which grow trees level depth wise lgb grows trees using the leaf wise strategy shi 2007 fan et al 2019 this growth strategy makes lgb more efficient because it chooses the leaf with maximum branching gain however the leaf wise strategy may cause over fitting especially when the data is small to remedy this downside lgb includes the maximum depth parameter to limit the tree depth to prevent over fitting while ensuring high efficiency additionally lgb uses gradient based one side sampling goss which uses small gradient data for faster learning chen et al 2019 and exclusive feature bundling efb for bundling the features together the training process of lgb is described as follows li et al 2007 chen et al 2019 the dataset d is first prepared as 6 d d x i y i i 1 n x i r m 1 y i r where n is the number of samples x i i 1 2 3 4 5 n is the m dimensional input vector and y i i 1 2 3 4 5 n is the one dimensional arsenic concentration target the prediction of each tree is added in an additive training process described in eqs 7 10 7 y ˆ i 0 0 8 y ˆ i 1 f 1 x i y ˆ i 0 f 1 x i 9 y ˆ i 2 f 1 x i f 2 x i y ˆ i 1 f 2 x i 10 y ˆ i t k 1 t f k x i where t is the number of trees f k is one of the trees with the leaf scores and it is obtained by minimizing the following objective function using eq 11 11 f f k arg min f k i 1 n l y i y ˆ i k ω f k where l is the training loss function measuring the difference between the predicted arsenic concentration and the observed arsenic concentration ω is the regularisation function that keeps the model complexity in check 2 6 3 generalized regression neural network grnn a powerful memory based network that was introduced by specht 1991 as an improved variant of the radial basis neural networks unlike the radial basis function neural network grnn is a one pass learning algorithm that requires no time consuming iterative process specht 1991 in the case of sparse data grnn provides a smooth transition from one observed value to another even with sparse data in a multidimensional measurement space specht 1991 grnn network structure consists of four layers the input layer two hidden layers pattern and summation layer and the output layer as shown in fig 4 the number of neurons in the hidden layer is usually the number of patterns in the training set since each pattern is represented by one neuron the implementation of grnn is described as follows specht 1991 a vector k of input variables m is received at the starting layer input layer the input layer provides the scaled measurement variables x to the neurons in the second layer pattern layer when the scaled variables x gets to the pattern layer it is subtracted from the already stored vectors in the layer the squared or absolute values of the differences are summed and passed on into radial basis function whose output is further passed on to the summation layer the summation layer contains two neurons the s summation neuron and the d summation neuron the s summation neuron calculates the sum of the weighted outputs of the pattern layer while the d summation neuron calculates the unweighted outputs of the pattern neurons finally the two outputs from the pattern layer reach the output layer the output layer calculates the quotient of the two outputs of the summation layer yielding the desired output value y of the system model for an input vector x the output y f x of the grnn is calculated in eq 12 as 12 y f x i 1 n y i exp b i 2 2 σ 2 i 1 n exp b i 2 2 σ 2 s d where 13 b i 2 x x i 2 x x i in which n is the number of data samples y is the desired output and σ is the smoothing parameter b i 2 is the euclidean distance between the training vector x i 2 6 4 decision trees dts are non parametric machine learning methods used for handling both classification and regression problems unlike the black box algorithms dts are very intuitive kucheryavskiy 2018 and their decisions are easy to interpret géron 2019 the algorithm reaches a decision based on multiple input variables that are organised and split into layers of decision branches in a sequence of a root node internal nodes and terminal nodes as shown in fig 5 after the dt has successfully split the data into two subsets it further splits the resulting subsets recursively using the same logic until the maximum depth specified is reached or it can no longer find a split that minimizes the loss function 2 6 5 multivariate adaptive regression spline mars is a flexible nonparametric regression model viewed as either a generalisation of the recursive partitioning regressions models or as a generalisation of the additive modelling approaches friedman 1991 friedman et al 2008 instead of splitting as in the recursive approaches mars uses an arithmetic notion of addition and multiplication friedman 1991 the starting point is to cast the approximation in the form of an expansion in a set of basis functions as represented in eq 14 14 f x m 1 a m b m x where b m is the mth basis function m is the number of basis functions and a m is the coefficient of the mth basis function then the forward stepwise regression procedure is initiated by setting the initial region to the wider domain and adjusting the coefficient values to best fit the data further good set basis functions are then derived the stepwise linear basis function is of the form x a and a x as shown in eq 15 15 y x a x a i f x a 0 o t h e r w i s e y a x a x i f a x 0 o t h e r w i s e the indexes indicate that only a positive part of the function is used the a parameter is a knot of the basic function and its value represent the location of the knot the knot locations are further used to derive a piecewise cubic basis with continuous first derivatives to produce a final model at this stage of the algorithm the final model consists of the entire basis functions used in the modelling so in a backward stepwise approach mars deletes one basis function at a time as a result the algorithm builds a sequence of n 1 models with each one having one basis function less than the original model after the forward stepwise regression finally the optimal model consisting of all basis functions that involve identical predictor variable sets and minimize the objective function is determined using the generalized cross validation gcv criterion defined in eq 16 friedman 1991 friedman et al 2008 16 g c v λ i 1 n y i h ˆ λ x i 2 1 p λ n 2 where λ is the number of terms y i is the ith response variable ĥ λ x i is the fitted response p λ is the effective number of parameters in the model and n is the number of observations it must be noted that p λ is generally related to the number of basis functions the final optimal model is represented in eq 17 as 17 f x b 0 k m 1 f i x i k m 2 f i j x i x j k m 2 f i j k x i x j x k the first sum represents overall basis functions that involve only a single variable representing a first order interaction here the variables do not interact with each other the second summation is overall basis functions involving exactly two variables representing a second order interaction if specified here maximum interaction is among two variables similarly the third sum is the contributions from three variable interactions with third order interaction and soon 2 6 6 multi layer perceptron neural network mlp inspired by the structure of neurons in the human brain bengio 2009 is an algorithm that mimics the biological nervous system to recognize patterns and objects here the neurons are typically aggregated in layers that generate connections between input and output data mlp explores the nonlinear relationship between input features water quality parameters and output targets arsenic concentration with a representation of weights and biases in the neurons the mlp architecture has three sequential layers the input layer the hidden layer and the output layer as shown in fig 6 an mlp with a single hidden layer of nodes venables and ripley 2002 the rectified linear activation function in the hidden layers and the adam algorithm for optimizing the objective function 2 6 7 random forest rf an ensemble technique developed by breiman 2001 is based on a combination of multiple decision trees applied from a parent node to a child node to make repetitive predictions of the target variable as shown in fig 7 the technique combines the performance of numerous decision tree algorithms to predict the arsenic concentration breiman 2001 guo et al 2015 rodriguez galiano et al 2012b each decision tree makes use of a training subset that is chosen randomly without replacement for a number of times equal to the number of trees in the ensemble 2 7 model performance assessment metrics the performance metrics used were mean square error mse root

predicted value o ˆ is the mean of the observed values and p ˆ is the mean of the predicted values 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogeochemical variation of arsenic concentration and other parameters the summary statistics of the various hydrochemical parameters are given in table 2 in regard to the physicochemical parameters ph varied in the range of 4 20 10 47 with a mean of 7 29 for surface water sources 4 44 10 29 with a mean of 6 77 for groundwater and 4 90 8 18 with a mean of 6 41 for drinking water this implies that the samples show moderately acidic to slightly alkaline ph the acidic ph in some of the samples may be as a result of the presence of alkaline materials in the aquifer system which facilitated the accumulation of rainwater acidity and other anthropogenic sources thereby decreasing the ph ewusi et al 2017a 2017b moreover the dissolution of carbonate minerals mixes with surface water and groundwater to increase the ph ec of water is the capacity of the water to produce electrical charges and thus its ability to conduct electricity the ec is always directly related to the total dissolved solids tds in the water when compared with the guideline value of 2500 μs cm who 2017 the ec values in surface water samples minimum maximum and mean of 23 20 895 00 and 228 47 μs cm respectively groundwater samples minimum maximum and mean of 20 30 684 02 and 181 89 μs cm respectively and drinking water samples minimum maximum and mean of 4 45 469 00 and 139 17 μs cm respectively were below the guideline value table 2 the relatively higher ec values particularly in some surface water and groundwater samples can be attributed to saline water intrusion from adjacent aquifers and input from anthropogenic activities such as aquaculture and indiscriminate waste disposal in the area tds constitute all organic and inorganic substances in water and usually leaves behind an undesirable taste in drinking water when in higher concentrations nag and suchetana 2016 khan et al 2020 the maximum permissible limit of tds in drinking water as provided by the world health organization is 1000 mg l who 2017 similar to the trend for ec the tds in surface water samples minimum maximum and mean of 11 12 415 00 and 110 71 mg l respectively groundwater samples minimum maximum and mean of 8 81 534 00 and 88 50 mg l respectively and drinking water samples minimum maximum and mean of 9 89 274 00 and 67 75 mg l respectively were below the guideline value table 2 the higher tds concentrations particularly in the surface water samples imply that input from municipal sewage is a major problem in the area considering the presence of several open pit mining activities as well as open landfill sites turbidity is a measure of the clearness and cleanness of water whiles tss is a measure of particles that are larger than 2 μm found in water small particles like clay silt algae and microorganisms can be suspended in water and cause light scattering giving the water a milky or cloudy appearance which can negatively affect its turbidity and tss the turbidity values of the surface water samples minimum maximum and mean of 0 83 1990 00 and 108 55 ntu respectively groundwater samples 0 70 374 00 and 16 47 ntu respectively and drinking water samples 0 04 16 40 and 3 34 ntu respectively exceed the guideline value of 5 ntu who 2017 as shown in table 2 tss on the other hand varied in the range of 1 00 899 00 with a mean of 74 03 for surface water sources 1 00 7650 00 with a mean of 62 89 for groundwater and 1 00 35 00 with a mean of 4 93 for drinking water the surface water and groundwater samples showed relatively high values of turbidity and tss possibly due to heavy rainfall or the disturbances to land near raw water sources due to the adverse mining and farming activities as and other heavy metals such as cd cn cu and hg are often released into the environment as a result of mining and other related activities the as concentrations are in the range of 0 0005 0 0290 mg l with a mean value of 0 0028 mg l for surface water samples 0 0005 0 0350 mg l with a mean value of 0 0019 mg l for groundwater samples and 0 0005 0 0031 mg l with a mean value of 0 0008 mg l for drinking water samples when compared with the guideline value of 0 01 mg l who 2017 the as concentrations of some samples in both surface water and groundwater exceed the guideline value whereas the as of drinking water samples were below the guideline value table 2 the relatively high as concentrations in some surface water and groundwater samples may possibly be due to the severe surface mining of gold bearing rocks which contains sulfide minerals such as pyrite and arsenopyrite borba et al 2003 the elevated arsenic concentrations in groundwater samples can also be attributed to the oxidation of sulphidic aquifers it is worth noting that the concentrations of other heavy metals such as cd cu and hg were below the who guideline values in all surface water groundwater and drinking water samples however cn concentrations in some surface water and groundwater samples exceed the guideline values the use of cn for mineral processing within the area could possibly be the source of elevated cn concentrations in some samples 3 2 importance of input variables the sensitive nature of arsenic contamination requires a monitoring technique that is simpler and cost effective hence the variable importance scores were applied to select input variables of high importance for the modelling process fig 8 shows the variable importance score for all the predictor variables for the top 3 performing models xgb dt and rf using all the 9 predictor variables from fig 8 the best 4 important variables are ph ec tub and tss hence were selected as the final input for modelling the arsenic concentration table 3 shows the performance comparison for the top 3 performing models using either all the 9 variables or the best 4 important variables ph ec tub and tss extracted from the variable importance scores as the input parameters the results show high predictive efficiency of the models built using the 4 important variables i e xgb r dt r and rf r which were indicated by relatively lower mse rmse and a higher nse r2 as complared to the models built using all 9 predictor variables xgb dt and rf 3 3 performance evaluation of models in this section the performances of different machine learning models are assessed based on their predictive capabilities of arsenic concentration the observed and predictive arsenic concentrations for each model were plotted and compared as discussed in the sections below xgb model was built using the xgboost library in python to prevent model complexity the hyperparameters were limited to n estimators max depth and learning rate however the learning rate was fixed at 0 1 to prevent complexities n estimators is discussed in the range of 80 150 and max depth in the range of 4 15 xgb model with n estimators 100 max depth 6 and 0 1 learning rate found to best optimize the objective function and hence selected as an optimum model the xgb model shows a good prediction indicated by a good between the observed and the predicted arsenic concentration as shown in fig 9 a the important parameters considered were n estimators in the range of 90 750 and max depth in the range of 3 12 the restriction of the parameters to only two was to ensure simpler models overall a model with n estimators and max depth of 500 and 5 respectively was chosen as the optimum model although the learning rate is instrumental the default learning rate of 0 1 was found to best optimize the objective function as shown in fig 9b the lgb algorithm showed an accurate prediction of the arsenic concentration it is interesting to note that the predicted arsenic values using the lgb model fit well with the observed values grnn was built using the neupy library package in python software the standard deviation std was the only tunable parameter considered since the predictor variables were normalised in the range of 0 1 the standard deviation was as well discussed in the range of 0 01 1 the network uses lazy learning which implies that the network doesn t need iterative training a grnn model with 0 16 std standard deviation was chosen as the optimum model from fig 9c a good fit exists between the observed and the predicted arsenic concentration as captured by the grnn model with remarkable accuracy the only tunable parameter considered in building the decision tree model was the maximum tree depth within a range of 2 12 a depth of 6 was selected to be the optimum parameter as shown in fig 9d the dt model performed very satisfactorily in estimating the arsenic concentration a good fit exists between the observed and the predicted arsenic concentration as captured by the dt model with remarkable accuracy the mars model was built by varying the different order of interactions namely zero order first order and second order with each variant a maximum of 12 basis functions was used however after the backward elimination stage only 3 basis functions 1 maximum interaction and 2 degrees of freedom for knot optimisation were selected as the optimum the optimum mars model for predicting arsenic concentration is given in eq 22 as 22 a s 0 00089 0 24411 bf 3 0 15773 bf 5 0 00629 bf 7 where bf represent the basis function from table 4 the mars model made use of only two variables ph and ec in estimating the arsenic concentration the final equation for the optimum mars model is given in eq 22 and the corresponding equations for the basis functions are presented in table 4 from fig 9e the model exhibits a satisfactory performance in estimating the arsenic concentration a good fit exists between the observed and the predicted arsenic concentration as captured by the mars model with remarkable accuracy mlp using the keras library was similarly built on the training data the model architecture consisted of 3 layers input hidden and output the number of nodes in each layer was 15 8 and 1 respectively the rectifier relu activation function was used by the hidden layer finally the objective function was optimized using the stochastic gradient descent optimizer adam with mse as loss function from fig 9f the grnn model shows a prediction indicated by a good fit between the observed and the predicted arsenic concentration rf regressor with 150 n estimators and 5 max depth was chosen as the optimum model after an exhaustive manual tuning the parameters to two could not prevent model complexity hence n estimators is discussed in the range of 50 250 and max depth in the range of 2 12 from fig 9g the rf model can fit the arsenic concentration accurately 3 4 comparison of model performance in this section the performances of the machine learning models are assessed using the mse nse and r2 a good performing model should have a lower mse and a higher nse and r2 score r2 values range from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect relationship between the observed and predicted arsenic and 0 representing no statistical correlation between them the nse of 1 corresponds to a perfect match an efficiency of zero indicates the model predictions are only as good as the mean of the observed data whereas an efficiency less than zero means the average value of the observed arsenic concentration is a better predictor than that of the constructed model a summary of the results is presented in table 5 fig 10 shows a plot of the performance of each model fig 10 a and b clearly show that the rf model exhibit slightly higher r2 0 975 and nse 0 974 values compared to other models moreover rf achieved the lowest error measures mse 7 45e 07 among all models studied fig 10c the result therefore implies that the rf model is more suitable for the estimation of arsenic concentration in surface and groundwater it is however important to highlight the remarkable performances by the remaining models dt also achieved very close performance as rf with r2 nse and mse of 0 974 0 972 and 8 03e 07 respectively all the remaining models achieved more than 0 9 efficiencies and a very low error measure essentially all the machine learning models have proven efficient in estimating the arsenic concentration 4 conclusion in this study seven machine learning models extreme gradient boosting xgb light gradient boosting lgb generalized regression neural network grnn decision trees dt multivariate adaptive regression spline mars multilayer perceptron neural network mlp and random forest rf were used to model arsenic as concentration in multiple water sources surface water and groundwater in tarkwa a predominant mining town in ghana the results from the study indicated that based on the variable importance score the four most important input variables were ph ec tss and turbidity the novel machine learning approaches xgb lgb and grnn introduced in this study have also proven efficient in the modelling task and are recommended to be explored in similar studies the rf model achieved the highest predictive performance nse 0 974 r2 0 975 mse 7 45e 07 compared to all the models investigated hence this model can be recommended to be implemented for monitoring arsenic concentration in various water supply systems the dt model also performed remarkably well nse 0 972 r2 0 974 mse 8 03e 07 and could also be used when model interpretability is a concern overall this research work provides a comprehensive assessment of different machine learning methods that would be useful for future prediction and management of arsenic concentration in various water supply systems the results obtained from this study suggest that all the machine learning approaches used in this study have proven efficient in estimating the arsenic concentration although the models used in this study have some predictive capabilities to some degree the data used for validation and testing were very limited to the study area it is therefore recommended that future studies should validate these models with large datasets and also include other parameters

11843,arsenic contamination is increasingly a serious global health concern especially in developing countries like ghana where the intensification of mining activities has resulted in adverse pollution of various water sources within mining communities to harness the early detection of arsenic contamination in multiple water supply systems this work aimed to assess and compare the prediction efficiency of different machine learning methods novel machine learning algorithms such as extreme gradient boosting xgb light gradient boosting lgb and generalized regression neural

satisfactory predictions which were comparable to the state of the art methods thus all the methods applied including the newly introduced models have proven efficient in the arsenic modelling task

2020 arsenic contamination as described by smith et al 2000 as the largest water poisoning has increasingly become a global issue and a serious global environmental challenge jain and ali 2000 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 hughes 2002 choong et al 2007 bhattacharya et al 2007 ahmad et al 2020 over 200 million people globally are estimated to be chronically exposed to arsenic from drinking contaminated water with a concentration above the world health organization who guideline limit of 0 01 mg l naujokas et al 2013 erickson et al 2021 this has resulted in several diseases including cancer in the skin lungs bladder and kidney smith et al 1992 marshall et al 2007 sengupta 2008 jovanovic et al 2013 who 2017 arsenic is primarily introduced into drinking water supply systems e g surface water and groundwater through the dissolution of naturally occurring minerals and ores who 2017 high concentration levels of arsenic in water are usually as a result of oxidation and dissolution of arsenic bearing minerals such as arsenopyrite welch et al 2000 according to abbas et al 2018 weathering and erosion of arsenic bearing rocks are considered the major and most widespread sources of arsenic in water besides the geogenic arsenic intensification of mining activities combined with increasing population and increased water requirements contributes to the rise in arsenic concentration in various water bodies asante et al 2007 bhardwaj et al 2020 nottebaum et al 2020 barats et al 2020 alonso et al 2020 chandio et al 2021 knowledge of arsenic concentrations in drinking water can help determine potential human exposure however quantification of arsenic contamination is a challenge especially in developing countries because it requires well trained technicians sophisticated equipment and expensive analysis park et al 2016 as a result there has been a growing need for alternative methods which is quicker robust and inexpensive to monitor arsenic concentration in water supply systems to ameliorate the challenges researchers have attempted to explore machine learning ml methods as an alternative technique due to their non parametric nature ability to accommodate more parameters and adequately model non linear and complex relationships between variables in fact literature is awash with several successful applications of machine learning in modelling arsenic concentration purkait et al 2008 chowdhury et al 2010 cho et al 2011 park et al 2016 podgorski and berg 2020 chakraborty et al 2020 podgorski et al 2020 tan et al 2020 liang et al 2021 wu et al 2021 lombard et al 2021 the most notable machine learning gathered from these studies include random forest rf boosted regression trees brt and artificial neural network ann table 1 presents a summary of some studies conducted on arsenic modelling using machine learning techniques it is evident that past studies have only applied machine learning to predict arsenic concentration using a single water source that is either surface water source lu et al 2019 or groundwater source ayotte et al 2016 chakraborty et al 2020 tan et al 2020 erickson et al 2021 liang et al 2021 wu et al 2021 lombard et al 2021 however the motivation underlying interest in arsenic concentration modelling suggests that a solution that could be useful in both scenarios surface and groundwater would be much advantageous especially for developing countries where a majority of people continue to rely on both groundwater and surface water for domestic use kemper 2004 howard et al 2006 who 2019 in addition a majority of the previous studies on arsenic modelling were conducted by using and comparing a few machine learning models hence a comparative analysis for a wider scope of machine learning models is yet to be discussed in the literature moreover since no single model fits all problems as according to the no free launch theorem proposed by wolpert and macready 1997 there is also the need for scholars to explore new machine learning models in arsenic concentration modelling furthermore interpretable machine learning models appear not to be widely applied in some parts of the world particularly in developing african countries hence the inability of end users to understand certain machine learning models is often problematic and may result in limited applications kim 2015 lipton 2018 in view of these gaps in the literature this study for the first time applied machine learning algorithms to model arsenic concentration for multiple water sources using combined monitoring data from groundwater surface water and drinking water sources further this study applied and assessed the prediction efficiency of extreme gradient boosting xgb light gradient boosting lgb and generalized regression neural network grnn as novel machine learning techniques in arsenic concentration modelling the choice of these methods was based on their successful application in related hydrological prediction studies cigizoglu 2005 wang et al 2008 rooki et al 2011 heddam 2014 eren et al 2019 fan et al 2019 su and zhao 2020 bhagat et al 2020 yingli et al 2020 to make the present study comprehensive unlike the existing studies involving fewer models additional machine learning models including interpretable models were considered in quantifying arsenic concentration the choice of

2017b osei et al 2021 fig 1 shows a map indicating the location of the study area the area is popularly known for intensive mining of gold and manganese ore with three major large scale mining companies namely goldfields ghana ltd gfgl ghana manganese company gmc and anglogold ashanti iduapriem limited aail and a great number of small scale mining companies operating ewusi et al 2017a 2017b according to the ghana statistical service 2014 groundwater boreholes pipe borne and hand dug wells constitute 70 of drinking water sources and surface water rivers and streams constitute 13 in the study area 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the study area is located lies within the ashanti gold belt of ghana on the unconformable contact between the younger tarkwaian formation to the west and birimian system to the east fig 1 the tarkwaian group considered to be a derived molassic facies of the birimian is made of a sequence in the direction of younging of fluviatile meta sedimentary rocks consisting of the kawere formation banket formation mineralised unit tarkwa phyllites and huni formation junner et al 1942 pigois et al 2003 kesse 1985 ewusi et al 2017a majeed et al 2022 the formation has gained much attention because of the placer gold deposit hosted in the banket formation the gold is mostly concentrated in the basal lowermost horizon with an enriched zone mostly associated with hematite common minerals found in the tarkwaian include chlorites chloritoids calcites sericites quartz and limonites kesse 1985 the style of gold mineralization in the birimian is an epigenetic gold quartz vein deposit associated with disseminated sulfides such as pyrite and arsenopyrite in fractured and sheared zones dzigbodi adjimah 1993 important aquifers in the study area are associated with the development of secondary porosity in the regolith through fissuring and weathering kuma and ewusi 2009 bhattacharya et al 2012 the area is also associated with localized groundwater flow due to the presence of numerous low hills acting as groundwater divides bhattacharya et al 2012 the groundwater is known to be hosted in the soft and easily weathered regolith of the banket and fracture zones within the tarkwaian kuma and ewusi 2009 in the weathered regolith aquifers are known to have relatively low permeability and high porosity and storage due to the presence of clay and silt whereas in the fracture zones they have relatively high transmissivity but low storage bhattacharya et al 2012 kortatsi 2004 estimated groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration are between 11 and 17 and 54 respectively of annual rainfall kuma 2007 the average well depth in the area is 35 4 m borehole yields range between 0 4 m3 h and 18 m3 h with an average of 2 4 m3 h bhattacharya et al 2012 ewusi et al 2021 the main source of recharge for streams and groundwater are the bonsa and ankobra rivers and their tributaries bhattacharya et al 2012 ewusi et al 2021 2 3 arsenic sources and pollution the quality of the water supply systems in the area is highly polluted especially with heavy metals particularly mercury and arsenic ewusi et al 2017b the arsenic in this region may have been derived from zones of gold mineralization in birimian volcano sedimentary rocks and altered sulphide minerals i e pyrite chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite besides the geogenic arsenic anthropogenic activities mining and agriculture in the area is also reported as the main contributor of elevated arsenic concentration in water sources with surface waters being more affected compared to groundwater kusimi and kusimi 2012 essumang 2009 the overall change in arsenic concentration can also be due to thermodynamic changes as a result of aquifer recharge as well as the resulting groundwater level fluctuation levitt et al 2019 sohrabi et al 2021 asante et al 2007 revealed much higher arsenic concentrations in surface waters within the tarkwa mining area 0 0005 0 073 mg l compared to the groundwater 0 0001 0 004 μmg l a high degree of human exposure to arsenic was also reported in a study by asante et al 2008 in their study the mean urinary arsenic concentration was reported to be 0 26 mg l kusimi and kusimi 2012 sampled both groundwater and surface water from 3 communities within the catchment of the major mining companies in the area and reported high arsenic concentration in water beyond the allowable limit 0 01 mg l of who 2017 a recent study by seidu and ewusi 2020 reported a higher carcinogenic risk for arsenic for people living in the area they indicated that consuming groundwater for a long period will increase one chance of acquiring cancer 2 4 sample collection and analysis a total of 387 water samples collected in 2015 were obtained from groundwater 189 surface water 110 and drinking water 87 systems in the study area the measured water parameters included arsenic as cyanide cn cadmium cd mercury hg copper cu total dissolved solids tds total suspended solids tss turbidity tub electrical conductivity ec and ph the statistical summary of all the measured parameters is presented in table 2 the samples were collected in 1 l polyethylene bottles which were washed with dilute hno3 and later rinsed with distilled water prior to the sample collection physicochemical parameters like ph tub tds and ec were measured in the field using hq40d18 series portable meter whiles as was determined using icp ms 2 5 determination of the most effective input variables first based on the ability of a parameter to control arsenic mobilisation ph and tss are widely reported to control arsenic mobilisation acidity and redox potential are sensitive to heavy metals lu et al 2019 and can influence the release of heavy metals wen and allen 1999 and affects their adsorption herut and kress 1997 gundersen and steinnes 2003 a study by zheng et al 2013 has also indicated dissolved solids ability to absorb heavy metals hence due to the sensitive nature of arsenic contamination feature selection of very important variables using variable importance scores by the best 3 performing models on all the 9 input variables was applied variables with a low degree of importance were eliminated from the modelling process as a result 4 important variables were finally extracted and used as input for building the final machine models 2 6 model development machine learning algorithms with few exceptions such as decision trees do not perform well when the input data have different scales geron 2019 therefore the input data was scaled predictor variables to fit the range from 0 to 1 using eq 1 geron 2019 1 x s c a l e x x m i n x m a x x m i n to effectively assess the models 80 of the dataset were used for training the machine learning models and the remaining 20 were used to evaluate their performance testing all 9 measured parameters were used as initial input variables to predict the arsenic concentration the variable importance scores from the best 3 performing models were then used to obtain the four most important variables which served as input in building the final set of models anaconda python was used in the implementation of the models the theoretical concept of the machine learning models is presented in the subsequent sections the workflow of the study is presented in fig 2 2 6 1 extreme gradient boosting xgb is a variant tree boosting algorithm efficient in handling both regression and classification problems chen et al 2015 the concept of the algorithm is to learn the functional relationship between the input and target features through an iterative process in which the individual trees are sequentially trained on the residuals from the previous tree chakraborty et al 2020 as shown in fig 3 this essential method is repeated several times before the stopping requirement is met the resultant is a final function f t representing all the predictions from the trees the final function is represented in eq 2 ullah et al 2021 as 2 f t k 1 t f k x i so doing the algorithm combines weak base learning models into a stronger learner in an iterative manner to optimize the objective function o b j friedman 2001 and it is made up of the training loss and regularisation parameter as defined by eq 3 ibrahim et al 2022 as 3 o b j t l θ s θ where tl is the training loss function θ represents the parameters to be learnt and s is the regularisation term the training loss is used to measure the model performance on training data the regularisation checks the model complexities gao et al 2018 simpler models tend to have a better performance against over fitting as earlier stated the algorithm starts from constant prediction and add a new function f t each time in deciding which function to add the best solution is to optimize the objective function the new optimized objective function represented by taylor s theorem is defined in eq 4 chen and guestrin 2016 as 4 o b j k 1 n q i f t v i 1 2 c i f t 2 v i b f t where q i and c i are taken as input the complexity of a decision tree in xgboost is defined in eq 5 as 5 b f t α a 1 2 λ j 1 l ω j 2 where the α is the complexity of each leaf l is the number of leaves in a decision tree λ is a parameter to scale the penalty and ω is the vector of scores on leaves 2 6 2 light gradient boosting lgb is an improved version of the gradient learning framework based on decision trees and the idea of weak learners ke et al 2017 lgb employs histogram based algorithms ranka and sing 1998 li et al 2007 fan et al 2019 which discretize continuous feature values into k bins and construct a histogram of width k this speeds up training and reduces memory usage unlike the decision tree based models which grow trees level depth wise lgb grows trees using the leaf wise strategy shi 2007 fan et al 2019 this growth strategy makes lgb more efficient because it chooses the leaf with maximum branching gain however the leaf wise strategy may cause over fitting especially when the data is small to remedy this downside lgb includes the maximum depth parameter to limit the tree depth to prevent over fitting while ensuring high efficiency additionally lgb uses gradient based one side sampling goss which uses small gradient data for faster learning chen et al 2019 and exclusive feature bundling efb for bundling the features together the training process of lgb is described as follows li et al 2007 chen et al 2019 the dataset d is first prepared as 6 d d x i y i i 1 n x i r m 1 y i r where n is the number of samples x i i 1 2 3 4 5 n is the m dimensional input vector and y i i 1 2 3 4 5 n is the one dimensional arsenic concentration target the prediction of each tree is added in an additive training process described in eqs 7 10 7 y ˆ i 0 0 8 y ˆ i 1 f 1 x i y ˆ i 0 f 1 x i 9 y ˆ i 2 f 1 x i f 2 x i y ˆ i 1 f 2 x i 10 y ˆ i t k 1 t f k x i where t is the number of trees f k is one of the trees with the leaf scores and it is obtained by minimizing the following objective function using eq 11 11 f f k arg min f k i 1 n l y i y ˆ i k ω f k where l is the training loss function measuring the difference between the predicted arsenic concentration and the observed arsenic concentration ω is the regularisation function that keeps the model complexity in check 2 6 3 generalized regression neural network grnn a powerful memory based network that was introduced by specht 1991 as an improved variant of the radial basis neural networks unlike the radial basis function neural network grnn is a one pass learning algorithm that requires no time consuming iterative process specht 1991 in the case of sparse data grnn provides a smooth transition from one observed value to another even with sparse data in a multidimensional measurement space specht 1991 grnn network structure consists of four layers the input layer two hidden layers pattern and summation layer and the output layer as shown in fig 4 the number of neurons in the hidden layer is usually the number of patterns in the training set since each pattern is represented by one neuron the implementation of grnn is described as follows specht 1991 a vector k of input variables m is received at the starting layer input layer the input layer provides the scaled measurement variables x to the neurons in the second layer pattern layer when the scaled variables x gets to the pattern layer it is subtracted from the already stored vectors in the layer the squared or absolute values of the differences are summed and passed on into radial basis function whose output is further passed on to the summation layer the summation layer contains two neurons the s summation neuron and the d summation neuron the s summation neuron calculates the sum of the weighted outputs of the pattern layer while the d summation neuron calculates the unweighted outputs of the pattern neurons finally the two outputs from the pattern layer reach the output layer the output layer calculates the quotient of the two outputs of the summation layer yielding the desired output value y of the system model for an input vector x the output y f x of the grnn is calculated in eq 12 as 12 y f x i 1 n y i exp b i 2 2 σ 2 i 1 n exp b i 2 2 σ 2 s d where 13 b i 2 x x i 2 x x i in which n is the number of data samples y is the desired output and σ is the smoothing parameter b i 2 is the euclidean distance between the training vector x i 2 6 4 decision trees dts are non parametric machine learning methods used for handling both classification and regression problems unlike the black box algorithms dts are very intuitive kucheryavskiy 2018 and their decisions are easy to interpret géron 2019 the algorithm reaches a decision based on multiple input variables that are organised and split into layers of decision branches in a sequence of a root node internal nodes and terminal nodes as shown in fig 5 after the dt has successfully split the data into two subsets it further splits the resulting subsets recursively using the same logic until the maximum depth specified is reached or it can no longer find a split that minimizes the loss function 2 6 5 multivariate adaptive regression spline mars is a flexible nonparametric regression model viewed as either a generalisation of the recursive partitioning regressions models or as a generalisation of the additive modelling approaches friedman 1991 friedman et al 2008 instead of splitting as in the recursive approaches mars uses an arithmetic notion of addition and multiplication friedman 1991 the starting point is to cast the approximation in the form of an expansion in a set of basis functions as represented in eq 14 14 f x m 1 a m b m x where b m is the mth basis function m is the number of basis functions and a m is the coefficient of the mth basis function then the forward stepwise regression procedure is initiated by setting the initial region to the wider domain and adjusting the coefficient values to best fit the data further good set basis functions are then derived the stepwise linear basis function is of the form x a and a x as shown in eq 15 15 y x a x a i f x a 0 o t h e r w i s e y a x a x i f a x 0 o t h e r w i s e the indexes indicate that only a positive part of the function is used the a parameter is a knot of the basic function and its value represent the location of the knot the knot locations are further used to derive a piecewise cubic basis with continuous first derivatives to produce a final model at this stage of the algorithm the final model consists of the entire basis functions used in the modelling so in a backward stepwise approach mars deletes one basis function at a time as a result the algorithm builds a sequence of n 1 models with each one having one basis function less than the original model after the forward stepwise regression finally the optimal model consisting of all basis functions that involve identical predictor variable sets and minimize the objective function is determined using the generalized cross validation gcv criterion defined in eq 16 friedman 1991 friedman et al 2008 16 g c v λ i 1 n y i h ˆ λ x i 2 1 p λ n 2 where λ is the number of terms y i is the ith response variable ĥ λ x i is the fitted response p λ is the effective number of parameters in the model and n is the number of observations it must be noted that p λ is generally related to the number of basis functions the final optimal model is represented in eq 17 as 17 f x b 0 k m 1 f i x i k m 2 f i j x i x j k m 2 f i j k x i x j x k the first sum represents overall basis functions that involve only a single variable representing a first order interaction here the variables do not interact with each other the second summation is overall basis functions involving exactly two variables representing a second order interaction if specified here maximum interaction is among two variables similarly the third sum is the contributions from three variable interactions with third order interaction and soon 2 6 6 multi layer perceptron neural network mlp inspired by the structure of neurons in the human brain bengio 2009 is an algorithm that mimics the biological nervous system to recognize patterns and objects here the neurons are typically aggregated in layers that generate connections between input and output data mlp explores the nonlinear relationship between input features water quality parameters and output targets arsenic concentration with a representation of weights and biases in the neurons the mlp architecture has three sequential layers the input layer the hidden layer and the output layer as shown in fig 6 an mlp with a single hidden layer of nodes venables and ripley 2002 the rectified linear activation function in the hidden layers and the adam algorithm for optimizing the objective function 2 6 7 random forest rf an ensemble technique developed by breiman 2001 is based on a combination of multiple decision trees applied from a parent node to a child node to make repetitive predictions of the target variable as shown in fig 7 the technique combines the performance of numerous decision tree algorithms to predict the arsenic concentration breiman 2001 guo et al 2015 rodriguez galiano et al 2012b each decision tree makes use of a training subset that is chosen randomly without replacement for a number of times equal to the number of trees in the ensemble 2 7 model performance assessment metrics the performance metrics used were mean square error mse root

predicted value o ˆ is the mean of the observed values and p ˆ is the mean of the predicted values 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogeochemical variation of arsenic concentration and other parameters the summary statistics of the various hydrochemical parameters are given in table 2 in regard to the physicochemical parameters ph varied in the range of 4 20 10 47 with a mean of 7 29 for surface water sources 4 44 10 29 with a mean of 6 77 for groundwater and 4 90 8 18 with a mean of 6 41 for drinking water this implies that the samples show moderately acidic to slightly alkaline ph the acidic ph in some of the samples may be as a result of the presence of alkaline materials in the aquifer system which facilitated the accumulation of rainwater acidity and other anthropogenic sources thereby decreasing the ph ewusi et al 2017a 2017b moreover the dissolution of carbonate minerals mixes with surface water and groundwater to increase the ph ec of water is the capacity of the water to produce electrical charges and thus its ability to conduct electricity the ec is always directly related to the total dissolved solids tds in the water when compared with the guideline value of 2500 μs cm who 2017 the ec values in surface water samples minimum maximum and mean of 23 20 895 00 and 228 47 μs cm respectively groundwater samples minimum maximum and mean of 20 30 684 02 and 181 89 μs cm respectively and drinking water samples minimum maximum and mean of 4 45 469 00 and 139 17 μs cm respectively were below the guideline value table 2 the relatively higher ec values particularly in some surface water and groundwater samples can be attributed to saline water intrusion from adjacent aquifers and input from anthropogenic activities such as aquaculture and indiscriminate waste disposal in the area tds constitute all organic and inorganic substances in water and usually leaves behind an undesirable taste in drinking water when in higher concentrations nag and suchetana 2016 khan et al 2020 the maximum permissible limit of tds in drinking water as provided by the world health organization is 1000 mg l who 2017 similar to the trend for ec the tds in surface water samples minimum maximum and mean of 11 12 415 00 and 110 71 mg l respectively groundwater samples minimum maximum and mean of 8 81 534 00 and 88 50 mg l respectively and drinking water samples minimum maximum and mean of 9 89 274 00 and 67 75 mg l respectively were below the guideline value table 2 the higher tds concentrations particularly in the surface water samples imply that input from municipal sewage is a major problem in the area considering the presence of several open pit mining activities as well as open landfill sites turbidity is a measure of the clearness and cleanness of water whiles tss is a measure of particles that are larger than 2 μm found in water small particles like clay silt algae and microorganisms can be suspended in water and cause light scattering giving the water a milky or cloudy appearance which can negatively affect its turbidity and tss the turbidity values of the surface water samples minimum maximum and mean of 0 83 1990 00 and 108 55 ntu respectively groundwater samples 0 70 374 00 and 16 47 ntu respectively and drinking water samples 0 04 16 40 and 3 34 ntu respectively exceed the guideline value of 5 ntu who 2017 as shown in table 2 tss on the other hand varied in the range of 1 00 899 00 with a mean of 74 03 for surface water sources 1 00 7650 00 with a mean of 62 89 for groundwater and 1 00 35 00 with a mean of 4 93 for drinking water the surface water and groundwater samples showed relatively high values of turbidity and tss possibly due to heavy rainfall or the disturbances to land near raw water sources due to the adverse mining and farming activities as and other heavy metals such as cd cn cu and hg are often released into the environment as a result of mining and other related activities the as concentrations are in the range of 0 0005 0 0290 mg l with a mean value of 0 0028 mg l for surface water samples 0 0005 0 0350 mg l with a mean value of 0 0019 mg l for groundwater samples and 0 0005 0 0031 mg l with a mean value of 0 0008 mg l for drinking water samples when compared with the guideline value of 0 01 mg l who 2017 the as concentrations of some samples in both surface water and groundwater exceed the guideline value whereas the as of drinking water samples were below the guideline value table 2 the relatively high as concentrations in some surface water and groundwater samples may possibly be due to the severe surface mining of gold bearing rocks which contains sulfide minerals such as pyrite and arsenopyrite borba et al 2003 the elevated arsenic concentrations in groundwater samples can also be attributed to the oxidation of sulphidic aquifers it is worth noting that the concentrations of other heavy metals such as cd cu and hg were below the who guideline values in all surface water groundwater and drinking water samples however cn concentrations in some surface water and groundwater samples exceed the guideline values the use of cn for mineral processing within the area could possibly be the source of elevated cn concentrations in some samples 3 2 importance of input variables the sensitive nature of arsenic contamination requires a monitoring technique that is simpler and cost effective hence the variable importance scores were applied to select input variables of high importance for the modelling process fig 8 shows the variable importance score for all the predictor variables for the top 3 performing models xgb dt and rf using all the 9 predictor variables from fig 8 the best 4 important variables are ph ec tub and tss hence were selected as the final input for modelling the arsenic concentration table 3 shows the performance comparison for the top 3 performing models using either all the 9 variables or the best 4 important variables ph ec tub and tss extracted from the variable importance scores as the input parameters the results show high predictive efficiency of the models built using the 4 important variables i e xgb r dt r and rf r which were indicated by relatively lower mse rmse and a higher nse r2 as complared to the models built using all 9 predictor variables xgb dt and rf 3 3 performance evaluation of models in this section the performances of different machine learning models are assessed based on their predictive capabilities of arsenic concentration the observed and predictive arsenic concentrations for each model were plotted and compared as discussed in the sections below xgb model was built using the xgboost library in python to prevent model complexity the hyperparameters were limited to n estimators max depth and learning rate however the learning rate was fixed at 0 1 to prevent complexities n estimators is discussed in the range of 80 150 and max depth in the range of 4 15 xgb model with n estimators 100 max depth 6 and 0 1 learning rate found to best optimize the objective function and hence selected as an optimum model the xgb model shows a good prediction indicated by a good between the observed and the predicted arsenic concentration as shown in fig 9 a the important parameters considered were n estimators in the range of 90 750 and max depth in the range of 3 12 the restriction of the parameters to only two was to ensure simpler models overall a model with n estimators and max depth of 500 and 5 respectively was chosen as the optimum model although the learning rate is instrumental the default learning rate of 0 1 was found to best optimize the objective function as shown in fig 9b the lgb algorithm showed an accurate prediction of the arsenic concentration it is interesting to note that the predicted arsenic values using the lgb model fit well with the observed values grnn was built using the neupy library package in python software the standard deviation std was the only tunable parameter considered since the predictor variables were normalised in the range of 0 1 the standard deviation was as well discussed in the range of 0 01 1 the network uses lazy learning which implies that the network doesn t need iterative training a grnn model with 0 16 std standard deviation was chosen as the optimum model from fig 9c a good fit exists between the observed and the predicted arsenic concentration as captured by the grnn model with remarkable accuracy the only tunable parameter considered in building the decision tree model was the maximum tree depth within a range of 2 12 a depth of 6 was selected to be the optimum parameter as shown in fig 9d the dt model performed very satisfactorily in estimating the arsenic concentration a good fit exists between the observed and the predicted arsenic concentration as captured by the dt model with remarkable accuracy the mars model was built by varying the different order of interactions namely zero order first order and second order with each variant a maximum of 12 basis functions was used however after the backward elimination stage only 3 basis functions 1 maximum interaction and 2 degrees of freedom for knot optimisation were selected as the optimum the optimum mars model for predicting arsenic concentration is given in eq 22 as 22 a s 0 00089 0 24411 bf 3 0 15773 bf 5 0 00629 bf 7 where bf represent the basis function from table 4 the mars model made use of only two variables ph and ec in estimating the arsenic concentration the final equation for the optimum mars model is given in eq 22 and the corresponding equations for the basis functions are presented in table 4 from fig 9e the model exhibits a satisfactory performance in estimating the arsenic concentration a good fit exists between the observed and the predicted arsenic concentration as captured by the mars model with remarkable accuracy mlp using the keras library was similarly built on the training data the model architecture consisted of 3 layers input hidden and output the number of nodes in each layer was 15 8 and 1 respectively the rectifier relu activation function was used by the hidden layer finally the objective function was optimized using the stochastic gradient descent optimizer adam with mse as loss function from fig 9f the grnn model shows a prediction indicated by a good fit between the observed and the predicted arsenic concentration rf regressor with 150 n estimators and 5 max depth was chosen as the optimum model after an exhaustive manual tuning the parameters to two could not prevent model complexity hence n estimators is discussed in the range of 50 250 and max depth in the range of 2 12 from fig 9g the rf model can fit the arsenic concentration accurately 3 4 comparison of model performance in this section the performances of the machine learning models are assessed using the mse nse and r2 a good performing model should have a lower mse and a higher nse and r2 score r2 values range from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect relationship between the observed and predicted arsenic and 0 representing no statistical correlation between them the nse of 1 corresponds to a perfect match an efficiency of zero indicates the model predictions are only as good as the mean of the observed data whereas an efficiency less than zero means the average value of the observed arsenic concentration is a better predictor than that of the constructed model a summary of the results is presented in table 5 fig 10 shows a plot of the performance of each model fig 10 a and b clearly show that the rf model exhibit slightly higher r2 0 975 and nse 0 974 values compared to other models moreover rf achieved the lowest error measures mse 7 45e 07 among all models studied fig 10c the result therefore implies that the rf model is more suitable for the estimation of arsenic concentration in surface and groundwater it is however important to highlight the remarkable performances by the remaining models dt also achieved very close performance as rf with r2 nse and mse of 0 974 0 972 and 8 03e 07 respectively all the remaining models achieved more than 0 9 efficiencies and a very low error measure essentially all the machine learning models have proven efficient in estimating the arsenic concentration 4 conclusion in this study seven machine learning models extreme gradient boosting xgb light gradient boosting lgb generalized regression neural network grnn decision trees dt multivariate adaptive regression spline mars multilayer perceptron neural network mlp and random forest rf were used to model arsenic as concentration in multiple water sources surface water and groundwater in tarkwa a predominant mining town in ghana the results from the study indicated that based on the variable importance score the four most important input variables were ph ec tss and turbidity the novel machine learning approaches xgb lgb and grnn introduced in this study have also proven efficient in the modelling task and are recommended to be explored in similar studies the rf model achieved the highest predictive performance nse 0 974 r2 0 975 mse 7 45e 07 compared to all the models investigated hence this model can be recommended to be implemented for monitoring arsenic concentration in various water supply systems the dt model also performed remarkably well nse 0 972 r2 0 974 mse 8 03e 07 and could also be used when model interpretability is a concern overall this research work provides a comprehensive assessment of different machine learning methods that would be useful for future prediction and management of arsenic concentration in various water supply systems the results obtained from this study suggest that all the machine learning approaches used in this study have proven efficient in estimating the arsenic concentration although the models used in this study have some predictive capabilities to some degree the data used for validation and testing were very limited to the study area it is therefore recommended that future studies should validate these models with large datasets and also include other parameters

11844,sequential iron as fe2 oxidation has been found to yield improved arsenic as as iii uptake than the single step oxidation the objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of interactions with phosphate po4 3 and silicate sio4 2 during sequential fe2 and as iii oxidation and removal as these are typically found in groundwater and known to interfere with as removal the laboratory experiments were performed using single and multi step jar tests with an initial as iii v fe2 po4 3 sio4 2 concentrations and ph of 200 μg l 2 5 mg l 2 mg l 16 mg l and 7 0 respectively representing the targeted natural groundwater in rajshahi district bangladesh the sequential fe2 and as iii oxidation in the multi step jar tests indicated that the po4 3 hindrance on as removal in the first fe2 oxidation step was compensated for in the second moreover smaller fe flocs 0 45 μm were observed in the presence of sio4 2 potentially providing more surface area during the second fe2 oxidation step leading to better overall as removal altogether it may be concluded that controlling the as iii and fe2 oxidation sequence is beneficial for as removal compared to single step fe2 oxidation both in the presence and absence of po4 3 and or sio4 2 graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic iron groundwater oxidation water treatment 1 introduction groundwater contamination with arsenic as is a global concern due to its adverse health effects the contamination of as in drinking water in the bengal delta plain including bangladesh and west bengal india is considered one of the major natural disasters of the 21st century chakraborty et al 2015 harvey et al 2005 ahmed et al 2004 hossain et al 2014 kapaj et al 2006 regular consumption of arsenic contaminated water beyond the standards may lead to chronic diseases such as skin lesions skin bladder and kidney cancer peripheral vascular disease neurological effects hypertension and cardiovascular disease huaming et al 2013 li et al 2012 luzi et al 2004 the world health organization who reported that about 200 million people depend on as contaminated drinking water and approximately 20 of mortalities may be ascribed to as contaminated drinking water in bangladesh and west bengal of india every year jakariya 2007 the world health organization who recommends as values in drinking water below 10 μg l who 2011 whereas 50 μg l is the maximum allowable limit in many high risk countries including bangladesh and india however groundwater in an extended area of bangladesh could have as concentrations beyond these recommended values even exceeding 1500 μgas l haque et al 2018 rosso et al 2011 zecchin et al 2019 therefore the as contaminated groundwater used for drinking requires treatment prior to supply and or consumption the available treatment technologies including adsorption chemical precipitation ion exchange membrane filtration and nanofiltration nf are efficient for arsenate as v removal but not for arsenite as iii bai et al 2016 lytle et al 2007 the reason is that in reducing groundwater at circumneutral ph as iii exists as thermodynamically stable and non ionized h3aso3 cullen and reimer 1989 hou et al 2017 and is thus difficult to remove by adsorption processes in contrast as v is the predominant species in oxidizing conditions and exists as negatively charged h2aso4 and haso4 2 and can thus be adsorbed to adsorbents e g fe oxides lafferty et al 2010 meng et al 2000 villalobos et al 2014 therefore oxidation of as iii to as v is required for effective as removal either by chemical oxidants or natural processes gude et al 2018 hu et al 2012 pio et al 2015 ryu et al 2017 however the use of chemical oxidants is energy intensive costly and increases the complexity of the treatment methods arsenic co precipitation with fe is a well known treatment method implemented in many countries ahmed 2001 li et al 2012 sharma et al 2016 sorensen and mcbean 2015 tian et al 2017 however despite having sufficient fe as ratio for as removal in as affected shallow groundwater annaduzzaman et al 2018 biswas et al 2012 native fe based as removal is not considered as a effective barrier for as removal importantly the removal efficiency of as using hydrous ferric oxides hfo such as ferrihydrite hagstroem 2017 is highly efficient however over time the transformation of poorly crystalline hfo flocs to more crystalline precipitates e g hematite or goethite reduces as removal efficiency huo et al 2017 recent studies have suggested that as co precipitation with freshly formed hfo flocs can be 3 8 to 4 1 times more efficient than pre formed hfo flocs or more stable fe oxides hering et al 1996 holm 2002 ryu et al 2017 e g during oxidation of groundwater native fe2 into hfo flocs annaduzzaman et al 2021b klas and kirk 2013 sorensen and mcbean 2015 fe2 oxidation is also known to stimulate as iii oxidation by fenton like chemical reactions and the formation of reactive oxidation species ros hug et al 2001 hug and leupin 2003 contributing to more effective as uptake however the source water composition heavily influences as removal efficiency with fe2 mediated hfo flocs the groundwater of bangladesh also contains high concentrations of po4 3 0 2 18 mg l and sio4 2 6 54 mg l which is not desirable in drinking water meng et al 2001 the who does not have any standard for po4 3 and sio4 2 but bangladesh drinking water standard for po4 3 is 6 mg l hug et al 2008 furthermore phosphate po4 3 and silicate sio4 2 are the most common hindering oxyanions for as removal with hfo flocs kanematsu et al 2013 li et al 2012 meng et al 2000 van genuchten et al 2012 although po4 3 and as v have similar affinities to hfo flocs surfaces liu et al 2001 sahai et al 2007 as removal with hfo flocs may considerably be reduced as po4 3 is generally present in higher concentrations than as kanematsu et al 2013 li et al 2012 in addition guan et al 2009 stated that at a ph ranging from 4 to 5 the presence of 10 mg l sio4 2 does not affect as removal by fe oxides möller and sylvester 2008 however at higher ph ranging from 6 to 9 as removal decreases by 5 53 respectively other authors have mentioned that with the presence of 10 mg l sio4 2 meng et al 2000 and 2 mg l of po4 3 chanpiwat et al 2017 as removal per mg of fe dropped from 90 to 28 and 35 respectively apart from competition on adsorption sites the presence of po4 3 also influences the structure composition and identity of hfo flocs where sio4 2 explicitly affects the size of hfo thus affecting as removal van genuchten et al 2014 some authors have reported that sequential fe2 dosages and oxidation could be beneficial for as removal roberts et al 2004 senn et al 2018 roberts et al 2004 revealed that in the presence of 30 mg l sio4 2 and 3 mg l po4 3 the sequential fe2 addition and oxidation only required 20 25 mg l of fe2 for achieving a filtrate as concentration of 50 μg l from an initial as concentration of 500 μg l whereas single step addition and oxidation required 50 55 mg l of fe2 however these studies were conducted in the laboratory considering high as fe po4 3 and sio4 2 levels which is not common in most situations our previous pilot scale studies revealed that sequential oxidation of groundwater native fe2 of 2 33 mg l using anoxic storage followed by aeration filtration facilitated high as removal 80 μgas mgfe compared to the oxic storage system 45 μgas mgfe from initial as concentration of 329 μg l annaduzzaman et al 2021a 2021b therefore it is hypothesized that the

annaduzzaman et al 2021a before the second fe2 dosing 20 mg l of 12 5 cl containing naocl solution was added after 60 min of the first step to oxidize the remaining as iii concentration and observed another 60 min to simulate total as iii oxidation in practice by e g biological processes in sand filters this would therefore allow for determining the residual as v adsorption capacity of the

the anova test was used to determine the significant difference among triplicate results the consistent lower p value 0 05 for as fe po4 3 and sio4 2 removal at different experimental conditions which means that the removal was statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 as iii and as v removal by single step fe2 oxidation fig 1 represents the removal of total as during the control experiments under single step fe2 oxidation in the absence of po4 3 and sio4 2 the control jar tests contained an initial 200 μg l of as iii or as v and either 2 5 mgfe2 l or 1 25 mgfe2 l symbols present the data points and the lines represent the pseudo second order kinetic model based as removal the initial do orp and t in the jar tests were 7 9 0 4 mg l 267 25 mv and 20 2 c respectively which were kept constant within 5 during the experimental duration with a p value of 0 05 the as iii removal stabilized after approximately 30 min to 50 55 μg l and 90 94 μg l for the jar containing 1 25 mgfe2 l and 2 5 mgfe2 l respectively after complete fe2 oxidation 2 min only minor as iii oxidation is to be expected as such the decrease in as iii concentration over time was likely caused by its direct adsorption to hfo flocs han et al 2016 and increased equilibrium ph to 7 7 0 1 from the initial ph of 7 0 roberts et al 2004 also found that as iii oxidation was limited to 200 250 μg l 40 50 during batch experiments containing 500 μg l of as iii and 5 50 mgfe2 l when we dosed as v however as removal was 190 2 μg l 95 within 2 min after dosing 2 5 mgfe2 l see fig 1 afterward no further adsorption of as v was observed illustrating that as v removal was limited by the hfo adsorption capacity and not by the kinetics of adsorption based upon the removal in the as v experiments the maximum as removal capacity for the single step aeration was 76 μgas mgfe p 0 05 similar to the previously found 70 80 μgas mgfe annaduzzaman et al 2021b katsoyiannis et al 2008 roberts et al 2004 when as was present as as iii the available capacity of hfo for as uptake was only utilized for 38 μgas mgfe p 0 05 for both as iii and as v the observed as removal from the jar tests were found to be best fitted with pseudo second order kinetic model compared to the pseudo first order model detailed in si which is in line with previous studies song et al 2019 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 the model rate constant k2 was found to be 1 34 10 3 mg μg 1 min 1 and 6 04 10 3 mg μg 1 min 1 for as iii with 1 25 μg l and 2 5 mg l of fe2 respectively whereas for as v with 2 5 mg l of fe2 the model rate constant k2 was 7 15 10 2 mg μg 1 min 1 the observed rate constant k2 for as v adsorption was higher than as iii indicating that the as v removal was faster than that of as iii similar results were also attained in previous studies for as iii and as v adsorption by fe based adsorbent e g ferrihydrite pena et al 2005 nanocrystalline titanium dioxide stumm 1997 and fe modified bone char begum et al 2016 3 2 effect of po4 3 and sio4 2 on as removal by single step fe2 oxidation the results in fig 2 indicate that in the presence of po4 3 or sio4 2 as iii and as v removal decreased compared to the control experiments for the po4 3 containing single step jar tests the removal of as iii and as v after 60 min was 40 μg l and 173 μg l respectively p 0 05 for the sio4 2 containing systems the as iii and as v removal was 82 μg l and 184 μg l correspondingly which was in line with earlier studies into the competition of po4 3 and sio4 2 with as onto precipitating fe oxides chanpiwat et al 2017 holm 2002 roberts et al 2004 senn et al 2018 voegelin et al 2010 the removal of as also followed pseudo second order kinetics meaning removal was chemisorption where the model rate constant k2 for the po4 3 containing system was 9 68 10 3 mg μg 1 min 1 and 1 23 10 2 mg μg 1 min 1 for as iii and as v respectively for the sio4 2 containing system the rate constant k2 was 1 03 10 2 mg μg 1 min 1 and 1 41 10 2 mg μg 1 min 1 for as iii and as v respectively the presence of both po4 3 and sio4 2 showed a substantial decrease in the removal efficiency of as iii and as v in the single step fe2 oxidation system fig 3 after 60 min the removal was 62 μg l and 157 μg l for a iii and as v respectively p 0 05 under similar conditions davis et al 2014 reasoned that the formation of ferrihydrite polymerization might be interrupted by po4 3 and sio4 2 which could affect overall as removal in the system with both po4 3 and sio4 2 as removal was higher than in the presence of po4 3 only indicating that sio4 2 might partially compensate for the inhibitory effects of po4 3 on as removal which was also reported by su and puls 2001 fig 4 presents the hfo floc sizes for the experiments with and without po4 3 in the presence of sio4 2 and as iii as v it can be observed that in the presence of po4 3 the floc sizes measured as removal by 0 45 and 0 2 μm filters are particularly smaller within the first 2 min indicating po4 3 sio4 2 fe interaction from the start of the reaction followed by gradual growth of these flocs in the presence of sio4 2 the flocs were the smallest 0 2 μm which might have reduced the po4 3 effect on overall as removal because of a larger specific adsorption surface area the phreeqc model study indicated the required fe as ratios g g for 95 as removal was 30 55 either in the absence and presence of po4 3 and sio4 2 with the initial as iii where for as v containing jar system the ratio was 11 20 table s1 and the experimental fe as ratio was 10 24 3 3 sequential oxidation of fe2 and as iii fig 5 represents the as iii removal after sequential oxidation of fe2 and as iii either in the presence or absence of po4 3 and or sio4 2 in these experiments the fe2 concentration of 2 5 mg l was introduced in two sequential steps before and after dosing the oxidant 20 mg l naocl for as iii oxidation in between dosing enough time 60 min was reserved for the complete oxidation of as iii and removal of oxidized as v by residual adsorption capacity of previously hfo flocs the oxidation of the first 1 25 mgfe2 l yielded an as iii removal of 55 μg l for the control experiments without po4 3 and sio4 2 and 52 26 and 40 μg l for sio4 2 po4 3 and both po4 3 and sio4 2 respectively p 0 05 the addition of the oxidant in the as iii oxidation step after the first fe2 oxidation step led to the instant oxidation of as iii to as v data in si showing a residual adsorption capacity of the previously precipitated hfo flocs for as v of 64 μg l in the control experiments this residual as v adsorption capacity was lower in the presence of po4 3 and or sio4 2 namely between 14 and 41 μg l the overall as uptake by the first fe2 dosing followed by the as iii oxidation step was 119 μgas mgfe p 0 05 in the absence of po4 3 and sio4 2 and 93 40 and 61 μgas mgfe when sio4 2 po4 3 and both po4 3 and sio4 2 were added respectively the uptake of as by hfo flocs was thus 2 3 times more effective in the absence of po4 3 than in the presence of po4 3 this underlines the previously reported po4 3 competition for hfo sites and changing the hfo structures davis et al 2014 he et al 1996 lytle and snoeyink 2002 resulting in the unavailability of hfo adsorption sites for dissolved as v fig 6 shows that po4 3 removal was approaching 90 in both experiments after dosing the first 1 25 mg l fe2 the uptake of as v after oxidant dosing was slightly better in the presence of both po4 3 and sio4 2 than po4 3 only which is in line with earlier observations that sio4 2 might partially compensate for the inhibitory effect of po4 3 su and puls 2001 robert et al 2004 studies reported that under sequential fe2 oxidation the required fe as ratio for 95 as removal was 40 50 mg mg instead of 80 90 mg mg in the single step oxidation process however our previous natural groundwater based pilot scale studies revealed that under step wise aeration oxidation 10 mg mg of fe as ratio could be sufficient for as removal annaduzzaman et al 2021a consequently this laboratory based sequential fe2 oxidation study revealed that the required fe as ratio of 10 15 mg mg could be sufficient to reach as concentration below 50 μg l either in the presence absence of po4 3 and sio4 2 with the introduction of the remaining 1 25 mg l of fe2 in the second step a substantial amount of available as v was removed by the newly formed hfo flocs fig 5 particularly in the presence of po4 3 obviously the starting conditions for this final step were not the same in all jars e g as v concentrations were lowest for the control and highest in the presence of po4 3 nevertheless the initial hindrance observed due to po4 3 is apparently compensated during the second fe2 dosing due to the removal of po4 3 during the first fe2 dosing 4 conclusion the objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of interactions with phosphate po4 3 and silicate sio4 2 during sequential fe2 and as iii oxidation as these are typically found in groundwater and known to interfere with as removal the research was conducted in single and multi step jar tests with initial as iii v fe2 concentrations and ph of 200 μg l 2 5 mg l and 7 0 respectively representing the targeted groundwater in bangladesh the sequential fe2 and as iii oxidation in the multi step jar tests indicated that the hindrance by po4 3 in the first fe2 oxidation step was compensated for in the second moreover smaller fe flocs 0 45 μm were observed in the presence of sio4 2 potentially providing more surface area during the second fe2 oxidation step leading to better overall as removal the present study specifies that the sequential fe2 could be a promising method for as removal with fe as ratios as low as 10 15 mg mg either in the presence absence of po4 3 and sio4 2 altogether it may be concluded that controlling the as iii and fe2 oxidation sequence is beneficial for as removal in the presence and absence of po4 3 and or sio4 2 however before applying this sequential fe2 oxidation method for as removal further investigation is recommended considering other contaminant effects declaration of

11844,sequential iron as fe2 oxidation has been found to yield improved arsenic as as iii uptake than the single step oxidation the objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of interactions with phosphate po4 3 and silicate sio4 2 during sequential fe2 and as iii oxidation and removal as these are typically found in groundwater and known to interfere with as removal the laboratory experiments were performed using single and multi step jar tests with an initial as iii v fe2 po4 3 sio4 2 concentrations and ph of 200 μg l 2 5 mg l 2 mg l 16 mg l and 7 0 respectively representing the targeted natural groundwater in rajshahi district bangladesh the sequential fe2 and as iii oxidation in the multi step jar tests indicated that the po4 3 hindrance on as removal in the first fe2 oxidation step was compensated for in the second moreover smaller fe flocs 0 45 μm were observed in the presence of sio4 2 potentially providing more surface area during the second fe2 oxidation step leading to better overall as removal altogether it may be concluded that controlling the as iii and fe2 oxidation sequence is beneficial for as removal compared to single step fe2 oxidation both in the presence and absence of po4 3 and or sio4 2 graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic iron groundwater oxidation water treatment 1 introduction groundwater contamination with arsenic as is a global concern due to its adverse health effects the contamination of as in drinking water in the bengal delta plain including bangladesh and west bengal india is considered one of the major natural disasters of the 21st century chakraborty et al 2015 harvey et al 2005 ahmed et al 2004 hossain et al 2014 kapaj et al 2006 regular consumption of arsenic contaminated water beyond the standards may lead to chronic diseases such as skin lesions skin bladder and kidney cancer peripheral vascular disease neurological effects hypertension and cardiovascular disease huaming et al 2013 li et al 2012 luzi et al 2004 the world health organization who reported that about 200 million people depend on as contaminated drinking water and approximately 20 of mortalities may be ascribed to as contaminated drinking water in bangladesh and west bengal of india every year jakariya 2007 the world health organization who recommends as values in drinking water below 10 μg l who 2011 whereas 50 μg l is the maximum allowable limit in many high risk countries including bangladesh and india however groundwater in an extended area of bangladesh could have as concentrations beyond these recommended values even exceeding 1500 μgas l haque et al 2018 rosso et al 2011 zecchin et al 2019 therefore the as contaminated groundwater used for drinking requires treatment prior to supply and or consumption the available treatment technologies including adsorption chemical precipitation ion exchange membrane filtration and nanofiltration nf are efficient for arsenate as v removal but not for arsenite as iii bai et al 2016 lytle et al 2007 the reason is that in reducing groundwater at circumneutral ph as iii exists as thermodynamically stable and non ionized h3aso3 cullen and reimer 1989 hou et al 2017 and is thus difficult to remove by adsorption processes in contrast as v is the predominant species in oxidizing conditions and exists as negatively charged h2aso4 and haso4 2 and can thus be adsorbed to adsorbents e g fe oxides lafferty et al 2010 meng et al 2000 villalobos et al 2014 therefore oxidation of as iii to as v is required for effective as removal either by chemical oxidants or natural processes gude et al 2018 hu et al 2012 pio et al 2015 ryu et al 2017 however the use of chemical oxidants is energy intensive costly and increases the complexity of the treatment methods arsenic co precipitation with fe is a well known treatment method implemented in many countries ahmed 2001 li et al 2012 sharma et al 2016 sorensen and mcbean 2015 tian et al 2017 however despite having sufficient fe as ratio for as removal in as affected shallow groundwater annaduzzaman et al 2018 biswas et al 2012 native fe based as removal is not considered as a effective barrier for as removal importantly the removal efficiency of as using hydrous ferric oxides hfo such as ferrihydrite hagstroem 2017 is highly efficient however over time the transformation of poorly crystalline hfo flocs to more crystalline precipitates e g hematite or goethite reduces as removal efficiency huo et al 2017 recent studies have suggested that as co precipitation with freshly formed hfo flocs can be 3 8 to 4 1 times more efficient than pre formed hfo flocs or more stable fe oxides hering et al 1996 holm 2002 ryu et al 2017 e g during oxidation of groundwater native fe2 into hfo flocs annaduzzaman et al 2021b klas and kirk 2013 sorensen and mcbean 2015 fe2 oxidation is also known to stimulate as iii oxidation by fenton like chemical reactions and the formation of reactive oxidation species ros hug et al 2001 hug and leupin 2003 contributing to more effective as uptake however the source water composition heavily influences as removal efficiency with fe2 mediated hfo flocs the groundwater of bangladesh also contains high concentrations of po4 3 0 2 18 mg l and sio4 2 6 54 mg l which is not desirable in drinking water meng et al 2001 the who does not have any standard for po4 3 and sio4 2 but bangladesh drinking water standard for po4 3 is 6 mg l hug et al 2008 furthermore phosphate po4 3 and silicate sio4 2 are the most common hindering oxyanions for as removal with hfo flocs kanematsu et al 2013 li et al 2012 meng et al 2000 van genuchten et al 2012 although po4 3 and as v have similar affinities to hfo flocs surfaces liu et al 2001 sahai et al 2007 as removal with hfo flocs may considerably be reduced as po4 3 is generally present in higher concentrations than as kanematsu et al 2013 li et al 2012 in addition guan et al 2009 stated that at a ph ranging from 4 to 5 the presence of 10 mg l sio4 2 does not affect as removal by fe oxides möller and sylvester 2008 however at higher ph ranging from 6 to 9 as removal decreases by 5 53 respectively other authors have mentioned that with the presence of 10 mg l sio4 2 meng et al 2000 and 2 mg l of po4 3 chanpiwat et al 2017 as removal per mg of fe dropped from 90 to 28 and 35 respectively apart from competition on adsorption sites the presence of po4 3 also influences the structure composition and identity of hfo flocs where sio4 2 explicitly affects the size of hfo thus affecting as removal van genuchten et al 2014 some authors have reported that sequential fe2 dosages and oxidation could be beneficial for as removal roberts et al 2004 senn et al 2018 roberts et al 2004 revealed that in the presence of 30 mg l sio4 2 and 3 mg l po4 3 the sequential fe2 addition and oxidation only required 20 25 mg l of fe2 for achieving a filtrate as concentration of 50 μg l from an initial as concentration of 500 μg l whereas single step addition and oxidation required 50 55 mg l of fe2 however these studies were conducted in the laboratory considering high as fe po4 3 and sio4 2 levels which is not common in most situations our previous pilot scale studies revealed that sequential oxidation of groundwater native fe2 of 2 33 mg l using anoxic storage followed by aeration filtration facilitated high as removal 80 μgas mgfe compared to the oxic storage system 45 μgas mgfe from initial as concentration of 329 μg l annaduzzaman et al 2021a 2021b therefore it is hypothesized that the preference of fe3 po4 3 complexation and po4 3 removal over as in the first fe2 oxidation step could improve overall as removal in the following fe2 oxidation step thus this novel study was conducted

present the data points and the lines represent the pseudo second order kinetic model based as removal the initial do orp and t in the jar tests were 7 9 0 4 mg l 267 25 mv and 20 2 c respectively which were kept constant within 5 during the experimental duration with a p value of 0 05 the as iii removal stabilized after approximately 30 min to 50 55 μg l and 90 94 μg l for the jar containing 1 25 mgfe2 l and 2 5 mgfe2 l respectively after complete fe2 oxidation 2 min only minor as iii oxidation is to be expected as such the decrease in as iii concentration over time was likely caused by its direct adsorption to hfo flocs han et al 2016 and increased equilibrium ph to 7 7 0 1 from the initial ph of 7 0 roberts et al 2004 also found that as iii oxidation was limited to 200 250 μg l 40 50 during batch experiments containing 500 μg l of as iii and 5 50 mgfe2 l when we dosed as v however as removal was 190 2 μg l 95 within 2 min after dosing 2 5 mgfe2 l see fig 1 afterward no further adsorption of as v was observed illustrating that as v removal was limited by the hfo adsorption capacity and not by the kinetics of adsorption based upon the removal in the as v experiments the maximum as removal capacity for the single step aeration was 76 μgas mgfe p 0 05 similar to the previously found 70 80 μgas mgfe annaduzzaman et al 2021b katsoyiannis et al 2008 roberts et al 2004 when as was present as as iii the available capacity of hfo for as uptake was only utilized for 38 μgas mgfe p 0 05 for both as iii and as v the observed as removal from the jar tests were found to be best fitted with pseudo second order kinetic model compared to the pseudo first order model detailed in si which is in line with previous studies song et al 2019 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 the model rate constant k2 was found to be 1 34 10 3 mg μg 1 min 1 and 6 04 10 3 mg μg 1 min 1 for as iii with 1 25 μg l and 2 5 mg l of fe2 respectively whereas for as v with 2 5 mg l of fe2 the model rate constant k2 was 7 15 10 2 mg μg 1 min 1 the observed rate constant k2 for as v adsorption was higher than as iii indicating that the as v removal was faster than that of as iii similar results were also attained in previous studies for as iii and as v adsorption by fe based adsorbent e g ferrihydrite pena et al 2005 nanocrystalline titanium dioxide stumm 1997 and fe modified bone char begum et al 2016 3 2 effect of po4 3 and sio4 2 on as removal by single step fe2 oxidation the results in fig 2 indicate that in the presence of po4 3 or sio4 2 as iii and as v removal decreased compared to the control experiments for the po4 3 containing single step jar tests the removal of as iii and as v after 60 min was 40 μg l and 173 μg l respectively p 0 05 for the sio4 2 containing systems the as iii and as v removal was 82 μg l and 184 μg l correspondingly which was in line with earlier studies into the competition of po4 3 and sio4 2 with as onto precipitating fe oxides chanpiwat et al 2017 holm 2002 roberts et al 2004 senn et al 2018 voegelin et al 2010 the removal of as also followed pseudo second order kinetics meaning removal was chemisorption where the model rate constant k2 for the po4 3 containing system was 9 68 10 3 mg μg 1 min 1 and 1 23 10 2 mg μg 1 min 1 for as iii and as v respectively for the sio4 2 containing system the rate constant k2 was 1 03 10 2 mg μg 1 min 1 and 1 41 10 2 mg μg 1 min 1 for as iii and as v respectively the presence of both po4 3 and sio4 2 showed a substantial decrease in the removal efficiency of as iii and as v in the single step fe2 oxidation system fig 3 after 60 min the removal was 62 μg l and 157 μg l for a iii and as v respectively p 0 05 under similar conditions davis et al 2014 reasoned that the formation of ferrihydrite polymerization might be interrupted by po4 3 and sio4 2 which could affect overall as removal in the system with both po4 3 and sio4 2 as removal was higher than in the presence of po4 3 only indicating that sio4 2 might partially compensate for the inhibitory effects of po4 3 on as removal which was also reported by su and puls 2001 fig 4 presents the hfo floc sizes for the experiments with and without po4 3 in the presence of sio4 2 and as iii as v it can be observed that in the presence of po4 3 the floc sizes measured as removal by 0 45 and 0 2 μm filters are particularly smaller within the first 2 min indicating po4 3 sio4 2 fe interaction from the start of the reaction followed by gradual growth of these flocs in the presence of sio4 2 the flocs were the smallest 0 2 μm which might have reduced the po4 3 effect on overall as removal because of a larger specific adsorption surface area the phreeqc model study indicated the required fe as ratios g g for 95 as removal was 30 55 either in the absence and presence of po4 3 and sio4 2 with the initial as iii where for as v containing jar system the ratio was 11 20 table s1 and the experimental fe as ratio was 10 24 3 3 sequential oxidation of fe2 and as iii fig 5 represents the as iii removal after sequential oxidation of fe2 and as iii either in the presence or absence of po4 3 and or sio4 2 in these experiments the fe2 concentration of 2 5 mg l was introduced in two sequential steps before and after dosing the oxidant 20 mg l naocl for as iii oxidation in between dosing enough time 60 min was reserved for the complete oxidation of as iii and removal of oxidized as v by residual adsorption capacity of previously hfo flocs the oxidation of the first 1 25 mgfe2 l yielded an as iii removal of 55 μg l for the control experiments without po4 3 and sio4 2 and 52 26 and 40 μg l for sio4 2 po4 3 and both po4 3 and sio4 2 respectively p 0 05 the addition of the oxidant in the as iii oxidation step after the first fe2 oxidation step led to the instant oxidation of as iii to as v data in si showing a residual adsorption capacity of the previously precipitated hfo flocs for as v of 64 μg l in the control experiments this residual as v adsorption capacity was lower in the presence of po4 3 and or sio4 2 namely between 14 and 41 μg l the overall as uptake by the first fe2 dosing followed by the as iii oxidation step was 119 μgas mgfe p 0 05 in the absence of po4 3 and sio4 2 and 93 40 and 61 μgas mgfe when sio4 2 po4 3 and both po4 3 and sio4 2 were added respectively the uptake of as by hfo flocs was thus 2 3 times more effective in the absence of po4 3 than in the presence of po4 3 this underlines the previously reported po4 3 competition for hfo sites and changing the hfo structures davis et al 2014 he et al 1996 lytle and snoeyink 2002 resulting in the unavailability of hfo adsorption sites for dissolved as v fig 6 shows that po4 3 removal was approaching 90 in both experiments after dosing the first 1 25 mg l fe2 the uptake of as v after oxidant dosing was slightly better in the presence of both po4 3 and sio4 2 than po4 3 only which is in line with earlier observations that sio4 2 might partially compensate for the inhibitory effect of po4 3 su and puls 2001 robert et al 2004 studies reported that under sequential fe2 oxidation the required fe as ratio for 95 as removal was 40 50 mg mg instead of 80 90 mg mg in the single step oxidation process however our previous natural groundwater based pilot scale studies revealed that under step wise aeration oxidation 10 mg mg of fe as ratio could be sufficient for as removal annaduzzaman et al 2021a consequently this laboratory based sequential fe2 oxidation study revealed that the required fe as ratio of 10 15 mg mg could be sufficient to reach as concentration below 50 μg l either in the presence absence of po4 3 and sio4 2 with the introduction of the remaining 1 25 mg l of fe2 in the second step a substantial amount of available as v was removed by the newly formed hfo flocs fig 5 particularly in the presence of po4 3 obviously the starting conditions for this final step were not the same in all jars e g as v concentrations were lowest for the control and highest in the presence of po4 3 nevertheless the initial hindrance observed due to po4 3 is apparently compensated during the second fe2 dosing due to the removal of po4 3 during the first fe2 dosing 4 conclusion the objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of interactions with phosphate po4 3 and silicate sio4 2 during sequential fe2 and as iii oxidation as these are typically found in groundwater and known to interfere with as removal the research was conducted in single and multi step jar tests with initial as iii v fe2 concentrations and ph of 200 μg l 2 5 mg l and 7 0 respectively representing the targeted groundwater in bangladesh the sequential fe2 and as iii oxidation in the multi step jar tests indicated that the hindrance by po4 3 in the first fe2 oxidation step was compensated for in the second moreover smaller fe flocs 0 45 μm were observed in the presence of sio4 2 potentially providing more surface area during the second fe2 oxidation step leading to better overall as removal the present study specifies that the sequential fe2 could be a promising method for as removal with fe as ratios as low as 10 15 mg mg either in the presence absence of po4 3 and sio4 2 altogether it may be concluded that controlling the as iii and fe2 oxidation sequence is beneficial for as removal in the presence and absence of po4 3 and or sio4 2 however before applying this sequential fe2 oxidation method for as removal further investigation is recommended considering other contaminant effects declaration of
