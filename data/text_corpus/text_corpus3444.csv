17220,real time acquisition of indicator bacteria concentration at the inlet of disinfection unit is a fundamental support to the control of chemical and ultraviolet wastewater disinfection culture based enumeration methods need time consuming laboratory analyses which give results after several hours or days while newest biosensors rarely provide information about specific strains and outputs are not directly comparable with regulatory limits as a consequence of measurement principles in this work a novel soft sensor approach for virtual real time monitoring of e coli concentration is proposed conventional wastewater physical and chemical indicators chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen nitrate ammonia total suspended solids conductivity ph turbidity and absorbance at 254 nm and flowrate were studied as potential predictors of e coli concentration relying on data collected from three full scale wastewater treatment plants different methods were compared i linear modeling via ordinary least squares ii ridge regression iii principal component regression and partial least squares iv non linear modeling through artificial neural networks linear soft sensors reached some degree of accuracy but performances of the artificial neural network based models were by far superior sensitivity analysis allowed to prioritize the importance of each predictor and to highlight the site specific nature of the approach because of the site specific nature of relationships between predictors and e coli concentration in one case study ph and conductivity worked as good proxy variables when the occurrence of intense rain events caused sharp increases in e coli concentration differently in other case studies chemical oxygen demand total suspended solids turbidity and absorbance at 254 nm accounted for the positive correlation between low wastewater quality and e coli concentration moreover sensitivity analysis of artificial neural network models highlighted the importance of interactions among predictors contributing to 25 to 30 of the model output variance this evidence along with performance results supported the idea that nonlinear families of models should be preferred in the estimation of e coli concentration the artificial neural network based soft sensor deployment for control of peracetic acid disinfectant dosage was simulated over a realistic scenario of wastewater quality recorded by on line sensors over 2 months the scenario simulations highlighted the significant benefit of an e coli soft sensor which provided up to 57 of

uv254 absorbance at 254 nm vsa variance based sensitivity analysis wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction chemical and ultraviolet uv disinfection are two effective solutions for wastewater treatment inter alia mezzanotte et al 2007 while the concentration of chemical disinfectant or uv radiation intensity and the contact time are the two fundamental process parameters in determining pathogen inactivation proper control of the disinfectant dosage can compensate contact time variations and preserve disinfection efficiency as recently demonstrated by manoli et al 2019 this issue is particularly important when wastewater is treated for reuse which implies strict limits on microbial indicators in the effluent for example the european parliament recently approved the new regulation for agricultural wastewater reuse the european parliament and the council of the european union 2020 where limits on e coli concentration after treatments are 10 or 100 cfu 100 ml depending on the type of crops and irrigation techniques nevertheless the disinfection process is strongly affected by many sources of uncertainty which cause high variability of the process efficiency with respect to the desired performance setpoint particularly the concentration of the indicator bacteria entering disinfection is highly variable as a result of the variability of raw wastewater characteristics upstream treatment layout and deviation from nominal conditions of wastewater treatment plants wwtp moreover intense rain events can cause fluctuations of order of magnitudes in bacteria concentration the first reason of inlet indicator bacteria concentration importance on disinfection is straightforward the higher the load the higher the required reduction given a discharge limit to comply with in addition bacteria concentration can significantly affect inactivation kinetics haas and kaymak 2003 kaymak and haas 2008 and thus has an impact on the determination of the disinfectant dosage traditional disinfection modeling approaches do not address the issue of indicator bacteria load variability and assume average 95 percentile or maximum of available observations as well as literature reference values as basis for process design and operation ducoste et al 2001 more recently inlet bacteria concentration and disinfection kinetics parameters were described as multivariate random variables santoro et al 2015 ahmed et al 2019 in these non deterministic frameworks e coli variability was modeled according to observed concentrations in several real wwtp effluents accounting for stochastic dependency with inactivation kinetics parameters these models give a realistic and reliable estimation of the indicator bacteria concentration variability upon which optimizing the disinfectant dosage however they are still a static description of the bacteria load synthesizing the quantity fluctuations as a fixed probability distribution to be estimated once for all through a site specific data collection campaign differently providing knowledge about indicator bacteria concentration trend in time and importantly being able to get this information on line is still a challenge culture based methods for estimation of indicator bacteria require time consuming laboratory work e coli which is one of the most widespread indicator bacteria for water and wastewater requires at least 18 hours of incubation to be cultured apha 1999 measurement of indicator bacteria concentration is thus usually limited to mandatory analyses of the effluent at the point of discharge the disinfection treatment is then designed and managed according to an approximate or partial knowledge about inlet bacteria concentration and wide safety factors are assumed sensors for real time monitoring of bacteria concentration are under development but mainly in the drinking water field skovhus horjis 2018 one of the major challenges in the implementation of these sensors is that they are based on measurement principles which are different from traditional culture based methods thus they provide outputs which are not directly comparable to regulation limits expressed as cfu colony forming units or mpn most probable number values moreover sensors rarely measure concentration of specific indicator bacteria strains like e coli skovhus and hojris 2018 soft sensors for regression applications are models that exploit easy to measure variables which can be monitored on line at a reasonable cost to predict target hard to measure variables souza et al 2016 in recent years many studies highlighted the potential of data driven regression models as soft sensing tools to predict non or hardly measurable variables in wwtps particularly many applications focus on the prediction of organic matter content and nutrients and on treatment fault detection haimi et al 2013 corominas et al 2018 however wastewater disinfection applications have not been explored yet a soft sensor could be a cost effective solution to virtually monitor the concentration of indicator bacteria in wastewater and to optimize disinfectant dosage accordingly actually the use of predictive modeling to estimate e coli concentration proved promising performances in many environmental water matrices where some chemical biological and physical characteristics effectively worked as predictors of e coli concentration christensen et al 2002 dwivedi et al 2013 2016 m√§lzer et al 2016 wang et al 2018 rossi et al 2020 however a model for real time estimation of indicator bacteria load has not been still studied for disinfection process control and optimization in this study the development of a soft sensor approach to virtually monitor e coli concentration at the inlet of real scale disinfection units is presented conventional wastewater physical chemical indicators flowrate and e coli were monitored in three large scale wwtps in the milan urban area italy both linear and nonlinear models were explored to identify the optimal family of models and assess prediction performances sensitivity analysis was performed to identify negligible factors prioritize relevant predictors and use the regression model to explore the relationship between the predictors and e coli concentration finally an example of the benefits of an e coli soft sensor is reported simulating its deployment on a realistic scenario for the optimization of the disinfectant dosage focusing on the use of peracetic acid paa 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection data collection was carried out at three large scale wwtps in the milan urban area wwtp1 1 050 000 pe wwtp2 600 000 pe and wwtp3 440 000 pe samples were collected at the inlet of disinfection units and analyzed for e coli concentration and wastewater quality characteristics ph conductivity temperature tss turbidity cod chemical oxygen demand uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 total nitrogen ammonia nitrate and flowrate as for wwtp1 42 samples were collected between july 2018 and march 2019 in both dry and wet weather conditions wastewater quality characteristics listed in table 1 were recorded by the disinfection unit on line sensors 10 minutes acquisition frequency except for uv254 which was measured in laboratory for each sample collected as for wwtp2 and wwtp3 respectively 13 and 19 samples were collected in dry weather conditions between july 2019 and january 2020 and wastewater characteristics in table 1 were measured in laboratory all wwtps were monitored at approximately weekly frequency three datasets were created from the collected data combining monitoring data from the three wwtps as detailed in table 1 dataset 1 comprises only data from wwtp1 while dataset 2 is composed grouping data from wwtp2 and wwtp3 in fact wwtp1 is worth to be studied independently being the only case where also rainy conditions occurred and wastewater quality was monitored with commercial on line sensors finally an additional dataset dataset 3 combining all available data was considered in order to explore potential general relationships between predictors and e coli concentration differences in terms of dataset variables are due to the fact that total nitrogen and nitrate ion were monitored only in wwtp2 and wwtp3 for each dataset only variables which were monitored in all the samples were kept in the modeling step 2 2 description of wwtps under study the three wwtps under study receive municipal wastewater from similar drainage basins with a limited contribution of industrial wastewater all the wwtps are based on activated sludge processes for carbon and nitrogen removal wwtp1 has a pre denitrification stage followed by nitrification phosphorous is then removed by chemical precipitation with ferric chloride and removal of suspended solids is refined by sand filtration the last stage is uv disinfection wwtp2 stream is firstly treated in a primary sedimentation stage biological treatment is made of a sequence of pre denitrification nitrification and post denitrification followed by chemical removal of phosphorous by aluminium chloride and disc filtration disinfection is carried out by sodium hypochlorite dosage wwtp3 has a primary sedimentation stage followed by a nitrification and phosphorous removal by aluminium chloride the stream quality is then refined by a double stage biofilter biofor suez performing nitrification denitrification and suspended solids filtration disinfection is then performed by peracetic acid 2 3 sampling procedure microbiological and chemical analysis all samples were collected in 1 l sterile bottles transported to the laboratory in refrigerated bags and analyzed within 12 h conservation in refrigerated chamber at 4 c e coli were enumerated by membrane filtration method according to standard methods section 9222 apha awwa wef 2012 using 0 45 Œºm pore size cellulose nitrate membranes whatman and chromogenic agar microinstant chromogenic coliforms agar scharlau as culture medium inoculated plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h e coli were expressed as cfu in 100 ml volume for wwtp1 wastewater quality parameters were measured by a multiparameter monitoring station micro station s can measuring ph conductivity temperature measured at sampling time before refrigeration cod tss and ammonia and an on line turbidimeter

path laboratory spectrophotometer hach dr6000 2 4 soft sensor development the soft sensor for e coli concentration was developed following four main steps i data collection paragraph 2 1 and pre processing ii variable selection iii model selection and calibration iv model testing fortuna et al 2007 souza et al 2016 the variable selection regression model selection and evaluation procedure were repeated for each dataset only 80 of data calibration subset was used for variable and model selection and calibration 20 of data test subset randomly sampled was used only to assess model performances in the testing step resulting numbers of data in each subset for the three different datasets are reported in table 1 in detail for dataset 1 test data corresponded to a randomly selected time window comprising 20 of the whole dataset in order to use the test subset to both evaluating model performances and assessing the model deployment benefits over a continuous time span 10 10 2018 28 11 2018 2 4 1 data pre processing input data were standardized to have null mean and standard deviation equal to 1 in order to ensure they have equal importance in the training process as output data the logarithmic transformation of e coli concentration was taken to properly manage the wide range of concentration variability within order of magnitudes of 102 to 105 shu and burn 2004 ammonia data were excluded from the analysis since in most cases they resulted lower than the loq level of quantification and thus the parameter was not considered as a good candidate as predictor of e coli concentration 2 4 2 variable selection model selection and calibration four kind of linear modeling options were evaluated i ordinary least squares ols multiple linear regression mlr coupled to a best variable subset selection strategy bvss ii ridge regression rr hoerl and kennard 2018 iii principal component regression pcr massy 1965 iv partial least squares pls wold 1975 all the four approaches perform variable and model selection steps within the identification process itself as following more details about linear modeling approaches are reported in supplementary material paragraph 1 each one of the listed linear regression techniques requires the tuning of one hyperparameter being the number of input variables for mlr k the value of the shrinking factor for rr Œª and the number of components for pcr and pls optimal hyperparameters were estimated via leave one out cross validation loocv which allows estimating the expected prediction error of a specified model hastie et al 2009 as for nonlinear regression model feed forward backpropagation artificial neural network ann was calibrated and tested on the data ann model was chosen as nonlinear regressor because it can reproduce any nonlinear relationship at the price of increasing its complexity hornik et al 1990 i e increasing the number of layers and neurons per hidden layer in this work the shallow ann model was adopted being a network with a three layer architecture made by one input one hidden and one output layer even in single hidden layer network the number of weight parameters defining the model can be very high being equal to p n 1 where n is the number of hidden neurons in small datasets such as in this work the number of weights of a shallow ann with a few hidden neurons can easily become comparable to the number of observations and predictors and even outnumber them the consequence is to produce a model which easily overfits calibration data and provides very poor generalization capability for this reason in this work the ann model was trained using a weight decay approach which applies the same penalty on the loss function in the minimization algorithm as the ridge regression equation 2 1 the integration of the penalty in the training algorithm shrinks towards zero unnecessary connections removing the effect of irrelevant predictors and input response relationships moreover the weight decay method reduces the effect of collinearities in this work the ann model had two hyperparameters to be tuned the number of hidden neurons and the weight decay rate in order to find the optimal hyperparameters loocv was adopted early stopping technique was used to further avoiding overfitting and improving generalization validation error was monitored during each training process training and validation errors usually decrease together during the first training iterations at later stages of training the network starts to overfit the data and the validation error typically rises summing weight decay and early stopping produce some redundancy in the direction of avoiding overfitting however the two methods tackle different issues weight decay shrinks irrelevant parameters performing a sort of variable selection even if it does not produce a sparse model early stopping performs regularization by looking at the validation data which are an additional information with respect to the training subset ann models with up to 15 neurons were considered in the loocv process representing the inner loop in the whole model selection process an outer loocv loop was performed for different values of the weight decay rate ranging between 0 0001 and 1 in each iteration of the loocv loop ann models were trained by means of back propagation algorithm based on gradient descent for mean squared error minimization details about the early stopping algorithm and other ann training settings are reported in detail in the supplementary material paragraph 2 linear regression analyses were performed on software r 3 6 3 using packages leaps 3 1 for bvss glmnet 4 0 for rr and pls 2 7 2 for pls and pcr training and cv of ann models were performed on python 3 3 6 using pytorch 1 3 1 and scikitlearn 0 22 1 libraries 2 4 3 model testing all the identified regression models were evaluated on the test subset of the corresponding dataset three performance metrics were used being the mean absolute error mae the mean absolute percentage error mape and the coefficient of determination r2 mae and mape were chosen because of their easy interpretability differently from widely used performance metrics like mean squared error mse and root mean squared error rmse mae and mape are not influenced by squares and square roots which emphasize the impact of high errors improving model training but preventing easy and direct interpretation for the same reason mae and mape were computed using e coli concentration as cfu 100 ml differently r2 was computed over logarithmic e coli concentration since r2 values depend on the sum of squares and can then overweight high values 2 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa of identified regression models was performed to prioritize the importance of relevant predictors variance based sensitivity analysis vsa was chosen for predictor prioritization vsa is an all at a time global sa method where output variations are obtained by varying all the inputs simultaneously exploring their entire variability space saltelli et al 2006 pianosi et al 2016 the contribution of the input xi on the output y variability is accounted by the term s i first order effect defined as 2 2 s i v a r e y x i v a r y the larger s i the larger the contribution of x i to the output y when the inputs are uncorrelated the total variance y is the sum of the contributions given by the variation of all the single inputs x i plus the contribution given by the interaction among inputs conversely if the inputs are correlated the sum of the variance contributions given by all the inputs might be higher than v a r y because the conditional variance also carries over the effects of other predictors that could be positively or negatively correlated to x i saltelli et al 2006 a critical step in vsa is the right definition of the variability space and probability distribution for the inputs which can significantly affect the sa results in this work input values for model simulations in sa were sampled from independent uniform distributions between the minimum and maximum observed values of each input which is the most common and simple approach pianosi et al 2016 the correlation among predictors was not considered in this step since the aim of the analysis was primarily to understand how the models behave opening the black box and then to prioritize the predictors after the model selection step under the assumption of uncorrelation s i ranges between 0 and 1 thanks to this property results from sa application on linear models and ann marseguerra et al 2003 can be directly compared and the effect of nonlinearity and interactions can be studied under the hypothesis of uncorrelation of inputs the contributions of all the interactions among the inputs can be estimated as 2 3 s i n t 1 i 1 p s i 2 6 simulation of soft sensor deployment in order to highlight the benefits of a soft sensor for virtual e coli monitoring and disinfection process control e coli concentration in wwtp1 undisinfected effluent was simulated by the ann based soft sensor model derived from regression on dataset 1 during the time span comprising test subset data paragraph 2 1 uv254 was assumed as constant estimated e coli concentrations were used to compute optimal paa dosage relying on site specific experimental results see supplementary material paragraph 4 about disinfectant decay and inactivation in wwtp1 wastewater entering full scale disinfection unit since no immediate oxidative demand was observed in the data rossi et al 2007 paa concentration needed to comply with a selected discharge limit was calculated assuming a first order kinetic model for paa decay the model described by dom√≠nguez henao et al 2018 was used for e coli inactivation assuming the kinetic parameters as constant over time eq 2 6 was used to compute the required exposure dose while eq 2 5 being the integral over time of equation 2 4 was used to compute the paa dosage needed to guarantee that dose results about the calibration of paa kinetics are reported in detail in the supplementary material paragraph 4 eq 2 4 p a a t p a a 0 e k t 2 5 d t p a a 0 k 1 e k t 2 6 ln n ln n 0 k d n 1 e h d where t is time k is the first order decay rate of paa p a a 0 is the paa initial concentration d is the dose n is e coli concentration at time t n 0 is e coli initial concentration and k n and h are the inactivation kinetic parameters t was assumed as equal to 30 minutes being a typical hydraulic residence time for chemical disinfection the ann based soft sensor model used in this scenario was re calibrated haupt et al 2008 on the calibration subset of dataset 1 according to two approaches firstly a single ann model was calibrated moreover an ensemble of 100 ann models anne was calibrated according to the bootstrap aggregation or bagging approach breiman 1996 bootstrap sampling consists in randomly drawing new datasets from the original calibration data each sample being a random sample with replacement the same size as the original dataset in some of the re sampled datasets some observations can appear more than once while in other cases one or more observations can be absent one model is fitted for each of the bootstrap samples the probability distribution of model parameters due to the modeling uncertainty was approximated by the observed distribution of the parameters derived from each model training similarly given a set of observations of the predictors the predictions given by anne provided both a point estimate by averaging the predictions and a confidence interval by taking the observed percentiles of the predictions efron and hastie 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characterization summary statistics of monitored wastewater physical and chemical characteristics and weather conditions during sample collection are reported in table 2 rainfall data close to wwtp1 location during the data collection campaign are reported in supplementary material figure s9 all the three monitored wwtps have good quality effluents both in terms of solids organic and nitrogen where monitored content one straightforward reason was the presence of tertiary treatments for quality refinement in fact mean effluent constituents are close to typical literature values of tertiary effluents after biological treatment for carbon and nitrogen removal and filtration for residual solids removal tchobanoglous et al 2013 moreover raw wastewater streams in the milan area are typically significantly diluted due to integration of some canals in the sewer network and frequent discharge of groundwater in the sewer to control water table level since data driven regression approaches were used to develop the soft sensor model for each dataset it is important to stress the fact that model validity is limited to observations ranges of variability which were recorded during the collection campaign limitations could be related to period of the day e g night hours the week e g weekend or the year april may and june in this work which could be not well represented by collected datasets 3 2 model identification and performance evaluation the model selection and calibration step aimed at identifying the best family of models and predictors regularization techniques used in this work aims at removing non relevant predictors or shrinking their coefficients thus reducing model complexity and improving the model generalization capability both linear and nonlinear regression analyses were performed in order to understand to what extent nonlinear dependencies and interactions are important in estimating input output relationships since there is no model or framework in literature to estimate inlet bacteria concentration in disinfection regression models here developed were compared to two baseline models bm which are considered as representative of the general approach in disinfection design and operation i mean of the data on the calibration subset bm1 ii 95th percentile of the calibration subset bm2 the performance metrics of bm1 on the test subset was considered as the base error rate hastie et al 2009 since observed mean can be seen as the simplest possible model while bm2 was included in the comparison as an example of more precautionary alternative to the solution here proposed test performances of all the regression options for each dataset are reported in table 3 details about the calibration and cross validation results are reported in the supplementary material paragraph 3 overall nonlinear regression based on ann shows the best performances and a significant improvement with respect to bm1 and linear models suggesting that nonlinearities and interactions are fundamental to get satisfying performances from a soft sensor for e coli regarding bm2 as shown in table 3 the price of guaranteeing a wide safety factor is a huge average error in the test cases differently from linear models the ann model is hardly interpretable via direct inspection of parameters weights 3 3 sensitivity analysis discussion on physical and chemical parameters relevance sensitivity analysis sa is of fundamental importance for model developers and users to understand key features of the model and exploit the model at its highest potential this kind of analysis is particularly important in case of high mathematical complexity models like anns whose parameters lack of direct interpretability and physical significance olden and jackson 2002 actually data driven regression models capture input output relationships as they perceive them in the available training data after model identification it is important in engineering applications to interpret the predictive relationships derived from the data and to compare the regression analysis results with a priori knowledge about phenomena the use of vsa presents some advantages in inspecting the model as briefly detailed in the supplementary material paragraph 7 values of s i from the vsa are reported in fig 1 computed both for the rr model as an example of a linear model and the ann model for the three studied datasets in many cases the index is almost null as a result of the shrinking effect on the model parameters produced by the penalty on the loss function imposed both by rr and weight decay in ann training results about dataset 1 show that ph is the most relevant factor in determining the variance of the output both for the linear and the nonlinear model cases 30 40 in the nonlinear case conductivity resulted also as an important factor with about 10 contribution to the total variance the relationship with e coli concentration is negative both for ph and conductivity a possible interpretation is that the most significant increase in e coli concentration occurs during intense rain events when the contribution of stormwater lowers ph and conductivity stormwater can actually determine sharp increase in e coli concentration due to urban runoff and sediment re suspension in the sewer mccarthy 2009 hathaway and hunt 2011 mckergow and davies colley 2010 the use of ph and conductivity as proxies of the incoming of stormwater instead of directly using the rainfall data as a predictor avoids the critical issues of modeling the delay between the occurrence of rain events and the incoming of stormwater in the wwtp which implies the description of the corrivation phenomena and the choice of optimal rainfall monitoring sites moreover acquisition of ph and conductivity data from on line sensors is a much more practical solution than implementing the real time transmission of rainfall data from monitoring sites the wwtp1 case study is then a clear example of how a soft sensor can exploit available monitoring data in order to catch proxy relationships which work as surrogates of the real physical cause effect laws of the target phenomena changes in conductivity or ph are not the physical cause of e coli increase but they are indirectly correlated to that the importance of ph and conductivity stands only for this dataset in the other two cases their contribution to the output variance is almost negligible since no rain events occurred during data collection ph and conductivity lose their role of proxies of wet weather conditions unexpectedly temperature did not result as an important predictor for the case of dataset 1 probably temperature in the effluent varied in a too narrow range to determine significant changes in e coli concentration however since a relationship between temperature and bacteria vitality exists the role of temperature should be further studied in models trained over dataset 2 most of the output variance about 50 is caused by turbidity significant correlations between turbidity and e coli concentration were found many times in surface waters christensen et al 2002 jamieson et al 2005 money et al 2009 huey meyer 2010 wu et al 2011 which can be explained by the tendency of e coli to attach to particles hipsey et al 2006 dickenson and sansalone 2012 liu et al 2013 jiang et al 2015 association of coliforms on suspended solids in wastewater is still poorly explored but it has been highlighted in some studies loge et al 2002 falsanisi et al 2008 mckergow and davies colley 2010 chahal et al 2016 carr√© et al 2018 it is then highly probable that increases in e coli concentration in wwtp2 and wwtp3 were determined by a higher contribution of the particle associated fraction in the influent due to temporary decrease of upstream treatments efficiencies or higher suspended solids loads to the plant in the case of dataset 3 models were trained and validated on data coming from all the three wwtps considered in this study thus corresponding sensitivity analysis results are better candidates than the dataset 1 and 2 case to describe general relationships between physical and chemical characteristics of wastewater and e coli concentration for dataset 3 uv254 cod turbidity and tss resulted as most important predictors for all the four predictors the correlation with e coli is positive thus in this general case the soft sensor captures the increase in e coli concentration that is correlated with a global worsening in wastewater quality in terms of organic content and suspended solids dependence of coliforms concentration on treatment efficiency of organic matter and solids was already highlighted by george et al 2002 and koivunen et al 2003 the role of tss and turbidity can be explained as for dataset 2 but in these cases both the two aggregated indicators of suspended solids turned out to be important which can be explained by the difference in their measuring principles turbidity which is an optical method can be affected by particle size gregory 2009 he and nan 2012 yao et al 2014 with larger particles usually contributing more to the overall nephelometric turbidity units ntus since particle size was pointed as a factor in determining particle association of coliform with bacteria typically attaching on larger particles falsanisi et al 2008 chahal et al 2016 both turbidity and tss were probably kept by the model as predictors in order to account both for total suspended solids mass and particle size as well as their interaction the importance of cod was likely due in part to the fact that a fraction of the residual organic matter in the effluent was in the form of suspended solids however the almost equal relevance of abs254 indicate that soluble organic matter is correlated to e coli concentration as well a candidate reason behind this evidence is that lower efficiencies of the activated sludge treatments in removing soluble organic carbon can be due to lower biological activities and thus weaker ecological barriers for e coli it was in fact highlighted in literature by long time how predation especially by protozoa is the main mechanism determining abatement of fecal bacteria in biological treatments van der drift et al 1977 loge et al 2002 non optimal conditions of activated sludge may also cause the formation of smaller and less settling flocs thus more difficultly removable by secondary settlers and filters this could be another reason why increase in sst and turbidity work as predictors of increases in e coli concentration overall there are some big discrepancies among the results from the three different datasets that worth to be discussed first of all as already mentioned dataset 1 leads to models which are completely different from the other two cases because in wwtp1 occurrence of intense rain events resulted as the only cause of sharp increases in e coli concentration determining variations of one order of magnitude results coming from dataset 1 are then really site specific and no general interpretation of the phenomena can be inferred the different ranges of variability of e coli concentration in the different datasets highlighted in figs 2 and 3 have to be considered as well data from dataset 1 are mainly comprised between 1 000 and 10 000 cfu 100 ml with a minor portion of data regarding wet weather conditions which reach about 60 000 cfu 100 ml differently data from dataset 2 range between 10 000 to 500 000 cfu 100 ml similarly cod tss uv254 and turbidity data vary in different ranges in the three datasets the three datasets complement each other and thus their combination allows to better explore their space of variability and consequently reveal more relationships with e coli concentration this is one of the reasons why predictors ranking changed completely from dataset 1 to dataset 2 in the latter case the wider distribution of data in their variability space allows to the regression analysis to catch the role of turbidity in predicting e coli concentration since dataset 3 is the sum of all the collected data from all the three studied wwtps it is the one having the most complete picture on e coli concentration and wastewater quality variability and thus in addition to turbidity it can capture the role of additional predictors being uv254 cod and tss sa on ann based soft sensors revealed that interactions among predictors are responsible of an important portion of the total variance 25 30 this result together with the significant increase in performances with respect to the linear models highlights that the relationship between e coli concentration and wastewater quality characteristics is mainly nonlinear and thus a family of nonlinear models like ann is the best candidate for soft sensor in conclusion the coupling of model selection techniques and sa revealed how wastewater characteristics can be screened and prioritized in order to understand which are essential to build an effective predictive model as an e coli soft sensor 3 4 example of model deployment over a scenario fig 4 reports predictions during the time window of the ann based soft sensor calibrated on dataset 1 the single ann model predictions approximate well almost all the test measurements importantly the soft sensor catches the increase in e coli concentration occurring around 01 11 2018 which coincided with intense rain events even if the model cannot explicitly discriminate between dry and wet weather conditions it captures the sharp increase in e coli concentration thanks to the wastewater quality variables which are real time monitored and can work as proxies of a higher contribution of stormwater to the overall flow rate thus the model testing support the interpretation of sa results previously reported predictions from bootstrap averaging of the anne are also reported in fig 4 average predictions are similar to the single ann model except for the wet weather condition cases in this period average predictions of the anne are significantly lower than the single ann leading to a dramatical underestimation of e coli in a critical event however the bagging approach has the advantage of producing an estimate of the confidence interval of the prediction the 95 confidence interval always contains all the observed concentrations of the test subset the upper bound of the anne is then a valuable reference to describe e coli concentration when the goal is the optimization of disinfectant dosage since it both provides an adequate safety factor and catches the main fluctuation in e coli load occurring in the considered time window table 4 reports paa consumption that would be required during the whole time window considering the different approaches for e coli concentration estimation consumptions data were computed for discharge limits equal to 5 000 and 10 cfu 100 ml which are respectively the limits for surface water discharge and agricultural reuse in italy the bm1 approach was totally inadequate for the discharge limit into surface water since the average e coli concentration observed in the calibration subset was lower than the discharge limit itself considering e coli as a constant equal to the observed average leads to a critical underestimation which even leads to conclude that no paa dosage would be needed considering all the other approaches as expected the bm2 brings to the highest paa consumption guaranteeing a good safety factor since only the most critical e coli concentration is underestimated when the single ann model is used a paa mass saving is obtained being respectively 57 for the discharge limit in surface water and 55 for the reuse limit moreover even if e coli concentration is often underestimated the error is quite small table 3 lastly when the anne is used considering the upper bound of the 95 confidence interval a reduction in paa consumption of 12 and 25 and a wide enough safety factor in order to never underestimate e coli concentration were obtained 4 conclusions in this study an innovative soft sensor based on black box regression models is proposed for real time virtual monitoring of e coli concentration at the inlet of full scale disinfection units relying on data from three wwtps soft sensor regressors using different physical and chemical characteristics as predictors were calibrated and gave satisfying performances performances of the ann based soft sensors were significantly higher than any linear model tested highlighting the importance of nonlinearities and interactions in the relationships between wastewater physical and chemical characteristics and e coli concentration based on the results of the sensitivity analysis in one case study the soft sensor was able to capture e coli concentration variations due to intense rain events by exploiting ph and conductivity as proxy variables of the presence of stormwater in the flow rate differently when data coming from all the case studies are considered variables describing a general worsening of the upstream treatment efficiency being cod uv absorbance tss and turbidity resulted as the driving predictors discrepancies of the results among the datasets underlined how this kind of black box regressor can have strongly site specific validity when data from just one case study are considered the combinations of data from three wwtps effluents allows to develop a model which was likely more generalizable then this work could be additionally developed by collecting a bigger dataset with data coming from a higher number of wwtps which could more robustly substantiate general conclusions on the physical cause effect relationships describing the phenomena the ann based soft sensor was tested over a scenario of wastewater quality and the model predictions of e coli concentration were used to simulate the control of the dosage of a paa disinfection treatment the simulation highlighted the significant benefits of the deployment of an e coli soft sensor both in terms of paa saving up to 57 and process reliability this study highlighted the potential of the soft sensor solution to unlock a new dynamic approach in optimization and control of disinfection which accounts for the indicator bacteria load dynamics by passing the drawbacks of laboratory culture methods and new on line bacteria sensors different regularization techniques were compared in order to deal with a limited dataset establishing a monitoring routine of indicator bacteria at the inlet of wwtps disinfection by plant managers could help in building big enough datasets to improve the soft sensor robustness before deployment particularly other important parameters could be monitored and studied such as dissolved oxygen concentration which could affect microbial vitality after an initial intensive data collection the monitoring protocol should include a periodical data collection in order to perform proper model maintenance since black box regression models could be biased by

17220,real time acquisition of indicator bacteria concentration at the inlet of disinfection unit is a fundamental support to the control of chemical and ultraviolet wastewater disinfection culture based enumeration methods need time consuming laboratory analyses which give results after several hours or days while newest biosensors rarely provide information about specific strains and outputs are not directly comparable with regulatory limits as a consequence of measurement principles in this work a novel soft sensor approach for virtual real time monitoring of e coli concentration is proposed conventional wastewater physical and chemical indicators chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen nitrate ammonia total suspended solids conductivity ph turbidity and absorbance at 254 nm and flowrate were studied as potential predictors of e coli concentration relying on data collected from three full scale wastewater treatment plants different methods were compared i linear modeling via ordinary least squares ii ridge regression iii principal component regression and partial least squares iv non linear modeling through artificial neural networks linear soft sensors reached some degree of accuracy but performances of the artificial neural network based models were by far superior sensitivity analysis allowed to prioritize the importance of each predictor and to highlight the site specific nature of the approach because of the site specific nature of relationships between predictors and e coli concentration in one case study ph and conductivity worked as good proxy variables when the occurrence of intense rain events caused sharp increases in e coli concentration differently in other case studies chemical oxygen demand total suspended solids turbidity and absorbance at 254 nm accounted for the positive correlation between low wastewater quality and e coli concentration moreover sensitivity analysis of artificial neural network models highlighted the importance of interactions among predictors contributing to 25 to 30 of the model output variance this evidence along with performance results supported the idea that nonlinear families of models should be preferred in the estimation of e coli concentration the artificial neural network based soft sensor deployment for control of peracetic acid disinfectant dosage was simulated over a realistic scenario of wastewater quality recorded by on line sensors over 2 months the scenario simulations highlighted the significant benefit of an e coli soft sensor which provided up to 57 of

uv254 absorbance at 254 nm vsa variance based sensitivity analysis wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction chemical and ultraviolet uv disinfection are two effective solutions for wastewater treatment inter alia mezzanotte et al 2007 while the concentration of chemical disinfectant or uv radiation intensity and the contact time are the two fundamental process parameters in determining pathogen inactivation proper control of the disinfectant dosage can compensate contact time variations and preserve disinfection efficiency as recently demonstrated by manoli et al 2019 this issue is particularly important when wastewater is treated for reuse which implies strict limits on microbial indicators in the effluent for example the european parliament recently approved the new regulation for agricultural wastewater reuse the european parliament and the council of the european union 2020 where limits on e coli concentration after treatments are 10 or 100 cfu 100 ml depending on the type of crops and irrigation techniques nevertheless the disinfection process is strongly affected by many sources of uncertainty which cause high variability of the process efficiency with respect to the desired performance setpoint particularly the concentration of the indicator bacteria entering disinfection is highly variable as a result of the variability of raw wastewater characteristics upstream treatment layout and deviation from nominal conditions of wastewater treatment plants wwtp moreover intense rain events can cause fluctuations of order of magnitudes in bacteria concentration the first reason of inlet indicator bacteria concentration importance on disinfection is straightforward the higher the load the higher the required reduction given a discharge limit to comply with in addition bacteria concentration can significantly affect inactivation kinetics haas and kaymak 2003 kaymak and haas 2008 and thus has an impact on the determination of the disinfectant dosage traditional disinfection modeling approaches do not address the issue of indicator bacteria load variability and assume average 95 percentile or maximum of available observations as well as literature reference values as basis for process design and operation ducoste et al 2001 more recently inlet bacteria concentration and disinfection kinetics parameters were described as multivariate random variables santoro et al 2015 ahmed et al 2019 in these non deterministic frameworks e coli variability was modeled according to observed concentrations in several real wwtp effluents accounting for stochastic dependency with inactivation kinetics parameters these models give a realistic and reliable estimation of the indicator bacteria concentration variability upon which optimizing the disinfectant dosage however they are still a static description of the bacteria load synthesizing the quantity fluctuations as a fixed probability distribution to be estimated once for all through a site specific data collection campaign differently providing knowledge about indicator bacteria concentration trend in time and importantly being able to get this information on line is still a challenge culture based methods for estimation of indicator bacteria require time consuming laboratory work e coli which is one of the most widespread indicator bacteria for water and wastewater requires at least 18 hours of incubation to be cultured apha 1999 measurement of indicator bacteria concentration is thus usually limited to mandatory analyses of the effluent at the point of discharge the disinfection treatment is then designed and managed according to an approximate or partial knowledge about inlet bacteria concentration and wide safety factors are assumed sensors for real time monitoring of bacteria concentration are under development but mainly in the drinking water field skovhus horjis 2018 one of the major challenges in the implementation of these sensors is that they are based on measurement principles which are different from traditional culture based methods thus they provide outputs which are not directly comparable to regulation limits expressed as cfu colony forming units or mpn most probable number values moreover sensors rarely measure concentration of specific indicator bacteria strains like e coli skovhus and hojris 2018 soft sensors for regression applications are models that exploit easy to measure variables which can be monitored on line at a reasonable cost to predict target hard to measure variables souza et al 2016 in recent years many studies highlighted the potential of data driven regression models as soft sensing tools to predict non or hardly measurable variables in wwtps particularly many applications focus on the prediction of organic matter content and nutrients and on treatment fault detection haimi et al 2013 corominas et al 2018 however wastewater disinfection applications have not been explored yet a soft sensor could be a cost effective solution to virtually monitor the concentration of indicator bacteria in wastewater and to optimize disinfectant dosage accordingly actually the use of predictive modeling to estimate e coli concentration proved promising performances in many environmental water matrices where some chemical biological and physical characteristics effectively worked as predictors of e coli concentration christensen et al 2002 dwivedi et al 2013 2016 m√§lzer et al 2016 wang et al 2018 rossi et al 2020 however a model for real time estimation of indicator bacteria load has not been still studied for disinfection process control and optimization in this study the development of a soft sensor approach to virtually monitor e coli concentration at the inlet of real scale disinfection units is presented conventional wastewater physical chemical indicators flowrate and e coli were monitored in three large scale wwtps in the milan urban area italy both linear and nonlinear models were explored to identify the optimal family of models and assess prediction performances sensitivity analysis was performed to identify negligible factors prioritize relevant predictors and use the regression model to explore the relationship between the predictors and e coli concentration finally an example of the benefits of an e coli soft sensor is reported simulating its deployment on a realistic scenario for the optimization of the disinfectant dosage focusing on the use of peracetic acid paa 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection data collection was carried out at three large scale wwtps in the milan urban area wwtp1 1 050 000 pe wwtp2 600 000 pe and wwtp3 440 000 pe samples were collected at the inlet of disinfection units and analyzed for e coli concentration and wastewater quality characteristics ph conductivity temperature tss turbidity cod chemical oxygen demand uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 total nitrogen ammonia nitrate and flowrate as for wwtp1 42 samples were collected between july 2018 and march 2019 in both dry and wet weather conditions wastewater quality characteristics listed in table 1 were recorded by the disinfection unit on line sensors 10 minutes acquisition frequency except for uv254 which was measured in laboratory for each sample collected as for wwtp2 and wwtp3 respectively 13 and 19 samples were collected in dry weather conditions between july 2019 and january 2020 and wastewater characteristics in table 1 were measured in laboratory all wwtps were monitored at approximately weekly frequency three datasets were created from the collected data combining monitoring data from the three wwtps as detailed in table 1 dataset 1 comprises only data from wwtp1 while dataset 2 is composed grouping data from wwtp2 and wwtp3 in fact wwtp1 is worth to be studied independently being the only case where also rainy conditions occurred and wastewater quality was monitored with commercial on line sensors finally an additional dataset dataset 3 combining all available data was considered in order to explore potential general relationships between predictors and e coli concentration differences in terms of dataset variables are due to the fact that total nitrogen and nitrate ion were monitored only in wwtp2 and wwtp3 for each dataset only variables which were monitored in all the samples were kept in the modeling step 2 2 description of wwtps under study the three wwtps under study receive municipal wastewater from similar drainage basins with a limited contribution of industrial wastewater all the wwtps are based on activated sludge processes for carbon and nitrogen removal wwtp1 has a pre denitrification stage followed by nitrification phosphorous is then removed by chemical precipitation with ferric chloride and removal of suspended solids is refined by sand filtration the last stage is uv disinfection wwtp2 stream is firstly treated in a primary sedimentation stage biological treatment is made of a sequence of pre denitrification nitrification and post denitrification followed by chemical removal of phosphorous by aluminium chloride and disc filtration disinfection is carried out by sodium hypochlorite dosage wwtp3 has a primary sedimentation stage followed by a nitrification and phosphorous removal by aluminium chloride the stream quality is then refined by a double stage biofilter biofor suez performing nitrification denitrification and suspended solids filtration disinfection is then performed by peracetic acid 2 3 sampling procedure microbiological and chemical analysis all samples were collected in 1 l sterile bottles transported to the laboratory in refrigerated bags and analyzed within 12 h conservation in refrigerated chamber at 4 c e coli were enumerated by membrane filtration method according to standard methods section 9222 apha awwa wef 2012 using 0 45 Œºm pore size cellulose nitrate membranes whatman and chromogenic agar microinstant chromogenic coliforms agar scharlau as culture medium inoculated plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h e coli were expressed as cfu in 100 ml volume for wwtp1 wastewater quality parameters were

path laboratory spectrophotometer hach dr6000 2 4 soft sensor development the soft sensor for e coli concentration was developed following four main steps i data collection paragraph 2 1 and pre processing ii variable selection iii model selection and calibration iv model testing fortuna et al 2007 souza et al 2016 the variable selection regression model selection and evaluation procedure were repeated for each dataset only 80 of data calibration subset was used for variable and model selection and calibration 20 of data test subset randomly sampled was used only to assess model performances in the testing step resulting numbers of data in each subset for the three different datasets are reported in table 1 in detail for dataset 1 test data corresponded to a randomly selected time window comprising 20 of the whole dataset in order to use the test subset to both evaluating model performances and assessing the model deployment benefits over a continuous time span 10 10 2018 28 11 2018 2 4 1 data pre processing input data were standardized to have null mean and standard deviation equal to 1 in order to ensure they have equal importance in the training process as output data the logarithmic transformation of e coli concentration was taken to properly manage the wide range of concentration variability within order of magnitudes of 102 to 105 shu and burn 2004 ammonia data were excluded from the analysis since in most cases they resulted lower than the loq level of quantification and thus the parameter was not considered as a good candidate as predictor of e coli concentration 2 4 2 variable selection model selection and calibration four kind of linear modeling options were evaluated i ordinary least squares ols multiple linear regression mlr coupled to a best variable subset selection strategy bvss ii ridge regression rr hoerl and kennard 2018 iii principal component regression pcr massy 1965 iv partial least squares pls wold 1975 all the four approaches perform variable and model selection steps within the identification process itself as following more details about linear modeling approaches are reported in supplementary material paragraph 1 each one of the listed linear regression techniques requires the tuning of one hyperparameter being the number of input variables for mlr k the value of the shrinking factor for rr Œª and the number of components for pcr and pls optimal hyperparameters were estimated via leave one out cross validation loocv which allows estimating the expected prediction error of a specified model hastie et al 2009 as for nonlinear regression model feed forward backpropagation artificial neural network ann was calibrated and tested on the data ann model was chosen as nonlinear regressor because it can reproduce any nonlinear relationship at the price of increasing its complexity hornik et al 1990 i e increasing the number of layers and neurons per hidden layer in this work the shallow ann model was adopted being a network with a three layer architecture made by one input one hidden and one output layer even in single hidden layer network the number of weight parameters defining the model can be very high being equal to p n 1 where n is the number of hidden neurons in small datasets such as in this work the number of weights of a shallow ann with a few hidden neurons can easily become comparable to the number of observations and predictors and even outnumber them the consequence is to produce a model which easily overfits calibration data and provides very poor generalization capability for this reason in this work the ann model was trained using a weight decay approach which applies the same penalty on the loss function in the minimization algorithm as the ridge regression equation 2 1 the integration of the penalty in the training algorithm shrinks towards zero unnecessary connections removing the effect of irrelevant predictors and input response relationships moreover the weight decay method reduces the effect of collinearities in this work the ann model had two hyperparameters to be tuned the number of hidden neurons and the weight decay rate in order to find the optimal hyperparameters loocv was adopted early stopping technique was used to further avoiding overfitting and improving generalization validation error was monitored during each training process training and validation errors usually decrease together during the first training iterations at later stages of training the network starts to overfit the data and the validation error typically rises summing weight decay and early stopping produce some redundancy in the direction of avoiding overfitting however the two methods tackle different issues weight decay shrinks irrelevant parameters performing a sort of variable selection even if it does not produce a sparse model early stopping performs regularization by looking at the validation data which are an additional information with respect to the training subset ann models with up to 15 neurons were considered in the loocv process representing the inner loop in the whole model selection process an outer loocv loop was performed for different values of the weight decay rate ranging between 0 0001 and 1 in each iteration of the loocv loop ann models were trained by means of back propagation algorithm based on gradient descent for mean squared error minimization details about the early stopping algorithm and other ann training settings are reported in detail in the supplementary material paragraph 2 linear regression analyses were performed on software r 3 6 3 using packages leaps 3 1 for bvss glmnet 4 0 for rr and pls 2 7 2 for pls and pcr training and cv of ann models were performed on python 3 3 6 using pytorch 1 3 1 and scikitlearn 0 22 1 libraries 2 4 3 model testing all the identified regression models were evaluated on the test subset of the corresponding dataset three performance metrics were used being the mean absolute error mae the mean absolute percentage error mape and the coefficient of determination r2 mae and mape were chosen because of their easy interpretability differently from widely used performance metrics like mean squared error mse and root mean squared error rmse mae and mape are not influenced by squares and square roots which emphasize the impact of high errors improving model training but preventing easy and direct interpretation for the same reason mae and mape were computed using e coli concentration as cfu 100 ml differently r2 was computed over logarithmic e coli concentration since r2 values depend on the sum of squares and can then overweight high values 2 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa of identified regression models was performed to prioritize the importance of relevant predictors variance based sensitivity analysis vsa was chosen for predictor prioritization vsa is an all at a time global sa method where output variations are obtained by varying all the inputs simultaneously exploring their entire variability space saltelli et al 2006 pianosi et al 2016 the contribution of the input xi on the output y variability is accounted by the term s i first order effect defined as 2 2 s i v a r e y x i v a r y the larger s i the larger the contribution of x i to the output y when the inputs are uncorrelated the total variance y is the sum of the contributions given by the variation of all the single inputs x i plus the contribution given by the interaction among inputs conversely if the inputs are correlated the sum of the variance contributions given by all the inputs might be higher than v a r y because the conditional variance also carries over the effects of other predictors that could be positively or negatively correlated to x i saltelli et al 2006 a critical step in vsa is the right definition of the variability space and probability distribution for the inputs which can significantly affect the sa results in this work input values for model simulations in sa were sampled from independent uniform distributions between the minimum and maximum observed values of each input which is the most common and simple approach pianosi et al 2016 the correlation among predictors was not considered in this step since the aim of the analysis was primarily to understand how the models behave opening the black box and then to prioritize the predictors after the model selection step under the assumption of uncorrelation s i ranges between 0 and 1 thanks to this property results from sa application on linear models and ann marseguerra et al 2003 can be directly compared and the effect of nonlinearity and interactions can be studied under the hypothesis of uncorrelation of inputs the contributions of all the interactions among the inputs can be estimated as 2 3 s i n t 1 i 1 p s i 2 6 simulation of soft sensor deployment in order to highlight the benefits of a soft sensor for virtual e coli monitoring and disinfection process control e coli concentration in wwtp1 undisinfected effluent was simulated by the ann based soft sensor model derived from regression on dataset 1 during the time span comprising test subset data paragraph 2 1 uv254 was assumed as constant estimated e coli concentrations were used to compute optimal paa dosage relying on site specific experimental results see supplementary material paragraph 4 about disinfectant decay and inactivation in wwtp1 wastewater entering full scale disinfection unit since no immediate oxidative demand was observed in the data rossi et al 2007 paa concentration needed to comply with a selected discharge limit was calculated assuming a first order kinetic model for paa decay the model described by dom√≠nguez henao et al 2018 was used for e coli inactivation assuming the kinetic parameters as constant over time eq 2 6 was used to compute the required exposure dose while eq 2 5 being the integral over time of equation 2 4 was used to compute the paa dosage needed to guarantee that dose results about the calibration of paa kinetics are reported in detail in the supplementary material paragraph 4 eq 2 4 p a a t p a a 0 e k t 2 5 d t p a a 0 k 1 e k t 2 6 ln n ln n 0 k d n 1 e h d where t is time k is the first order decay rate of paa p a a 0 is the paa initial concentration d is the dose n is e coli concentration at time t n 0 is e coli initial concentration and k n and h are the inactivation kinetic parameters t was assumed as equal to 30 minutes being a typical hydraulic residence time for chemical disinfection the ann based soft sensor model used in this scenario was re calibrated haupt et al 2008 on the calibration subset of dataset 1 according to two approaches firstly a single ann model was calibrated moreover an ensemble of 100 ann models anne was calibrated according to the bootstrap aggregation or bagging approach breiman 1996 bootstrap sampling consists in randomly drawing new datasets from the original calibration data each sample being a random sample with replacement the same size as the original dataset in some of the re sampled datasets some observations can appear more than once while in other cases one or more observations can be absent one model is fitted for each of the bootstrap samples the probability distribution of model parameters due to the modeling uncertainty was approximated by the observed distribution of the parameters derived from each model training similarly given a set of observations of the predictors the predictions given by anne provided both a point estimate by averaging the predictions and a confidence interval by taking the observed percentiles of the predictions efron and hastie 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characterization summary statistics of monitored wastewater physical and chemical characteristics and weather conditions during sample collection are reported in table 2 rainfall data close to wwtp1 location during the data collection campaign are reported in supplementary material figure s9 all the three monitored wwtps have good quality effluents both in terms of solids organic and nitrogen where monitored content one straightforward reason was the presence of tertiary treatments for quality refinement in fact mean effluent constituents are close to typical literature values of tertiary effluents after biological treatment for carbon and nitrogen removal and filtration for residual solids removal tchobanoglous et al 2013 moreover raw wastewater streams in the milan area are typically significantly diluted due to integration of some canals in the sewer network and frequent discharge of groundwater in the sewer to control water table level since data driven regression approaches were used to develop the soft sensor model for each dataset it is important to stress the fact that model validity is limited to observations ranges of variability which were recorded during the collection campaign limitations could be related to period of the day e g night hours the week e g weekend or the year april may and june in this work which could be not well represented by collected datasets 3 2 model identification and performance evaluation the model selection and calibration step aimed at identifying the best family of models and predictors regularization techniques used in this work aims at removing non relevant predictors or shrinking their coefficients thus reducing model complexity and improving the model generalization capability both linear and nonlinear regression analyses were performed in order to understand to what extent nonlinear dependencies and interactions are important in estimating input output relationships since there is no model or framework in literature to estimate inlet bacteria concentration in disinfection regression models here developed were compared to two baseline models bm which are considered as representative of the general approach in disinfection design and operation i mean of the data on the calibration subset bm1 ii 95th percentile of the calibration subset bm2 the performance metrics of bm1 on the test subset was considered as the base error rate hastie et al 2009 since observed mean can be seen as the simplest possible model while bm2 was included in the comparison as an example of more precautionary alternative to the solution here proposed test performances of all the regression options for each dataset are reported in table 3 details about the calibration and cross validation results are reported in the supplementary material paragraph 3 overall nonlinear regression based on ann shows the best performances and a significant improvement with respect to bm1 and linear models suggesting that nonlinearities and interactions are fundamental to get satisfying performances from a soft sensor for e coli regarding bm2 as shown in table 3 the price of guaranteeing a wide safety factor is a huge average error in the test cases differently from linear models the ann model is hardly interpretable via direct inspection of parameters weights 3 3 sensitivity analysis discussion on physical and chemical parameters relevance sensitivity analysis sa is of fundamental importance for model developers and users to understand key features of the model and exploit the model at its highest potential this kind of analysis is particularly important in case of high mathematical complexity models like anns whose parameters lack of direct interpretability and physical significance olden and jackson 2002 actually data driven regression models capture input output relationships as they perceive them in the available training data after model identification it is important in engineering applications to interpret the predictive relationships derived from the data and to compare the regression analysis results with a priori knowledge about phenomena the use of vsa presents some advantages in inspecting the model as briefly detailed in the supplementary material paragraph 7 values of s i from the vsa are reported in fig 1 computed both for the rr model as an example of a linear model and the ann model for the three studied datasets in many cases the index is almost null as a result of the shrinking effect on the model parameters produced by the penalty on the loss function imposed both by rr and weight decay in ann training results about dataset 1 show that ph is the most relevant factor in determining the variance of the output both for the linear and the nonlinear model cases 30 40 in the nonlinear case conductivity resulted also as an important factor with about 10 contribution to the total variance the relationship with e coli concentration is negative both for ph and conductivity a possible interpretation is that the most significant increase in e coli concentration occurs during intense rain events when the contribution of stormwater lowers ph and conductivity stormwater can actually determine sharp increase in e coli concentration due to urban runoff and sediment re suspension in the sewer mccarthy 2009 hathaway and hunt 2011 mckergow and davies colley 2010 the use of ph and conductivity as proxies of the incoming of stormwater instead of directly using the rainfall data as a predictor avoids the critical issues of modeling the delay between the occurrence of rain events and the incoming of stormwater in the wwtp which implies the description of the corrivation phenomena and the choice of optimal rainfall monitoring sites moreover acquisition of ph and conductivity data from on line sensors is a much more practical solution than implementing the real time transmission of rainfall data from monitoring sites the wwtp1 case study is then a clear example of how a soft sensor can exploit available monitoring data in order to catch proxy relationships which work as surrogates of the real physical cause effect laws of the target phenomena changes in conductivity or ph are not the physical cause of e coli increase but they are indirectly correlated to that the importance of ph and conductivity stands only for this dataset in the other two cases their contribution to the output variance is almost negligible since no rain events occurred during data collection ph and conductivity lose their role of proxies of wet weather conditions unexpectedly temperature did not result as an important predictor for the case of dataset 1 probably temperature in the effluent varied in a too narrow range to determine significant changes in e coli concentration however since a relationship between temperature and bacteria vitality exists the role of temperature should be further studied in models trained over dataset 2 most of the output variance about 50 is caused by turbidity significant correlations between turbidity and e coli concentration were found many times in surface waters christensen et al 2002 jamieson et al 2005 money et al 2009 huey meyer 2010 wu et al 2011 which can be explained by the tendency of e coli to attach to particles hipsey et al 2006 dickenson and sansalone 2012 liu et al 2013 jiang et al 2015 association of coliforms on suspended solids in wastewater is still poorly explored but it has been highlighted in some studies loge et al 2002 falsanisi et al 2008 mckergow and davies colley 2010 chahal et al 2016 carr√© et al 2018 it is then highly probable that increases in e coli concentration in wwtp2 and wwtp3 were determined by a higher contribution of the particle associated fraction in the influent due to temporary decrease of upstream treatments efficiencies or higher suspended solids loads to the plant in the case of dataset 3 models were trained and validated on data coming from all the three wwtps considered in this study thus corresponding sensitivity analysis results are better candidates than the dataset 1 and 2 case to describe general relationships between physical and chemical characteristics of wastewater and e coli concentration for dataset 3 uv254 cod turbidity and tss resulted as most important predictors for all the four predictors the correlation with e coli is positive thus in this general case the soft sensor captures the increase in e coli concentration that is correlated with a global worsening in wastewater quality in terms of organic content and suspended solids dependence of coliforms concentration on treatment efficiency of organic matter and solids was already highlighted by george et al 2002 and koivunen et al 2003 the role of tss and turbidity can be explained as for dataset 2 but in these cases both the two aggregated indicators of suspended solids turned out to be important which can be explained by the difference in their measuring principles turbidity which is an optical method can be affected by particle size gregory 2009 he and nan 2012 yao et al 2014 with larger particles usually contributing more to the overall nephelometric turbidity units ntus since particle size was pointed as a factor in determining particle association of coliform with bacteria typically attaching on larger particles falsanisi et al 2008 chahal et al 2016 both turbidity and tss were probably kept by the model as predictors in order to account both for total suspended solids mass and particle size as well as their interaction the importance of cod was likely due in part to the fact that a fraction of the residual organic matter in the effluent was in the form of suspended solids however the almost equal relevance of abs254 indicate that soluble organic matter is correlated to e coli concentration as well a candidate reason behind this evidence is that lower efficiencies of the activated sludge treatments in removing soluble organic carbon can be due to lower biological activities and thus weaker ecological barriers for e coli it was in fact highlighted in literature by long time how predation especially by protozoa is the main mechanism determining abatement of fecal bacteria in biological treatments van der drift et al 1977 loge et al 2002 non optimal conditions of activated sludge may also cause the formation of smaller and less settling flocs thus more difficultly removable by secondary settlers and filters this could be another reason why increase in sst and turbidity work as predictors of increases in e coli concentration overall there are some big discrepancies among the results from the three different datasets that worth to be discussed first of all as already mentioned dataset 1 leads to models which are completely different from the other two cases because in wwtp1 occurrence of intense rain events resulted as the only cause of sharp increases in e coli concentration determining variations of one order of magnitude results coming from dataset 1 are then really site specific and no general interpretation of the phenomena can be inferred the different ranges of variability of e coli concentration in the different datasets highlighted in figs 2 and 3 have to be considered as well data from dataset 1 are mainly comprised between 1 000 and 10 000 cfu 100 ml with a minor portion of data regarding wet weather conditions which reach about 60 000 cfu 100 ml differently data from dataset 2 range between 10 000 to 500 000 cfu 100 ml similarly cod tss uv254 and turbidity data vary in different ranges in the three datasets the three datasets complement each other and thus their combination allows to better explore their space of variability and consequently reveal more relationships with e coli concentration this is one of the reasons why predictors ranking changed completely from dataset 1 to dataset 2 in the latter case the wider distribution of data in their variability space allows to the regression analysis to catch the role of turbidity in predicting e coli concentration since dataset 3 is the sum of all the collected data from all the three studied wwtps it is the one having the most complete picture on e coli concentration and wastewater quality variability and thus in addition to turbidity it can capture the role of additional predictors being uv254 cod and tss sa on ann based soft sensors revealed that interactions among predictors are responsible of an important portion of the total variance 25 30 this result together with the significant increase in performances with respect to the linear models highlights that the relationship between e coli concentration and wastewater quality characteristics is mainly nonlinear and thus a family of nonlinear models like ann is the best candidate for soft sensor in conclusion the coupling of model selection techniques and sa revealed how wastewater characteristics can be screened and prioritized in order to understand which are essential to build an effective predictive model as an e coli soft sensor 3 4 example of model deployment over a scenario fig 4 reports predictions during the time window of the ann based soft sensor calibrated on dataset 1 the single ann model predictions approximate well almost all the test measurements importantly the soft sensor catches the increase in e coli concentration occurring around 01 11 2018 which coincided with intense rain events even if the model cannot explicitly discriminate between dry and wet weather conditions it captures the sharp increase in e coli concentration thanks to the wastewater quality variables which are real time monitored and can work as proxies of a higher contribution of stormwater to the overall flow rate thus the model testing support the interpretation of sa results previously reported predictions from bootstrap averaging of the anne are also reported in fig 4 average predictions are similar to the single ann model except for the wet weather condition cases in this period average predictions of the anne are significantly lower than the single ann leading to a dramatical underestimation of e coli in a critical event however the bagging approach has the advantage of producing an estimate of the confidence interval of the prediction the 95 confidence interval always contains all the observed concentrations of the test subset the upper bound of the anne is then a valuable reference to describe e coli concentration when the goal is the optimization of disinfectant dosage since it both provides an adequate safety factor and catches the main fluctuation in e coli load occurring in the considered time window table 4 reports paa consumption that would be required during the whole time window considering the different approaches for e coli concentration estimation consumptions data were computed for discharge limits equal to 5 000 and 10 cfu 100 ml which are respectively the limits for surface water discharge and agricultural reuse in italy the bm1 approach was totally inadequate for the discharge limit into surface water since the average e coli concentration observed in the calibration subset was lower than the discharge limit itself considering e coli as a constant equal to the observed average leads to a critical underestimation which even leads to conclude that no paa dosage would be needed considering all the other approaches as expected the bm2 brings to the highest paa consumption guaranteeing a good safety factor since only the most critical e coli concentration is underestimated when the single ann model is used a paa mass saving is obtained being respectively 57 for the discharge limit in surface water and 55 for the reuse limit moreover even if e coli concentration is often underestimated the error is quite small table 3 lastly when the anne is used considering the upper bound of the 95 confidence interval a reduction in paa consumption of 12 and 25 and a wide enough safety factor in order to never underestimate e coli concentration were obtained 4 conclusions in this study an innovative soft sensor based on black box regression models is proposed for real time virtual monitoring of e coli concentration at the inlet of full scale disinfection units relying on data from three wwtps soft sensor regressors using different physical and chemical characteristics as predictors were calibrated and gave satisfying performances performances of the ann based soft sensors were significantly higher than any linear model tested highlighting the importance of nonlinearities and interactions in the relationships between wastewater physical and chemical characteristics and e coli concentration based on the results of the sensitivity analysis in one case study the soft sensor was able to capture e coli concentration variations due to intense rain events by exploiting ph and conductivity as proxy variables of the presence of stormwater in the flow rate differently when data coming from all the case studies are considered variables describing a general worsening of the upstream treatment efficiency being cod uv absorbance tss and turbidity resulted as the driving predictors discrepancies of the results among the datasets underlined how this kind of black box regressor can have strongly site specific validity when data from just one case study are considered the combinations of data from three wwtps effluents allows to develop a model which was likely more generalizable then this work could be additionally developed by collecting a bigger dataset with data coming from a higher number of wwtps which could more robustly substantiate general conclusions on the physical cause effect relationships describing the phenomena the ann based soft sensor was tested over a scenario of wastewater quality and the model predictions of e coli concentration were used to simulate the control of the dosage of a paa disinfection treatment the simulation highlighted the significant benefits of the deployment of an e coli soft sensor both in terms of paa saving up to 57 and process reliability this study highlighted the potential of the soft sensor solution to unlock a new dynamic approach in optimization and control of disinfection which accounts for the indicator bacteria load dynamics by passing the drawbacks of laboratory culture methods and new on line bacteria sensors different regularization techniques were compared in order to deal with a limited dataset establishing a monitoring routine of indicator bacteria at the inlet of wwtps disinfection by plant managers could help in building big enough datasets to improve the soft sensor robustness before deployment particularly other important parameters could be monitored and studied such as dissolved oxygen concentration which could affect microbial vitality after an initial intensive data collection the monitoring protocol should include a periodical data collection in order to perform proper model maintenance since black box regression models could be biased by

17221,ciprofloxacin cip one of the most widely used fluoroquinolone antibiotics is frequently detected in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants and aquatic environments in this study a cip degrading bacterial strain was isolated from the sulfate reducing bacteria srb enriched sludge identified as paraclostridium sp i e strain s2 the effects of critical operational parameters on cip removal by the strain s2 were systematically studied and these parameters were optimized via response surface methodology to maximize cip removal furthermore the pathway and kinetics of cip removal

of 1975 7 109 1 ¬µg g cell dry weight h at an initial cip concentration of 20 mg l based on the main transformation products several biotransformation pathways have been proposed including piperazine ring cleavage oh f substitution decarboxylation and hydroxylation as the major transformation reactions catalyzed by cytochrome p450 and dehydrogenases acute toxicity assessment apparently shows that cip biotransformation by strain s2 resulted in the formation of less toxic intermediates to the best of our knowledge this is the very first study in which a key functional microbe paraclostridium sp highly effective in cip biotransformation was isolated from srb enriched sludge the findings of this study could facilitate in developing appropriate bioaugmentation strategy and in designing and

biological wastewater treatment 1 introduction ciprofloxacin cip is a widely prescribed synthetic fluoroquinolone fq antibiotic for both human therapy and veterinary applications cip accounted nearly 68 of total consumption of the second generation quinolones in the european union eu in 2014 and is the second most widely used fq antibiotic in china with an annual consumption of 4844 t in 2013 zhang et al 2015 ecdc 2018 since cip is only partially metabolized by humans large amount of the consumed cip is excreted via urine 45 62 and feces 15 25 and is eventually discharged into the wastewater treatment plants wwtps golet et al 2003 cip was detected in municipal wastewater in the range of 0 015 246 1 Œºg l gao et al 2012 mohapatra et al 2016 and is regarded amongst the top ten priority pharmaceuticals frequently found in the aquatic environments de voogt et al 2009 moreover substantially high concentrations of cip were detected in the effluents from drug manufacturing

knowledge no studies have so far isolated and characterized the functional bacterial species from the srb enriched sludge effective for cip biotransformation it is however critically important to identify the predominant functional bacteria in srb enriched sludge responsible for cip removal and understand the underlying biotransformation mechanism and pathways such information would be helpful in developing appropriate bioaugmentation strategy and in designing and operating an srb based engineered process for cip laden wastewater treatment cip is highly recalcitrant to biodegradation and its removal during a conventional biological wastewater treatment process is mainly via adsorption onto biological sludge oberoi et al 2019 to the best of our knowledge only a few bacterial and fungal

2001 the potential toxicity of such intermediates formed during cip biotransformation needs to be examined for broader environmental implications in this study we successfully isolated cip degrading strain from the srb enriched sludge and identified as paraclostridium sp based on physiological characteristics and 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis the effects of different operational conditions such as ph temperature and initial concentrations of organic carbon and sulfate so4 2 on cip removal were examined furthermore multivariate optimization method i e response surface methodology rsm was applied to assess the interactive effects among the selected operational conditions on cip removal the cip removal kinetics via adsorption and biotransformation by paraclostridium sp under the optimized conditions were also determined furthermore based on the intermediate compounds identified and enzymatic assay cip biotransformation pathways catalyzed by the functional enzymes were proposed finally the potential acute toxicity of cip biotransformation products was assessed by microtox bioassay this study not only isolated identified and characterized the key microbe from srb enriched sludge capable of degrading cip effectively but also provided a new opportunity for both basic and applied research employing the newly isolated strain paraclostridium sp for cip laden

analysis see pages s8 s9 in si for more details 2 2 batch experiments to investigate the cip removal efficiency pathways and mechanism by the isolated strain s2 under different conditions a series of batch experiments in triplicate were conducted in serum bottles 100 ml working volume wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid photodegradation with synthetic culture media see table s3 in si for composition the strain s2 used in all experiments was grown to the mid log phase in culture media based on the growth curve of strain s2 and the bacterial cells were then collected by centrifugation at 5080 g and 4 c for 10 min finally the harvested cells were washed thrice with sterilized 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 0 and resuspended in experimental media to an optical density of 1 0 at 600 nm od600 before inoculation all the experiments were performed in triplicate and the results are reported as mean standard deviation 2 2 1 optimization of operational parameters and their influence on cip removal by the strain s2 different operational parameters such as ph 5 0 9 0 temperature 15 45 c and initial chemical oxygen demand cod 150 3000 mg l and so4 2 50 1500 mg so4 2 l concentrations were examined for their effect on the growth of strain s2 and cip removal using one factor at a time optimization approach see table s4 in si for experimental scheme at a constant cip concentration of 10 mg l the bacterial cells suspension was inoculated into the synthetic media at a ratio of 10 v v in all batch experiments subsequently the operational parameters were optimized and possible interactive effect among these parameters were evaluated using rsm based five level central composite design ccd consisting of 30 experimental runs see pages s9 s10 and tables s5 and s6 in si for details 2 2 2 cip removal pathways and kinetics by the strain s2 three groups i e i ii and iii of batch experiments were conducted to examine the cip removal pathways e g via adsorption and biotransformation by the strain s2 at different initial cip concentrations of 0 1 1 5 10 and 20 mg l see table s7 in si for experimental plan these values were chosen to evaluate the cip removal potential of the strain s2 at a wide range of cip concentrations found in municipal hospital and pharmaceutical wastewaters larsson et al 2007 daouk et al 2016 mohapatra et al 2016 group i designated as a control i e without inoculum was conducted to determine the possible removal of cip via hydrolysis and volatilization in group ii 0 1 sodium azide nan3 was added to inhibit the microbial activity to examine the abiotic removal of cip via adsorption hydrolysis and volatilization in group iii a set of experiments was conducted for 3 d to determine the total removal of cip by the strain s2 and these experiments were initiated by inoculating the culture media with active bacterial cells initial od600 of 0 1 the cip removal via adsorption and biotransformation was calculated based on the difference between the experimental results in groups i ii and iii the batch experiments of each group were conducted in triplicate under optimized experimental conditions determined via rsm the cip removal efficiency and specific removal rate via adsorption and biotransformation were calculated following the equations eqs s2 s7 in page s11 in si moreover cip adsorption kinetics was also investigated using pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption models eqs s9 and s10 respectively in page s12 in si and the total cip removal kinetics and half lives t 1 2 were investigated using zero first and second order kinetic models eqs s11 s16 see pages s12 s13 in si for details finally the potential of the strain s2 in degrading other fq antibiotics e g ofloxacin ofl norfloxacin nor and enrofloxacin enr was also examined see table s8 in si for details 2 2 3 key functional enzymes and possible pathways of cip biotransformation by the strain s2 the possible role of the cytochrome p450 cyp450 enzymes in cip biotransformation was evaluated by adding specific enzyme inhibitor 1 aminobenzotriazole 1 abt to the cell culture of strain s2 see table s9 in si for details the role of dehydrogenases in cip biotransformation by the strain s2 was evaluated using calorimetric method i e iodonitrotetrazolium chloride int dehydrogenase assay see pages s13 s14 and table s10 in si for details additionally the control test i e without enzyme inhibitor was also conducted to examine the intermediates and possible pathways of cip biotransformation by the strain s2 2 2 4 acute toxicity evaluation of cip biotransformation intermediates via microtox bioassay the acute toxicity of cip and its biotransformation products was assessed via the bioluminescence inhibition test conducted with bacterium vibrio fischeri jq tox kit iv china using lumistox toxicity analyzer hach usa the assay was carried out at 15 c according to the standard operating procedure of the international organization for standardization iso 11 348 3 2007 the experimental samples tested were collected from the time course degradation experiments at an interval of 12 h and the initial cip concentration of 10 mg l measurement of luminescence of bacterium v fischeri at time zero and after 30 min of incubation with samples containing cip biotransformation intermediates by the strain s2 was carried out and compared with control solution 2 sodium chloride to determine inhibition moreover the incubated samples with synthetic culture media and bacterial inoculum strain s2 at initial od600 of 0 1 but without cip addition were analyzed to determine a background inhibition and to exclude the possibility of any toxicity posed by the media components see table s11 for experimental plan 2 3 analytical methods cip and other fqs ofl nor and enr in aqueous phase were quantified using an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc see table s12 in si for details high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer hplc ms ms applied biosystems sciex triple quad 5500 usa was used to analyze the metabolites more details on extraction and analysis are given in pages s14 s15 in si cod analysis was carried out as per the standard methods apha 2012 so4 2 sulfite so3 2 and thiosulfate s2o3 2 in aqueous phase were analyzed by

and scanning electron microscopy sem examination sigma 500 zeiss germany see page s16 in si for details 2 4 statistical analysis all the experiments were conducted in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation one way analysis of variance anova was conducted using spss 16 0 ibm usa with statistical significance defined at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation and identification of a cip degrading bacterial strain following acclimation to cip and selective enrichment for over a period of three months a bacterial strain was isolated and identified from the srb enriched sludge designated as strain s2 in this study the isolated strain was identified as a gram positive and rod shaped bacterium based on its physiological and morphological characteristics fig s3 in si basic local alignment search tool blast analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequence of strain s2 with the retrieved sequences from the genbank database suggested that the strain was closely related to the genus paraclostridium and possessed the highest sequence identity 100 with paraclostridium bifermentans strain w18006c2 genbank accession number kp944166 1 subsequently the phylogenetic tree was constructed using mega x software and the neighbor joining phylogenetic tree clearly showed that the isolated strain s2 positioned within the cluster of the genus paraclostridium fig s4 in si the complete taxonomical hierarchy of the strain was determined using ribosomal database project rdp classifier tool and the strain s2 was found to belong to phylum firmicutes class clostridia family peptostreptococcaceae and genus paraclostridium the 16s rrna gene sequence consisting of 1372 nucleotides has been deposited in the genbank database under accession no mw040845 the gram positive bacteria have better adaptability and self protection mechanism against the xenobiotic compounds because of its stronger cell envelope structure than the gram negative bacteria the bacteria belonging to the genus paraclostridium could produce endospores as an adaptation mechanism and survive under extreme environmental conditions wong et al 2018 bacteria from the genus paraclostridium played an important role in the biodegradation of several recalcitrant organic pollutants including chlorinated aliphatic compounds e g tetrachloroethylene chang et al 2001 explosives e g 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene tnt and cyclic nitroamines zhao et al 2003 through diverse metabolic pathways however to date no studies have isolated identified and characterized pure culture from srb enriched sludge and examined its efficacy in biotransformation of fq antibiotics especially cip 3 2 optimization of cip degradation by strain s2 3 2 1 one factor at a time optimization the effect of key factors such as ph temperature and initial so4 2 and cod concentrations on cip removal by the strain s2 was evaluated ph not only affects the cell surface charge but also influences the cell membrane permeability and the activity of carrier proteins and enzymes associated with the metabolic processes zarfl et al 2008 in addition the ionic speciation of cip molecule is also ph driven therefore ph plays an important role in cip removal via both adsorption and biodegradation oberoi et al 2019 as shown in fig s5 a in si the highest cip removal efficiency 80 specific removal rate 2767 ¬µg g cell dry weight wt h and bacterial growth od600 1 2 were found at neutral initial ph 7 0 however both removal efficiency and microbial growth declined significantly p 0 05 when the initial ph was below 6 0 or above 8 0 this finding was in close agreement with several studies using pure strains where microbial growth and biodegradation of antibiotics such as cip and sulfamethazine were more effective at aqueous phase ph between 6 0 to 8 0 pan et al 2018 cao et al 2019 temperature is also equally critical parameter affecting cip biodegradation due to its influence on bacterial growth and enzyme activity paraclostridium bifermentans possessing 100 of sequence identity with strain s2 isolated in this study is a mesophilic bacterium with the optimum growth temperature between 25 and 45 c kutsuna et al 2018 hence the temperatures of 15 25 35 and 45 c were selected in this study to examine its effect on cip removal and bacterial growth the results showed that the cip removal efficiency and specific removal rate increased significantly p 0 05 and closely correlated with bacterial cells proliferation while increasing temperature from 15 to 35 c fig s5 b in si at high temperature of 45 c there was a significant decline in cip removal efficiency which was associated with decrease in microbial activity fig s5 b in si on the other hand at temperatures below the optimum range 25 35 c decrease in microbial growth rate could be related to the decrease in cell membrane fluidity and nutrient transport efficiency of the membrane proteins nedwell et al 1999 which corroborated well with the findings of this study as shown in fig s5 c in si cip removal efficiency and specific removal rate increased with increasing initial cod from 150 to 1000 mg l the higher cip removal could be attributed to the enhanced microbial growth and the up regulated expression of key functional enzymes e g dehydrogenases involved in the biotransformation zhang et al 2020 interestingly when cod concentration was further increased to 1500 and 3000 mg l significant decrease p 0 05 in specific cip removal rate was observed despite increase in cell growth fig s5 c in si this negative effect of higher cod concentrations on cip removal could be the result of carbon catabolite repression i e reduction in the synthesis of peripheral catabolic enzymes in the presence of excess readily biodegradable carbon source muller et al 1996 since the strain s2 was isolated from the srb enriched sludge system bacterial cell growth and activity are likely to be affected by so4 2 concentration as apparent from fig s5 d in si the increase in so4 2 concentrations from 50 to 500 mg so4 2 l promoted both the cip removal efficiency and the specific removal rate p 0 05 along with enhancement in cell growth the highest cip removal efficiency and specific removal rate of 81 6 0 1 and 2767 5 21 7 ¬µg g cell dry wt h respectively were obtained at an initial so4 2 concentration of 500 mg so4 2 l the finding was in close agreement with other studies where so4 2 addition enhanced the biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds including pharmaceuticals e g naproxen he et al 2018 and antibiotics e g trimethoprim tmp liang et al 2019 interestingly further increase in so4 2 concentration to 800 and 1500 mg so4 2 l resulted in significant p 0 05 decrease in specific cip removal rate despite enhanced cell growth cip adsorption on the bacterial cell surface is strongly associated with cip speciation which is influenced by the aqueous phase ph since the experiments were conducted at neutral ph 7 0 0 2 cip mainly existed in zwitterionic form cip 90 with nh2 and coo as functional groups zhang et al 2019a the presence of so4 2 anion at high concentration caused significant decrease in cip adsorption onto the microbial surface as the so4 2 anions could form ionic pair with the zwitterionic cip molecule thereby subsequently decreasing the electrostatic interaction between cip molecule and the negatively charged microbial surface zhang et al 2019a 3 2 2 multivariate optimization based on four factor ccd matrix table s5 in si a quadratic polynomial equation eq s17 in si in terms of coded factors was established by applying multiple regression analysis to determine the specific cip removal rate based on independent variables and their interactions the significance of the fit of the second order polynomial model was assessed by carrying out the analysis of variance anova and the results are presented in table s13 in si details of statistical analysis of the polynomial model are given in si see pages s16 s18 and figs s6 s7 and s8 to gain better understanding of the combined effect of four independent variables on specific cip removal rate the results obtained from the model were plotted as 3d response surface with their corresponding contour plots fig 1 each plot shows the effect of two variables within the ranges studied with the other two variables fixed at the zero level the maximum cip removal could be attained at the intersection of center levels of both factors i e ph 7 0 and temperature 35 c as shown in fig 1 a in addition the curvature in the response to the ph and temperature reflects the statistically significant effect of the quadratic form for these factors see table s13 in si for details furthermore the relative elliptical nature of the contour plots revealed significant interaction between factors cod and so4 2 concentrations on specific cip removal rate at constant ph 7 0 and temperature of 35 c fig 1 d significantly higher specific cip removal rate was obtained with increasing the cod concentrations from 500 to1000 mg l thereafter the cip removal gradually decreased with further increase in cod concentration and this effect was more pronounced at higher so4 2 concentrations the cod and so4 2 concentrations of 915 mg l and 544 mg so4 2 l respectively cod so4 2 mass ratio of 1 7 were found to be the optimum values for maximum cip removal the optimum so4 2 concentration and cod so4 2 mass ratio enhanced the specific growth rate of the strain s2 which in turn resulted in higher specific cip removal rate the results obtained are in consistent with other studies where the optimum cod so4 2 mass ratios were between 1 5 and 2 3 choi and rim 1991 the response surface and contour plots showing interaction among other influencing factors are depicted in figs s9 and s10 in si quadratic polynomial model eq s17 in si was used to predict the maximum specific cip removal rate i e 2862 ¬µg g cell dry wt h by the strain s2 under the optimum conditions i e ph 7 0 temperature of 34 3 c and so4 2 and cod concentrations of 544 mg so4 2 l and 915 mg l respectively in order to further confirm the accuracy of the model prediction for cip removal rate additional experiments were carried out under the above stated optimum conditions notably the average specific cip removal rate was 2894 ¬µg g cell dry wt h which was not significantly different p 0 05 from the predicted one this apparently shows that the quadratic polynomial model accurately predicted the optimum conditions obtained through the experiment in this study therefore the subsequent batch experiments were carried out under the optimum conditions 3 3 cip removal pathways and kinetics by the strain s2 the time course cip removal and bacterial growth profile at different initial cip concentrations 0 1 20 mg l are presented in fig 2 there was a lag phase of 3 6 h depending on the initial cip concentration at the beginning of the bacterial growth and subsequently the strain s2 started to grow in the logarithmic growth phase the growth of the strain s2 was influenced by cip concentration and the specific growth rate Œº of bacterial cells was found to be 0 15 and 0 13 h 1 at cip concentrations of 1 and 20 mg l respectively initially the removal of cip occurred rapidly which coincided with high cod removal so4 2 reduction and cell growth rate after that the removal of cip by the strain s2 occurred rather slowly and reached plateau within 24 h the results show that the rapid degradation of cip was associated with maximum biomass concentration which was most likely due to high availability of readily degradable carbon source at the beginning moreover strong correlation between so4 2 reduction and growth of the strain s2 was observed r2 0 928 infact the occurrence of bacteria belonging to the genus paraclostridium often reported in the environments e g marine sediment with high so4 2 concentration sasi jyothsna et al 2016 the influent so4 2 was reduced into dissolved sulfide and other sulfur intermediates e g s2o3 2 so3 2 and elemental sulfur which were also regularly measured during the batch experiments and their concentrations were below the detection limit see fig s11 in si for cod and so4 2 removal efficiencies at different initial cip concentrations the cip removal gradually decreased with an increase in initial cip concentration fig 2 b at initial cip concentrations of 0 1 and 1 mg l rapid complete removal occurred 100 in less than 24 h however the removal efficiencies decreased to 74 72 and 57 when the initial cip concentrations were increased to 5 10 and 20 mg l respectively it is worth mentioning that the removal efficiency of cip by the strain s2 in this study was significantly higher than the other microorganisms i e ochrobactrum sp 34 and bradyrhizobium sp 26 at the same initial cip concentration of 10 mg l nguyen et al 2018 feng et al 2019 abiotic control test results showed insignificant cip removal via volatilization and hydrolysis and the removal via photolysis was negligible as all the serum bottles were wrapped with aluminum foil during the experiments fig s12 in si thus cip removal from the aqueous phase was primarily attributed to adsorption and biotransformation the contributions of adsorption and biotransformation to cip removal were determined at different initial cip concentrations and the specific adsorption and biotransformation rates of cip by the strain s2 are shown in fig 2 b at lower concentrations 0 1 and 1 mg l cip was mainly removed via adsorption however biotransformation was the dominant pathway at higher concentrations 5 10 and 20 mg l biodegradation is usually limited by the substrate threshold which relies on the concentration of the target compound in the culture medium and its availability to the microorganisms this threshold could be associated with the chemical or the physical factors for instance it can be due to mass transfer limitation for uptake by the microbial cells at low concentrations marozava et al 2019 such threshold values also vary with the types of pollutant to be degraded and the microbes and the environment rapp and timmis 1999 distinct threshold concentration for stimulation of enzymes and biotransformation of trace organic micropollutants has been reported for many other bacteria rapp and timmis 1999 kovar et al 2002 these factors could have contributed to low biotransformation efficiency and rate at low initial cip concentrations of 0 1 and 1 mg l it is apparent that the strain s2 was highly effective in cip biotransformation and the specific biotransformation rate increased significantly p 0 05 with increase in initial cip concentrations as more cip was bioavailable to the microorganisms fig 2 b additionally microorganisms have different mechanisms to respond to the toxic compounds including fq antibiotics at high concentrations e g by changing the gene regulation of the bacterial cells e g the presence of efflux pump and the cell envelope modification and the phenotype e g bacterial biotransformation capacity which determine their metabolic potential poole 2000 finally the genus paraclostridium has an ability to produce endospore which facilitates its survival under extreme or unfavorable growth conditions wong et al 2018 the kinetic data fitted well with pseudo second order model r2 0 960 implying that the chemisorption was the rate controlling mechanism for cip adsorption see table s14 in si furthermore the total cip removal kinetics as a function of different initial concentrations was determined the r2 values ranged from 0 907 to 0 988 which demonstrated that the cip removal conformed well to the first order kinetics and the corresponding rate constant k and the half life degradation time t1 2 were summarized in table s15 in si the results obtained in this study k 0 73 d 1 t1 2 0 95 d at an initial cip concentration of 5 mg l showed that the strain s2 was highly effective in the removal of cip compared to other pure bacterial strains including labrys portucalensis k 0 02 d 1 t1 2 37 50 d and thermus sp k 0 38 d 1 t1 2 1 85 d amorim et al 2014 pan et al 2018 finally the isolated strain s2 was examined for its effectiveness in removing other antibiotics belonging to the same fqs class as cip e g ofl nor and enr at initial concentration of 5 mg l the results showed that the enr ofl and nor were effectively removed by the strain s2 via adsorption and biotransformation with the removal efficiency of 68 56 and 60 respectively after 3 d of incubation fig 2 c a more detailed discussion pertaining to other antibiotics removal is provided in pages s18 s19 in si this finding suggests that the strain s2 likely possesses one or more enzymes with broad specificity for antibiotics biotransformation the strain s2 could be further employed to augment srb sludge to improve antibiotics removal in a complex microbial community structure this has practical implications in developing successful bioaugmentation strategies for fq antibiotics laden wastewater treatment 3 4 functional enzymes involved in cip biotransformation the intracellular cyp450 enzymes play a pivotal role in the biotransformation of antibiotics and other xenobiotic compounds especially for fungal species by catalyzing various reactions such as ipso substitution cleavage of piperazinyl ring through epoxidation defluorination oxidation reduction and hydroxylation chong et al 2014 girvan and munro 2016 the possible roles of cyp450 and dehydrogenase enzymes in cip biotransformation were investigated through in vivo batch assays using whole cell of the strain s2 and the experimental results are shown in fig 3 a and b respectively the key function of cyp450 enzymes in cip biotransformation was substantiated by adding the specific inhibitor 1 abt since significant suppression p 0 05 of cip removal efficiency and specific biotransformation rate 53 8 4 7 and 830 4 39 0 ¬µg g cell dry wt h respectively was observed compared to that in control test no inhibitor 73 6 0 6 and 1780 3 52 9 ¬µg g cell dry wt h respectively the dehydrogenase enzymes are intracellular enzymes of the oxidoreductase family which catalyze the hydroxylation reaction under anaerobic condition dermer and fuchs 2012 szaleniec et al 2014 the dehydrogenase activity a good indicator of microbial oxidative activities for cellular biodegradation of xenobiotic organic compounds under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions was determined under different initial cip concentrations in this study as shown in fig 3 b the dehydrogenase activity was significantly p 0 05 stimulated with increase in initial cip concentrations from 0 1 to 20 mg l which was in close agreement with other studies hou et al 2019 there was significant up regulation in dehydrogenase activity in the treatment group compared to the control especially at higher cip concentrations of 10 and 20 mg l the presence of organic pollutants influences the up regulation and down regulation of genes encoding the enzymes involved in the biodegradation as a specific cellular response zhang et al 2019b this up regulation of enzyme activity under distinct growth conditions is probably related to the biotransformation of cip or better tolerance of the strain s2 to cip in addition a positive correlation r 0 966 p 0 01 between dehydrogenase activity and specific cip biotransformation rate apparently showed the involvement of dehydrogenase enzymes in cip biotransformation several previous studies also showed a positive correlation between the dehydrogenase activity and the biodegradation of xenobiotics including antibiotics zhang et al 2020 and pahs hou et al 2019 nonetheless our results suggest the key role of non specific intracellular enzymes i e cyp450 and dehydrogenase enzymes in cip biotransformation by the strain s2 3 5 identification of biotransformation metabolites and pathways the major cip biotransformation intermediates and the possible pathways were further investigated to better understand the catalytic functions of key functional enzymes involved no metabolites were detected in the controls without cip or only cip without microorganisms indicating that all the intermediates formed were produced during cip biotransformation the structures of biotransformation metabolites were proposed based on their retention time target m z fragmentation pattern of tandem ms as well as by referring to previous studies see table s16 in si for details based on the intermediate compounds identified four major cip biotransformation pathways were proposed fig 3 c in pathway i cip m z 332 c17h18fn3o3 biotransformation was initiated from the cleavage of piperazinyl ring and the cn bond was the most likely target that resulted in opening of the ring structure and the formation of the dialdehyde derivative with m z of 362 c17h16fn3o5 biotransformation product tp1 the biotransformation product with m z 334 c16h16fn3o4 tp2 could be formed from m z 362 by losing one aldehyde group followed by decarboxylation thereby leading to formation of tp3 m z 306 c15h16fn3o3 identified as desethylene n cip cyp450 enzymes under anaerobic conditions appear to play a key role in the reductive metabolism catalyzing the reduction of aromatic nitro group to the corresponding amines trager 2006 and their role was also confirmed via batch inhibition test in our study see fig 3 a the formation of tp4 m z 263 c13h11fn2o3 is attributed to the loss of secondary amine nitrogen and formaldehyde from the amine side chain resulted in the complete removal of the piperazine ring the cyp450 enzymes can facilitate the breakdown of the piperazinyl substituent by catalyzing the epoxidation of c c double bond in cip molecular moiety finally tp4 was defluorinated by the cleavage of the c f bond on c6 to form tp5 m z 245 c13h12n2o3 the cyp450 enzymes had previously demonstrated the potential for reductive dehalogenation reactions which involve the release of halogen and its replacement by hydrogen li and wackett 1993 under anaerobic conditions cyp450 enzymes can accept electrons from p450 reductase and use them to catalyze reductive reactions ortiz de montellano 2013 alternatively a defluorinated tp6 m z 288 c15h17n3o3 formed from tp3 which subsequently yields tp5 the degradation of cip in pathway ii could be initiated by defluorination at c 6 to form tp7 m z 330 c17h19n3o4 after that tp8 m z 318 c16h19n3o4 was produced through oxidative decarboxylation reaction at c 3 and complemented by hydroxylation at c 2 in the quinolone moiety the cyp450 enzymes were reported to catalyze defluorination reaction responsible for the formation of tp7 and dehydrogenase enzymes could play a key role in the hydroxylation of the heterocyclic aromatic ring under anaerobic conditions szaleniec et al 2014 jia et al 2018 the substitution of the terminal carboxyl by a hydroxyl group at position c 3 of cip resulted in the generation of tp9 m z 304 c16h18fn3o2 in pathway iii wetzstein et al 1999 ou et al 2016 the formation of tp10 m z 348 c17h18fn3o4 in pathway iv probably resulted from the electrophilic adduct reaction occurred at c 2 leading to the addition of hydroxyl radical on the c c bond in the quinolone moiety of the cip molecule intriguingly the biotransformation of cip involves an unprecedented anaerobic hydroxylation at c 2 of the quinolone moiety thereby yielding tp10 hydroxylation of the aromatic ring is an important reaction in the metabolism of the heterocyclic compounds the steric requirements of the enzyme involved in the hydroxylation reaction might favor substitution at c 2 position adjacent to the heteroatom of aromatic ring which further destabilizes the ring structure grbic galic 1990 the pattern of hydroxylation at c 2 position in heterocyclic ring of quinolone moiety of cip molecule in this study was similar to that previously reported during the initial biotransformation of quinoline indole and nicotinic acid catalyzed by srb e g desulfobacterium indolicum and clostridium barkeri under sulfate reducing condition licht et al 1997 it is well known that in anaerobic biotransformation pathways dehydrogenase enzymes can be regarded as a counterpart to oxygenases catalyzing o2 dependent hydroxylation and they use water as a source of oxygen atom for the aromatic ring hydroxylation reactions kniemeyer and heider 2001 dermer and fuchs 2012 therefore the higher dehydrogenase activity observed in this study see fig 3 b could be correlated with the hydroxylation at c 2 of the heterocyclic ring in pathways ii and iv since the overall dehydrogenase activity depends on the catalytic activity of the various dehydrogenases the exact dehydrogenase enzymes catalyzing cip biotransformation could not be identified in this study and more in depth studies at transcriptomics and proteomics levels are needed though the strain s2 demonstrated good cip removal efficiency fig 2 a and b the complete cip mineralization by the strain s2 could not be achieved as some of the metabolic intermediates were still present in the batch reactor even after 72 h most of the identified biotransformation products retained the core quinolone ring structure which is essential to the antibacterial activity of cip paul et al 2010 thus to assess the toxicity variation during cip biotransformation by the strain s2 the acute toxicity was examined the results show that the inhibition intensity decreased significantly p 0 05 from 18 to 2 within first 24 h and then further declined to 4 at the end of 48 h fig s13 in si the detail discussion on decreased toxicity is provided in pages s19 s20 in si this apparently shows that the cip biotransformation by the strain s2 resulted in less toxic biotransformation products 4 conclusions in recent years considerable research efforts have been made in developing sulfur based biological processes employing srb enriched sludge for the treatment of pharmaceutical laden e g smx cip tmp and ibuprofen wastewater our previous study employed srb enriched sludge for the treatment of cip contaminated wastewater to the best of our knowledge this is the first study in which cip degrading strain s2 i e paraclostridium sp was successfully isolated from the srb enriched sludge for the development of successful bioaugmentation strategy isolation of native microorganisms pure cultures with proven degradation potential and adaptability to changes in environmental conditions is critically important from this perspective our study not only successfully isolated and characterized a highly effective cip degrading strain from the srb enriched sludge but also optimized its growth conditions to maximize the degradation of cip and other fq antibiotics the isolation of effective cip degrading microbe has significant scientific and engineering merits for the detoxification of fqs in srb mediated biological wastewater treatment process the ubiquitous presence of the bacterium belonging to the genus paraclostridium in a variety of environmental matrices such as marine sediments oil producing wells and landfill leachate along with its ability to catabolize a wide range of toxic e g cyanophycin benzene and emerging organic contaminants presents a new opportunity in bioremediation of cip and other fq antibiotics in wastewaters our study shows that biotransformation is a major mechanism of cip removal by the strain s2 and that both piperazinyl ring and quinolone moiety of cip molecule are potential targets for bacterial metabolism bacterial intracellular cyp450 and dehydrogenase are the two key functional enzymes responsible for the biotransformation and detoxification of cip with generation of less toxic intermediates by the strain s2 however the exact cyp450 and dehydrogenase enzymes catalyzing cip biotransformation remain unidentified the identification of a pure culture involved in biodegradation of cip will enable the identification of functional enzymes underlying the biotransformation reactions the whole genome sequencing and comparative proteomics and or transcriptomics analyses can be used to identify the key degradative genes or proteins which are up regulated during growth or exposure to cip and more in depth studies are needed to gain insights into biodegradation mechanisms at a molecular level a detailed knowledge of the microbes genes and enzymes responsible for cip biotransformation would allow better understanding of the environmental fate of cip and other fq antibiotics and the risk associated with their release into the

cip biotransformation by strain s2 resulted in the formation of less toxic intermediates to the best of our knowledge this is the very first study in which a key functional microbe paraclostridium sp highly effective in cip biotransformation was isolated from srb enriched sludge the findings of this study could facilitate in developing appropriate bioaugmentation strategy and in designing and operating an srb based engineered process for treating cip laden wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfate reducing bacteria antibiotics biotransformation toxicity biological wastewater treatment 1 introduction ciprofloxacin cip is a widely prescribed synthetic fluoroquinolone fq antibiotic for both human therapy and veterinary applications cip accounted nearly 68 of total consumption of the second generation quinolones in the european union eu in 2014 and is the second most widely used fq antibiotic in china with an annual consumption of 4844 t in 2013 zhang et al 2015 ecdc 2018 since cip is only partially metabolized by humans large amount of the consumed cip is excreted via urine 45 62 and feces 15 25 and is eventually discharged into the wastewater treatment plants wwtps golet et al 2003 cip was detected in municipal wastewater in the range of 0 015 246 1 Œºg l gao et al 2012 mohapatra et al 2016 and is regarded amongst the top ten

versatile and diverse microbes with the ability to catabolize various xenobiotic compounds including benzene toluene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs kuppardt et al 2014 to the best of our knowledge no studies have so far isolated and characterized the functional bacterial species from the srb enriched sludge effective for cip biotransformation it is however critically important to identify the predominant functional bacteria in srb enriched sludge responsible for cip removal and understand the underlying biotransformation mechanism and pathways such information would be helpful in developing appropriate bioaugmentation strategy and in designing and operating an srb based engineered process for cip laden wastewater treatment cip is highly recalcitrant to biodegradation and its removal during a conventional biological wastewater treatment process is mainly via adsorption onto biological sludge oberoi et al 2019 to the best of our knowledge only a few bacterial and fungal

2001 the potential toxicity of such intermediates formed during cip biotransformation needs to be examined for broader environmental implications in this study we successfully isolated cip degrading strain from the srb enriched sludge and identified as paraclostridium sp based on physiological characteristics and 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis the effects of different operational conditions such as ph temperature and initial concentrations of organic carbon and sulfate so4 2 on cip removal were examined furthermore multivariate optimization method i e response surface methodology rsm was applied to assess the interactive effects among the selected operational conditions on cip removal the cip removal kinetics via adsorption and biotransformation by paraclostridium sp under the optimized conditions were also determined furthermore based on the intermediate compounds identified and enzymatic assay cip biotransformation pathways catalyzed by the functional enzymes were proposed finally the potential acute toxicity of cip biotransformation products was assessed by microtox bioassay this study not only isolated identified and characterized the key microbe from srb enriched sludge capable of degrading cip effectively but also provided a new opportunity for both basic and applied research employing the newly isolated strain paraclostridium sp for cip laden wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 culture enrichment isolation and identification the srb enriched sludge was initially taken from a laboratory scale sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb reactor operating continuously in our laboratory for over 300 d for treatment of cip laden wastewater see pages s6 s7 in supplementary information si for more details for enriching isolating and identifying the key bacterial species responsible for cip biotransformation the modified postgate s culture medium see table s2 in si for composition was used for enrichment and isolation of cip degrading strains see pages s7 s8 and fig s1 in si for operational details and schematic procedure based on its highest cip degrading efficiency the strain hereafter referred to as s2 was selected from the four isolated strains in this study for further investigation see fig s2 in si finally the identification of the strain s2 was carried out via 16s rrna gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis see pages s8 s9 in si for more details 2 2 batch experiments to investigate the cip removal efficiency pathways and mechanism by the isolated strain s2 under different conditions a series of batch experiments in triplicate were conducted in serum bottles 100 ml working volume wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid photodegradation with synthetic culture media see table s3 in si for composition the strain s2 used in all experiments was grown to the mid log phase in culture media based on the growth curve of strain s2 and the bacterial cells were then collected by centrifugation at 5080 g and 4 c for 10 min finally the harvested cells were washed thrice with sterilized 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 0 and resuspended in experimental media to an optical density of 1 0 at 600 nm od600 before inoculation all the experiments were performed in triplicate and the results are reported as mean standard deviation 2 2 1 optimization of operational parameters and their influence on cip removal by the strain s2 different operational parameters such as ph 5 0 9 0 temperature 15 45 c and initial chemical oxygen demand cod 150 3000 mg l and so4 2 50 1500 mg so4 2 l concentrations were examined for their effect on the growth of strain s2 and cip removal using one factor at a time optimization approach see table s4 in si for experimental scheme at a constant cip concentration of 10 mg l the bacterial cells suspension was inoculated into the synthetic media at a ratio of 10 v v in all batch experiments subsequently the operational parameters were optimized and possible interactive effect among these parameters were evaluated using rsm based five level central composite design ccd consisting of 30 experimental runs see pages s9 s10 and tables s5 and s6 in si for

biotransformation by the strain s2 at different initial cip concentrations of 0 1 1 5 10 and 20 mg l see table s7 in si for experimental plan these values were chosen to evaluate the cip removal potential of the strain s2 at a wide range of cip concentrations found in municipal hospital and pharmaceutical wastewaters larsson et al 2007 daouk et al 2016 mohapatra et al 2016 group i designated as a control i e without inoculum was conducted to determine the possible removal of cip via hydrolysis and volatilization in group ii 0 1 sodium azide nan3 was added to inhibit the microbial activity to examine the abiotic removal of cip via adsorption hydrolysis and volatilization in group iii a set of experiments was conducted for 3 d to determine the total removal of cip by the strain s2 and these experiments were initiated by inoculating the culture media with active bacterial cells initial od600 of 0 1 the cip removal via adsorption and biotransformation was calculated based on the difference between the experimental results in groups i ii and iii the batch experiments of each group were conducted in triplicate under optimized experimental conditions determined via rsm the cip removal efficiency and specific removal rate via adsorption and biotransformation were calculated following the equations eqs s2 s7 in page s11 in si moreover cip adsorption kinetics was also investigated using pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption models eqs s9 and s10 respectively in page s12 in si and the total cip removal kinetics and half lives t 1 2 were investigated using zero first and second order kinetic models eqs s11 s16 see pages s12 s13 in si for details finally the potential of the strain s2 in degrading other fq antibiotics e g ofloxacin ofl norfloxacin nor and enrofloxacin enr was also examined see table s8 in si for details 2 2 3 key functional enzymes and possible pathways of cip biotransformation by the strain s2 the possible role of the cytochrome p450 cyp450 enzymes in cip biotransformation was evaluated by adding specific enzyme inhibitor 1 aminobenzotriazole 1 abt to the cell culture of strain s2 see table s9 in si for details the role of dehydrogenases in cip biotransformation by the strain s2 was evaluated using calorimetric method i e iodonitrotetrazolium chloride int dehydrogenase assay see pages s13 s14 and table s10 in si for details additionally the control test i e without enzyme inhibitor was also conducted to examine the intermediates and possible pathways of cip biotransformation by the strain s2 2 2 4 acute toxicity evaluation of cip biotransformation intermediates via microtox bioassay the acute toxicity of cip and its biotransformation products was assessed via the bioluminescence inhibition test conducted with bacterium vibrio fischeri jq tox kit iv china using lumistox toxicity analyzer hach usa the assay was carried out at 15 c according to the standard operating procedure of the international organization for standardization iso 11 348 3 2007 the experimental samples tested were collected from the time course degradation experiments at an interval of 12 h and the initial cip concentration of 10 mg l measurement of luminescence of bacterium v fischeri at time zero and after 30 min of incubation with samples containing cip biotransformation intermediates by the strain s2 was carried out and compared with control solution 2 sodium chloride to determine inhibition moreover the incubated samples with synthetic culture media and bacterial inoculum strain s2 at initial od600 of 0 1 but without cip addition were analyzed to determine a background inhibition and to exclude the possibility of any toxicity posed by the media components see table s11 for experimental plan 2 3 analytical methods cip and other fqs ofl nor and enr in aqueous phase were quantified using an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc see table s12 in si for details high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer hplc ms ms applied biosystems sciex triple quad 5500 usa was used to analyze the metabolites more details on extraction and analysis are given in pages s14 s15 in si cod analysis was carried out as per the standard methods apha 2012 so4 2 sulfite so3 2 and thiosulfate s2o3 2 in aqueous phase were analyzed by

expressed as mean standard deviation one way analysis of variance anova was conducted using spss 16 0 ibm usa with statistical significance defined at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation and identification of a cip degrading bacterial strain following acclimation to cip and selective enrichment for over a period of three months a bacterial strain was isolated and identified from the srb enriched sludge designated as strain s2 in this study the isolated strain was identified as a gram positive and rod shaped bacterium based on its physiological and morphological characteristics fig s3 in si basic local alignment search tool blast analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequence of strain s2 with the retrieved sequences from the genbank database suggested that the strain was closely related to the genus paraclostridium and possessed the highest sequence identity 100 with paraclostridium bifermentans strain w18006c2 genbank accession number kp944166 1 subsequently the phylogenetic tree was constructed using mega x software and the neighbor joining phylogenetic tree clearly showed that the isolated strain s2 positioned within the cluster of the genus paraclostridium fig s4 in si the complete taxonomical hierarchy of the strain was determined using ribosomal database project rdp classifier tool and the strain s2 was found to belong to phylum firmicutes class clostridia family peptostreptococcaceae and genus paraclostridium the 16s rrna gene sequence consisting of 1372 nucleotides has been deposited in the genbank database under accession no mw040845 the gram positive bacteria have better adaptability and self protection mechanism against the xenobiotic compounds because of its stronger cell envelope structure than the gram negative bacteria the bacteria belonging to the genus paraclostridium could produce endospores as an adaptation mechanism and survive under extreme environmental conditions wong et al 2018 bacteria from the genus paraclostridium played an important role in the biodegradation of several recalcitrant organic pollutants including chlorinated aliphatic compounds e g tetrachloroethylene chang et al 2001 explosives e g 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene tnt and cyclic nitroamines zhao et al 2003 through diverse metabolic pathways however to date no studies have isolated identified and characterized pure culture from srb enriched sludge and examined its efficacy in biotransformation of fq antibiotics especially cip 3 2 optimization of cip degradation by strain s2 3 2 1 one factor at a time optimization the effect of key factors such as ph temperature and initial so4 2 and cod concentrations on cip removal by the strain s2 was evaluated ph not only affects the cell surface charge but also influences the cell membrane permeability and the activity of carrier proteins and enzymes associated with the metabolic processes zarfl et al 2008 in addition the ionic speciation of cip molecule is also ph driven therefore ph plays an important role in cip removal via both adsorption and biodegradation oberoi et al 2019 as shown in fig s5 a in si the highest cip removal efficiency 80 specific removal rate 2767 ¬µg g cell dry weight wt h and bacterial growth od600 1 2 were found at neutral initial ph 7 0 however both removal efficiency and microbial growth declined significantly p 0 05 when the initial ph was below 6 0 or above 8 0 this finding was in close agreement with several studies using pure strains where microbial growth and biodegradation of antibiotics such as cip and sulfamethazine were more effective at aqueous phase ph between 6 0 to 8 0 pan et al 2018 cao et al 2019 temperature is also equally critical parameter affecting cip biodegradation due to its influence on bacterial growth and enzyme activity paraclostridium bifermentans possessing 100 of sequence identity with strain s2 isolated in this study is a mesophilic bacterium with the optimum growth temperature between 25 and 45 c kutsuna et al 2018 hence the temperatures of 15 25 35 and 45 c were selected in this study to examine its effect on cip removal and bacterial growth the results showed that the cip removal efficiency and specific removal rate increased significantly p 0 05 and closely correlated with bacterial cells proliferation while increasing temperature from 15 to 35 c fig s5 b in si at high temperature of 45 c there was a significant decline in cip removal efficiency which was associated with decrease in microbial activity fig s5 b in si on the other hand at temperatures below the optimum range 25 35 c decrease in microbial growth rate could be related to the decrease in cell membrane fluidity and nutrient transport efficiency of the membrane proteins nedwell et al 1999 which corroborated well with the findings of this study as shown in fig s5 c in si cip removal efficiency and specific removal rate increased with increasing initial cod from 150 to 1000 mg l the higher cip removal could be attributed to the enhanced microbial growth and the up regulated expression of key functional enzymes e g dehydrogenases involved in the biotransformation zhang et al 2020 interestingly when cod concentration was further increased to 1500 and 3000 mg l significant decrease p 0 05 in specific cip removal rate was observed despite increase in cell growth fig s5 c in si this negative effect of higher cod concentrations on cip removal could be the result of carbon catabolite repression i e reduction in the synthesis of peripheral catabolic enzymes in the presence of excess readily biodegradable carbon source muller et al 1996 since the strain s2 was isolated from the srb enriched sludge system bacterial cell growth and activity are likely to be affected by so4 2 concentration as apparent from fig s5 d in si the increase in so4 2 concentrations from 50 to 500 mg so4 2 l promoted both the cip removal efficiency and the specific removal rate p 0 05 along with enhancement in cell growth the highest cip removal efficiency and specific removal rate of 81 6 0 1 and 2767 5 21 7 ¬µg g cell dry wt h respectively were obtained at an initial so4 2 concentration of 500 mg so4 2 l the finding was in close agreement with other studies where so4 2 addition enhanced the biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds including pharmaceuticals e g naproxen he et al 2018 and antibiotics e g trimethoprim tmp liang et al 2019 interestingly further increase in so4 2 concentration to 800 and 1500 mg so4 2 l resulted in significant p 0 05 decrease in specific cip removal rate despite enhanced cell growth cip adsorption on the bacterial cell surface is strongly associated with cip speciation which is influenced by the aqueous phase ph since the experiments were conducted at neutral ph 7 0 0 2 cip mainly existed in zwitterionic form cip 90 with nh2 and coo as functional groups zhang et al 2019a the presence of so4 2 anion at high concentration caused significant decrease in cip adsorption onto the microbial surface as the so4 2 anions could form ionic pair with the zwitterionic cip molecule thereby subsequently decreasing the electrostatic interaction between cip molecule and the negatively charged microbial surface zhang et al 2019a 3 2 2 multivariate optimization based on four factor ccd matrix table s5 in si a quadratic polynomial equation eq s17 in si in terms of coded factors was established by applying multiple regression analysis to determine the specific cip removal rate based on independent variables and their interactions the significance of the fit of the second order polynomial model was assessed by carrying out the analysis of variance anova and the results are presented in table s13 in si details of statistical analysis of the polynomial model are given in si see pages s16 s18 and figs s6 s7 and s8 to gain better understanding of the combined effect of four independent variables on specific cip removal rate the results obtained from the model were plotted as 3d response surface with their corresponding contour plots fig 1 each plot shows the effect of two variables within the ranges studied with the other two variables fixed at the zero level the maximum cip removal could be attained at the intersection of center levels of both factors i e ph 7 0 and temperature 35 c as shown in fig 1 a in addition the curvature in the response to the ph and temperature reflects the statistically significant effect of the quadratic form for these factors see table s13 in si for details furthermore the relative elliptical nature of the contour plots revealed significant interaction between factors cod and so4 2 concentrations on specific cip removal rate at constant ph 7 0 and temperature of 35 c fig 1 d significantly higher specific cip removal rate was obtained with increasing the cod concentrations from 500 to1000 mg l thereafter the cip removal gradually decreased with further increase in cod concentration and this effect was more pronounced at higher so4 2 concentrations the cod and so4 2 concentrations of 915 mg l and 544 mg so4 2 l respectively cod so4 2 mass ratio of 1 7 were found to be the optimum values for maximum cip removal the optimum so4 2 concentration and cod so4 2 mass ratio enhanced the specific growth rate of the strain s2 which in turn resulted in higher specific cip removal rate the results obtained are in consistent with other studies where the optimum cod so4 2 mass ratios were between 1 5 and 2 3 choi and rim 1991 the response surface and contour plots showing interaction among other influencing factors are depicted in figs s9 and s10 in si quadratic polynomial model eq s17 in si was used to predict the maximum specific cip removal rate i e 2862 ¬µg g cell dry wt h by the strain s2 under the optimum conditions i e ph 7 0 temperature of 34 3 c and so4 2 and cod concentrations of 544 mg so4 2 l and 915 mg l respectively in order to further confirm the accuracy of the model prediction for cip removal rate additional experiments were carried out under the above stated optimum conditions notably the average specific cip removal rate was 2894 ¬µg g cell dry wt h which was not significantly different p 0 05 from the predicted one this apparently shows that the quadratic polynomial model accurately predicted the optimum conditions obtained through the experiment in this study therefore the subsequent batch experiments were carried out under the optimum conditions 3 3 cip removal pathways and kinetics by the strain s2 the time course cip removal and bacterial growth profile at different initial cip concentrations 0 1 20 mg l are presented in fig 2 there was a lag phase of 3 6 h depending on the initial cip concentration at the beginning of the bacterial growth and subsequently the strain s2 started to grow in the logarithmic growth phase the growth of the strain s2 was influenced by cip concentration and the specific growth rate Œº of bacterial cells was found to be 0 15 and 0 13 h 1 at cip concentrations of 1 and 20 mg l respectively initially the removal of cip occurred rapidly which coincided with high cod removal so4 2 reduction and cell growth rate after that the removal of cip by the strain s2 occurred rather slowly and reached plateau within 24 h the results show that the rapid degradation of cip was associated with maximum biomass concentration which was most likely due to high availability of readily degradable carbon source at the beginning moreover strong correlation between so4 2 reduction and growth of the strain s2 was observed r2 0 928 infact the occurrence of bacteria belonging to the genus paraclostridium often reported in the environments e g marine sediment with high so4 2 concentration sasi jyothsna et al 2016 the influent so4 2 was reduced into dissolved sulfide and other sulfur intermediates e g s2o3 2 so3 2 and elemental sulfur which were also regularly measured during the batch experiments and their concentrations were below the detection limit see fig s11 in si for cod and so4 2 removal efficiencies at different initial cip concentrations the cip removal gradually decreased with an increase in initial cip concentration fig 2 b at initial cip concentrations of 0 1 and 1 mg l rapid complete removal occurred 100 in less than 24 h however the removal efficiencies decreased to 74 72 and 57 when the initial cip concentrations were increased to 5 10 and 20 mg l respectively it is worth mentioning that the removal efficiency of cip by the strain s2 in this study was significantly higher than the other microorganisms i e ochrobactrum sp 34 and bradyrhizobium sp 26 at the same initial cip concentration of 10 mg l nguyen et al 2018 feng et al 2019 abiotic control test results showed insignificant cip removal via volatilization and hydrolysis and the removal via photolysis was negligible as all the serum bottles were wrapped with aluminum foil during the experiments fig s12 in si thus cip removal from the aqueous phase was primarily attributed to adsorption and biotransformation the contributions of adsorption and biotransformation to cip removal were determined at different initial cip concentrations and the specific adsorption and biotransformation rates of cip by the strain s2 are shown in fig 2 b at lower concentrations 0 1 and 1 mg l cip was mainly removed via adsorption however biotransformation was the dominant pathway at higher concentrations 5 10 and 20 mg l biodegradation is usually limited by the substrate threshold which relies on the concentration of the target compound in the culture medium and its availability to the microorganisms this threshold could be associated with the chemical or the physical factors for instance it can be due to mass transfer limitation for uptake by the microbial cells at low concentrations marozava et al 2019 such threshold values also vary with the types of pollutant to be degraded and the microbes and the environment rapp and timmis 1999 distinct threshold concentration for stimulation of enzymes and biotransformation of trace organic micropollutants has been reported for many other bacteria rapp and timmis 1999 kovar et al 2002 these factors could have contributed to low biotransformation efficiency and rate at low initial cip concentrations of 0 1 and 1 mg l it is apparent that the strain s2 was highly effective in cip biotransformation and the specific biotransformation rate increased significantly p 0 05 with increase in initial cip concentrations as more cip was bioavailable to the microorganisms fig 2 b additionally microorganisms have different mechanisms to respond to the toxic compounds including fq antibiotics at high concentrations e g by changing the gene regulation of the bacterial cells e g the presence of efflux pump and the cell envelope modification and the phenotype e g bacterial biotransformation capacity which determine their metabolic potential poole 2000 finally the genus paraclostridium has an ability to produce endospore which facilitates its survival under extreme or unfavorable growth conditions wong et al 2018 the kinetic data fitted well with pseudo second order model r2 0 960 implying that the chemisorption was the rate controlling mechanism for cip adsorption see table s14 in si furthermore the total cip removal kinetics as a function of different initial concentrations was determined the r2 values ranged from 0 907 to 0 988 which demonstrated that the cip removal conformed well to the first order kinetics and the corresponding rate constant k and the half life degradation time t1 2 were summarized in table s15 in si the results obtained in this study k 0 73 d 1 t1 2 0 95 d at an initial cip concentration of 5 mg l showed that the strain s2 was highly effective in the removal of cip compared to other pure bacterial strains including labrys portucalensis k 0 02 d 1 t1 2 37 50 d and thermus sp k 0 38 d 1 t1 2 1 85 d amorim et al 2014 pan et al 2018 finally the isolated strain s2 was examined for its effectiveness in removing other antibiotics belonging to the same fqs class as cip e g ofl nor and enr at initial concentration of 5 mg l the results showed that the enr ofl and nor were effectively removed by the strain s2 via adsorption and biotransformation with the removal efficiency of 68 56 and 60 respectively after 3 d of incubation fig 2 c a more detailed discussion pertaining to other antibiotics removal is provided in pages s18 s19 in si this finding suggests that the strain s2 likely possesses one or more enzymes with broad specificity for antibiotics biotransformation the strain s2 could be further employed to augment srb sludge to improve antibiotics removal in a complex microbial community structure this has practical implications in developing successful bioaugmentation strategies for fq antibiotics laden wastewater treatment 3 4 functional enzymes involved in cip biotransformation the intracellular cyp450 enzymes play a pivotal role in the biotransformation of antibiotics and other xenobiotic compounds especially for fungal species by catalyzing various reactions such as ipso substitution cleavage of piperazinyl ring through epoxidation defluorination oxidation reduction and hydroxylation chong et al 2014 girvan and munro 2016 the possible roles of cyp450 and dehydrogenase enzymes in cip biotransformation were investigated through in vivo batch assays using whole cell of the strain s2 and the experimental results are shown in fig 3 a and b respectively the key function of cyp450 enzymes in cip biotransformation was substantiated by adding the specific inhibitor 1 abt since significant suppression p 0 05 of cip removal efficiency and specific biotransformation rate 53 8 4 7 and 830 4 39 0 ¬µg g cell dry wt h respectively was observed compared to that in control test no inhibitor 73 6 0 6 and 1780 3 52 9 ¬µg g cell dry wt h respectively the dehydrogenase enzymes are intracellular enzymes of the oxidoreductase family which catalyze the hydroxylation reaction under anaerobic condition dermer and fuchs 2012 szaleniec et al 2014 the dehydrogenase activity a good indicator of microbial oxidative activities for cellular biodegradation of xenobiotic organic compounds under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions was determined under different initial cip concentrations in this study as shown in fig 3 b the dehydrogenase activity was significantly p 0 05 stimulated with increase in initial cip concentrations from 0 1 to 20 mg l which was in close agreement with other studies hou et al 2019 there was significant up regulation in dehydrogenase activity in the treatment group compared to the control especially at higher cip concentrations of 10 and 20 mg l the presence of organic pollutants influences the up regulation and down regulation of genes encoding the enzymes involved in the biodegradation as a specific cellular response zhang et al 2019b this up regulation of enzyme activity under distinct growth conditions is probably related to the biotransformation of cip or better tolerance of the strain s2 to cip in addition a positive correlation r 0 966 p 0 01 between dehydrogenase activity and specific cip biotransformation rate apparently showed the involvement of dehydrogenase enzymes in cip biotransformation several previous studies also showed a positive correlation between the dehydrogenase activity and the biodegradation of xenobiotics including antibiotics zhang et al 2020 and pahs hou et al 2019 nonetheless our results suggest the key role of non specific intracellular enzymes i e cyp450 and dehydrogenase enzymes in cip biotransformation by the strain s2 3 5 identification of biotransformation metabolites and pathways the major cip biotransformation intermediates and the possible pathways were further investigated to better understand the catalytic functions of key functional enzymes involved no metabolites were detected in the controls without cip or only cip without microorganisms indicating that all the intermediates formed were produced during cip biotransformation the structures of biotransformation metabolites were proposed based on their retention time target m z fragmentation pattern of tandem ms as well as by referring to previous studies see table s16 in si for details based on the intermediate compounds identified four major cip biotransformation pathways were proposed fig 3 c in pathway i cip m z 332 c17h18fn3o3 biotransformation was initiated from the cleavage of piperazinyl ring and the cn bond was the most likely target that resulted in opening of the ring structure and the formation of the dialdehyde derivative with m z of 362 c17h16fn3o5 biotransformation product tp1 the biotransformation product with m z 334 c16h16fn3o4 tp2 could be formed from m z 362 by losing one aldehyde group followed by decarboxylation thereby leading to formation of tp3 m z 306 c15h16fn3o3 identified as desethylene n cip cyp450 enzymes under anaerobic conditions appear to play a key role in the reductive metabolism catalyzing the reduction of aromatic nitro group to the corresponding amines trager 2006 and their role was also confirmed via batch inhibition test in our study see fig 3 a the formation of tp4 m z 263 c13h11fn2o3 is attributed to the loss of secondary amine nitrogen and formaldehyde from the amine side chain resulted in the complete removal of the piperazine ring the cyp450 enzymes can facilitate the breakdown of the piperazinyl substituent by catalyzing the epoxidation of c c double bond in cip molecular moiety finally tp4 was defluorinated by the cleavage of the c f bond on c6 to form tp5 m z 245 c13h12n2o3 the cyp450 enzymes had previously demonstrated the potential for reductive dehalogenation reactions which involve the release of halogen and its replacement by hydrogen li and wackett 1993 under anaerobic conditions cyp450 enzymes can accept electrons from p450 reductase and use them to catalyze reductive reactions ortiz de montellano 2013 alternatively a defluorinated tp6 m z 288 c15h17n3o3 formed from tp3 which subsequently yields tp5 the degradation of cip in pathway ii could be initiated by defluorination at c 6 to form tp7 m z 330 c17h19n3o4 after that tp8 m z 318 c16h19n3o4 was produced through oxidative decarboxylation reaction at c 3 and complemented by hydroxylation at c 2 in the quinolone moiety the cyp450 enzymes were reported to catalyze defluorination reaction responsible for the formation of tp7 and dehydrogenase enzymes could play a key role in the hydroxylation of the heterocyclic aromatic ring under anaerobic conditions szaleniec et al 2014 jia et al 2018 the substitution of the terminal carboxyl by a hydroxyl group at position c 3 of cip resulted in the generation of tp9 m z 304 c16h18fn3o2 in pathway iii wetzstein et al 1999 ou et al 2016 the formation of tp10 m z 348 c17h18fn3o4 in pathway iv probably resulted from the electrophilic adduct reaction occurred at c 2 leading to the addition of hydroxyl radical on the c c bond in the quinolone moiety of the cip molecule intriguingly the biotransformation of cip involves an unprecedented anaerobic hydroxylation at c 2 of the quinolone moiety thereby yielding tp10 hydroxylation of the aromatic ring is an important reaction in the metabolism of the heterocyclic compounds the steric requirements of the enzyme involved in the hydroxylation reaction might favor substitution at c 2 position adjacent to the heteroatom of aromatic ring which further destabilizes the ring structure grbic galic 1990 the pattern of hydroxylation at c 2 position in heterocyclic ring of quinolone moiety of cip molecule in this study was similar to that previously reported during the initial biotransformation of quinoline indole and nicotinic acid catalyzed by srb e g desulfobacterium indolicum and clostridium barkeri under sulfate reducing condition licht et al 1997 it is well known that in anaerobic biotransformation pathways dehydrogenase enzymes can be regarded as a counterpart to oxygenases catalyzing o2 dependent hydroxylation and they use water as a source of oxygen atom for the aromatic ring hydroxylation reactions kniemeyer and heider 2001 dermer and fuchs 2012 therefore the higher dehydrogenase activity observed in this study see fig 3 b could be correlated with the hydroxylation at c 2 of the heterocyclic ring in pathways ii and iv since the overall dehydrogenase activity depends on the catalytic activity of the various dehydrogenases the exact dehydrogenase enzymes catalyzing cip biotransformation could not be identified in this study and more in depth studies at transcriptomics and proteomics levels are needed though the strain s2 demonstrated good cip removal efficiency fig 2 a and b the complete cip mineralization by the strain s2 could not be achieved as some of the metabolic intermediates were still present in the batch reactor even after 72 h most of the identified biotransformation products retained the core quinolone ring structure which is essential to the antibacterial activity of cip paul et al 2010 thus to assess the toxicity variation during cip biotransformation by the strain s2 the acute toxicity was examined the results show that the inhibition intensity decreased significantly p 0 05 from 18 to 2 within first 24 h and then further declined to 4 at the end of 48 h fig s13 in si the detail discussion on decreased toxicity is provided in pages s19 s20 in si this apparently shows that the cip biotransformation by the strain s2 resulted in less toxic biotransformation products 4 conclusions in recent years considerable research efforts have been made in developing sulfur based biological processes employing srb enriched sludge for the treatment of pharmaceutical laden e g smx cip tmp and ibuprofen wastewater our previous study employed srb enriched sludge for the treatment of cip contaminated wastewater to the best of our knowledge this is the first study in which cip degrading strain s2 i e paraclostridium sp was successfully isolated from the srb enriched sludge for the development of successful bioaugmentation strategy isolation of native microorganisms pure cultures with proven degradation potential and adaptability to changes in environmental conditions is critically important from this perspective our study not only successfully isolated and characterized a highly effective cip degrading strain from the srb enriched sludge but also optimized its growth conditions to maximize the degradation of cip and other fq antibiotics the isolation of effective cip degrading microbe has significant scientific and engineering merits for the detoxification of fqs in srb mediated biological wastewater treatment process the ubiquitous presence of the bacterium belonging to the genus paraclostridium in a variety of environmental matrices such as marine sediments oil producing wells and landfill leachate along with its ability to catabolize a wide range of toxic e g cyanophycin benzene and emerging organic contaminants presents a new opportunity in bioremediation of cip and other fq antibiotics in wastewaters our study shows that biotransformation is a major mechanism of cip removal by the strain s2 and that both piperazinyl ring and quinolone moiety of cip molecule are potential targets for bacterial metabolism bacterial intracellular cyp450 and dehydrogenase are the two key functional enzymes responsible for the biotransformation and detoxification of cip with generation of less toxic intermediates by the strain s2 however the exact cyp450 and dehydrogenase enzymes catalyzing cip biotransformation remain unidentified the identification of a pure culture involved in biodegradation of cip will enable the identification of functional enzymes underlying the biotransformation reactions the whole genome sequencing and comparative proteomics and or transcriptomics analyses can be used to identify the key degradative genes or proteins which are up regulated during growth or exposure to cip and more in depth studies are needed to gain insights into biodegradation mechanisms at a molecular level a detailed knowledge of the microbes genes and enzymes responsible for cip biotransformation would allow better understanding of the environmental fate of cip and other fq antibiotics and the risk associated with their release into the

17222,compared with common anaerobic digestion microbial electrolysis has been proven feasibly to accelerate biodegradation and methanogenesis with the advantages of effective electron flow regulation however its actual application and scale up required a full understanding and further investigation on electrode size and distribution for making full use of the space of the integrated reactor and improve methane recovery an effective interior configuration was significant in this work three types of reactors with different cathode spatial distributions that is different cathode space ratios ratio of cathode surface area to reaction region volume were studied to form a good flow pattern for obtaining high methane production tracer experiments and numerical simulation were employed simultaneously for understanding the hydrodynamics characters of the interior flow field the results showed that by increasing the cathode space ratio to 1 33 cm2 cm3 and 2 cm2 cm3 respectively better flow patterns with the residence time of 1 336 times and 1 363 times of theoretical hydraulic retention time could be obtained the stacked structure of nickel meshes was beneficial to prolong the contact time of contaminant and improve the mass transfer increasing the cathode space ratio could also enhance the electrochemical performance considering the organic removal methane recovery electrons generation and material consumption the recommended cathode space ratio was 1 33 cm2 cm3 with this structure cod removal efficiency reached 93 2 1 9 and 94 1 1 5 methane production rate reached 332 0 and 334 8 ml ch4 l reactor day and methane yield was 171 3 and 246 4 ml ch4 g cod under the hrt of 24 h and 36 h respectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrolysis methane recovery cathode spatial distribution hydrodynamics analysis numerical simulation 1 introduction as clean energy and efficient fuel methane has high industrial utilization value and can be sustainably recovered from waste organics and wastewater villano et al 2013 zhen et al 2016 compared with conventional anaerobic digestion the introduction of microbial electrolysis makes the systems more stable and controllable which has the superiority in organic conversion and methane recovery guo et al 2017 asztalos and kim 2015 electrodes not only serve as the electron transport medium but also as the carrier of microbes recently electrical regulation or stimulation has proven to a selective effect on the microbes which could enhance both the interactions among microbes and extracellular electron transfer between electrodes and microbes zhang et al 2019 zhen et al 2017 zhi et al 2019 the impact of enhanced methane production was found through biomass retention on electrodes even rather than electrochemical interaction with the electrodes in the research of de vrieze et al 2014 lots of researchers have focused on the selection of electrode materials thangavel et al 2016 and cathode catalysts zhen et al 2016 song et al 2016 to increase the biocompatibility of the electrode other researches concerned about the size of electrodes chen et al 2011 bruce logan et al 2007 to increase the number of microbes in the reactor however most of these researches guided at the laboratory level guo et al 2017 wang et al 2020a few attempts reported in large scale reactors and had similar satisfactory results cusick et al 2011 escapa et al 2015 such difficulties existed as the formation of biofilm fluid dynamics inside the reactors escapa et al 2015 zhen et al 2017 favorable fluid dynamics inside the reactors brought by good electrode distribution provided a well mass transfer that expressed sufficient contact time and contact degree for organics with both electrodes and microbes it meant a benign environment for the growth and attachment of microbes further increased microbial biomass and enhances microbial activity hui et al 2019 wang et al 2017a sufficient mass transfer and enriched microbes further reduced the internal resistance and enhanced the function of electrode thus the spatial distribution of electrodes was significant wang et al 2017b xu et al 2018 to promote the scaling up and potential application of this technology the configuration of bioelectrodes still needs to be further understood when using microbial electrolysis to enhance wastewater treatment and energy recovery since methanogenesis efficiency is markedly affected by electroactive microbes colonizing on the biocathode that use electrons through direct and indirect extracellular electron transfer li et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 the cathode was more correlated in the methanogenesis process compared with increased electrochemical efficiency resulting from enlarged anode surface area guo et al 2017 wang et al 2020a it is worth noting that a part of suspended microbes was discovered taking part in the methane recovery and being influenced by the electrodes wang et al 2020b the increased cathode modules inserted in wastewater treatment reactors would perforce influence the original flow pattern and further change the mass transfer to activated microorganisms few studies focused on the change of internal flow regime caused by increased electrode modules and therefore lacked the appropriate strategies for scaling up since directly stacking the cathode modules might result in the reactor clogging kim et al 2015 which was not beneficial for electrode playing its role and even influence the upward transport of matters thus increased to the appropriate cathode surface should be researched based on its effect on the overall flow pattern flow regime change could be reflected through hydrodynamic analysis which was commonly used in designing an effective interior structure or scaling up a reactor the hydrodynamic analysis could be in virtue of experiment or simulation residence time distribution rtd test as an effective experiment method was widely used to reflect the hydrodynamic characters in a practical application of bioreactor including computing the mean residence time mrt and reflecting the existence of several short circuiting streams or preferential flows kim et al 2015 olivet et al 2005 with model fitting the flow pattern could be further analyzed another method numerical simulation always used computational fluid dynamics cfd it could simulate the flow field of reactors and make it visualization through a two or three dimensional visualization according to the actual demand qi et al 2013 gao et al 2019 the distributions and relative values of some parameters such as velocity and pressure in the reactor could be reflected not only can simulation produce an appropriate hydraulic design but also reduce the cost and time by high efficiency iteration calculation considering the utilization of the reaction space the increased stacked mesh cathode was designed above the original cathode gao et al 2019 to further improve the performance of the reactor the considerable organic removal methane recovery and hydrodynamics characteristics were linked to cathode space ratio ratio of cathode surface area to reaction region volume which could provide a quantifiable reference for practical applications the effect on suspended solution was also noticed the simulation results of the dynamic distribution of tracer were compared with the results of the rtd experiment to verify the reliability of the model settings especially the non rigid carbon brush 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction and operation three types of up flow membrane less mec reactors rac racc and raccc were constructed for experiment analysis with an empty volume of 600 ml approximately an inner diameter of 5 cm and a total height of 35 cm as shown in fig 1 reactors had three main regions divided as their function gas collection and outlet region reaction region and inlet region another reactor r1 without electrodes was invented only with the reaction region and inlet region and was just for numerical simulation fig 1 anodes adopted carbon fiber brushes toray industries inc japan with 5 cm in diameter and length respectively nickel mesh with 40 mesh and 5 cm in diameter was used for cathode as shown in fig 1 stacked construction cathodes were counted as groups in each group the nickel meshes were connected by the titanium wire baoji lixing titanium group co ltd china the distances between anode and cathode maintained 3 cm in all reactors reactor rac had only one group of nickel mesh materials placed above the anode as previous study gao et al 2019 compared with rac racc was assembled with two groups of cathodes the increased cathode group was placed above the first group and 3 cm higher as an analogy raccc was made up of one anode brush and three groups of cathode meshes the distances between anode and cathode and the distances of each cathode group were 3 cm for the convenience of guiding application cathode space ratio was defined as different ratios between cathode surface area and reaction region volume for expressing the distribution of cathode thereinto reaction region volume was simplified as a cylinder with 5 cm in diameter and 24 cm in higher shown in fig 1 while the cathode surface area was calculated according to the upper and lower sides of each nickel mesh rac racc and raccc had the cathode space ratios of 0 67 cm2 cm3 1 33 cm2 cm3 and 2 cm2 cm3 respectively all the cathode groups connected with anode

collection at the same time intervals during one hrt sampling time was controlled as three folds of hrts to ensure the complete outflow of the tracer the samples were detected by icp oes optima 8300 perkinelmer co ltd usa following the methods as introduced before gao et al 2019 rtd curves and analysis were conducted according to the equations from the literature cui et al 2020 meanwhile tanks in series tis and longitudinal dispersion ld model as well as the modified tanks in series mtis model wang et al 2017b 2015 were selected to fit the curves for comprehending fluid dynamics of each construction to get closer to the real flow field a three dimensional simulation was used to investigate hydrodynamics the actual reactors were extremely difficult to depict since the complexity of interior structure and inevitable machining error from the hand made reactor some hypotheses and simplifications were listed in supplementary material according to the reactor requirements and literature cui et al 2020 then the entity models were created and divided meshes shown in fig s1 due to the otherness of each structure it was divided into several parts and employed different grid division methods volume mesh used unstructured meshes in each part the total cells of rac racc and raccc were 1 475 748 1 316 528 and 1 316 528 respectively with an interval size of 1 for visualizing the flow pattern of reactors the steady state solver was selected viscous model chose the k epsilon equations and k epsilon realizable model for well and reasonable convergence the residuals were set as 10 6 the porous media model was employed by adding a momentum source term cui et al 2020 two main parameters Œ± and c2 were needed which were calculated according to eqs 12 and 13 as follows cui et al 2020 12 Œ± d p 2 150 Œµ 3 1 Œµ 2 13 c 2 3 5 d p 1 Œµ Œµ 3 where dp was the average particle diameter Œµ was the void fraction in this study the diameter of carbon fiber was used as the dp for the anode model while dp was derived from the conversion by the diameter of nickel wire and interval size of nickel mesh in cathode model simulation for the process of rtd experiment was performed which verified the track of tracer in other words the results of the rtd experiment also could verify the accuracy of the cfd model for rtd simulation the mixture model of two phases was applied as well as the transient state solver since licl solution was rapidly injected into the inlet the district with the same volume as added licl was marked near the inlet in this district the volume fraction was 1 the residuals were set as 10 3 and the concentration of li was reported by the area weighted average volume fraction 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrodynamics analysis for reactors with different cathode spatial distribution tracer test was used for understanding the hydrodynamic characters of three different reactors the results were drawn as the rtd curves shown in fig 2 and fig s1 all the curves had only one peak with a little tail which was following the common regulation gao et al 2019 wang et al 2015 little tails implied there had small dead or stagnant zones in reactors since the nickel wire in the cathode mesh structure and the root of the carbon brush had some interception to the fluid in fig 2 only reactor rac had the response peak at 0 67 Œ∏ under hrt of 12 h while others appeared after 0 67 Œ∏ under the hrt of 18 h response peak appeared at Œ∏ in reactor racc when hrt was more than 24 h reactor raccc also had the peak at Œ∏ generally ahead response peak meant the existence of a short circuiting stream or preferential flow the results showed that reactor racc and raccc had a better flow pattern than rac the increased stacked nickel mesh might play the role of water distribution so that the flow more uniform the longer mrts than hrts table 1 might be caused by the introduction of electrode modules which were similar to other reactors with built in electrodes wang et al 2017b cui et al 2020 when hrt was 24 h the relative mrts were the longest and Œ≤ the ratio of mrt to hrt wang et al 2017b values were 1 277 1 336 and 1 363 in reactors rac racc and raccc respectively properly extending the residence time conduced to the sufficient contact time between organics and electrodes different from the ideal complete mixing regime and plug flow regime most reactors existed a mixture of two regimes presenting the local mixing and push flow regime hence two typical hydraulic models based on ideal models were employed for describing those non ideal flow reactors the fitting results were showed in fig s1 and table 1 both two models roughly reflected the rtd experimental law of the three reactors the fitting response peaks always appeared before Œ∏ for the tis model while closer to Œ∏ for the ld model adjusted r square was calculated for evaluating the fitting degree for models in table s1 results showed that the tis model was more suitable for reactor rac while the flow regime of reactor raccc was closer to the ld model the smallest values of œÉ Œ∏ 2 appeared at hrt of 24 h which meant the minimal degree of back mixing and the flow pattern of reactors was closer to the plug flow regime racc and raccc were more similar with a plug flow reactor with the smaller œÉ Œ∏ 2 values smaller n and larger pe values larger values implied the main method of mass transfer was convection which was influenced by the velocity the mtis model showed highly consistent with the experiment results fig 2 and had the higher adjusted r square values table s1 all reactors were divided into three strands and the smallest and largest values were 3 50 and 17 97 of n respectively table s2 three reactors were closer to the plug flow regime since the degree of back mixing was insignificant with the larger values of n than 3 01 according to the literature wang et al 2015 in a word a higher cathode space ratio 1 33 cm2 cm3 and 2 cm2 cm3 was beneficial for prolonging the flow path and avoiding the short circuiting stream or preferential flow which optimized the mass transfer between electrodes and organics the effect of a higher cathode space ratio was more obvious with longer mrt under hrts of 24 h and 36 h which provided adequate contact time for organics with microbes reactors with a higher cathode space ratio were also closer to plug flow regime which was beneficial for biogas collection 3 2 flow pattern visualization analysis and rtd test simulation through cfd for further understanding the hydrodynamics characters of different structures the cfd simulation was used for visualizing the fluid flow the simulation of the rtd test was used to prove the reliability of the cfd simulation all cfd simulations were under the hrt of 24 h since the minimal degree of back mixing and its flow pattern closer to the plug flow regime occurred at the hrt of 24 h the pressure contours of three reactors were compared with an empty reactor r1 without electrodes showed in fig s3 for the reactor with non electrodes the pressure presented a higher value around the inlet region and dropped in an order of magnitude along with the flow direction three reactors with electrodes showed almost one order higher pressure of magnitude than r1 and the high pressure region including the inlet region and half of the anode region the three similar pressure contours might be caused due to two reasons one reason was that the increased pressure might be mainly caused by the anode but not the mesh structure of the cathode the other was that the main action of electrodes on the fluid was concentrated in the lower part of reactors in any case the introduction of electrodes increased the flow resistance which could contribute to prolonging the residence time improve the flow pattern and enhance mass transfer velocity distribution in the medial surface of three reactors and r1 without electrodes were depicted in fig 3 compared with r1 the changed velocity distribution and decreased interference from the wall was visually presented in reactors with electrodes the inlet region had a high velocity because the fluid was pumped into the reactor at a constant velocity through the inlet pipe with little section another high velocity region appeared around the anode as the fluid passed through the cathode the velocity decreased but became uniform which suggested that the cathode structure had the function of distributing water the velocity magnitude of three reactors medial surface was shown in fig s4 it showed that racc and raccc had the higher maximum flow velocity at the anode region the mean rising velocity was 1 16 cm h 1 11 cm h and 1 06 cm h in rac racc and raccc respectively reactors with a higher cathode space ratio had a higher local velocity and lower mean rising velocity that the lower mean rising velocity corresponded to the longer mrt in the rtd results increased local velocity contributed to enhancing the fluid contact degree with electrodes including the contact with attached microbes it further enhanced organics removal and microbial growth lower mean rising velocity prolonged the mrt which was consistent with rtd experimental results it was beneficial for sufficient reaction also a lower mean rising velocity was beneficial for retaining suspended microbes cfd simulation used for whole experiment results of rtd test was shown in fig s5 to clearly show the different flow states of reactors with different structures cfd simulation results in a shortened period of two Œ∏ were presented in fig 4 a b c the period of tracer diffusion from the inlet pipe in the initial stage was ignored it showed li gradually diffused along with the continuous influent as the flow direction and flowed out from outlet surface in fig 4 a b c in the first two intervals the li distribution had almost no differences in the three reactors the first time li reached the outlet surface was 16th hour for racc while rac had a considerable fraction of li flowed out which was consistent with the results in fig s5 d e f li flowed out of the outlet surface at a slightly slower rate shown in fig 4 the tracer had a little residual when going through the anode but was uniform in the cathode region it indicated that the center part of the anode seemed to intercept the flow while the cathode seemed to allow the fluid to flow uniformly fig s5 d e f showed the area weighted average volume fraction of li from the outlet surface as the numerical simulation result the cfd simulations showed similar patterns with rtd tests and the same response peak position it demonstrated the reliability of cfd simulation and electrode models in this study however the results before 0 5 Œ∏ showed some deviation and the peak values were exorbitant since the simulation was based on the hypotheses and simplifications there were certain structural differences with the actual reactors also the chosen models couldn t fully represent the real flow pattern anyhow cfd simulation supplied the visualization of the fluid field in reactors with different structures and helped comprehend the hydrodynamics characters more researches were needed to improve the accuracy of the simulation 3 3 effects of cathode space ratio on organics removal and methane recovery to better understand the effect of different cathode space ratios on reactor performance the microbial community structure of electrodes biofilm and suspended solution on genus level were detected fig 5 it showed that in this an up flow microbial electrolysis assisted reactors the dominant functional microbes including ferment and acid producing bacteria enterococcus electrochemical active bacteria desulfovibrio acetotrophic methanogens methanosarcina and hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacterium methanospirillum methanobrevibacter and methanocorpusculum were enriched in both anode biofilm cathode biofilm and suspended solution according to the microbial community structure possible pathways of organics removal and methane recovery were showed in fig 5 d these pathways might exist between microbes and microbes with electrodes a longer mrt favored a higher abundance of methanogens especially methanosarcina in the anode biofilm compared with the anode cathode biofilm had higher diversity for hydrogenotrophic methanogens a higher abundance of methanogens enriched in the biofilm of the lowest cathode with a longer mrt in this system methanogens were very competitive on the electrode biofilms especially due to the adequate contact time and good mass transfer with longer mrt a higher cathode space ratio provided a good flow pattern with a long flow path and less short circuiting steam or preferential flow which led to the similar dominant functional microbes enriched in the suspended solution it reflected the participation of suspended microbes in the methane recovery and the effect on suspended microbes by electrodes the organics removal was measured by cod removal efficiency showed in fig 6 a results showed that the increased cathode space ratio could cause higher organics removal the higher abundance of desulfovibrio electrode biofilm and enterococcus electrode biofilm and suspended solution were enriched in reactors with higher cathode space ratio which could improve the cod removal the removal efficiency increased more obviously when cathode space ratio went from 0 67 cm2 cm3 to 1 33 cm2 cm3 hrt 12 h and 24 h t test p 0 01 hrt 18 h and 36 h t test p 0 05 the biggest differences appeared at the hrt of 12 h with more groups of nickel mesh racc and raccc had 1 3 times and 1 4 times removal efficiency than rac respectively increased organics removal might be ascribed to more biomass and better hydraulic conditions under the hrt of 12 h a higher cathode ratio space had the better mass transfer as described in section 3 1 which contributed in higher cod removal efficiency and when the hrt was 24 h a longer mrt higher local velocity and lower mean rising velocity were all favorable factors for reactors with a higher cathode space ratio when hrt was longer than 12 h both three reactors with different cathode space ratios had the cod removal efficiency of more than 80 and had reduced gaps in particular the difference between racc and raccc was indistinctive 93 2 1 9 and 94 9 1 1 at the hrt of 24 h 94 1 1 5 and 96 0 1 8 at the hrt of 36 h t test p 0 05 it meant that increased cathode space ratio was beneficial for cod removal and the advantage was more pronounced under shorter hrt when hrt was lower the fast flow rate made the contact time between organics and electrode short and the organics could not be fully utilized the more function microbes accelerated the conversion of the organics in the higher cathode space ratio made up for the lack of contact time when hrt was higher the advantage of high cathode space ratio tended to better flow regime since the lower mean rising velocity and longer mrt in the reactor with higher cathode space ratio lower rising velocity benefited for retaining more suspended microbes which contributed more organic removal and longer mrt enhanced the contact time furthermore the cod removal of racc could reach the maximum 93 2 1 9 at hrt of 24 h which was higher than the 89 9 1 8 of rac under hrt of 36 h increased cathode space ratio could also speed up processing on the other hand methane production rate mpr and methane yield my were evaluated and showed in fig 6 b in fig 6 b it showed that increasing the cathode space ratio from 0 67 cm2 cm3 to 1 33 cm2 cm3 influenced the methane production rate mpr however further increasing to the 2 cm2 cm3 did not significantly improve the mpr compared with the removal process of organics the methanogenesis process was slower and needed more contact time a higher mpr in racc might be ascribed to its strong competitive of methanogens on the electrode biofilms and suspended solution caused by the adequate contact time and good mass transfer with longer mrt also the introduction of electrodes speeded up a part of the methanogenesis process through electron transfer and more electrons were produced along with the enhanced organics removal in racc meanwhile for racc and raccc the methane production was almost 2 1 fold and 1 4 fold higher at hrt of 36 h and 24 h than 12 h which expressed the nearly mpr hrt 24 h 332 0 and 340 5 ml ch4 l reactor day respectively hrt 36 h 334 8 and 343 1 ml ch4 l reactor day respectively with similar cod removal efficiency and flow pattern cathode space ratio 1 33 cm2 cm3 and 2 cm2 cm3 was not the limited faction and expressed a similar performance in fig 6 b results showed the cathode space ratio had no obvious effect on methane yield from cod as shown in fig 5 d the functional bacteria involved in organic matter removal and methane generation were enriched in both the electrode biofilm and suspension solution the increase of the cathode space ratio led to the increase of methane production and organics removal simultaneously moreover the increased organics removal from high cathode space ratio might be caused by increased biomass and further expressed similar methane yield the high methane yield occurred at the hrt of 36 h than 24 h attributing to the more methane accumulation in a long time under similar cod removal 3 4 effects of cathode space ratio on electrochemical performance and electron balance analysis electrons produced by the anode and transferred to the cathode through the external circuit were calculated for evaluating the electrochemical performance the electric quantity q produced in racc and raccc was higher than that in rac according to table 2 such as when the hrt was 24 h the accumulated q value was 713 4 998 7 and 1141 4 c in reactor rac racc and raccc respectively increasing the cathode space ratio was in favor of more electronic production which was caused by better electrogenesis capacity of the anode with a higher abundance of electrochemical active bacteria in the reactor with a higher cathode space ratio the higher flow velocity at the anode region could also improve the contact degree of anode and anode microbes with organics and further enhanced the electrogenesis capacity of the anode the q value hinted that the anode in racc with a cathode space ratio of 1 33 cm2 cm3 had higher electrogenesis capacity than in rac and similar with raccc it was also discovered that the q value reached the maximum at the hrt of 18 h and decreased with the increased hrt which was the same with other researches min and logan 2004 behera and ghangrekar 2017 since more organics were applied for reactors with shorter hrt and more electrons were generated during the same time the electrochemical effect of anode could also be evaluated through coulombic efficiency shown in table 2 results showed a low ce generated in all three reactors at the hrt of 12 h and the order of raccc racc rac under other hrts it hinted that less of the removal of organics at lower hrt was contributed by the anodic electrogenesis increased organics removal in reactors with the higher cathode space ratio might be attributed to the more microbial enrichment at all electrodes and suspension solution when hrt was higher the increased cathode space ratio improved the anode electrogenesis capacity the part of methane produced utilizing the electrons transferred from the anode was evaluated as the electrochemical contribution efficiency Œ∑e in table 2 the Œ∑e values were higher at the lower hrt of 12 h and were similar in three reactors since when the residence time was short the methanogenesis relied more on the rapid transfer of electrons through external circuits and expressed the higher Œ∑e when hrt was increased the proportion of electrons contributing directly to methanogenesis was lower the increased rate of Œ∑e was smaller than q since more suspended microbes were retained in reactors under higher hrt and contributed a lot to methanogenesis organics conversion pathways were calculated based on electron balance shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 5 d organics turned into methane through electrochemical reaction through the external circuit pe and methanogens effect pm methanogens included both attached to electrodes and suspended solution in the reactor the composition and distribution of these microbial communities were influenced by electrodes pothers reflected microbial growth consumption including methanogens and other microbes in fig 5a with the closer and lower mrt 13 0 14 5 h pe and pm had extremely low values compared to pothers as shown in fig 7 a however pothers had an obvious improvement increased along with the increased cathode space ratio which hinted the main effect of increased cathode space ratio was enriching more other microbes meanwhile the reactor with the higher cathode space ratio had the higher abundance of function microbes for organics conversion which expressed higher cod removal under the higher cathode space ratio in fig 7b pe had an upward trend along with the increased cathode space ratio which indicated the improvement of electrogenesis capacity at the mrt of 20 24 h with the longest mrt 23 7 h pm was higher in the reactor with a cathode space ratio of 1 33 cm2 cm3 than other reactors it was well understood the importance of contact time to methanogenesis however the pm was still less than pothers the contribution of microbes to methanogenesis remained modest when mrt arrived at 30 33 h pm was higher than pothers in fig 7c pothers increased only along with the increased cathode space ratio from 0 67 cm2 cm3 to 1 33 cm2 cm3 and got the maximum longer mrt caused by the higher cathode space ratio mainly contributed to the methanogenesis in fig 7c also these good flow regimes improved the electrogenesis capacity the pe values were increased along with the increased cathode space ratio in fig 7d pe in raccc was 1 8 fold of in rac while only 1 2 fold of in racc at hrt of 36 h it indicated the increasing cathode space ratio was benefiting for improving the electrochemical performance however it was not the limit factor when increased to 1 33 cm2 cm3 the increased pm and decreased pothers in fig 7c and 7d expressed as enhanced methane production and cod removal 4 conclusions enough contact time well flow field and appropriate surface area of electrodes were three efficient methods to enhance the organics removal efficiency and increase the methane production also were aims of reactors design in this up flow microbial electrolysis assisted reactors microbes enriched on anode biofilm cathode biofilm and suspended solution had a great similarity the electrodes were more like biologically selective vectors and used for suspension solutions dominant functional microbes which took part in the removal of organics methane recovery and electron generation were enriched including enterococcus desulfovibrio methanosarcina methanobacterium methanospirillum methanobrevibacter and methanocorpusculum increasing the cathode space ratio from 0 67 cm2 cm3 to 1 33 cm2 cm3 and 2 cm2 cm3 could improve the flow pattern and prolong the contact time at the view of hydrodynamics analysis based on tracer experiment and visual numerical simulation under hrt of 24 h and 36 h comparatively increasing the cathode space ratio from 1 33 cm2 cm3 to 2 cm2 cm3 however had only a small effect thus the recommended cathode space ratio was 1 33 cm2 cm3 which provided a quantifiable reference the reactor racc with the cathode space ratio of 1 33 cm2 cm3 had the a considerable organics removal efficiency of 93 2 1 9 and methane production rate

17222,compared with common anaerobic digestion microbial electrolysis has been proven feasibly to accelerate biodegradation and methanogenesis with the advantages of effective electron flow regulation however its actual application and scale up required a full understanding and further investigation on electrode size and distribution for making full use of the space of the integrated reactor and improve methane recovery an effective interior configuration was significant in this work three types of reactors with different cathode spatial distributions that is different cathode space ratios ratio of cathode surface area to reaction region volume were studied to form a good flow pattern for obtaining high methane production tracer experiments and numerical simulation were employed simultaneously for understanding the hydrodynamics characters of the interior flow field the results showed that by increasing the cathode space ratio to 1 33 cm2 cm3 and 2 cm2 cm3 respectively better flow patterns with the residence time of 1 336 times and 1 363 times of theoretical hydraulic retention time could be obtained the stacked structure of nickel meshes was beneficial to prolong the contact time of contaminant and improve the mass transfer increasing the cathode space ratio could also enhance the electrochemical performance considering the organic removal methane recovery electrons generation and material consumption the recommended cathode space ratio was 1 33 cm2 cm3 with this structure cod removal efficiency reached 93 2 1 9 and 94 1 1 5 methane production rate reached 332 0 and 334 8 ml ch4 l reactor day and methane yield was 171 3 and 246 4 ml ch4 g cod under the hrt of 24 h and 36 h respectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrolysis methane recovery cathode spatial distribution hydrodynamics analysis numerical simulation 1 introduction as clean energy and efficient fuel methane has high industrial utilization value and can be sustainably recovered from waste organics and wastewater villano et al 2013 zhen et al 2016 compared with conventional anaerobic digestion the introduction of microbial electrolysis makes the systems more stable and controllable which has the superiority in organic conversion and methane recovery guo et al 2017 asztalos and kim 2015 electrodes not only serve as the electron transport medium but also as the carrier of microbes recently electrical regulation or stimulation has proven to a selective effect on the microbes which could enhance both the interactions among microbes and extracellular electron transfer between electrodes and microbes zhang et al 2019 zhen et al 2017 zhi et al 2019 the impact of enhanced methane production was found through biomass retention on electrodes even rather than electrochemical interaction with the electrodes in the research of de vrieze et al 2014 lots of researchers have focused on the selection of electrode materials thangavel et al 2016 and cathode catalysts zhen et al 2016 song et al 2016 to increase the biocompatibility of the electrode other researches concerned about the size of electrodes chen et al 2011 bruce logan et al 2007 to increase the number of microbes in the reactor however most of these researches guided at the laboratory level guo et al 2017 wang et al 2020a few attempts reported in large scale reactors and had similar satisfactory results cusick et al 2011 escapa et al 2015 such difficulties existed as the formation of biofilm fluid dynamics inside the reactors escapa et al 2015 zhen et al 2017 favorable fluid dynamics inside the reactors brought by good electrode distribution provided a well mass transfer that expressed sufficient contact time and contact degree for organics with both electrodes and microbes it meant a benign environment for the growth and attachment of microbes further increased microbial biomass and enhances microbial activity hui et al 2019 wang et al 2017a sufficient mass transfer and enriched microbes further reduced the internal resistance and enhanced the function of electrode thus the spatial distribution of electrodes was significant wang et al 2017b xu et al 2018 to promote the scaling up and potential application of this technology the configuration of bioelectrodes still needs to be further understood when using microbial electrolysis to enhance wastewater treatment and energy recovery since methanogenesis efficiency is markedly affected by electroactive microbes colonizing on the biocathode that use electrons through direct and indirect extracellular electron transfer li et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 the cathode was more correlated in the methanogenesis process compared with increased electrochemical efficiency resulting from enlarged anode surface area guo et al 2017 wang et al 2020a it is worth noting that a part of suspended microbes was discovered taking part in the methane recovery and being influenced by the electrodes wang et al 2020b the increased cathode modules inserted in wastewater treatment reactors would perforce influence the original flow pattern and further change the mass transfer to activated microorganisms few studies focused on the change of internal flow regime caused by increased electrode modules and therefore lacked the appropriate strategies for scaling up since directly stacking the cathode modules might result in the reactor clogging kim et al 2015 which was not beneficial for electrode playing its role and even influence the upward transport of matters thus increased to the appropriate cathode surface should be researched based on its effect on the overall flow pattern flow regime change could be reflected through hydrodynamic analysis which was commonly used in designing an effective interior structure or scaling up a reactor the hydrodynamic analysis could be in virtue of experiment or simulation residence time distribution rtd test as an effective experiment method was widely used to reflect the hydrodynamic characters in a practical application of bioreactor including computing the mean residence time mrt and reflecting the existence of several short circuiting streams or preferential flows kim et al 2015 olivet et al 2005 with model fitting the flow pattern could be further analyzed another method numerical simulation always used computational fluid dynamics cfd it could simulate the flow field of reactors and make it visualization through a two or three dimensional visualization according to the actual demand qi et al 2013 gao et al 2019 the distributions and relative values of some parameters such as velocity and pressure in the reactor could be reflected not only can simulation produce an appropriate hydraulic design but also reduce the cost and time by high efficiency iteration calculation considering the utilization of the reaction space the increased stacked mesh cathode was designed above the original cathode gao et al 2019 to further improve the performance of the reactor the considerable organic removal methane recovery and hydrodynamics characteristics were linked to cathode space ratio ratio of cathode surface area to reaction region volume which could provide a quantifiable reference for practical applications the effect on suspended solution was also noticed the simulation results of the dynamic distribution of tracer were compared with the results of the rtd experiment to verify the reliability of the model settings especially the non rigid carbon brush 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction and operation three types of up flow membrane less mec reactors rac racc and raccc were constructed for experiment analysis with an empty volume of 600 ml approximately an inner diameter of 5 cm and a total height of 35 cm as shown in fig 1 reactors had three main regions divided as their function gas collection and outlet region reaction region and inlet region another reactor r1 without electrodes was invented only with the reaction region and inlet region and was just for numerical simulation fig 1 anodes adopted carbon fiber brushes toray industries inc japan with 5 cm in diameter and length respectively nickel mesh with 40 mesh and 5 cm in diameter was used for cathode as shown in fig 1 stacked construction cathodes were counted as groups in each group the nickel meshes were connected by the titanium wire baoji lixing titanium group co ltd china the distances between anode and cathode maintained 3 cm in all reactors reactor rac had only one group of nickel mesh materials placed above the anode as previous study gao et al 2019 compared with rac racc was assembled with two groups of cathodes the increased cathode group was placed above the first group and 3 cm higher as an analogy raccc was made up of one anode brush and three groups of cathode meshes the distances between anode and cathode and the distances of each cathode group were 3 cm for the convenience of guiding application cathode space ratio was defined as different ratios between cathode surface area and reaction region volume for expressing the distribution of cathode thereinto reaction region volume was simplified as a cylinder with 5 cm in diameter and 24 cm in higher shown in fig 1 while the cathode surface area was calculated according to the upper and lower sides of each nickel mesh rac racc and raccc had the cathode space ratios of 0 67 cm2 cm3 1 33 cm2 cm3 and 2 cm2 cm3 respectively all the cathode groups connected with anode

plant wenchang harbin china li et al 2020 and effluent of 10 ml from similar long term operation integration reactors during the running stage sodium acetate was replaced into the proportional artificial beer wastewater influent while other components remained unchanged supplementary material influent was introduced by a peristaltic pump under the continuous flow mode huang et al 2021 theoretical hydraulic retention time hrt was shortened as the order of 36 24 18 and 12 h for investigating the performance under four different hrts and further evaluating whether the optimized structure could improve the treatment rate every condition was maintained for one month including one week of stabilization after the change of conditions and three weeks of sampling 2 2 chemical

hydrodynamics analysis lithium ion li as the tracer was used for the rtd experiment in this study after licl 1 0 g l of 10 ml was added into the inlet rapidly samples were adopted from the sample collection at the same time intervals during one hrt sampling time was controlled as three folds of hrts to ensure the complete outflow of the tracer the samples were detected by icp oes optima 8300 perkinelmer co ltd usa following the methods as introduced before gao et al 2019 rtd curves and analysis were conducted according to the equations from the literature cui et al 2020 meanwhile tanks in series tis and longitudinal dispersion ld model as well as the modified tanks in series mtis model wang et al 2017b 2015 were selected to fit the curves for comprehending fluid dynamics of each construction to get closer to the real flow field a three dimensional simulation was used to investigate hydrodynamics the actual reactors were extremely difficult to depict since the complexity of interior structure and inevitable machining error from the hand made reactor some hypotheses and simplifications were listed in supplementary material according to the reactor requirements and literature cui et al 2020 then the entity models were created and divided meshes shown in fig s1 due to the otherness of each structure it was divided into several parts and employed different grid division methods volume mesh used unstructured meshes in each part the total cells of rac racc and raccc were 1 475 748 1 316 528 and 1 316 528 respectively with an interval size of 1 for visualizing the flow pattern of reactors the steady state solver was selected viscous model chose the k epsilon equations and k epsilon realizable model for well and reasonable convergence the residuals were set as 10 6 the porous media model was employed by adding a momentum source term cui et al 2020 two main parameters Œ± and c2 were needed which were calculated according to eqs 12 and 13 as follows cui et al 2020 12 Œ± d p 2 150 Œµ 3 1 Œµ 2 13 c 2 3 5 d p 1 Œµ Œµ 3 where dp was the average particle diameter Œµ was the void fraction in this study the diameter of carbon fiber was used as the dp for the anode model while dp was derived from the conversion by the diameter of nickel wire and interval size of nickel mesh in cathode model simulation for the process of rtd experiment was performed which verified the track of tracer in other words the results of the rtd experiment also could verify the accuracy of the cfd model for rtd simulation the mixture model of two phases was applied as well as the transient state solver since licl solution was rapidly injected into the inlet the district with the same volume as added licl was marked near the inlet in this district the volume fraction was 1 the residuals were set as 10 3 and the concentration of li was reported by the area weighted average volume fraction 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrodynamics analysis for reactors with different cathode spatial distribution tracer test was used for understanding the hydrodynamic characters of three different reactors the results were drawn as the rtd curves shown in fig 2 and fig s1 all the curves had only one peak with a little tail which was following the common regulation gao et al 2019 wang et al 2015 little tails implied there had small dead or stagnant zones in reactors since the nickel wire in the cathode mesh structure and the root of the carbon brush had some interception to the fluid in fig 2 only reactor rac had the response peak at 0 67 Œ∏ under hrt of 12 h while others appeared after 0 67 Œ∏ under the hrt of 18 h response peak appeared at Œ∏ in reactor racc when hrt was more than 24 h reactor raccc also had the peak at Œ∏ generally ahead response peak meant the existence of a short circuiting stream or preferential flow the results showed that reactor racc and raccc had a better flow pattern than rac the increased stacked nickel mesh might play the role of water distribution so that the flow more uniform the longer mrts than hrts table 1 might be caused by the introduction of electrode modules which were similar to other reactors with built in electrodes wang et al 2017b cui et al 2020 when hrt was 24 h the relative mrts were the longest and Œ≤ the ratio of mrt to hrt wang et al 2017b values were 1 277 1 336 and 1 363 in reactors rac racc and raccc respectively properly extending the residence time conduced to the sufficient contact time between organics and electrodes different from the ideal complete mixing regime and plug flow regime most reactors existed a mixture of two regimes presenting the local mixing and push flow regime hence two typical hydraulic models based on ideal models were employed for describing those non ideal flow reactors the fitting results were showed in fig s1 and table 1 both two models roughly reflected the rtd experimental law of the three reactors the fitting response peaks always appeared before Œ∏ for the tis model while closer to Œ∏ for the ld model adjusted r square was calculated for evaluating the fitting degree for models in table s1 results showed that the tis model was more suitable for reactor rac while the flow regime of reactor raccc was closer to the ld model the smallest values of œÉ Œ∏ 2 appeared at hrt of 24 h which meant the minimal degree of back mixing and the flow pattern of reactors was closer to the plug flow regime racc and raccc were more similar with a plug flow reactor with the smaller œÉ Œ∏ 2 values smaller n and larger pe values larger values implied the main method of mass transfer was convection which was influenced by the velocity the mtis model showed highly consistent with the experiment results fig 2 and had the higher adjusted r square values table s1 all reactors were divided into three strands and the smallest and largest values were 3 50 and 17 97 of n respectively table s2 three reactors were closer to the plug flow regime since the degree of back mixing was insignificant with the larger values of n than 3 01 according to the literature wang et al 2015 in a word a higher cathode space ratio 1 33 cm2 cm3 and 2 cm2 cm3 was beneficial for prolonging the flow path and avoiding the short circuiting stream or preferential flow which optimized the mass transfer between electrodes and organics the effect of a higher cathode space ratio was more obvious with longer mrt under hrts of 24 h and 36 h which provided adequate contact time for organics with microbes reactors with a higher cathode space ratio were also closer to plug flow regime which was beneficial for biogas collection 3 2 flow pattern visualization analysis and rtd test simulation through cfd for further understanding the hydrodynamics characters of different structures the cfd simulation was used for visualizing the fluid flow the simulation of the rtd test was used to prove the reliability of the cfd simulation all cfd simulations were under the hrt of 24 h since the minimal degree of back mixing and its flow pattern closer to the plug flow regime occurred at the hrt of 24 h the pressure contours of three reactors were compared with an empty reactor r1 without electrodes showed in fig s3 for the reactor with non electrodes the pressure presented a higher value around the inlet region and dropped in an order of magnitude along with the flow direction three reactors with electrodes showed almost one order higher pressure of magnitude than r1 and the high pressure region including the inlet region and half of the anode region the three similar pressure contours might be caused due to two reasons one reason was that the increased pressure might be mainly caused by the anode but not the mesh structure of the cathode the other was that the main action of electrodes on the fluid was concentrated in the lower part of reactors in any case the introduction of electrodes increased the flow resistance which could contribute to prolonging the residence time improve the flow pattern and enhance mass transfer velocity distribution in the medial surface of three reactors and r1 without electrodes were depicted in fig 3 compared with r1 the changed velocity distribution and decreased interference from the wall was visually presented in reactors with electrodes the inlet region had a high velocity because the fluid was pumped into the reactor at a constant velocity through the inlet pipe with little section another high velocity region appeared around the anode as the fluid passed through the cathode the velocity decreased but became uniform which suggested that the cathode structure had the function of distributing water the velocity magnitude of three reactors medial surface was shown in fig s4 it showed that racc and raccc had the higher maximum flow velocity at the anode region the mean rising velocity was 1 16 cm h 1 11 cm h and 1 06 cm h in rac racc and raccc respectively reactors with a higher cathode space ratio had a higher local velocity and lower mean rising velocity that the lower mean rising velocity corresponded to the longer mrt in the rtd results increased local velocity contributed to enhancing the fluid contact degree with electrodes including the contact with attached microbes it further enhanced organics removal and microbial growth lower mean rising velocity prolonged the mrt which was consistent with rtd experimental results it was beneficial for sufficient reaction also a lower mean rising velocity was beneficial for retaining suspended microbes cfd simulation used for whole experiment results of rtd test was shown in fig s5 to clearly show the different flow states of reactors with different structures cfd simulation results in a shortened period of two Œ∏ were presented in fig 4 a b c the period of tracer diffusion from the inlet pipe in the initial stage was ignored it showed li gradually diffused along with the continuous influent as the flow direction and flowed out from outlet surface in fig 4 a b c in the first two intervals the li distribution had almost no differences in the three reactors the first time li reached the outlet surface was 16th hour for racc while rac had a considerable fraction of li flowed out which was consistent with the results in fig s5 d e f li flowed out of the outlet surface at a slightly slower rate shown in fig 4 the tracer had a little residual when going through the anode but was uniform in the cathode region it indicated that the center part of the anode seemed to intercept the flow while the cathode seemed to allow the fluid to flow uniformly fig s5 d e f showed the area weighted average volume fraction of li from the outlet surface as the numerical simulation result the cfd simulations showed similar patterns with rtd tests and the same response peak position it demonstrated the reliability of cfd simulation and electrode models in this study however the results before 0 5 Œ∏ showed some deviation and the peak values were exorbitant since the simulation was based on the hypotheses and simplifications there were certain structural differences with the actual reactors also the chosen models couldn t fully represent the real flow pattern anyhow cfd simulation supplied the visualization of the fluid field in reactors with different structures and helped comprehend the hydrodynamics characters more researches were needed to improve the accuracy of the simulation 3 3 effects of cathode space ratio on organics removal and methane recovery to better understand the effect of different cathode space ratios on reactor performance the microbial community structure of electrodes biofilm and suspended solution on genus level were detected fig 5 it showed that in this an up flow microbial electrolysis assisted reactors the dominant functional microbes including ferment and acid producing bacteria enterococcus electrochemical active bacteria desulfovibrio acetotrophic methanogens methanosarcina and hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacterium methanospirillum methanobrevibacter and methanocorpusculum were enriched in both anode biofilm cathode biofilm and suspended solution according to the microbial community structure possible pathways of organics removal and methane recovery were showed in fig 5 d these pathways might exist between microbes and microbes with electrodes a longer mrt favored a higher abundance of methanogens especially methanosarcina in the anode biofilm compared with the anode cathode biofilm had higher diversity for hydrogenotrophic methanogens a higher abundance of methanogens enriched in the biofilm of the lowest cathode with a longer mrt in this system methanogens were very competitive on the electrode biofilms especially due to the adequate contact time and good mass transfer with longer mrt a higher cathode space ratio provided a good flow pattern with a long flow path and less short circuiting steam or preferential flow which led to the similar dominant functional microbes enriched in the suspended solution it reflected the participation of suspended microbes in the methane recovery and the effect on suspended microbes by electrodes the organics removal was measured by cod removal efficiency showed in fig 6 a results showed that the increased cathode space ratio could cause higher organics removal the higher abundance of desulfovibrio electrode biofilm and enterococcus electrode biofilm and suspended solution were enriched in reactors with higher cathode space ratio which could improve the cod removal the removal efficiency increased more obviously when cathode space ratio went from 0 67 cm2 cm3 to 1 33 cm2 cm3 hrt 12 h and 24 h t test p 0 01 hrt 18 h and 36 h t test p 0 05 the biggest differences appeared at the hrt of 12 h with more groups of nickel mesh racc and raccc had 1 3 times and 1 4 times removal efficiency than rac respectively increased organics removal might be ascribed to more biomass and better hydraulic conditions under the hrt of 12 h a higher cathode ratio space had the better mass transfer as described in section 3 1 which contributed in higher cod removal efficiency and when the hrt was 24 h a longer mrt higher local velocity and lower mean rising velocity were all favorable factors for reactors with a higher cathode space ratio when hrt was longer than 12 h both three reactors with different cathode space ratios had the cod removal efficiency of more than 80 and had reduced gaps in particular the difference between racc and raccc was indistinctive 93 2 1 9 and 94 9 1 1 at the hrt of 24 h 94 1 1 5 and 96 0 1 8 at the hrt of 36 h t test p 0 05 it meant that increased cathode space ratio was beneficial for cod removal and the advantage was more pronounced under shorter hrt when hrt was lower the fast flow rate made the contact time between organics and electrode short and the organics could not be fully utilized the more function microbes accelerated the conversion of the organics in the higher cathode space ratio made up for the lack of contact time when hrt was higher the advantage of high cathode space ratio tended to better flow regime since the lower mean rising velocity and longer mrt in the reactor with higher cathode space ratio lower rising velocity benefited for retaining more suspended microbes which contributed more organic removal and longer mrt enhanced the contact time furthermore the cod removal of racc could reach the maximum 93 2 1 9 at hrt of 24 h which was higher than the 89 9 1 8 of rac under hrt of 36 h increased cathode space ratio could also speed up processing on the other hand methane production rate mpr and methane yield my were evaluated and showed in fig 6 b in fig 6 b it showed that increasing the cathode space ratio from 0 67 cm2 cm3 to 1 33 cm2 cm3 influenced the methane production rate mpr however further increasing to the 2 cm2 cm3 did not significantly improve the mpr compared with the removal process of organics the methanogenesis process was slower and needed more contact time a higher mpr in racc might be ascribed to its strong competitive of methanogens on the electrode biofilms and suspended solution caused by the adequate contact time and good mass transfer with longer mrt also the introduction of electrodes speeded up a part of the methanogenesis process through electron transfer and more electrons were produced along with the enhanced organics removal in racc meanwhile for racc and raccc the methane production was almost 2 1 fold and 1 4 fold higher at hrt of 36 h and 24 h than 12 h which expressed the nearly mpr hrt 24 h 332 0 and 340 5 ml ch4 l reactor day respectively hrt 36 h 334 8 and 343 1 ml ch4 l reactor day respectively with similar cod removal efficiency and flow pattern cathode space ratio 1 33 cm2 cm3 and 2 cm2 cm3 was not the limited faction and expressed a similar performance in fig 6 b results showed the cathode space ratio had no obvious effect on methane yield from cod as shown in fig 5 d the functional bacteria involved in organic matter removal and methane generation were enriched in both the electrode biofilm and suspension solution the increase of the cathode space ratio led to the increase of methane production and organics removal simultaneously moreover the increased organics removal from high cathode space ratio might be caused by increased biomass and further expressed similar methane yield the high methane yield occurred at the hrt of 36 h than 24 h attributing to the more methane accumulation in a long time under similar cod removal 3 4 effects of cathode space ratio on electrochemical performance and electron balance analysis electrons produced by the anode and transferred to the cathode through the external circuit were calculated for evaluating the electrochemical performance the electric quantity q produced in racc and raccc was higher than that in rac according to table 2 such as when the hrt was 24 h the accumulated q value was 713 4 998 7 and 1141 4 c in reactor rac racc and raccc respectively increasing the cathode space ratio was in favor of more electronic production which was caused by better electrogenesis capacity of the anode with a higher abundance of electrochemical active bacteria in the reactor with a higher cathode space ratio the higher flow velocity at the anode region could also improve the contact degree of anode and anode microbes with organics and further enhanced the electrogenesis capacity of the anode the q value hinted that the anode in racc with a cathode space ratio of 1 33 cm2 cm3 had higher electrogenesis capacity than in rac and similar with raccc it was also discovered that the q value reached the maximum at the hrt of 18 h and decreased with the increased hrt which was the same with other researches min and logan 2004 behera and ghangrekar 2017 since more organics were applied for reactors with shorter hrt and more electrons were generated during the same time the electrochemical effect of anode could also be evaluated through coulombic efficiency shown in table 2 results showed a low ce generated in all three reactors at the hrt of 12 h and the order of raccc racc rac under other hrts it hinted that less of the removal of organics at lower hrt was contributed by the anodic electrogenesis increased organics removal in reactors with the higher cathode space ratio might be attributed to the more microbial enrichment at all electrodes and suspension solution when hrt was higher the increased cathode space ratio improved the anode electrogenesis capacity the part of methane produced utilizing the electrons transferred from the anode was evaluated as the electrochemical contribution efficiency Œ∑e in table 2 the Œ∑e values were higher at the lower hrt of 12 h and were similar in three reactors since when the residence time was short the methanogenesis relied more on the rapid transfer of electrons through external circuits and expressed the higher Œ∑e when hrt was increased the proportion of electrons contributing directly to methanogenesis was lower the increased rate of Œ∑e was smaller than q since more suspended microbes were retained in reactors under higher hrt and contributed a lot to methanogenesis organics conversion pathways were calculated based on electron balance shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 5 d organics turned into methane through electrochemical reaction through the external circuit pe and methanogens effect pm methanogens included both attached to electrodes and suspended solution in the reactor the composition and distribution of these microbial communities were influenced by electrodes pothers reflected microbial growth consumption including methanogens and other microbes in fig 5a with the closer and lower mrt 13 0 14 5 h pe and pm had extremely low values compared to pothers as shown in fig 7 a however pothers had an obvious improvement increased along with the increased cathode space ratio which hinted the main effect of increased cathode space ratio was enriching more other microbes meanwhile the reactor with the higher cathode space ratio had the higher abundance of function microbes for organics conversion which expressed higher cod removal under the higher cathode space ratio in fig 7b pe had an upward trend along with the increased cathode space ratio which indicated the improvement of electrogenesis capacity at the mrt of 20 24 h with the longest mrt 23 7 h pm was higher in the reactor with a cathode space ratio of 1 33 cm2 cm3 than other reactors it was well understood the importance of contact time to methanogenesis however the pm was still less than pothers the contribution of microbes to methanogenesis remained modest when mrt arrived at 30 33 h pm was higher than pothers in fig 7c pothers increased only along with the increased cathode space ratio from 0 67 cm2 cm3 to 1 33 cm2 cm3 and got the maximum longer mrt caused by the higher cathode space ratio mainly contributed to the methanogenesis in fig 7c also these good flow regimes improved the electrogenesis capacity the pe values were increased along with the increased cathode space ratio in fig 7d pe in raccc was 1 8 fold of in rac while only 1 2 fold of in racc at hrt of 36 h it indicated the increasing cathode space ratio was benefiting for improving the electrochemical performance however it was not the limit factor when increased to 1 33 cm2 cm3 the increased pm and decreased pothers in fig 7c and 7d expressed as enhanced methane production and cod removal 4 conclusions enough contact time well flow field and appropriate surface area of electrodes were three efficient methods to enhance the organics removal efficiency and increase the methane production also were aims of reactors design in this up flow microbial electrolysis assisted reactors microbes enriched on anode biofilm cathode biofilm and suspended solution had a great similarity the electrodes were more like biologically selective vectors and used for suspension solutions dominant functional microbes which took part in the removal of organics methane recovery and electron generation were enriched including enterococcus desulfovibrio methanosarcina methanobacterium methanospirillum methanobrevibacter and methanocorpusculum increasing the cathode space ratio from 0 67 cm2 cm3 to 1 33 cm2 cm3 and 2 cm2 cm3 could improve the flow pattern and prolong the contact time at the view of hydrodynamics analysis based on tracer experiment and visual numerical simulation under hrt of 24 h and 36 h comparatively increasing the cathode space ratio from 1 33 cm2 cm3 to 2 cm2 cm3 however had only a small effect thus the recommended cathode space ratio was 1 33 cm2 cm3 which provided a quantifiable reference the reactor racc with the cathode space ratio of 1 33 cm2 cm3 had the a considerable organics removal efficiency of 93 2 1 9 and methane production rate

17223,time lags between anthropogenic nitrogen inputs and their impacts to nitrate levels cause a misunderstanding for sources and subsequently misguide the groundwater management we investigated the hydrochemical data of groundwater samples n 172 from 49 wells with chlorofluorocarbons cfcs based groundwater age dating and stable n Œ¥15n and o isotopes Œ¥18o of nitrate to assess the legacy effect of livestock farming to groundwater in an agricultural area where intensive livestock farming started in the 1970s and illegal dumping of manure wastewater in a lava cave was revealed in 2015 approximately 90 of the groundwater samples had nitrate concentrations exceeding the natural threshold 5 5 mg l no3 for nitrate contamination and 34 exceeded the world health organization s guideline for drinking water quality 44 3 mg l indicating severe nitrate contamination the Œ¥15nno3 values 5 5 to 24 3 in groundwater exceeding the threshold of nitrate showed that livestock manure was a major nitrate source while ammonium fertilizer also seemed influential given the Œ¥15nno3 values in the overlapping fields of n sources factor analysis of hydrochemical data also supported nitrate contamination by manure as well as by plant farming in the study area based on the spatial distribution of nitrate levels and Œ¥15nno3 livestock farming affected nitrate contamination by illegal manure dumping in the leakage cave according to a bayesian mixing model the contribution of manure wastewater was 33 5 to 81 8 as of 2015 2018 with the rest from fertilizers meanwhile the groundwater ages showed negative correlations with both nitrate levels r 0 90 and Œ¥15nno3 values r 0 74 on a log scale consistent with the increasing n release from livestock farming since the 1960s in particular the median value of Œ¥15nno3 rapidly increased to 9 2 in groundwater recharged between the late 1970s and early 1990s when n production exponentially increased implying a significant effect of livestock farming after the 1980s groundwater quality is expected to deteriorate over the next several decades based on the groundwater ages 23 5 years the increased n production from livestock farming and the legacy effect of n long term groundwater management plans 25 years are required to decrease n loads in the study area because it takes time for management practices to take effect the study results are a good reference for groundwater management in regions with a source shift to livestock farming under intensive livestock production systems moreover the chronological study using historical n production groundwater age data and dual nitrate isotopes can be applied to other regions with multiple n sources and their shifting for identifying sources and estimating time lags graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater nitrate water management livestock farming legacy effect cfcs dating and dual nitrate isotopes 1 introduction as plant cultivation and livestock farming increase for food production along with the exponential growth in the world s population in recent decades anthropogenic nitrogen n inputs have soared galloway et al 2003 specifically the n input to the landmass increased globally from 54 to 89 tg n yr 1 between 1900 and 1950 and up to 248 tg n yr 1 in 2000 including n fertilizer 83 tg n yr 1 and n manure 92 tg n yr 1 bouwman et al 2013 the n input rates are higher than the n output rates e g natural attenuation and thus n has accumulated in the environment and altered the global n cycle galloway et al 2008 schlesinger 2009 moreover excessive n inputs deteriorate water quality which has emerged as a global environmental problem in particular nitrate levels in water have been constantly increasing in many countries with increasing anthropogenic n inputs eea 2000 katz et al 2001 nolan and hitt 2006 dubrovsky et al 2010 howden et al 2010 sutton et al 2011 for instance nitrate levels in groundwater wells in agricultural areas are about three times the national background level of nitrate 3 1 mg l in the united states dubrovsky et al 2010 ward et al 2018 similarly 25 of groundwater wells in the european union are in poor chemical status due to excessive n inputs from agriculture and livestock farming activities eea 2000 for the sustainability of freshwater resources it is urgent to establish efficient n management practices however there are difficulties in establishing an effective management policy for groundwater quality mainly for the following reasons 1 large amounts of anthropogenic n are loaded via nonpoint source pollution which causes spatial inconsistencies between sources and polluted sites and makes it difficult to identify sources liu et al 2005 2 several sources are mixed in a small area especially in intensive agro farming areas including south korea choi et al 2003 minet et al 2017 and 3 there are time lags between n inputs and groundwater contamination called legacy effects van meter et al 2018 vero et al 2018 for example more than 50 of nitrate exported from the mississippi river gulf of mexico watershed is 30 years of age and only 25 is 5 years due to the legacy of n sources within the watershed van meter et al 2018 groundwater nitrate concentrations result from present day or historical anthropogenic n inputs depending on hydro bio geological conditions and source characteristics for instance n sources can lead to a hydrological time lag e g time spent traveling along slow transport pathways or a biogeochemical time lag via denitrification or accumulation in the root zone of agricultural soils the time gap between inputs and nitrate contamination continues to cause nitrate contamination and delays the achievement of nutrient management practices howden et al 2010 erostate et al 2018 vero et al 2018 and moreover causes a misunderstanding for sources and subsequently misguide the groundwater management thus the legacy problem should be dealt with when interpreting the groundwater nitrate contamination and the time lag must be assessed for sustainable groundwater management however it is challenging to assess the n legacy due to little information to link the time of n inputs to the time for the n to reach groundwater as well as uncertainties for the subsurface environment condition it becomes more challenging when multiple n sources exist or shift with time e g from plant farming to livestock farming to discriminate nitrate sources among potential sources n and oxygen o isotopic ranges for each source have been identified and applied for source identification choi et al 2007 xue et al 2009 furthermore the dual no isotope approach has been used to provide information on biogeochemical processes such as denitrification nitrification and ammonia volatilization kendall 1998 xue et al 2009 minet et al 2017 despite this usefulness however the dual no isotope approach has limitations such as 1 the overlap of isotopic ranges among different nitrate sources and 2 isotopic fractionations accompanied by biogeochemical reactions e g denitrification xue et al 2009 hosono et al 2013 minet et al 2017 recently the dual no isotope approach has been combined with land use jin et al 2012 hydrochemical data past√©n zapata et al 2014 kim et al 2015 and multivariate statistical analysis jung et al 2014 meghdadi and javar 2018 to improve its effectiveness as for the time lag between n inputs and nitrate levels of groundwater groundwater ages have been studied with nitrate contaminatio b√∂hlke and denver 1995 katz et al 2001 b√∂hlke 2002 morgenstern et al 2012 taufiq et al 2019 groundwater ages provide information on recharge timing residence time and groundwater pathway kolbe et al 2016 koh et al 2018 mar√ßais et al 2018 these pieces of information help assess the response of an aquifer to n inputs and estimate future nitrate contamination in combination with historical n inputs puckett et al 2011 erostate et al 2018 chambers et al 2019 however most of the chronological studies on n inputs and nitrate contamination have been focused on total n or plant farming e g puckett et al 2011 vero et al 2018 whereas few have applied groundwater age data and focused on livestock farming although the n production from livestock farming keeps increasing in many countries including canada new zealand south korea spain and the united states oecd 2019 for instance the n production from the livestock industry in south korea increased by 26 between 1990 1992 and 2002 2004 oecd 2008 and has exceeded n from plant farming since 2008 oecd 2019 it is required to establish management practices for the livestock derived n with considering its legacy effect in the regions with intensive livestock farms thus we assessed nitrate levels and stable n and o isotopes of nitrate in groundwater with groundwater ages and the history of livestock farming to understand the impact of livestock farming on groundwater nitrate contamination with time on the volcanic island of jeju in south korea in which groundwater is the only water resource and intensive livestock farming began in the 1970s in particular the impact of illegal dumping of manure wastewater in a lava cave until 2015 was evaluated specifically the present study aimed 1 to identify a source shift of nitrate contamination in groundwater 2 to quantify the contribution of a major source i e illegal manure wastewater dumping as of 2015 2018 3 to find the temporal relationship between n production from livestock farming and nitrate contamination and ultimately to assess a time gap between n inputs and nitrate levels in groundwater and 4 to suggest groundwater management based on the legacy effect the results of this study can provide valuable information for future policies to regulate livestock facilities for the conservation of drinking water quality in regions with a similar source shift due to intensive animal farming e g concentrated animal feeding operations moreover the combined use of hydrochemical parameters no dual isotopes groundwater age dating and the historical data of n production to assess a time lag can be applied to other regions with multiple n sources and their shifting 2 study area the hanlim region 91 09 km2 is located in the northwestern part of jeju island south korea fig 1 a groundwater flows from the southeast high altitude area to the northwest shoreline similar to the topography in fig 1d lava caves are distributed in the forest and grassland along the groundwater flow path toward

volcanic rocks include interflow structures e g clinker lava tubes and tunnels formed by a series of lava flows and thus have high permeability according to won et al 2006 hydraulic conductivity is in a wide range from 0 1 m day 1 to 2400 m day 1 with an average of 234 m day 1 due to the high permeability and storage capacity these volcanic rocks act as the main aquifer of the island but also make the aquifer vulnerable to surface contaminants including livestock manure and synthetic fertilizers kim et al 2003 won et al 2006 koh et al 2006 2012 kim et al 2018 also the lava caves can be preferential pathways for contaminants if connected to the surface kiernan et al 2003 according to lee et al 2006 lava caves are a direct recharge point of groundwater on jeju island although studies on the hydrological role of lava caves on the island are still insufficient a sedimentary formation formed by hydrovolcanism called seogwipo formation underlies the volcanic rocks the formation is composed of sand tuffaceous materials fragments of basaltic rocks and molluscan shells sohn et al 2003 acts as an impermeable layer because of relatively low permeability kim et al 2003 won et al 2006 and has an average thickness of 100 m a u formation and bedrock layer underlie the seogwipo formation and they consist of unconsolidated sand and granite respectively koh 1997 jeong et al 2016 aquifers on jeju island are classified into three types perched basal and parabasal groundwater koh 1997 choung et al 2004 the study area shows all three types choung et al 2004 but mostly parabasal groundwater over the impermeable seogwipo formation because the study area meets the impermeable seogwipo formation at shallow depths 37 100 m below sea level koh et al 2012 jung et al 2014 perched groundwater is present in the impervious layer in the unsaturated zone and develops predominantly in the mid to high altitude areas while basal groundwater is distributed in the coastal area and lies on the saltwater due to the density difference the annual mean temperature and precipitation of jeju island ranged from 14 9 to 16 3 c and from 735 5 to 1874 5 mm yr 1 respectively in 1988 2017 http

kmolit 2017 jssgp 2018 groundwater recharges mostly from high altitude areas due to high precipitation low evaporation and low runoff in high altitude areas 1200 m a s l park et al 2014 groundwater is the only water resource on the island i e nearly 91 as of 2017 and thus the groundwater use per unit area 360 5 m3 day 1 km2 is more than four times that of the south korean peninsula k water 2018 2 2 land use and manure waste in the study area most of the hanlim area located below 250 m a s l is used for agriculture fig 1b as of 2017 the agricultural area was 40 47 km2 similar to that in the 1960s

1700 ton year in 2017 jssgp 2018 based on the n isotopic compositions of nitrate the impact of compost on groundwater nitrate contamination seems insignificant since the compost had n isotopic compositions exceeding 15 up to 20 9 in the study area choi 2002 the atmospheric deposition of nitrate also can be excluded given low traffic volumes and no industrial facilities in this area and low nitrate concentrations in the air song et al 2016 livestock facilities are scattered at 100 350 m a s l and in particular are densely located near the geum oreum at an altitude of 250 300 m a s l fig

at 180 m a s l called the leakage cave in fig 1 were revealed in 2015 and more than 8500 tons of manure wastewater were estimated to infiltrate underground jmp 2018 after the illegal discharge was disclosed a monitoring well sm 01 in fig 1a was installed near the leakage cave in 2018 by the korea rural community corporation krc to investigate the contamination of aquifers core samples from two fracture zones 20 and 30 m below ground surface showed traces of contamination see supplementary fig s1 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and sample pretreatment for analysis a total of 172 groundwater samples were collected from 49 wells fig 1 during five sampling campaigns in june 2015 four wells n 4 october 2015 10 wells n 10 august to september 2017 15 wells n 81 march 2018 37 wells n 37 and may 2018 40 wells n 40 during the third campaign in 2017 81 groundwater samples were collected from 15 wells near the leakage cave every 5 to 10 days most of the wells were installed for agricultural farming and the well depths were in the range of 35 to 370 m median depth of 156 8 m below the ground surface groundwater samples were filtered through 0 45 Œºm cellulose membranes and then transferred to pre washed hdpe bottles for the analysis of dissolved ions samples for major cations were acidified to decrease ph 2 by adding a few drops of ultrapure nitric acid additionally 63 groundwater samples were collected in october 2015 n 10 august to september 2017 n 16 and march 2018 n 37 for nitrate isotopic analysis at least one sample was obtained from 45 wells to cover the whole study area also two manure samples cow and pig respectively and three synthetic ammonium fertilizers were obtained in march 2018 to identify the isotopic characteristics of potential nitrate sources in the study area ten grams of wet manure samples were diluted to 100 ml while one gram of fertilizer samples was diluted to 200 ml with deionized water kleinman et al 2002 these diluted samples were filtered through 0 45 Œºm cellulose membranes before isotopic analysis in october 2015 and may 2018 23 groundwater samples and their duplicates were collected in 60 ml borosilicate glass bottles for the analysis of cfcs sampling locations were selected along the groundwater flow path from the leakage cave to the shoreline based on the hydrochemical analysis results samples highly contaminated with nitrate and ones with little contamination were evenly selected for cfc analysis the bottles were placed in a 1 l beaker and filled with groundwater until the bottles overflowed busenberg and plummer 1992 then the groundwater samples were sealed to prevent contact with the atmosphere dunkel et al 1993 all samples were kept in the dark and at less than 4 c using ice until laboratory analysis 3 2 analysis of samples ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do were measured in the field by a handheld multi parameter probe ysi usa alkalinity was also measured in the field by a titration technique to quantify carbonate species mainly hco3 in groundwater stumm and morgan 1996 major cations na k mg2 ca2 si and vanadium v were analyzed using icp aes model optima

using ion chromatography ics2000 dionex usa with the detection limit 0 05 mg l at the center for mineral resources research cmr of korea university the n Œ¥15n and o Œ¥18o isotope ratios of nitrate were analyzed for 63 groundwater samples and n Œ¥15n of ammonium for five potential n source samples i e manure and synthetic ammonium fertilizer at the isotope science laboratory of the university of calgary by the bacterial denitrification method casciotti et al 2002 and diffusion method hannon and b√∂hlke 2008 respectively nitrates of water samples were converted to gaseous nitrous oxide n2o by pseudomonas aureofaciens which lack n2o reductive activity then Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o of nitrate were determined with finnigan mat delta plus xl irms ammoniums in the solution were converted to gaseous form that was subsequently trapped quantitatively as nh4 2so4 on a specially prepared filter pad then Œ¥15n of ammonium was determined with elemental analyzer isotope ratio mass spectrometer ea irms system the Œ¥15n values of nitrate Œ¥15nno3 and ammonium Œ¥15nnh4 were notated with respect to atmospheric n with a precision of 0 3 while the Œ¥18o values of nitrate Œ¥18ono3 were reported relative to v smow with an analytical precision of 0 5 cfcs in 23 groundwater samples were analyzed at gns science in new zealand the north american air curves for cfcs https water usgs gov lab were used to calculate the apparent age of groundwater because atmospheric cfc concentrations on jeju island were expected to be similar to those in the northern hemisphere given no cfcs sources such as industrial facilities on the island koh et al 2006 also showed that monthly monitoring results of atmospheric cfcs on the island corresponded to those of north america averages of a sample and its duplicate were provided as a representative value 3 3 factor analysis and bayesian isotope mixing model factor analysis fa was conducted to determine the hydrochemical processes controlling groundwater quality in the study area using major ions cl no3 so4 2 ca2 mg2 na k and field parameters ph ec hco3 fa is a multivariate statistical technique that extracts a small number of latent variables called factors that can describe the whole dataset with minimal loss of original information park 2000 jiang et al 2009 a correlation matrix of all hydrochemical variables is calculated and factors are then extracted from a linear combination of the original variables for this study fa was performed by using ibm spss statistics 25 software all hydrochemical variables except ph were log transformed and then standardized to reduce the impact of outliers factors were extracted using the principal components method in the spss software and based on eigenvalues greater than 1 and then rotated through varimax rotation kaiser 1958 liu et al 2003 to make it easy to interpret the original variables major hydrochemical processes were assessed based on the correlations between each factor and hydrochemical variables and the factor scores of groundwater samples a bayesian isotope mixing model was implemented using Œ¥15nno3 and the siar stable isotope analysis in r package to quantify the contribution of illegal dumping in the leakage cave until 2015 to groundwater nitrate contamination in the study area fig 1 the bayesian isotope mixing model is effective in quantifying the proportional contribution pk of source k at sample i and has been widely used to evaluate the contribution of each pollutant in a complex system with several sources kim et al 2015 meghdadi et al 2018 the basic algorithm of the bayesian isotope mixing model is as follows 1 x i k 1 k p k s k c k œµ i s k n Œº k œâ k 2 c k n Œª k œÑ k 2 Œµ k n 0 œÉ 2 with a constraint of k 1 k p k 1 where k is the

172 groundwater samples are shown in table 1 with percentiles we used the 10th and 90th percentiles instead of minimum and maximum values when describing the contamination status to exclude extreme values near the leakage cave tds ranged from 123 4 mg l 10th percentile to 314 3 mg l 90th percentile while nitrate concentrations ranged from 5 8 mg l 10th percentile to 80 5 mg l 90th percentile the highest nitrate concentration was observed close to the leakage cave 370 1 mg l in 2018 at sm 01 followed by 174 1 mg l in 2017 at w 026 immediately downgradient of the leakage cave approximately 90 of the groundwater samples had nitrate concentrations exceeding the natural threshold 5 5 mg l no3 koh et al 2009 for nitrate contamination on jeju island while 34 exceeded the dws 44 3 mg l indicating severe nitrate contamination groundwater samples were continuously distributed from na hco3to ca mg cl no3 type fig 3 the most abundant hydrochemical facies was the ca mg cl no3 type n 78 45 3 whose median no3 was 50 1 mg l and average ph was 7 5 then the na hco3 type n 64 37 2 median no3 8 0 mg l average ph 8 2 ca mg hco3 type n 20 11 6 median no3 31 2 mg l average ph 7 8 and na cl type n 10 5 8 median no3 30 5 mg l average ph 8 0 were observed it is noticeable that the na hco3 facies was contained in groundwater samples with low nitrate concentrations and high ph fig 3 consistent with the hydrochemistry of pristine groundwater on jeju island known as na hco3 type or na mg hco3 type choung et al 2004 koh et al 2005 2009 kim et al 2018 in contrast the nitrate concentration tended to increase while ph decreased with an increasing proportion of mg2 ca2 and cl fig 3 nitrate showed high positive correlations r 0 8 with ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl and ec and a high negative correlation r 0 8 with ph supplementary table s2 4 1 2 groundwater wells seasonal differences were rarely observed in nitrate concentrations e g p 0 05 in the t test between 2015 and 2018 p 0

showed little temporal variations thus hydrochemical data including nitrate concentrations were averaged for each well fig 4 a and supplementary table s3 as a result the range of nitrate concentrations was from 1 7 to 370 1 mg l depending on the well almost all the wells had nitrate concentrations exceeding the natural threshold 5 5 mg l on jeju island except for six wells fig 4a supplementary table s3 moreover more than 24 of the wells 12 of the total 49 wells cw dyp f 132 f 206 f 242 f 246 jc 04 s 004 si sm 01 w 026 y 036 in figs 1a and 4a had nitrate concentrations exceeding the dws which indicates that the groundwater in the hanlim region has been severely contaminated by nitrate groundwater wells with high nitrate concentrations were mostly located downgradient of the leakage cave in the northwest area fig 4a the well located immediately downgradient of the leakage cave w 026 diamond symbols in figs 3 and 4 and hereafter showed the highest nitrate concentration following sm 01 meanwhile the range of nitrate concentrations was from 5 4 to 31 1 mg l median 8 9 mg l no3 n 11 in the southeast area upgradient of the leakage cave and lower than the median nitrate concentration in the region 31 9 mg l in table 1 the lowest concentrations were observed in the wells hm 01 1 7 mg l no3 and hm 02 1 9 mg l no3 in the coastal area which are used for pumping groundwater for liquor production the spatial distribution of cl so4 2 ec and tds also showed similar spatial patterns to nitrate in supplementary fig s2 4 2 stable n and o isotopes of 63 groundwater samples analyzed for nitrate isotopes 55 samples showed nitrate concentrations exceeding the natural threshold 5 5 mg l and are called contaminated gw in table 2 the Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values of nitrate in groundwater were in the range of 4 6 to 24 3 table 2 and 0 4 to 6 5 table 3 respectively during denitrification Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values increase with a slope of 1 1 3 to 1 2 with decreasing nitrate concentrations ji et al 2017 minet et al 2017 but this trend was not shown in the study area supplementary fig s3 4 2 1 Œ¥18o of nitrate the Œ¥18o values of nitrate Œ¥18ono3 produced through nitrification are assumed to be within 10 to 10 based on the Œ¥18o of precipitation Œ¥18oh2o precipitation in the world kendall 1998 xue et al 2009 this wide range of Œ¥18ono3 is used in the dual no isotope approach to assess the origin of nitrate and biogeochemical processes we narrowed down the theoretical range of Œ¥18ono3 through nitrification Œ¥18ono3 nitrification using the Œ¥18oh2o precipitation values of jeju in table 3 as 2 Œ¥ 18 o no 3 nitrification 1 3 Œ¥ 18 o o 2 atmospheric 2 3 Œ¥ 18 o h 2 o precipitation where Œ¥18oo2 atmospheric is the Œ¥18o of o2 in the atmospheric air and was assumed to be 23 5 kendall 1998 xue et al 2009 while Œ¥18oh2o precipitation is the Œ¥18o of precipitation on jeju island and was obtained from lee et al 2003 n 109 and ryuh 2017 n 167 eq 2 indicates that nitrifying bacteria couples two oxygen atoms from ambient water and an oxygen atom from atmospheric o2 with an n atom from ammonium during nitrification kendall 1998 xue et al 2009 as a result the theoretical Œ¥18ono3 nitrification values of the jeju groundwater ranged from 0 9 10th percentile to 5 5 90th percentile table 3 and were much narrower than the typical range reported by kendall 1998 we applied the 10th and 90th percentile for Œ¥18ono3 nitrification in fig 5 following xue et al 2009 a comparison of the theoretical Œ¥18ono3 nitrification calculated for jeju to the measured Œ¥18ono3 in groundwater showed that most groundwater samples were plotted in the theoretical Œ¥18o range of nitrification 0 9 to 5 5 table 3 and fig 5 and far from the general Œ¥18o range of synthetic nitrate fertilizer 17 to 25 or atmospheric nitrate 25 to 75 kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 the Œ¥18ono3 values show that manure soil n and synthetic ammonium fertilizer can be potential sources of nitrate in the hanlim area 4 2 2 Œ¥15n of nitrate and ammonium two manure samples collected from the study area had Œ¥15nnh4 values of 5 1 and 19 1 table 2 within the Œ¥15n range of manure 5 to 25 reported by xue et al 2009 synthetic ammonium fertilizers had values between 3 5 and 1 5 table 2 within the Œ¥15n range of nitrified ammonium fertilizers 6 to 6 reported by xue et al 2009 thus we used the Œ¥15n range reported by xue et al 2009 to determine nitrate sources in groundwater in fig 5 note the overlap of Œ¥15n between three n sources in fig 5 the Œ¥15nno3 values of contaminated gw 5 5 to 24 3 were all within the Œ¥15n range of manure 5 to 25 table 2 fig 5 groundwater samples n 2 collected immediately downgradient of the leakage cave w 026 had the highest Œ¥15nno3values 19 7 in 2018 and 24 3 in 2017 and nitrate concentrations 151 4 mg l in 2018 and 146 0 mg l in 2017 in figs 4 and 5 note that groundwater from sm 01 installed close to the leakage cave was not analyzed for Œ¥15nno3 it should be noted however that the manure source has a wide range of Œ¥15n values and most of the groundwater samples exceeding the natural threshold of nitrate 5 5 mg l were plotted close to the low boundary of the manure range in fig 5 implying mixing with other sources with low Œ¥15n values also the Œ¥15nno3values of two samples from the wells park and s 004 see fig 1a for localities were also in the Œ¥15n range of nitrified ammonium fertilizers 6 to 6 fig 5 these two wells were located in the middle of the agricultural area and the nitrate concentrations for each groundwater sample were 36 4 and 75 5 mg l respectively in contrast eight samples whose nitrate concentrations were below the natural threshold 5 5 mg l including hm 01 and hm 02 had Œ¥15n values within the range of soil n 0 to 8 except for one sample hh see fig 1a for locality that was 8 5 despite the low nitrate concentration 4 7 mg l in march 2018 in fact the other two samples from the hh well had high no3 18 5 mg l in october 2015 17 4 mg l in may 2018 an average of 13 5 mg l for three samples in supplementary table s3 implying anthropogenic nitrate contamination in hh moreover the other samples were also plotted in the overlapping zone of fertilizer soil n and manure in fig 5 indicating the possibility of anthropogenic n effects 4 3 cfcs age dating the recharge temperature of rainfall is needed to derive a reasonable apparent age of groundwater chambers et al 2019 because the solubility of atmospheric cfcs varies with temperature thus the recharge temperature was estimated using air temperature data obtained in 2016 2018 n 1089 from the youngsil 869 weather station fig 1a since groundwater recharges mostly from high altitude areas park et al 2014 a precipitation weighted average temperature of 13 15 c was obtained as 3 precipitation weighted average t e m p e r a t u r e p r e c i p i t a t i o n p r e c i p i t a t i o n and used in fig 6 and supplementary table s4 as the recharge temperature considering that rainfall on jeju island is controlled by monsoons and concentrated in summer based on cfc 12 apparent groundwater ages ranged between 54 years 1961 and 23 5 years 1991 5 almost half the groundwater samples were 30 years of age hm 01 and hm 02 near the coastline had the oldest groundwater ages the apparent age of the youngest groundwater was 23 5 years 1991 5 similar to the previous results on jeju island koh et al 2006 2018 we selected cfc 12 in this study to determine the apparent age of groundwater because cfc 12 has higher stability against degradation and is less contaminated during sampling than cfc 11 or cfc 113 plummer and bunsenberg 2000 koh et al 2018 the younger groundwater had higher nitrate concentrations fig 6a specifically nitrate concentrations of groundwater recharged before 1970 n 4 were below the natural threshold 5 5 mg l while the nitrate concentrations of groundwater recharged after 1970 n 19 exceeded the threshold value moreover more than half the groundwater samples recharged after the late 1980s six of eleven exceeded the dws 44 3 mg l similar to the nitrate concentrations the younger groundwater had higher Œ¥15nno3 values in fig 6b the Œ¥15nno3 values of groundwater recharged before 1972 were less than 7 up to 6 6 while groundwater recharged after 1972 showed that Œ¥15nno3 values increased by more than 2 9 two groundwater samples recharged after the late 1980s f 242 in 1987 and w 026 in 1988 had Œ¥15nno3 values 10 4 4 factor analysis two factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 were chosen in table 4 and they accounted for a total of 90 5 of the total variance f1 showed high positive correlations with no3 mg2 so4 2 ca2 cl and ec and a strong negative correlation with ph table 4 consistent with their spatial distribution in figs 3 and 4a and supplementary fig s2 and implying nitrate contamination meanwhile f2 showed high positive correlations with hco3 na and k it was not clear enough to define a single process for f2 because the high positive correlations with hco3 na and k can be caused by water rock interactions or originate from manure wastewater ranjbar and jalali 2012 gilabert alarc√≥n et al 2018 which will be discussed further in section 5 1 factor scores for groundwater samples were plotted in fig 7 with color codes for nitrate hco3 v concentrations and the ratio of hco3 cl with increasing f1 and f2 scores line 1 both nitrate and hco3 tended to increase whereas both hco3 cl and v decreased samples collected immediately downgradient of the leakage cave w 026 were plotted at the end of this trend fig 7 in contrast samples with low nitrate concentrations i e hm 01 and hm 02 had low f1 scores and high f2 scores line 2 in fig 7 these samples had high hco3 cl ratios and v and relatively high hco3 concentrations samples with low hco3 and high nitrate concentrations were found with high f1 scores and low f2 scores line 3 in fig 7 these samples had low hco3 cl ratios and v concentrations 5 discussion major hydrochemical processes in the study area were discussed using the fa result section 5 1 and then the nitrate source was identified based on the Œ¥15nno3 values section 5 2 lastly a source shift was discussed with groundwater ages and n production with time and the contribution of manure was estimated as of 2015 2018 in section 5 3 5 1 major hydrochemical processes using fa groundwater samples were distributed in three directions in the score plot fig 7 each direction 1 2 and 3 represents nitrate contamination by manure water rock interaction and nitrate contamination by plant farming respectively seawater intrusion was excluded because of no progress to the na cl type by seawater intrusion in fig 3 rather the na cl type groundwater had high no3 concentrations also the cl so4 2 ratio over the whole groundwater samples n 172 was 1 71 and significantly different from the cl so4 2 ratio of seawater 19 06 hounslow 1995 these results imply that salinization by seawater intrusion was negligible in the study area probably due to the impermeable seogwipo formation at shallow depths in western jeju island it should be noted that hco3 and the ratio of hco3 cl were used to discriminate a contamination source among manure and ammonium fertilizer in fig 7 since cl can be an indicator of either manure or ammonium fertilizer when seawater effects are absent koh et al 2007 jung et al 2014 while hco3 can be derived from manure or water rock interaction but rarely from fertilizer jung et al 2014 gilabert alarc√≥n et al 2018 thus low hco3 cl values despite high hco3 concentrations indicate that the groundwater samples are affected by manure 5 1 1 natural water mafic rock interaction high v and hco3 cl values and low nitrate concentrations along line 2 indicate that the hydrochemistry of these samples mostly from hm 01 and hm 02 were derived from water rock interactions ph na and k also increased along line 2 table 4 implying the weathering of rock forming minerals in the aquifer natural groundwater chemistry in volcanic rocks is controlled by the chemical weathering of major silicates and volcanic glass hearn et al 1985 koh et al 2005 2007 which increases alkalinity ph and cations concentrations hearn et al 1985 koh et al 2009 also high v concentrations in groundwater are known to be an indicator of prolonged water mafic rock interaction wright et al 2010 2014 hyun et al 2016 on the other hand the increase of these hydrochemical variables during the weathering process leads to the precipitation of secondary minerals e g iron magnesium smectite calcite amorphous iron oxyhydroxide clinoptilolite and removes ca2 and mg2 from the solution hearn et al 1985 for this reason the groundwater samples with low nitrate concentrations and high ph showed the na k hco3 facies in fig 3 based on this result hm 01 and hm 02 in the coastal area rectangle symbols in figs 3 to 7 can be considered pristine groundwater in the study area because they contained the lowest nitrate concentrations 2 mg l and highest ph 8 6 and 8 7 respectively in fig 3 and supplementary table s3 and showed the na hco3 facies in fig 3 Œ¥15nno3 within the soil n in fig 5 and the oldest groundwater ages in fig 6 reflecting the recharge through a long and deep pathway also the depth of these two wells 60 to 70 m below sea level was much deeper than the other wells median of 30 m below sea level 5 1 2 nitrate contamination by manure wastewater and plant farming progression along line 1 shows high no3 and hco3 but low hco3 cl fig 7 in the forest and grassland below 150 m a s l fig 4a supplementary fig s4 note that land use was defined by the most widely distributed land use type within 500 m around each well and thus no well belonged to a livestock facility in supplementary fig s4 as well as in fig 8 because of the point distribution of livestock facilities fig 1b it can be concluded that line 1 represents nitrate contamination by manure for the following reasons 1 the inflow of manure increases nitrate chloride and hco3 in groundwater ranjbar and jalali 2012 kim et al 2015 gilabert alarc√≥n et al 2018 and thus decreases hco3 cl values despite the high hco3 2 livestock facilities were located near the forest and grassland fig 1b and 3 groundwater samples from the forest and grassland downgradient of the leakage cave had high Œ¥15nno3values and nitrate concentrations fig 4 meanwhile the concentrations of na and hco3 decreased i e negative f2 scores in table 4 while nitrate increased along line 3 in the agricultural area fig 7 and supplementary fig s4 the low na and hco3 concentrations but high nitrate concentrations in line 3 represent nitrate contamination by plant farming na is a useful indicator of n rich organic effluents such as livestock wastewater and septic tank effluent because the animal human organic effluents have more na contents than other nitrate sources such as chemical fertilizers ranjbar and jalali 2012 minet et al 2017 in addition synthetic ammonium fertilizer contains lower organic contents than manure and thus the hco3 i e the final oxidation product of organic compounds loads from plant farming are lower than that from livestock farming activities similarly a previous study conducted in an agricultural area of jeju island showed that na k and hco3 had a negative correlation with nitrate which was explained by the fact that nitrate came from plant farming jung et al 2014 in sum the positive f1 loading indicates nitrate contamination by either manure or plant farming the high negative correlation between ph and nitrate f1 in table 4 fig 3 indicates that nitrate in groundwater originated from the nitrification process of ammonium released from manures and or ammonium fertilizers along lines 1 and 3 respectively consistent with the result of Œ¥18ono3 fig 5 when nitrifying bacteria oxidize nh4 to nitrate in the oxic condition protons h are released to groundwater havlin et al 1999 b√∂hlke 2002 the nitrate contamination caused the increase of mg2 so4 2 ca2 cl and tds as well as the decrease of ph f1 in table 4 supplementary fig s2 these compositional changes may occur with increasing nitrate concentrations for the following two reasons first the dissolution of manures and agrochemicals such as synthetic ammonium fertilizers generally elevates the concentrations of ca2 mg2 so4 2 and cl in groundwater straatman 1989 b√∂hlke 2002 kim et al 2009 second enhanced weathering is another reason for the hydrochemical change according to kim et al 2019 groundwater with high nitrate concentrations has a higher molar ratio of ca2 mg2 to hco3 than groundwater controlled by natural weathering because of enhanced weathering through nitrification fig 3 shows that the proportion of ca2 and mg2 increased in the study area with the decreasing proportion of hco3 and ph and increasing nitrate 5 2 nitrate sources of groundwater based on the Œ¥15nno3 values in fig 5 manure is the dominant source of groundwater nitrate while nitrified ammonium fertilizer and soil n seem to be a minor source in the hanlim area as of 2015 2018 however soil n can be excluded from nitrate sources for contaminated gw n 55 in table 2 because of low nitrate concentrations up to 6 8 ppm mostly 5 ppm past√©n zapata et al 2014 meghdadi and javar 2018 the Œ¥15nno3 values within the range for manure in the study area table 2 fig 5 were different from those in the range of ammonium fertilizers in hankyeong and daejeong in jeju in 2017 kim et al 2019 whose median Œ¥15nno3 value was 4 6 and 5 lower than that of hanlim in fig 5 this difference is consistent with the major land use or anthropogenic nitrate source in groundwater in each district since hankyeong and daejeong have larger proportions of agricultural land than hanlim by about 10 whereas n production from livestock farming in those areas is only 16 8 and 21 6 of that from hanlim respectively it should be noted that a previous study in the study area hanlim showed that all Œ¥15nno3 values in groundwater collected from the agriculture area in 2002 were in the range of the ammonium fertilizer 2 8 to 3 4 n 8 choung et al 2004 however only two groundwater samples of a total of 55 contaminated gw had Œ¥15nno3values within the fertilizer both 5 5 while the other groundwater samples had Œ¥15nno3values in the range of manure figs 4b and 5 as of 2015 2018 which indicates the shift of groundwater nitrate contaminationsource from chemical fertilizer to livestock manure over about a decade probably due to intensive livestock farming and inefficient manure wastewater management which will be discussed in section 5 3 1 meanwhile the effect of fertilizers still seemed non negligible given the Œ¥15nno3 values in the overlapping field between sources in fig 5 indicating the mixing of different sources which will be quantified in section 5 3 2 5 3 temporal change of groundwater nitrate levels and sources 5 3 1 groundwater nitrate levels in relation to the increasing livestock industry both nitrate concentrations and Œ¥15nno3 values increase as the groundwater is young similar to the increasing trend of n production from livestock farming in figs 2 and 6 in fig 2 the apparent groundwater age data in fig 6 were categorized in 10 year intervals e g 1955 to 1965 and the median values of groundwater nitrate concentrations top and Œ¥15nno3 values bottom in each interval were compared with the n production data for each interval because of different time intervals as a result the temporal change of nitrate concentrations and Œ¥15nno3 values showed high positive correlations with the historical change of n production from livestock farming r 0 93 and r 0 84 respectively groundwater recharged between 1955 and 1965 had a lower median nitrate concentration 1 8 mg l than the natural threshold value and the median Œ¥15nno3value 4 9 within the range of ammonium fertilizers and far away from the Œ¥15n range of manure indicating the minor impact of livestock farming the median nitrate concentrations in groundwater recharged between 1965 and 1975 were 6 7 mg l and increased by 5 mg l compared to the previous period the median Œ¥15nno3 was 6 6 within the Œ¥15n range of manure indicating that groundwater began to be affected by manure with intensive livestock farming in the 1970s as n production from livestock farming increased exponentially from the 1980s to the 1990s the median nitrate concentrations in groundwater increased to 42 1 mg l close to the dws 44 3 mg l no3 indicating that groundwater recharged during this period was heavily contaminated by nitrate the median value of Œ¥15nno3 in this period was 9 2 indicating that the major source of nitrate was livestock farming 5 3 2 apportionment of illegal dumping in nitrate contamination as of 2015 2018 previous studies on the relationship between groundwater nitrate levels and surface n loadings showed that n production from livestock farming is likely to infiltrate underground with the application of liquid organic fertilizers illegal discharges of manure wastewater and manure piles nikolenko et al 2018 the severe nitrate contamination in the study area as of 2015 2018 seemed to be related to the illegal dumping of manure wastewater in the leakage cave until 2015 based on the spatial distribution of high nitrate concentrations and Œ¥15nno3 values downgradient of the leakage cave fig 4 thus the contribution of illegal dumping to groundwater nitrate contamination was quantified by the bayesian isotope mixing model for the groundwater samples whose nitrate exceeded the natural threshold n 53 excluding two samples from w 026 the 53 groundwater samples were divided into three groups based on land use forest and grassland n 21 agricultural area n 28 and public facilities n 4 as in supplementary fig s4 since the land use did not change over the 50 years the two groundwater samples from w 026 were used to define an end member i e the illegal dumping until 2015 in table 5 because of their highest nitrate concentrations and Œ¥15nno3 levels fig 5 and a relatively young cfc age fig 6 and having neither Œ¥15nno3 nor cfc data from sm 01 nearest to the leakage cave fig 1a also groundwater samples from w 026 were plotted at the end of line 1 indicating that w 026 was affected by manure fig 7 moreover the manure samples collected in the study area had lower Œ¥15n values than the groundwater samples from the w 026 well table 2 probably due to the isotopic enrichment process manure preferentially loses 14n leaving residual ammonium enriched in 15n relative to the source material during volatilization choi et al 2003 the Œ¥15n value of the manure wastewater illegally dumped until 2015 was expected to be similar to or higher than the Œ¥15n values 19 7 and 24 3 of the groundwater samples from the w 026 well another end member was characterized using three synthetic ammonium fertilizer samples obtained in the study area based on Œ¥15nno3 levels in groundwater in fig 5 and the land use of the study area in fig 1b according to ji et al 2017 denitrification can cause errors in bayesian inference techniques however denitrification could be excluded in this study because there were no negative relationships between Œ¥15n and nitrate concentrations supplementary fig s3 probably because of oxic conditions do 3 5 mg l table 1 through fast infiltration and large porosity koh et al 2007 2009 which made Œªk and œÑk in eq 1 not needed in table 5 other sources e g soil n and precipitation were excluded due to low concentrations of nitrate song et al 2016 past√©n zapata et al 2014 meghdadi and javar 2018 compared to the two sources i e w 026 and fertilizers and 53 groundwater samples as a result the contributions of manure were in a range from 33 5 to 81 8 n 53 the groundwater samples n 21 collected from the forest and grassland showed higher contributions of manure wastewater than those from the agricultural area fig 8 this result supports groundwater nitrate contamination by manure in the forest and grassland the trend 1 in fig 7 supplementary fig s4 and by plant farming in the agricultural land the trend 3 in fig 7 supplementary fig s4 while the major source shifted to livestock farming fertilizers seemed to still significantly affect the groundwater quality in agricultural areas as of 2015 2018 6 conclusion and suggestions hydrochemical processes and nitrate sources in groundwater were assessed in hanlim jeju island where intensive livestock farming began in the 1970s and illegal manure wastewater dumping in a lava cave was revealed in 2015 also the aquifer is vulnerable to surface contaminants due to the high permeability of volcanic rocks to identify nitrate sources factor analysis and land use were combined with the n and o isotopic analysis of nitrate a bayesian isotope mixing model was applied to quantify the contribution of illegal dumping in groundwater samples chlorofluorocarbons cfcs were assessed to estimate groundwater ages the study results showed that the hydrochemistry of groundwater varied widely from na hco3 type to ca mg cl no3 type with increasing no3 concentrations and decreasing ph suggesting anthropogenic n inputs and nitrification consistent with the Œ¥18ono3 values in groundwater factor analysis summarized the major hydrochemical processes in the study area as water rock interaction and nitrate contamination by fertilizer and manure the spatial distribution of Œ¥15nno3 and nitrate levels in groundwater suggested that the major source of nitrate contamination was manure wastewater illegally dumped in the lava cave as of 2015 2018 accounting for 33 5 81 8 of groundwater nitrate in addition apparent groundwater ages ranged between 54 years 1961 and 23 5 years 1991 5 and the younger groundwater had higher nitrate levels and Œ¥15nno3 values which implied the shift of a major nitrate source from fertilizer to livestock manure in the deep groundwater median well depth of 156 8 m below ground surface due to the increased n production from intensive livestock farming since the 1970s illegal manure wastewater discharge and high hydraulic conductivity the apparent age of the youngest groundwater of 23 5 years 1991 5 in the study area suggests that the current groundwater nitrate contamination originated from anthropogenic activities before the 1990s the time lag between human activities and groundwater contamination can be explained by the legacy effect also the temporal change in n pollution sources and the increase in groundwater nitrate levels with time demonstrate that the groundwater management of the hanlim area is inadequate based on the legacy effect and the inadequate groundwater management the high n production as of today will exacerbate groundwater nitrate contamination over the next several decades thus long term 25 years groundwater management practices are required to decrease n loads in hanlim because it takes time for management practices to take effect due to the legacy n the study results are a good reference for future studies to assess legacy problems in regions where a similar n source shift to livestock farming is expected as the livestock industry has been expanded and intensified from traditional grazing to meet the need for meat besides the combined use of hydrochemical parameters no dual isotopes groundwater age data factor analysis and historical n production to identify n sources and evaluate the time lag of an individual n source can be applied to many other regions in the world where multiple n sources exist

17223,time lags between anthropogenic nitrogen inputs and their impacts to nitrate levels cause a misunderstanding for sources and subsequently misguide the groundwater management we investigated the hydrochemical data of groundwater samples n 172 from 49 wells with chlorofluorocarbons cfcs based groundwater age dating and stable n Œ¥15n and o isotopes Œ¥18o of nitrate to assess the legacy effect of livestock farming to groundwater in an agricultural area where intensive livestock farming started in the 1970s and illegal dumping of manure wastewater in a lava cave was revealed in 2015 approximately 90 of the groundwater samples had nitrate concentrations exceeding the natural threshold 5 5 mg l no3 for nitrate contamination and 34 exceeded the world health organization s guideline for drinking water quality 44 3 mg l indicating severe nitrate contamination the Œ¥15nno3 values 5 5 to 24 3 in groundwater exceeding the threshold of nitrate showed that livestock manure was a major nitrate source while ammonium fertilizer also seemed influential given the Œ¥15nno3 values in the overlapping fields of n sources factor analysis of hydrochemical data also supported nitrate contamination by manure as well as by plant farming in the study area based on the spatial distribution of nitrate levels and Œ¥15nno3 livestock farming affected nitrate contamination by illegal manure dumping in the leakage cave according to a bayesian mixing model the contribution of manure wastewater was 33 5 to 81 8 as of 2015 2018 with the rest from fertilizers meanwhile the groundwater ages showed negative correlations with both nitrate levels r 0 90 and Œ¥15nno3 values r 0 74 on a log scale consistent with the increasing n release from livestock farming since the 1960s in particular the median value of Œ¥15nno3 rapidly increased to 9 2 in groundwater recharged between the late 1970s and early 1990s when n production exponentially increased implying a significant effect of livestock farming after the 1980s groundwater quality is expected to deteriorate over the next several decades based on the groundwater ages 23 5 years the increased n production from livestock farming and the legacy effect of n long term groundwater management plans 25 years are required to decrease n loads in the study area because it takes time for management practices to take effect the study results are a good reference for groundwater management in regions with a source shift to livestock farming under intensive livestock production systems moreover the chronological study using historical n production groundwater age data and dual nitrate isotopes can be applied to other regions with multiple n sources and their shifting for identifying sources and estimating time lags graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater nitrate water management livestock farming legacy effect cfcs dating and dual nitrate isotopes 1 introduction as plant cultivation and livestock farming increase for food production along with the exponential growth in the world s population in recent decades anthropogenic nitrogen n inputs have soared galloway et al 2003 specifically the n input to the landmass increased globally from 54 to 89 tg n yr 1 between 1900 and 1950 and up to 248 tg n yr 1 in 2000 including n fertilizer 83 tg n yr 1 and n manure 92 tg n yr 1 bouwman et al 2013 the n input rates are higher than the n output rates e g natural attenuation and thus n has accumulated in the environment and altered the global n cycle galloway et al 2008 schlesinger 2009 moreover excessive n inputs deteriorate water quality which has emerged as a global environmental problem in particular nitrate levels in water have been constantly increasing in many countries with increasing anthropogenic n inputs eea 2000 katz et al 2001 nolan and hitt 2006 dubrovsky et al 2010 howden et al 2010 sutton et al 2011 for instance nitrate levels in groundwater wells in agricultural areas are about three times the national background level of nitrate 3 1 mg l in the united states dubrovsky et al 2010 ward et al 2018 similarly 25 of groundwater wells in the european union are in poor chemical status due to excessive n inputs from agriculture and livestock farming activities eea 2000 for the sustainability of freshwater resources it is urgent to establish efficient n management practices however there are difficulties in establishing an effective management policy for groundwater quality mainly for the following reasons 1 large amounts of anthropogenic n are loaded via nonpoint source pollution which causes spatial inconsistencies between sources and polluted sites and makes it difficult to identify sources liu et al 2005 2 several sources are mixed in a small area especially in intensive agro farming areas including south korea choi et al 2003 minet et al 2017 and 3 there are time lags between n inputs and groundwater contamination called legacy effects van meter et al 2018 vero et al 2018 for example more than 50 of nitrate exported from the mississippi river gulf of mexico watershed is 30 years of age and only 25 is 5 years due to the legacy of n sources within the watershed van meter et al 2018 groundwater nitrate concentrations result from present day or historical anthropogenic n inputs depending on hydro bio geological conditions and source characteristics for instance n sources can lead to a hydrological time lag e g time spent traveling along slow transport pathways or a biogeochemical time lag via denitrification or accumulation in the root zone of agricultural soils the time gap between inputs and nitrate contamination continues to cause nitrate contamination and delays the achievement of nutrient management practices howden et al 2010 erostate et al 2018 vero et al 2018 and moreover causes a misunderstanding for sources and subsequently misguide the groundwater management thus the legacy problem should be dealt with when interpreting the groundwater nitrate contamination and the time lag must be assessed for sustainable groundwater management however it is challenging to assess the n legacy due to little information to link the time of n inputs to the time for the n to reach groundwater as well as uncertainties for the subsurface environment condition it becomes more challenging when multiple n sources exist or shift with time e g from plant farming to livestock farming to discriminate nitrate sources among potential sources n and oxygen o isotopic ranges for each source have been identified and applied for source identification choi et al 2007 xue et al 2009 furthermore the dual no isotope approach has been used to provide information on biogeochemical processes such as denitrification nitrification and ammonia volatilization kendall 1998 xue et al 2009 minet et al 2017 despite this usefulness however the dual no isotope approach has limitations such as 1 the overlap of isotopic ranges among different nitrate sources and 2 isotopic fractionations accompanied by biogeochemical reactions e g denitrification xue et al 2009 hosono et al 2013 minet et al 2017 recently the dual no isotope approach has been combined with land use jin et al 2012 hydrochemical data past√©n zapata et al 2014 kim et al 2015 and multivariate statistical analysis jung et al 2014 meghdadi and javar 2018 to improve its effectiveness as for the time lag between n inputs and nitrate levels of groundwater groundwater ages have been studied with nitrate contaminatio b√∂hlke and denver 1995 katz et al 2001 b√∂hlke 2002 morgenstern et al 2012 taufiq et al 2019 groundwater ages provide information on recharge timing residence time and groundwater pathway kolbe et al 2016 koh et al 2018 mar√ßais et al 2018 these pieces of information help assess the response of an aquifer to n inputs and estimate future nitrate contamination in combination with historical n inputs puckett et al 2011 erostate et al 2018 chambers et al 2019 however most of the chronological studies on n inputs and nitrate contamination have been focused on total n or plant farming e g puckett et al 2011 vero et al 2018 whereas few have applied groundwater age data and focused on livestock farming although the n production from livestock farming keeps increasing in many countries including canada new zealand south korea spain and the united states oecd 2019 for instance the n production from the livestock industry in south korea increased by 26 between 1990 1992 and 2002 2004 oecd 2008 and has exceeded n from plant farming since 2008 oecd 2019 it is required to establish management practices for the livestock derived n with considering its legacy effect in the regions with intensive livestock farms thus we assessed nitrate levels and stable n and o isotopes of nitrate in groundwater with groundwater ages and the history of livestock farming to understand the impact of livestock farming on groundwater nitrate contamination with time on the volcanic island of jeju in south korea in which groundwater is the only water resource and intensive livestock farming began in the 1970s in particular the impact of illegal dumping of manure wastewater in a lava cave until 2015 was evaluated specifically the present study aimed 1 to identify a source shift of nitrate contamination in groundwater 2 to quantify the contribution of a major source i e illegal manure wastewater dumping as of 2015 2018 3 to find the temporal relationship between n production from livestock farming and nitrate contamination and ultimately to assess a time gap between n inputs and nitrate levels in groundwater and 4 to suggest groundwater management based on the legacy effect the results of this study can provide valuable information for future policies to regulate livestock facilities for the conservation of drinking water quality in regions with a similar source shift due to intensive animal farming e g concentrated animal feeding operations moreover the combined use of hydrochemical parameters no dual isotopes groundwater age dating and the historical data of n production to assess a time lag can be applied to other regions with multiple n sources and their shifting 2 study area the hanlim region 91 09 km2 is located in the northwestern part of jeju island south korea fig 1 a groundwater flows from the southeast high altitude area to the northwest shoreline similar to the topography in fig 1d lava caves are distributed in the forest and grassland along the groundwater flow path toward the coast fig 1b the daily precipitation measured at the youngsil 869 weather station located at 1260 m above sea level a s l fig 1a and the groundwater water level gwl at four monitoring wells installed by the jeju special self governing province fig 1d are compared in fig 1c which shows the relatively fast response of water level to precipitation as reported before in the study area won et al 2006 2 1 jeju island jeju island was formed by volcanic activities during the pleistocene and holocene epochs won et al 2006 and volcanic rocks cover more than 90 of the surface koh et al 2006 the volcanic rocks include interflow structures e g clinker lava tubes and tunnels formed by a series of lava flows and thus have high permeability according to won et al 2006 hydraulic conductivity is in a wide range from 0 1 m day 1 to 2400 m day 1 with an average of 234 m day 1 due to the high permeability and storage capacity these volcanic rocks act as the main aquifer of the island but also make the aquifer vulnerable to surface contaminants including livestock manure and synthetic fertilizers kim et al 2003 won et al 2006 koh et al 2006 2012 kim et al 2018 also the lava caves can be preferential pathways for contaminants if connected to the surface kiernan et al 2003 according to lee et al 2006 lava caves are a direct recharge point of groundwater on jeju island although studies on the hydrological role of lava caves on the island are still insufficient a sedimentary formation formed by hydrovolcanism called seogwipo formation underlies the volcanic rocks the formation is composed of sand tuffaceous materials fragments of basaltic rocks and molluscan shells sohn et al 2003 acts as an impermeable layer because of relatively low permeability kim et al 2003 won et al 2006 and has an average thickness of 100 m a u formation and bedrock layer underlie the seogwipo formation and they consist of unconsolidated sand and granite respectively koh 1997 jeong et al 2016 aquifers on jeju island are classified into three types perched basal and parabasal groundwater koh 1997 choung et al 2004 the study area shows all three types choung et al 2004 but mostly parabasal groundwater over the impermeable seogwipo formation because the study area meets the impermeable seogwipo formation at shallow depths 37 100 m below sea level koh et al 2012 jung et al 2014 perched groundwater is present in the impervious layer in the unsaturated zone and develops predominantly in the mid to high altitude areas while basal groundwater is distributed in the coastal area and lies on the saltwater due to the density difference the annual mean temperature and precipitation of jeju island ranged from 14 9 to 16 3 c and from 735 5 to 1874 5 mm yr 1 respectively in 1988 2017 http www kma go kr during the same period the annual groundwater recharge was 1603 6 106 m3 yr 1 corresponding to 40 58 of precipitation which is 2 7 times higher than that of the south korean peninsula kmolit 2017 jssgp 2018 groundwater recharges mostly from high altitude areas due to high precipitation low evaporation and low runoff in high altitude areas 1200 m a s l park et al 2014 groundwater is the only water resource on the island i e nearly 91 as of 2017 and thus the groundwater use per unit area 360 5 m3 day 1 km2 is more than four times that of the south korean peninsula k water 2018 2 2 land use and manure waste in the study area most of the hanlim area located below 250 m a s l is used for agriculture fig 1b as of 2017 the agricultural area was 40 47 km2 similar to that in the 1960s 41 km2 accounting for 44 of the total area kmafra 2017 chemical fertilizers have been widely applied to the agricultural area causing groundwater nitrate contamination exceeding world health organization who and korean drinking water standards dws 44 3 mg l and its n isotopic compositions between 2 8 and 3 4 choung et al 2004 although their consumption has decreased since 2012 down to 1700 ton year in 2017 jssgp 2018 based on the n isotopic compositions of nitrate the impact of compost on groundwater nitrate contamination seems insignificant since the compost had n isotopic compositions exceeding 15 up to 20 9 in the study area choi 2002 the atmospheric deposition of nitrate also can be excluded given low traffic volumes and no industrial facilities in this area and low nitrate concentrations in the air song et al 2016 livestock facilities are scattered at 100 350 m a s l and in particular are densely located near the geum oreum at an altitude of 250 300 m a s l fig

at 180 m a s l called the leakage cave in fig 1 were revealed in 2015 and more than 8500 tons of manure wastewater were estimated to infiltrate underground jmp 2018 after the illegal discharge was disclosed a monitoring well sm 01 in fig 1a was installed near the leakage cave in 2018 by the korea rural community corporation krc to investigate the contamination of aquifers core samples from two fracture zones 20 and 30 m below ground surface showed traces of contamination see supplementary fig s1 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and sample pretreatment for analysis a total of 172

agricultural farming and the well depths were in the range of 35 to 370 m median depth of 156 8 m below the ground surface groundwater samples were filtered through 0 45 Œºm cellulose membranes and then transferred to pre washed hdpe bottles for the analysis of dissolved ions samples for major cations were acidified to decrease ph 2 by adding a few drops of ultrapure nitric acid additionally 63

whole study area also two manure samples cow and pig respectively and three synthetic ammonium fertilizers were obtained in march 2018 to identify the isotopic characteristics of potential nitrate sources in the study area ten grams of wet manure samples were diluted to 100 ml while one gram of fertilizer samples was diluted to 200 ml with deionized water kleinman et al 2002 these diluted samples were filtered through 0 45 Œºm cellulose membranes before isotopic analysis in october 2015 and may 2018 23 groundwater samples and their duplicates were collected in 60 ml borosilicate glass bottles for the analysis of cfcs sampling locations were selected along the groundwater flow path from the leakage cave to the shoreline based on the hydrochemical analysis results samples highly contaminated with nitrate and ones with little contamination were evenly selected for cfc analysis the bottles were placed in a 1 l beaker and filled with groundwater until the bottles overflowed

facilities on the island koh et al 2006 also showed that monthly monitoring results of atmospheric cfcs on the island corresponded to those of north america averages of a sample and its duplicate were provided as a representative value 3 3 factor analysis and bayesian isotope mixing model factor analysis fa was conducted to determine the hydrochemical processes controlling groundwater quality in the study area using major ions cl no3 so4 2 ca2 mg2 na k and field parameters ph ec hco3 fa is a multivariate statistical technique that extracts a small number of latent variables called factors that can describe the whole dataset with minimal loss of original information park 2000 jiang et al 2009 a correlation matrix of all hydrochemical variables is calculated and factors are then extracted from a linear combination of the original variables for this study fa was performed by using ibm spss statistics 25 software all hydrochemical variables except ph were log transformed and then standardized to reduce the impact of outliers factors were extracted using the principal components method in the spss software and based on eigenvalues greater than 1 and then rotated through varimax rotation kaiser 1958 liu et al 2003 to make it easy to interpret the original variables major hydrochemical processes were assessed based on the correlations between each factor and hydrochemical variables and the factor scores of groundwater samples a bayesian isotope mixing model was implemented using Œ¥15nno3 and the siar stable isotope analysis in r package to quantify the contribution of illegal dumping in the leakage cave until 2015 to groundwater nitrate contamination in the study area fig 1 the bayesian isotope mixing model is effective in quantifying the proportional contribution pk of source k at sample i and has been widely used to evaluate the contribution of each pollutant in a complex system with several sources kim et al 2015 meghdadi et al 2018

172 groundwater samples are shown in table 1 with percentiles we used the 10th and 90th percentiles instead of minimum and maximum values when describing the contamination status to exclude extreme values near the leakage cave tds ranged from 123 4 mg l 10th percentile to 314 3 mg l 90th percentile while nitrate concentrations ranged from 5 8 mg l 10th percentile to 80 5 mg l 90th percentile the highest nitrate concentration was observed close to the leakage cave 370 1 mg l in 2018 at sm 01 followed by 174 1 mg l in 2017 at w 026 immediately downgradient of the leakage cave approximately 90 of the groundwater samples had nitrate concentrations exceeding the natural threshold 5 5 mg l no3 koh et al 2009 for nitrate contamination on jeju island while 34 exceeded the dws 44 3 mg l indicating severe nitrate contamination groundwater samples were continuously distributed from na hco3to ca mg cl no3 type fig 3 the most abundant hydrochemical facies was the ca mg cl no3 type n 78 45 3 whose median no3 was 50 1 mg l and average ph was 7 5 then the na hco3 type n 64 37 2 median no3 8 0 mg l average ph 8 2 ca mg hco3 type n 20 11 6 median no3 31 2 mg l average ph 7 8 and na cl type n 10 5 8 median no3 30 5 mg l average ph 8 0 were observed it is noticeable that the na hco3 facies was contained in groundwater samples with low nitrate concentrations and high ph fig 3 consistent with the hydrochemistry of pristine groundwater on jeju island known as na hco3 type or na mg hco3 type choung et al 2004 koh et al 2005 2009 kim et al 2018 in contrast the nitrate concentration tended to increase while ph decreased with an increasing proportion of mg2 ca2 and cl fig 3 nitrate showed high positive correlations r 0 8 with ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl and ec and a high negative correlation r 0 8 with ph supplementary table s2 4 1 2 groundwater wells seasonal differences were rarely observed in nitrate concentrations e g p 0 05 in the t test between 2015 and 2018 p 0 05 in the mann whitney u test between 2017 and 2018 furthermore w 026 145 30 3 mg l no3 n 6 and f 132 81 7 2 2 mg l no3 n 6 which were relatively enriched in nitrate and repeatedly measured in 2017 showed little temporal variations thus hydrochemical data including nitrate concentrations were averaged for each well fig 4 a and supplementary table s3 as a result the range of nitrate concentrations was from 1 7 to 370 1 mg l depending on the well almost all the wells had nitrate concentrations exceeding the natural threshold 5 5 mg l on jeju island except for six wells fig 4a supplementary table s3 moreover more than 24 of the wells 12 of the total 49 wells cw dyp f 132 f 206 f 242 f 246 jc 04 s 004 si sm 01 w 026 y 036 in figs 1a and 4a had nitrate concentrations exceeding the dws which indicates that the groundwater in the hanlim region has been severely contaminated by nitrate groundwater wells with high nitrate concentrations were mostly located downgradient of the leakage cave in the northwest area fig 4a the well located immediately downgradient of the leakage cave w 026 diamond symbols in figs 3 and 4 and hereafter showed the highest nitrate concentration following sm 01 meanwhile the range of nitrate concentrations was from 5 4 to 31 1 mg l median 8 9 mg l no3 n 11 in the southeast area upgradient of the leakage cave and lower than the median nitrate concentration in the region 31 9 mg l in table 1 the lowest concentrations were observed in the wells hm 01 1 7 mg l no3 and hm 02 1 9 mg l no3 in the coastal area which are used for pumping groundwater for liquor production the spatial distribution of cl so4 2 ec and tds also showed similar spatial patterns to nitrate in supplementary fig s2 4 2 stable n and o isotopes of 63 groundwater samples analyzed for nitrate isotopes 55 samples showed nitrate concentrations exceeding the natural threshold 5 5 mg l and are called contaminated gw in table 2 the Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values of nitrate in groundwater were in the range of 4 6 to 24 3 table 2 and 0 4 to 6 5 table 3 respectively during denitrification Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values increase with a slope of 1 1 3 to 1 2 with decreasing nitrate concentrations ji et al 2017 minet et al 2017 but this trend was not shown in the study area supplementary fig s3 4 2 1 Œ¥18o of nitrate the Œ¥18o values of nitrate Œ¥18ono3 produced through nitrification are assumed to be within 10 to 10 based on the Œ¥18o of precipitation Œ¥18oh2o precipitation in the world kendall 1998 xue et al 2009 this wide range of Œ¥18ono3 is used in the dual no isotope approach to assess the origin of nitrate and biogeochemical processes we narrowed down the theoretical range of Œ¥18ono3 through nitrification Œ¥18ono3 nitrification using the Œ¥18oh2o precipitation values of jeju in table 3 as 2 Œ¥ 18 o no 3 nitrification 1 3 Œ¥ 18 o o 2 atmospheric 2 3 Œ¥ 18 o h 2 o precipitation where Œ¥18oo2 atmospheric is the Œ¥18o of o2 in the atmospheric air and was assumed to be 23 5 kendall 1998 xue et al 2009 while Œ¥18oh2o precipitation is the Œ¥18o of precipitation on jeju island and was obtained from lee et al 2003 n 109 and ryuh 2017 n 167 eq 2 indicates that nitrifying bacteria couples two oxygen atoms from ambient water and an oxygen atom from atmospheric o2 with an n atom from ammonium during nitrification kendall 1998 xue et al 2009 as a result the theoretical Œ¥18ono3 nitrification values of the jeju groundwater ranged from 0 9 10th percentile to 5 5 90th percentile table 3 and were much narrower than the typical range reported by kendall 1998 we applied the 10th and 90th percentile for Œ¥18ono3 nitrification in fig 5 following xue et al 2009 a comparison of the theoretical Œ¥18ono3 nitrification calculated for jeju to the measured Œ¥18ono3 in groundwater showed that most groundwater samples were plotted in the theoretical Œ¥18o range of nitrification 0 9 to 5 5 table 3 and fig 5 and far from the general Œ¥18o range of synthetic nitrate fertilizer 17 to 25 or atmospheric nitrate 25 to 75 kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 the Œ¥18ono3 values show that manure soil n and synthetic ammonium fertilizer can be potential sources of nitrate in the hanlim area 4 2 2 Œ¥15n of nitrate and ammonium two manure samples collected from the study area had Œ¥15nnh4 values of 5 1 and 19 1 table 2 within the Œ¥15n range of manure 5 to 25 reported by xue et al 2009 synthetic ammonium fertilizers had values between 3 5 and 1 5 table 2 within the Œ¥15n range of nitrified ammonium fertilizers 6 to 6 reported by xue et al 2009 thus we used the Œ¥15n range reported by xue et al 2009 to determine nitrate sources in groundwater in fig 5 note the overlap of Œ¥15n between three n sources in fig 5 the Œ¥15nno3 values of contaminated gw 5 5 to 24 3 were all within the Œ¥15n range of manure 5 to 25 table 2 fig 5 groundwater samples n 2 collected immediately downgradient of the leakage cave w 026 had the highest Œ¥15nno3values 19 7 in 2018 and 24 3 in 2017 and nitrate concentrations 151 4 mg l in 2018 and 146 0 mg l in 2017 in figs 4 and 5 note that groundwater from sm 01 installed close to the leakage cave was not analyzed for Œ¥15nno3 it should be noted however that the manure source has a wide range of Œ¥15n values and most of the groundwater samples exceeding the natural threshold of nitrate 5 5 mg l were plotted close to the low boundary of the manure range in fig 5 implying mixing with other sources with low Œ¥15n values also the Œ¥15nno3values of two samples from the wells park and s 004 see fig 1a for localities were also in the Œ¥15n range of nitrified ammonium fertilizers 6 to 6 fig 5 these two wells were located in the middle of the agricultural area and the nitrate concentrations for each groundwater sample were 36 4 and 75 5 mg l respectively in contrast eight samples whose nitrate concentrations were below the natural threshold 5 5 mg l including hm 01 and hm 02 had Œ¥15n values within the range of soil n 0 to 8 except for one sample hh see fig 1a for locality that was 8 5 despite the low nitrate concentration 4 7 mg l in march 2018 in fact the other two samples from the hh well had high no3 18 5 mg l in october 2015 17 4 mg l in may 2018 an average of 13 5 mg l for three samples in supplementary table s3 implying anthropogenic nitrate contamination in hh moreover the other samples were also plotted in the overlapping zone of fertilizer soil n and manure in fig 5 indicating the possibility of anthropogenic n effects 4 3 cfcs age dating the recharge temperature of rainfall is needed to derive a reasonable apparent age of groundwater chambers et al 2019 because the solubility of atmospheric cfcs varies with temperature thus the recharge temperature was estimated using air temperature data obtained in 2016 2018 n 1089 from the youngsil 869 weather station fig 1a since groundwater recharges mostly from high altitude areas park et al 2014 a precipitation weighted average temperature of 13 15 c was obtained as 3 precipitation weighted average t e m p e r a t u r e p r e c i p i t a t i o n p r e c i p i t a t i o n and used in fig 6 and supplementary table s4 as the recharge temperature considering that rainfall on jeju island is controlled by monsoons and concentrated in summer based on cfc 12 apparent groundwater ages ranged between 54 years 1961 and 23 5 years 1991 5 almost half the groundwater samples were 30 years of age hm 01 and hm 02 near the coastline had the oldest groundwater ages the apparent age of the youngest groundwater was 23 5 years 1991 5 similar to the previous results on jeju island koh et al 2006 2018 we selected cfc 12 in this study to determine the apparent age of groundwater because cfc 12 has higher stability against degradation and is less contaminated during sampling than cfc 11 or cfc 113 plummer and bunsenberg 2000 koh et al 2018 the younger groundwater had higher nitrate concentrations fig 6a specifically nitrate concentrations of groundwater recharged before 1970 n 4 were below the natural threshold 5 5 mg l while the nitrate concentrations of groundwater recharged after 1970 n 19 exceeded the threshold value moreover more than half the groundwater samples recharged after the late 1980s six of eleven exceeded the dws 44 3 mg l similar to the nitrate concentrations the younger groundwater had higher Œ¥15nno3 values in fig 6b the Œ¥15nno3 values of groundwater recharged before 1972 were less than 7 up to 6 6 while groundwater recharged after 1972 showed that Œ¥15nno3 values increased by more than 2 9 two groundwater samples recharged after the late 1980s f 242 in 1987 and w 026 in 1988 had Œ¥15nno3 values 10 4 4 factor analysis two factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 were chosen in table 4 and they accounted for a total of 90 5 of the total variance f1 showed high positive correlations with no3 mg2 so4 2 ca2 cl and ec and a strong negative correlation with ph table 4 consistent with their spatial distribution in figs 3 and 4a and supplementary fig s2 and implying nitrate contamination meanwhile f2 showed high positive correlations with hco3 na and k it was not clear enough to define a single process for f2 because the high positive correlations with hco3 na and k can be caused by water rock interactions or originate from manure wastewater ranjbar and jalali 2012 gilabert alarc√≥n et al 2018 which will be discussed further in section 5 1 factor scores for groundwater samples were plotted in fig 7 with color codes for nitrate hco3 v concentrations and the ratio of hco3 cl with increasing f1 and f2 scores line 1 both nitrate and hco3 tended to increase whereas both hco3 cl and v decreased samples collected immediately downgradient of the leakage cave w 026 were plotted at the end of this trend fig 7 in contrast samples with low nitrate concentrations i e hm 01 and hm 02 had low f1 scores and high f2 scores line 2 in fig 7 these samples had high hco3 cl ratios and v and relatively high hco3 concentrations samples with low hco3 and high nitrate concentrations were found with high f1 scores and low f2 scores line 3 in fig 7 these samples had low hco3 cl ratios and v concentrations 5 discussion major hydrochemical processes in the study area were discussed using the fa result section 5 1 and then the nitrate source was identified based on the Œ¥15nno3 values section 5 2 lastly a source shift was discussed with groundwater ages and n production with time and the contribution of manure was estimated as of 2015 2018 in section 5 3 5 1 major hydrochemical processes using fa groundwater samples were distributed in three directions in the score plot fig 7 each direction 1 2 and 3 represents nitrate contamination by manure water rock interaction and nitrate contamination by plant farming respectively seawater intrusion was excluded because of no progress to the na cl type by seawater intrusion in fig 3 rather the na cl type groundwater had high no3 concentrations also the cl so4 2 ratio over the whole groundwater samples n 172 was 1 71 and significantly different from the cl so4 2 ratio of seawater 19 06 hounslow 1995 these results imply that salinization by seawater intrusion was negligible in the study area probably due to the impermeable seogwipo formation at shallow depths in western jeju island it should be noted that hco3 and the ratio of hco3 cl were used to discriminate a contamination source among manure and ammonium fertilizer in fig 7 since cl can be an indicator of either manure or ammonium fertilizer when seawater effects are absent koh et al 2007 jung et al 2014 while hco3 can be derived from manure or water rock interaction but rarely from fertilizer jung et al 2014 gilabert alarc√≥n et al 2018 thus low hco3 cl values despite high hco3 concentrations indicate that the groundwater samples are affected by manure 5 1 1 natural water mafic rock interaction high v and hco3 cl values and low nitrate concentrations along line 2 indicate that the hydrochemistry of these samples mostly from hm 01 and hm 02 were derived from water rock interactions ph na and k also increased along line 2 table 4 implying the weathering of rock forming minerals in the aquifer natural groundwater chemistry in volcanic rocks is controlled by the chemical weathering of major silicates and volcanic glass hearn et al 1985 koh et al 2005 2007 which increases alkalinity ph and cations concentrations hearn et al 1985 koh et al 2009 also high v concentrations in groundwater are known to be an indicator of prolonged water mafic rock interaction wright et al 2010 2014 hyun et al 2016 on the other hand the increase of these hydrochemical variables during the weathering process leads to the precipitation of secondary minerals e g iron magnesium smectite calcite amorphous iron oxyhydroxide clinoptilolite and removes ca2 and mg2 from the solution hearn et al 1985 for this reason the groundwater samples with low nitrate concentrations and high ph showed the na k hco3 facies in fig 3 based on this result hm 01 and hm 02 in the coastal area rectangle symbols in figs 3 to 7 can be considered pristine groundwater in the study area because they contained the lowest nitrate concentrations 2 mg l and highest ph 8 6 and 8 7 respectively in fig 3 and supplementary table s3 and showed the na hco3 facies in fig 3 Œ¥15nno3 within the soil n in fig 5 and the oldest groundwater ages in fig 6 reflecting the recharge through a long and deep pathway also the depth of these two wells 60 to 70 m below sea level was much deeper than the other wells median of 30 m below sea level 5 1 2 nitrate contamination by manure wastewater and plant farming progression along line 1 shows high no3 and hco3 but low hco3 cl fig 7 in the forest and grassland below 150 m a s l fig 4a supplementary fig s4 note that land use was defined by the most widely distributed land use type within 500 m around each well and thus no well belonged to a livestock facility in supplementary fig s4 as well as in fig 8 because of the point distribution of livestock facilities fig 1b it can be concluded that line 1 represents nitrate contamination by manure for the following reasons 1 the inflow of manure increases nitrate chloride and hco3 in groundwater ranjbar and jalali 2012 kim et al 2015 gilabert alarc√≥n et al 2018 and thus decreases hco3 cl values despite the high hco3 2 livestock facilities were located near the forest and grassland fig 1b and 3 groundwater samples from the forest and grassland downgradient of the leakage cave had high Œ¥15nno3values and nitrate concentrations fig 4 meanwhile the concentrations of na and hco3 decreased i e negative f2 scores in table 4 while nitrate increased along line 3 in the agricultural area fig 7 and supplementary fig s4 the low na and hco3 concentrations but high nitrate concentrations in line 3 represent nitrate contamination by plant farming na is a useful indicator of n rich organic effluents such as livestock wastewater and septic tank effluent because the animal human organic effluents have more na contents than other nitrate sources such as chemical fertilizers ranjbar and jalali 2012 minet et al 2017 in addition synthetic ammonium fertilizer contains lower organic contents than manure and thus the hco3 i e the final oxidation product of organic compounds loads from plant farming are lower than that from livestock farming activities similarly a previous study conducted in an agricultural area of jeju island showed that na k and hco3 had a negative correlation with nitrate which was explained by the fact that nitrate came from plant farming jung et al 2014 in sum the positive f1 loading indicates nitrate contamination by either manure or plant farming the high negative correlation between ph and nitrate f1 in table 4 fig 3 indicates that nitrate in groundwater originated from the nitrification process of ammonium released from manures and or ammonium fertilizers along lines 1 and 3 respectively consistent with the result of Œ¥18ono3 fig 5 when nitrifying bacteria oxidize nh4 to nitrate in the oxic condition protons h are released to groundwater havlin et al 1999 b√∂hlke 2002 the nitrate contamination caused the increase of mg2 so4 2 ca2 cl and tds as well as the decrease of ph f1 in table 4 supplementary fig s2 these compositional changes may occur with increasing nitrate concentrations for the following two reasons first the dissolution of manures and agrochemicals such as synthetic ammonium fertilizers generally elevates the concentrations of ca2 mg2 so4 2 and cl in groundwater straatman 1989 b√∂hlke 2002 kim et al 2009 second enhanced weathering is another reason for the hydrochemical change according to kim et al 2019 groundwater with high nitrate concentrations has a higher molar ratio of ca2 mg2 to hco3 than groundwater controlled by natural weathering because of enhanced weathering through nitrification fig 3 shows that the proportion of ca2 and mg2 increased in the study area with the decreasing proportion of hco3 and ph and increasing nitrate 5 2 nitrate sources of groundwater based on the Œ¥15nno3 values in fig 5 manure is the dominant source of groundwater nitrate while nitrified ammonium fertilizer and soil n seem to be a minor source in the hanlim area as of 2015 2018 however soil n can be excluded from nitrate sources for contaminated gw n 55 in table 2 because of low nitrate concentrations up to 6 8 ppm mostly 5 ppm past√©n zapata et al 2014 meghdadi and javar 2018 the Œ¥15nno3 values within the range for manure in the study area table 2 fig 5 were different from those in the range of ammonium fertilizers in hankyeong and daejeong in jeju in 2017 kim et al 2019 whose median Œ¥15nno3 value was 4 6 and 5 lower than that of hanlim in fig 5 this difference is consistent with the major land use or anthropogenic nitrate source in groundwater in each district since hankyeong and daejeong have larger proportions of agricultural land than hanlim by about 10 whereas n production from livestock farming in those areas is only 16 8 and 21 6 of that from hanlim respectively it should be noted that a previous study in the study area hanlim showed that all Œ¥15nno3 values in groundwater collected from the agriculture area in 2002 were in the range of the ammonium fertilizer 2 8 to 3 4 n 8 choung et al 2004 however only two groundwater samples of a total of 55 contaminated gw had Œ¥15nno3values within the fertilizer both 5 5 while the other groundwater samples had Œ¥15nno3values in the range of manure figs 4b and 5 as of 2015 2018 which indicates the shift of groundwater nitrate contaminationsource from chemical fertilizer to livestock manure over about a decade probably due to intensive livestock farming and inefficient manure wastewater management which will be discussed in section 5 3 1 meanwhile the effect of fertilizers still seemed non negligible given the Œ¥15nno3 values in the overlapping field between sources in fig 5 indicating the mixing of different sources which will be quantified in section 5 3 2 5 3 temporal change of groundwater nitrate levels and sources 5 3 1 groundwater nitrate levels in relation to the increasing livestock industry both nitrate concentrations and Œ¥15nno3 values increase as the groundwater is young similar to the increasing trend of n production from livestock farming in figs 2 and 6 in fig 2 the apparent groundwater age data in fig 6 were categorized in 10 year intervals e g 1955 to 1965 and the median values of groundwater nitrate concentrations top and Œ¥15nno3 values bottom in each interval were compared with the n production data for each interval because of different time intervals as a result the temporal change of nitrate concentrations and Œ¥15nno3 values showed high positive correlations with the historical change of n production from livestock farming r 0 93 and r 0 84 respectively groundwater recharged between 1955 and 1965 had a lower median nitrate concentration 1 8 mg l than the natural threshold value and the median Œ¥15nno3value 4 9 within the range of ammonium fertilizers and far away from the Œ¥15n range of manure indicating the minor impact of livestock farming the median nitrate concentrations in groundwater recharged between 1965 and 1975 were 6 7 mg l and increased by 5 mg l compared to the previous period the median Œ¥15nno3 was 6 6 within the Œ¥15n range of manure indicating that groundwater began to be affected by manure with intensive livestock farming in the 1970s as n production from livestock farming increased exponentially from the 1980s to the 1990s the median nitrate concentrations in groundwater increased to 42 1 mg l close to the dws 44 3 mg l no3 indicating that groundwater recharged during this period was heavily contaminated by nitrate the median value of Œ¥15nno3 in this period was 9 2 indicating that the major source of nitrate was livestock farming 5 3 2 apportionment of illegal dumping in nitrate contamination as of 2015 2018 previous studies on the relationship between groundwater nitrate levels and surface n loadings showed that n production from livestock farming is likely to infiltrate underground with the application of liquid organic fertilizers illegal discharges of manure wastewater and manure piles nikolenko et al 2018 the severe nitrate contamination in the study area as of 2015 2018 seemed to be related to the illegal dumping of manure wastewater in the leakage cave until 2015 based on the spatial distribution of high nitrate concentrations and Œ¥15nno3 values downgradient of the leakage cave fig 4 thus the contribution of illegal dumping to groundwater nitrate contamination was quantified by the bayesian isotope mixing model for the groundwater samples whose nitrate exceeded the natural threshold n 53 excluding two samples from w 026 the 53 groundwater samples were divided into three groups based on land use forest and grassland n 21 agricultural area n 28 and public facilities n 4 as in supplementary fig s4 since the land use did not change over the 50 years the two groundwater samples from w 026 were used to define an end member i e the illegal dumping until 2015 in table 5 because of their highest nitrate concentrations and Œ¥15nno3 levels fig 5 and a relatively young cfc age fig 6 and having neither Œ¥15nno3 nor cfc data from sm 01 nearest to the leakage cave fig 1a also groundwater samples from w 026 were plotted at the end of line 1 indicating that w 026 was affected by manure fig 7 moreover the manure samples collected in the study area had lower Œ¥15n values than the groundwater samples from the w 026 well table 2 probably due to the isotopic enrichment process manure preferentially loses 14n leaving residual ammonium enriched in 15n relative to the source material during volatilization choi et al 2003 the Œ¥15n value of the manure wastewater illegally dumped until 2015 was expected to be similar to or higher than the Œ¥15n values 19 7 and 24 3 of the groundwater samples from the w 026 well another end member was characterized using three synthetic ammonium fertilizer samples obtained in the study area based on Œ¥15nno3 levels in groundwater in fig 5 and the land use of the study area in fig 1b according to ji et al 2017 denitrification can cause errors in bayesian inference techniques however denitrification could be excluded in this study because there were no negative relationships between Œ¥15n and nitrate concentrations supplementary fig s3 probably because of oxic conditions do 3 5 mg l table 1 through fast infiltration and large porosity koh et al 2007 2009 which made Œªk and œÑk in eq 1 not needed in table 5 other sources e g soil n and precipitation were excluded due to low concentrations of nitrate song et al 2016 past√©n zapata et al 2014 meghdadi and javar 2018 compared to the two sources i e w 026 and fertilizers and 53 groundwater samples as a result the contributions of manure were in a range from 33 5 to 81 8 n 53 the groundwater samples n 21 collected from the forest and grassland showed higher contributions of manure wastewater than those from the agricultural area fig 8 this result supports groundwater nitrate contamination by manure in the forest and grassland the trend 1 in fig 7 supplementary fig s4 and by plant farming in the agricultural land the trend 3 in fig 7 supplementary fig s4 while the major source shifted to livestock farming fertilizers seemed to still significantly affect the groundwater quality in agricultural areas as of 2015 2018 6 conclusion and suggestions hydrochemical processes and nitrate sources in groundwater were assessed in hanlim jeju island where intensive livestock farming began in the 1970s and illegal manure wastewater dumping in a lava cave was revealed in 2015 also the aquifer is vulnerable to surface contaminants due to the high permeability of volcanic rocks to identify nitrate sources factor analysis and land use were combined with the n and o isotopic analysis of nitrate a bayesian isotope mixing model was applied to quantify the contribution of illegal dumping in groundwater samples chlorofluorocarbons cfcs were assessed to estimate groundwater ages the study results showed that the hydrochemistry of groundwater varied widely from na hco3 type to ca mg cl no3 type with increasing no3 concentrations and decreasing ph suggesting anthropogenic n inputs and nitrification consistent with the Œ¥18ono3 values in groundwater factor analysis summarized the major hydrochemical processes in the study area as water rock interaction and nitrate contamination by fertilizer and manure the spatial distribution of Œ¥15nno3 and nitrate levels in groundwater suggested that the major source of nitrate contamination was manure wastewater illegally dumped in the lava cave as of 2015 2018 accounting for 33 5 81 8 of groundwater nitrate in addition apparent groundwater ages ranged between 54 years 1961 and 23 5 years 1991 5 and the younger groundwater had higher nitrate levels and Œ¥15nno3 values which implied the shift of a major nitrate source from fertilizer to livestock manure in the deep groundwater median well depth of 156 8 m below ground surface due to the increased n production from intensive livestock farming since the 1970s illegal manure wastewater discharge and high hydraulic conductivity the apparent age of the youngest groundwater of 23 5 years 1991 5 in the study area suggests that the current groundwater nitrate contamination originated from anthropogenic activities before the 1990s the time lag between human activities and groundwater contamination can be explained by the legacy effect also the temporal change in n pollution sources and the increase in groundwater nitrate levels with time demonstrate that the groundwater management of the hanlim area is inadequate based on the legacy effect and the inadequate groundwater management the high n production as of today will exacerbate groundwater nitrate contamination over the next several decades thus long term 25 years groundwater management practices are required to decrease n loads in hanlim because it takes time for management practices to take effect due to the legacy n the study results are a good reference for future studies to assess legacy problems in regions where a similar n source shift to livestock farming is expected as the livestock industry has been expanded and intensified from traditional grazing to meet the need for meat besides the combined use of hydrochemical parameters no dual isotopes groundwater age data factor analysis and historical n production to identify n sources and evaluate the time lag of an individual n source can be applied to many other regions in the world where multiple n sources exist

17224,deepening the understanding of scaling processes would facilitate the improvement of membrane distillation md as a promising technique for sustainable development this study investigated the scaling of calcium sulfate in md via an approach based on optical coherence tomography oct the oct based characterization enabled an analysis that correlated the flux decline with the morphological evolution of the scaling layer it was revealed by this analysis that the reduction in the evaporation rate could be dominated by different mechanisms as the crystalline particles grew and deposited on the membrane surface the striping phenomenon visualized by mapping the local growth rates provided evidence for the hydrodynamic instability induced by the coupled mass and heat transfer in md moreover the oct based characterization was exploited to unravel the interplay between the crystallization and the porous structure by quantifying the membrane deformation as a function of time the varied precipitation kinetics in the boundary layer was confirmed by comparing the temporal variations in the oct signals at different depths all these results shed light on mechanisms underlying complex scaling processes which are the basis for optimizing the design of md graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation scaling mechanisms calcium sulfate in situ

al 2015 gryta et al 2006 guan et al 2018 and thereby reduce the environmental footprint curcio et al 2015 md efficiency can be significantly decreased owing to scaling phenomena drioli et al 2012 gryta 2008 horseman et al 2020 that are primarily attributed to the crystallization of sparingly soluble inorganic salts calcium sulfate caso4 is identified as a recalcitrant non alkaline salt whose removal is quite challenging when forming a scaling layer on the membrane surface gryta 2009 nghiem and cath 2011 effective approaches to mitigating negative impacts of caso4 scaling should be explored on the basis of a better understanding that correlates md performance with the temporal and spatial evolution of the scaling at multiple scales as a special fouling phenomenon that involves both formation i e crystallization or aggregation and deposition of particulate foulants great efforts were made to investigate the scaling behavior in the context of identifying or quantifying the induction period under a variety of operating conditions for example warsinger et al warsinger et al 2017 developed a mathematical model to predict the incidence of caso4 scaling by combining various mechanisms underlying thermodynamics kinetics and fluid mechanics however it remains inconclusive how the scaling process can be correlated with the distillation performance while elucidating the involved mechanisms in a pressure driven membrane process the effects of scaling on the flux decline can be explained in terms of the extra hydraulic resistance resulting from an incompressible e g calcium carbonate or relatively compressible e g ferric hydroxide cake layer shirazi et al 2010 various mathematical models ang and mohammad 2015 hitsov et al 2015 hwang et al 2011 khayet 2011 were proposed to estimate the variation in cake resistance as a function of the geometrical characteristics e g thickness porosity and tortuosity on the other hand as reviewed by shirazi et al shirazi et al 2010 it was justified that the deposition of scalants can be numerically described using the classical fouling models accounting for pore blockage hitsov et al 2015 and cake filtration cheremisinoff 1998 khayet 2011 though the crystallization could significantly change the cake growth rate owing to the increased solute concentration in the feed boundary layer i e the external concentration polarization lee and lee 2000 mart√≠nez d√≠ez and v√°zquez gonz√†lez 1999 and the cake layer i e the cake enhanced concentration polarization chong et al 2008 hoek and elimelech 2003 zhu and elimelech 1997 when the driving force is governed by the vapor pressure difference across the hydrophobic membrane in md the cake layer can play a different role in reducing the distillate flux the majority of early studies on md postulated that extra thermal resistance could result from the fouling and thereby decrease the vapor pressure at the cake membrane interface for example ding et al ding et al 2010 employed a simple mathematical model to estimate the increase in the thermal resistance over time in a md process for concentrating traditional chinese medicine an improved model by gilron et al gilron et al 2013 accounted for the aggravated temperature polarization in the quiescent liquid owing to the partial wetting despite the complex coupling effect between the cake growth and the thermal transport srisurichan et al srisurichan et al 2006 interpreted the flux decline observed in md by fitting the experimental data with the model developed by hermia hermia 1982 which distinguishes the mechanisms of pore blockage cake filtration and pore constriction in terms of a varied parameter however difficulties in numerically decoupling the mass and energy transfer of the crystallization in the vicinity of the feed membrane interface further prevents developing a mechanistic model to describe the evolution of a scaling layer in md prior work wang et al 2014 to a great extent was limited to a schematic description of the interplay between the scalants and the pore structure in the presence of a liquid vapor interface whose validation was subject to the employed characterization method the resistance based mechanisms were poorly supported by the sem characterization results in some studies goh et al 2013 gryta 2008 phattaranawik et al 2009 that indicated a disparity between the measured cake thickness and the reduced evaporation rate it was first argued by goh et al goh et al 2013 that the hydraulic resistance of a hydrophilic cake layer could have little impact on the interfacial phase transition as the capillary pressure was sufficiently high to drive a liquid flux not lower than the evaporation rate instead the evaporation rate might be substantially reduced owing to the concave liquid vapor interface held by the cake pores with extremely small diameters i e the kelvin effect fisher 1981 mitropoulos 2008 a theoretical analysis was presented by chew et al chew et al 2014 to quantify the vapor pressure depression arising from the kelvin effect the model predictions were supported by the experimental study using humic acid as the foulant in md tan et al 2016 reviewing these studies establishes that the fouling behavior in md especially when scaling occurs could be contributed by mechanisms more complex than those involved in conventional membrane processes a better understanding entails more knowledge of the cake layer that evolves over time to change the evaporation rate in various ways noninvasive characterization provides an effective approach to in situ analyze the evolution of a fouling layer during different membrane processes while avoiding possible damage caused by autopsy based characterization e g imaging via scanning electron microscopy sem as an advanced tool for performing noninvasive sectioning optical coherence tomography oct huang et al 1991 has been successfully explored to investigate scaling phenomena in md though the majority of these studies farid et al 2018 fortunato et al 2018 2017 guo et al 2020 lee et al 2018 highlighted the tomographical images while ignoring the potential to analyze the optical signals in a quantitative way in a study on fouling in ultrafiltration li et al li et al 2016 developed a series of algorithms to numerically identify the evolving cake layer from 3d oct datasets a similar approach was employed by bauer et al bauer et al 2019 to study a complex fouling process in md which combined the scaling of inorganic salts and the growth of a biofilm this study focused on characterizing the scaling development of caso4 in md via the oct technique the scaling characterization was implemented using a mode associated with the concept of metastable zone width mszw in addition to the tomographical visualization the evolution of scaling was resolved via two different approaches that were based on the numerically tracked feed membrane interface and the digitalized cake layers respectively the analysis was aimed at revealing dynamic effects induced by the scaling in an effort to provide deeper insights into mechanisms underlying the evaporation rate reduction rendered by the scaling of caso4 in md this study will demonstrate that oct can be explored as a powerful tool for enhancing the performance of md processes 2 experimental procedures 2 1 scaling of calcium sulfate in md via a mszw based mode the scaling of caso4 in md is essentially equivalent to an evaporative crystallization process that can be characterized in various ways in comparison with the induction time s√∂hnel and mullin 1988 the measurement of mszw kubota 2010 sangwal 2008 shares more similarities with the implementation of concentration via md where the degree of supersaturation is gradually increased given that a slower process of nucleation and crystal growth might offer advantages in accurately capturing the dynamic effects a mode associated with the concept of mszw was employed to study the scaling behavior of caso4 in md the schematic in the supporting information si figure s 1a demonstrates the experimental system for performing a process of direct contact md alkhudhiri et al 2012 k smolders 1989 liao et al 2014 whose vapor pressure difference was created by maintaining a higher temperature 60 c on the feed side while the distillate flow with a lower temperate 20 c was in direct contact with the membrane in particular the feed container with a volume of 2000 ml was immersed in a thermostatically controlled water bath changliu model no hx 102 china and the feed flow was driven by a gear pump longer pump model no wt 3000 1fb china to circulate between the membrane cell and the feed container with a flow rate of 465 ml min the distillate flow was driven in the same way while the pipeline was connected with a chiller laboto model no cc 0506e china the evaporation rate was estimated by weighing the distillate container 2000 ml placed on a digital balance mettler toledo model no ml4002 t usa the caso4 containing feed solution was prepared in a similar way employed by naidu et al naidu et al 2014 that is deionized di water 1000 ml milli q direct 8 water purification system france was mixed with caso4 2 0 g caso4 2h2o 99 analytical reagent aladdin and fully blended to form a homogeneous solution whose concentration was approximately close to the solubility of caso4 at the feed temperature hoang et al 2007 xiao et al 2019 the feed solution was prefiltered using a membrane with a pore size of 0 45 ¬µm mf millipore merck millipore ireland to remove any undissolved particles as schematically indicated by the plot in si figure s 1b it was assumed that the degree of supersaturation would be increased in a progressive manner before the occurrence of the nucleation and the subsequent crystal deposition the maximum supersaturation achieved in this way would disclose an operation window in terms of the volumetric concentration factor vcf i e the ratio of the initial feed volume to the one obtained over time which was similar to the mszw usually defined in terms of the temperature in a process of cooling crystallization sangwal 2008 in particular the variation in the concentration of caso4 was continuously monitored by measuring the conductivity mettler toledo model no fe38 accuracy of 0 5 within the measurement range of the solutions in both the feed and distillate containers a hydrophobic membrane with a nominal pore size of 0 3 ¬µm annuo zhejiang china si figure s 2 was cut into a rectangular piece of 5 cm by 8 cm and sealed in the membrane cell to form an effective area of 34 cm2 the chamber separated by the membrane provided two channels width 48 5 mm and height 2 mm for the feed and distillate flows respectively such that the bulk velocity in both the channels was equal to 8 cm s membrane spacers with a diamond configuration were placed in both the channel to support the membrane and enhance the heat transfer moreover a fresh membrane piece was used in each run and all the experiments were repeated at least five times to insure a statistical analysis the mechanical strength of the membranes was measured using a tensile testing system cmt6104 mts systems china before and after the scaling experiments 2 2 oct based characterization of the scaling behavior in a similar way employed in prior studies li et al 2016 liu et al 2017 the membrane cell was incorporated with an oct system ganymede iii hr thorlabs usa by performing a series of 3d scans through the optical window 20 mm by 20 mm by 1 mm embedded in the channel wall on the feed side the broadband light source central wavelength 905 nm enabled an a scan i e the scan focused on a point with a depth resolution of 2 ¬µm in water each oct sampling was composed of an array of a scans 200 by 100 performed within a rectangular area of 2 mm by 1 mm thereby yielding a dataset consisting of voxels with a size of approximately 5 ¬µm by 5 ¬µm by 2 ¬µm the value of each voxel was determined by the light intensity reflected liu et al 2017 by the corresponding medium spot in the scanned volume as revealed by the oct based characterization for fouling in pressure driven processes gao et al 2014 han et al 2017 liu et al 2020a the membrane surface can be perturbed by the flowing fluid to shift and thereby pose an obstacle to the identification of the deposited foulants li et al li et al 2016 addressed this challenge by developing a numerical algorithm that was able to track the interfacial shift in terms of the similarity between the intensity profiles this study employed the same algorithm briefly introduced in the si method s 1 to quantify the membrane shift that could be induced by the scaling when the membrane surface on the feed side was accurately identified over time different approaches were explored to numerically analyzing the scaling phenomenon in the vicinity of the feed membrane interface as schematically illustrated in si figure s 3a a series of coordinate surfaces with the positive direction pointing toward the feed were established in terms of the membrane surface that could be initially curved and shifted over time these coordinate surfaces were uniformly spaced with an interval 2 ¬µm determined by the depth resolution of the oct system the voxels associated with each coordinate surface were used to evaluate the profile of surface averaged intensity sai trinh et al 2018 and the fraction of positive anomalies pas li et al 2016 in particular a voxel was identified as a pa if the intensity was greater than a threshold which was equal to the mean of the background intensities plus twice the corresponding standard deviation i e the single sided 95 confidence interval the fraction of pas was then equivalent to the number ratio of the anomalies to the total voxels associated with a coordinate surface it was believed that a pa would be created once the space corresponding to the voxel was occupied by crystals of caso4 since the liquid crystal interface can significantly increase the reflectance and thereby yield a higher intensity this assumption established that the pas should be equivalent to the foulant voxels defined in the work by li et al li et al 2016 when a group of spatially linked foulant voxels was in direct contact with the membrane surface it was assumed that this voxel group should constitute part of a stagnant or transient cake layer as demonstrated in prior studies li et al 2016 the digitalized cake layers can be exploited to evaluate more details are presented in the si method s 2 the surface coverage specific deposit or mean of local thicknesses and local growth rates all procedures for the oct based analysis are outlined by the flowchart in si figure s 3b moreover supplementary characterization was implemented to analyze the geometrical characteristics of the scalants at a submicron scale via sem zeiss merlin germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 flux decline induced by scaling of calcium sulfate in md if the supersaturation state is achieved by mixing na2so4 and cacl2 the immediately induced scaling usually results in a sharp flux decline as revealed in prior studies christie et al 2019 nghiem and cath 2011 in contrast the scaling experiments in this study employed a feed solution whose concentration of calcium sulfate was approximately equal to the solubility therefore the degree of supersaturation was gradually increased as the water was removed by the evaporation at a relatively constant rate before the occurrence of scaling note that the effects of particulate foulants on the crystallization were minimized by the prefiltration of the feed moreover the direct dissolution of caso4 in di water would offer the advantage of eliminating any effects of background electrolytes kowacz et al 2010 the evaporation rate per unit membrane area can be estimated in terms of the distillate flux that is plotted as a function of time in fig 1 a as indicated by the results for the controls i e di water as the feed the distillate flux was decreased nearly in a linear way from 40 lmh to 32 lmh when setting the duration of the md process to 400 min this slow reduction in the distillate flux could be attributed to the limited capacity of the temperature control units i e the reduced transmembrane temperature difference as shown in si figure s 4 nevertheless it is evidently indicated by the results for the caso4 containing feed that the reduction rate of distillate flux was significantly increased when the time of md was longer than 225 min in terms of the flux decline curve the onset of scaling should correspond to a value of 1 8 fig 1b for the vcf which defines the mszw when assuming that the flux decline rate was changed by the deposition of caso4 crystals it also indicates that the value of vcf for the caso4 containing feed was not markedly deviated from that for the control until a sharp flux decline occurred at t 250 min note that the value of vcf should be different from that of concentration factor i e the ratio of the feed concentration to the initial one in the presence of crystallization the variation in the salt concentration can be more directly illustrated by the plots of feed conductivity versus time in fig 1c it confirms that the caso4 in the feed was concentrated to increase the degree of supersaturation despite the continuous reduction in the feed volume the spontaneous nucleation and the subsequent growth of crystals could significantly decrease the concentration of caso4 in the liquid phase thereby yielding a maximum of feed conductivity at a time in agreement with the onset of scaling moreover it is evident that the hydrophobic membrane was not wetted in the scaling experiments since the plot in fig 1c shows that the temporal variation in the distillate conductivity is confined to a range lower than 5 ¬µs cm the characterization of mechanical strength si figure s 5 also confirms that the scaling of caso4 with a duration of 200 min had negligible impact on the membrane structure these characterization results are different from those christie et al 2019 obtained in a scaling experiment that prepared the feed solution by mixing cacl2 and na2so4 a possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the occurrence of wetting could be strongly dependent on the scaling kinetics that is varying the initial degree of supersaturation could have substantial impacts on the kinetical pathway of crystallization in the boundary layer gebauer et al 2018 wang et al 2012 and thereby change the interactions between the crystals and the membrane pores 3 2 surface orientated analysis of the scaling process in order to set the sampling rate at a relatively high value approximately 2 datasets per min while saving the storage space the oct characterization was initiated at a time t 210 min close to the onset of flux decline induced by the scaling the oct dataset obtained at t 210 min was exploited to determine the feed membrane interface in the absence of crystal deposition the numerically determined interface denoted in red can be verified by the tomographic image t 210 min in fig 2 a the similarity based algorithm was applied to track the feed membrane or scalant membrane interface in each oct dataset the interface tracking results are denoted in light blue and compared with the initial interface in the tomographic images in terms of the curve for the caso4 containing feed in fig 1a the flux decline rate was markedly increased at t 240 min this is consistent with the corresponding tomographic image in fig 2a indicating that crystals of caso4 were formed in or conveyed from the bulk into the feed boundary layer and a small amount of deposition was scattered on the membrane surface on the other hand it is evident that the membrane was not perturbed by the initial deposition in a discernable way since the numerically tracked interface denoted in light blue is virtually overlapped with the initial one denoted in red the scaling process during the sharp flux decline can be analyzed in terms of the tomographic image obtained at t 250 min fig 2a in contrast to the initial period it clearly shows that a significant amount of crystals had been deposited on the membrane surface to form a cake layer in a more continuous sense it is also interesting to note that the membrane surface was markedly shifted to a position lower than the initial interface i e the direction toward the membrane as revealed by the separate curves denoted in light blue and red moreover the tomographic image obtained at t 300 min fig 2a displays a thicker cake layer and a greater distance between the red and light blue curves all these observations indicate that the membrane shift i e the spatial deviation from the initial location could be correlated with the formation of the cake layer of crystals the membrane shift can be quantified for each oct dataset and the calculated shift distance is demonstrated as a function of time in fig 2b this plot confirms that the membrane was consistently shifted toward in the negative direction i e a position on the membrane side with respect to the initial interface rather than randomly perturbed however it is more intuitive to believe that the decrease in the vapor flux within the membrane would give rise to a relaxation of the membrane i e a movement toward the liquid side owing to the reduction in the drag force exerted on the membrane by the flowing fluid in addition the comparison between figs 1a and 2a establishes that the membrane was shifted in a way approximately coincident with the flux decline behavior over the same period therefore it is tempting to infer that there should be strong and continuously varied interactions between the deposited crystalline particles and the substructures of the membrane surface e g the polymer network could be stretched by the growing crystals that were partially embedded the crystal membrane interactions on the feed side would create a nonuniform distribution of stress across the polymer film thereby resulting in a deformation of the partially suspended membrane the numerically tracked interface enabled the establishment of coordination surfaces uniformly spaced in the depth direction which were exploited to evaluate the profiles of sai at varied times and the fractions of pas at varied depths although the profiles of sai si figure s 6 offer a straightforward way to characterize the cake growth the analysis could be questionable since the developed cake substantially attenuated the incident light around the cake membrane interface moreover the sai could be insensitive to the scattered speckles mariampillai et al 2008 induced by the crystals during the early stage of precipitation in comparison identifying the pas was less dependent on the incident light a valid response could be induced by a small number of speckles thereby lending a potential tool for detecting the onset of precipitation the fraction of pas was evaluated at two coordinate surfaces to compare the precipitation of caso4 in the bulk feed 200 ¬µm above the membrane surface with that in the boundary layer 6 ¬µm above the membrane surface the plot of the fraction of pas versus time in fig 3 a indicates a relatively slow precipitation process in the bulk feed whereas a sharp increase in the fraction of pas is shown in the plot for the boundary layer fig 3b note that owing to the light attenuation the fraction of pas evaluated in the boundary layer is decreased after achieving a maximum nevertheless the varied precipitation kinetics confirms the effects of the coupled concentration and temperature polarization on the degree of supersaturation in the boundary layer in addition to the polarization phenomena the retrograde solubility of caso4 hoang et al 2007 makes it more difficult to understand the different crystallization behavior in the boundary layer such as the varied aspect ratio distribution of the crystals si figure s 7 that could result from the dependence of crystalline habit on the varied temperature field wang et al 2012 3 3 resolving the evolution of the scaling layer unraveling the morphological evolution of the scaling layer is a key to understand the reduction in the vapor evaporation rate the digitalized cake layers obtained at various times can be exploited to analyze the temporal variation in the geometrical characteristics that could dominate the complex interactions between the cake layer and membrane the calculated surface coverage i e the fraction of the membrane surface in direct contact with the scalants is plotted as a function of time in fig 4 a it clearly shows that the surface coverage is increased in an s shaped manner over the range approximately between t 220 min and 250 min this observation is at variance with the prediction based on the classical pore blockage model ang and mohammad 2015 iritani and katagiri 2016 khayet 2011 which describes an exponential increase in the surface coverage on the other hand the flux decline curve fig 1a is concave down during the initial scaling indicating that the flux decline rate was increased as the membrane surface was gradually covered by the deposited crystals as revealed by ho and zydney ho and zydney 1999 these nonclassical behaviors could be attributed to the highly interconnected structure of the employed membrane si figure s 7 which alleviated the effects of the blockage by allowing the vapor to flow in the lateral direction note that after achieving a maximum close to 1 the surface coverage is slowly decreased to a value around 0 7 this observation could be an optical artifact owing to the substantially attenuated incident light at the cake membrane interface the specific deposit was evaluated as the volume of deposits per unit area of the membrane surface the comparison between figs 1a and 4b indicates a strong dependence of the flux decline on the increase in the deposits given that the network created by depositing crystals of caso4 can be viewed as a hydrophilic scaling layer vora and ali 2019 the evaporation at the interface should be to a great extent independent of the liquid flow within the growing scaling layer therefore it is reasonable to attribute the loss of driving force to the temperature polarization whose degree could be substantially enhanced as more crystals were deposited on the membrane surface this hypothesis is more evidently supported by the cake growth over the range between t 250 min and 260 min when the effects of the surface coverage could be negligible despite the strong flux deposition correlation the characterization results indicate that the distillate flux continued to slowly decrease over the range of time greater than 260 min even though the scaling layer stopped growing in a statistical sense i e the mean of local cake thicknesses achieves a steady value of 0 08 mm in fig 4c note that the evaluation of local cake thicknesses should be immune to the light attenuation at the cake membrane interface thereby supporting the analysis for the long term scaling in a more reliable way a possible explanation for the continuing flux decline is that the degree of supersaturation could be maintained for a relatively long period by the cake enhanced concentration polarization chong et al 2008 i e a more severe polarized concentration profile caused by the lower mass transfer rate within the cake layer as a result the growth of the deposited crystals or the secondary nucleation in the voids formed by the deposited crystals i e a process similar to the crystallization in porous materials scherer 1999 would compact the scaling layer in some regions close to the cake membrane interface the compacted scaling layer could have some pores with a size within the range dominated by the kelvin effect fisher 1981 mitropoulos 2008 that is the vapor pressure could be substantially depressed owing to the liquid vapor interface that was curved toward the hydrophilic pore this hypothesis is consistent with prior studies chew et al 2014 goh et al 2013 tan et al 2016 that unraveled the vapor pressure depression when examining the flux decline resulting from the deposition of organic foulants the local growth rates i e the variation in the local cake thickness per unit time were approximately evaluated by comparing the digitalized cake layers obtained at two consecutive times the distribution of local growth rates is demonstrated by the red blue plot where the positive i e the deposition and negative i e the removal growth rates are denoted in red and blue respectively a sequence of representative red blue plots obtained at various times is displayed in fig 5 evidently showing three periods that are characteristic of distinct striping patterns in contrast to the scattered active regions in the red blue plots for the initial period t 250 min the scanned area is dominated by red stripes that are oriented in parallel with the crossflow although striping phenomena have been reported in prior studies that were based on ultrafiltration larsen 1991 li et al 2016 liu et al 2020a 2020b and forward osmosis liu et al 2020a to the best knowledge it is for the first time that stripe like patterns were resolved in a scaling process in md in terms of the linear stability analysis by larsen larsen 1991 the periodic deposition of foulant particles can be explained by the interplay between the polarized boundary layer and the fluctuated permeate flux however more complex mechanisms should be involved in the boundary layer in md since the vapor flux is dominated by the interfacial temperature it is not straightforward to simply extend the larsen model to the coupled mass and heat transfer on the other hand it can be seen that the patterns formed by alternating red and blue stripes are actually varied over time despite the predominance of red stripes corresponding to the rapid development of the scaling layer more blue stripes are resolved with relatively high spatial frequencies in the plots for the long term scaling t 270 min the increase in the blue stripes i e areas dominated by the removal of particles can be an indicator of higher shear rates since the channel was narrowed by the growing scaling layer moreover it is consistent with the variation in the average of local thicknesses fig 4c indicating that a dynamic equilibrium between the deposition and removal of crystals was established 4 conclusions the scaling of caso4 in md was studied using a mode associated with the concept of mszw the caso4 containing feed was gradually concentrated such that the temporal resolution could be enhanced for the scaling characterization the flux decline was analyzed in terms of the evolving cake layer that was digitalized using the oct datasets it was revealed that the reduction in evaporation rate could be dominated by different mechanisms as the cake layer of crystals was formed on the membrane surface instead of a random deposition process the striping phenomenon was visualized by mapping the local growth rates indicating that the temperature polarization could play an important role in inducing instability in the boundary layer all these observations confirm that the scaling of caso4 in md is a process in which various transport phenomena are coupled in a complex way it is desirable that mechanistic models with improved accuracy would be developed on the basis of these observations on the other hand the oct based characterization provided evidence for the membrane deformation resulting from the scaling of caso4 which should be of great value in understanding possible membrane damage during a md process the ability of resolving the precipitation kinetics in the boundary layer further confirms that oct can be explored to quantitatively study scaling processes in md with advantages absent in conventional characterization declaration of competing interest the authors

explored on the basis of a better understanding that correlates md performance with the temporal and spatial evolution of the scaling at multiple scales as a special fouling phenomenon that involves both formation i e crystallization or aggregation and deposition of particulate foulants great efforts were made to investigate the scaling behavior in the context of identifying or quantifying the induction period under a variety of operating conditions for example warsinger et al warsinger et al 2017 developed a mathematical model to predict the incidence of caso4 scaling by combining various mechanisms underlying thermodynamics kinetics and fluid mechanics however it remains inconclusive how the scaling process can be correlated with the distillation performance while elucidating the involved mechanisms in a pressure driven membrane process the effects of scaling on the flux decline can be explained in terms of the extra hydraulic resistance resulting from an incompressible e g

al 2010 it was justified that the deposition of scalants can be numerically described using the classical fouling models accounting for pore blockage hitsov et al 2015 and cake filtration cheremisinoff 1998 khayet 2011 though the crystallization could significantly change the cake growth rate owing to the increased solute concentration in the feed boundary layer i e the external concentration polarization lee and lee 2000 mart√≠nez d√≠ez and v√°zquez gonz√†lez 1999 and the cake layer i e the cake enhanced concentration polarization chong et al 2008 hoek and elimelech 2003 zhu and elimelech 1997 when the driving force is governed by the vapor pressure difference across the hydrophobic membrane in md the cake layer can play a different role in reducing the distillate flux the majority of early studies on md postulated that extra thermal resistance could result from the fouling and thereby decrease the vapor pressure at the cake membrane interface for example ding et al ding et al 2010 employed a simple mathematical model to estimate the increase in the thermal resistance over time in a md process for concentrating traditional chinese medicine an improved model by gilron et al gilron et al 2013 accounted for the aggravated temperature polarization in the quiescent liquid owing to the partial wetting despite the complex coupling effect between the cake growth and the thermal transport srisurichan et al srisurichan et al 2006 interpreted the flux decline observed in md by fitting the experimental data with the model developed by hermia hermia 1982 which distinguishes the mechanisms of pore blockage cake filtration and pore constriction in terms of a varied parameter however difficulties in numerically decoupling the mass and energy transfer of the crystallization in the vicinity of the feed membrane interface further prevents developing a mechanistic model to describe the evolution of a scaling layer in md prior work wang et al 2014 to a great extent was limited to a schematic description of the interplay between the scalants and the pore structure in the presence of a liquid vapor interface whose validation was subject to the employed characterization method the resistance based mechanisms were poorly supported by the sem characterization results in some studies goh et al 2013 gryta 2008 phattaranawik et al 2009 that indicated a disparity between the measured cake thickness and the reduced evaporation rate it was first argued by goh et al goh et al 2013 that the hydraulic resistance of a hydrophilic cake layer could have little impact on the interfacial phase transition as the capillary pressure was sufficiently high to drive a liquid flux not lower than the evaporation rate instead the evaporation rate might be substantially reduced owing to the concave liquid vapor interface held by the cake pores with extremely small diameters i e the kelvin effect fisher 1981 mitropoulos 2008 a theoretical analysis was presented by chew et al chew et al 2014 to quantify the vapor pressure depression arising from the kelvin effect the model predictions were supported by the experimental study using humic acid as the foulant in md tan et al 2016 reviewing these studies establishes that the fouling behavior in md especially when scaling occurs could be contributed by mechanisms more complex than those involved in conventional membrane processes a better understanding entails more knowledge of the cake layer that evolves over time to change the evaporation rate in various ways noninvasive characterization provides an effective approach to in situ analyze the evolution of a fouling layer during different membrane processes while avoiding possible damage caused by autopsy based characterization e g imaging via scanning electron microscopy sem as an advanced tool for performing noninvasive sectioning optical coherence tomography oct huang et al 1991 has been successfully explored to investigate scaling phenomena in md though the majority of these studies farid et al 2018 fortunato et al 2018 2017 guo et al 2020 lee et al 2018 highlighted the tomographical images while ignoring the potential to analyze the optical signals in a quantitative way in a study on fouling in ultrafiltration li et al li et al 2016 developed a series of algorithms to numerically identify the evolving cake layer from 3d oct datasets a similar approach was employed by bauer et al bauer et al 2019 to study a complex fouling process in md which combined the scaling of inorganic salts and the growth of a biofilm this study focused on characterizing the scaling development of caso4 in md via the oct technique the scaling characterization was implemented using a mode associated with the concept of metastable zone width mszw in addition to the tomographical visualization the evolution of scaling was resolved via two different approaches that were based on the numerically tracked feed membrane interface and the digitalized cake layers respectively the analysis was aimed at revealing dynamic effects induced by the scaling in an effort to provide deeper insights into mechanisms underlying the evaporation rate reduction rendered by the scaling of caso4 in md this study will demonstrate that oct can be explored as a powerful tool for enhancing the performance of md processes 2 experimental procedures 2 1 scaling of calcium sulfate in md via a mszw based mode the scaling of caso4 in md is essentially equivalent to an evaporative crystallization process that can be characterized in various ways in comparison with the induction time s√∂hnel and mullin 1988 the measurement of mszw kubota 2010 sangwal 2008 shares more similarities with the implementation of concentration via md where the degree of supersaturation is gradually increased given that a slower process of nucleation and crystal growth might offer advantages in accurately capturing the dynamic effects a mode associated with the concept of mszw was employed to study the scaling behavior of caso4 in md the schematic in the supporting information si figure s 1a demonstrates the experimental system for performing a process of direct contact md alkhudhiri et al 2012 k smolders 1989 liao et al 2014 whose vapor pressure difference was created by maintaining a higher temperature 60 c on the feed side while the distillate flow with a lower temperate 20 c was in direct contact with the membrane in particular the feed container with a volume of 2000 ml was immersed in a thermostatically controlled water bath changliu model no hx 102 china and the feed flow was driven by a gear pump longer pump model no wt 3000 1fb china to circulate between the membrane cell and the feed container with a flow rate of 465 ml min the distillate flow was driven in the same way while the pipeline was connected with a chiller laboto model no cc 0506e china the evaporation rate was estimated by weighing the distillate container 2000 ml placed on a digital balance mettler toledo model no ml4002 t usa the caso4 containing feed solution was prepared in a similar way employed by naidu et al naidu et al 2014 that is deionized di water 1000 ml milli q direct 8 water purification system france was mixed with caso4 2 0 g caso4 2h2o 99 analytical reagent aladdin and fully blended to form a homogeneous solution whose concentration was approximately close to the solubility of caso4 at the feed temperature hoang et al 2007 xiao et al 2019 the feed solution was prefiltered using a membrane with a pore size of 0 45 ¬µm mf millipore merck millipore ireland to remove any undissolved particles as schematically indicated by the plot in si figure s 1b it was assumed that the degree of supersaturation would be increased in a progressive manner before the occurrence of the nucleation and the subsequent crystal deposition the maximum supersaturation achieved in this way would disclose an operation window in terms of the volumetric concentration factor vcf i e the ratio of the initial feed volume to the one obtained over time which was similar to the mszw usually defined in terms of the temperature in a process of cooling crystallization sangwal 2008 in particular the variation in the concentration of caso4 was continuously monitored by measuring the conductivity mettler toledo model no fe38 accuracy of 0 5 within the measurement range of the solutions in both the feed and distillate containers a hydrophobic membrane with a nominal pore size of 0 3 ¬µm annuo zhejiang china si figure s 2 was cut into a rectangular piece of 5 cm by 8 cm and sealed in the membrane cell to form an effective area of 34 cm2 the chamber separated by the membrane provided two channels width 48 5 mm and height 2 mm for the feed and distillate flows respectively such that the bulk velocity in both the channels was equal to 8 cm s membrane spacers with a diamond configuration were placed in both the channel to support the membrane and enhance the heat transfer moreover a fresh membrane piece was used in each run and all the experiments were repeated at least five times to insure a statistical analysis the mechanical strength of the membranes was measured using a tensile testing system cmt6104 mts systems china before and after the scaling experiments 2 2 oct based characterization of the scaling behavior in a similar way employed in prior studies li et al 2016 liu et al 2017 the membrane cell was incorporated with an oct system ganymede iii hr thorlabs usa by performing a series of 3d scans through the optical window 20 mm by 20 mm by 1 mm embedded in the channel wall on the feed side the broadband light source central wavelength 905 nm enabled an a scan i e the scan focused on a point with a depth resolution of 2 ¬µm in water each oct sampling was composed of an array of a scans 200 by 100 performed within a rectangular area of 2 mm by 1 mm thereby yielding a dataset consisting of voxels with a size of approximately 5 ¬µm by 5 ¬µm by 2 ¬µm the value of each voxel was determined by the light intensity reflected liu et al 2017 by the corresponding medium spot in the scanned volume as revealed by the oct based characterization for fouling in pressure driven processes gao et al 2014 han et al 2017 liu et al 2020a the membrane surface can be perturbed by the flowing fluid to shift and thereby pose an obstacle to the identification of the deposited foulants li et al li et al 2016 addressed this challenge by developing a numerical algorithm that was able to track the interfacial shift in terms of the similarity between the intensity profiles this study employed the same algorithm briefly introduced in the si method s 1 to quantify the membrane shift that could be induced by the scaling when the membrane surface on the feed side was accurately identified over time different approaches were explored to numerically analyzing the scaling phenomenon in the vicinity of the feed membrane interface as schematically illustrated in si figure s 3a a series of coordinate surfaces with the positive direction pointing toward the feed were established in terms of the membrane surface that could be initially curved and shifted over time these coordinate surfaces were uniformly spaced with an interval 2 ¬µm determined by the depth resolution of the oct system the voxels associated with each coordinate surface were used to evaluate the profile of surface averaged intensity sai trinh et al 2018 and the fraction of positive anomalies pas li et al 2016 in particular a voxel was identified as a pa if the intensity was greater than a threshold which was equal to the mean of the background intensities plus twice the corresponding standard deviation i e the single sided 95 confidence interval the fraction of pas was then equivalent to the number ratio of the anomalies to the total voxels associated with a coordinate surface it was believed that a pa would be created once the space corresponding to the voxel was occupied by crystals of caso4 since the liquid crystal interface can significantly increase the reflectance and thereby yield a higher intensity this assumption established that the pas should be equivalent to the foulant voxels defined in the work by li et al li et al 2016 when a group of spatially linked foulant voxels was in direct contact with the membrane surface it was assumed that this voxel group should constitute part of a stagnant or transient cake layer as demonstrated in prior studies li et al 2016 the digitalized cake layers can be exploited to evaluate more details are presented in the si method s 2 the surface coverage specific deposit or mean of local thicknesses and local growth rates all procedures for the oct based analysis are outlined by the flowchart in si figure s 3b moreover supplementary characterization was implemented to analyze the geometrical characteristics of the scalants at a submicron scale via sem zeiss merlin germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 flux decline induced by scaling of calcium sulfate in md if the supersaturation state is achieved by mixing na2so4 and cacl2 the immediately induced scaling usually results in a sharp flux decline as revealed in prior studies christie et al 2019 nghiem and cath 2011 in contrast the scaling experiments in this study employed a feed solution whose concentration of calcium sulfate was approximately equal to the solubility therefore the degree of supersaturation was gradually increased as the water was removed by the evaporation at a relatively constant rate before the occurrence of scaling note that the effects of particulate foulants on the crystallization were minimized by the prefiltration of the feed moreover the direct dissolution of caso4 in di water would offer the advantage of eliminating any effects of background electrolytes kowacz et al 2010 the evaporation rate per unit membrane area can be estimated in terms of the distillate flux that is plotted as a function of time in fig 1 a as indicated by the results for the controls i e di water as the feed the distillate flux was decreased nearly in a linear way from 40 lmh to 32 lmh when setting the duration of the md process to 400 min this slow reduction in the distillate flux could be attributed to the limited capacity of the temperature control units i e the reduced transmembrane temperature difference as shown in si figure s 4 nevertheless it is evidently indicated by the results for the caso4 containing feed that the reduction rate of distillate flux was significantly increased when the time of md was longer than 225 min in terms of the flux decline curve the onset of scaling should correspond to a value of 1 8 fig 1b for the vcf which defines the mszw when assuming that the flux decline rate was changed by the deposition of caso4 crystals it also indicates that the value of vcf for the caso4 containing feed was not markedly deviated from that for the control until a sharp flux decline occurred at t 250 min note that the value of vcf should be different from that of concentration factor i e the ratio of the feed concentration to the initial one in the presence of crystallization the variation in the salt concentration can be more directly illustrated by the plots of feed conductivity versus time in fig 1c it confirms that the caso4 in the feed was concentrated to increase the degree of supersaturation despite the continuous reduction in the feed volume the spontaneous nucleation and the subsequent growth of crystals could significantly decrease the concentration of caso4 in the liquid phase thereby yielding a maximum of feed conductivity at a time in agreement with the onset of scaling moreover it is evident that the hydrophobic membrane was not wetted in the scaling experiments since the plot in fig 1c shows that the temporal variation in the distillate conductivity is confined to a range lower than 5 ¬µs cm the characterization of mechanical strength si figure s 5 also confirms that the scaling of caso4 with a duration of 200 min had negligible impact on the membrane structure these characterization results are different from those christie et al 2019 obtained in a scaling experiment that prepared the feed solution by mixing cacl2 and na2so4 a possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the occurrence of wetting could be strongly dependent on the scaling kinetics that is varying the initial degree of supersaturation could have substantial impacts on the kinetical pathway of crystallization in the boundary layer gebauer et al 2018 wang et al 2012 and thereby change the interactions between the crystals and the membrane pores 3 2 surface orientated analysis of the scaling process in order to set the sampling rate at a relatively high value approximately 2 datasets per min while saving the storage space the oct characterization was initiated at a time t 210 min close to the onset of flux decline induced by the scaling the oct dataset obtained at t 210 min was exploited to determine the feed membrane interface in the absence of crystal deposition the numerically determined interface denoted in red can be verified by the tomographic image t 210 min in fig 2 a the similarity based algorithm was applied to track the feed membrane or scalant membrane interface in each oct dataset the interface tracking results are denoted in light blue and compared with the initial interface in the tomographic images in terms of the curve for the caso4 containing feed in fig 1a the flux decline rate was markedly increased at t 240 min this is consistent with the corresponding tomographic image in fig 2a indicating that crystals of caso4 were formed in or conveyed from the bulk into the feed boundary layer and a small amount of deposition was scattered on the membrane surface on the other hand it is evident that the membrane was not perturbed by the initial deposition in a discernable way since the numerically tracked interface denoted in light blue is virtually overlapped with the initial one denoted in red the scaling process during the sharp flux decline can be analyzed in terms of the tomographic image obtained at t 250 min fig 2a in contrast to the initial period it clearly shows that a significant amount of crystals had been deposited on the membrane surface to form a cake layer in a more continuous sense it is also interesting to note that the membrane surface was markedly shifted to a position lower than the initial interface i e the direction toward the membrane as revealed by the separate curves denoted in light blue and red moreover the tomographic image obtained at t 300 min fig 2a displays a thicker cake layer and a greater distance between the red and light blue curves all these observations indicate that the membrane shift i e the spatial deviation from the initial location could be correlated with the formation of the cake layer of crystals the membrane shift can be quantified for each oct dataset and the calculated shift distance is demonstrated as a function of time in fig 2b this plot confirms that the membrane was consistently shifted toward in the negative direction i e a position on the membrane side with respect to the initial interface rather than randomly perturbed however it is more intuitive to believe that the decrease in the vapor flux within the membrane would give rise to a relaxation of the membrane i e a movement toward the liquid side owing to the reduction in the drag force exerted on the membrane by the flowing fluid in addition the comparison between figs 1a and 2a establishes that the membrane was shifted in a way approximately coincident with the flux decline behavior over the same period therefore it is tempting to infer that there should be strong and continuously varied interactions between the deposited crystalline particles and the substructures of the membrane surface e g the polymer network could be stretched by the growing crystals that were partially embedded the crystal membrane interactions on the feed side would create a nonuniform distribution of stress across the polymer film thereby resulting in a deformation of the partially suspended membrane the numerically tracked interface enabled the establishment of coordination surfaces uniformly spaced in the depth direction which were exploited to evaluate the profiles of sai at varied times and the fractions of pas at varied depths although the profiles of sai si figure s 6 offer a straightforward way to characterize the cake growth the analysis could be questionable since the developed cake substantially attenuated the incident light around the cake membrane interface moreover the sai could be insensitive to the scattered speckles mariampillai et al 2008 induced by the crystals during the early stage of precipitation in comparison identifying the pas was less dependent on the incident light a valid response could be induced by a small number of speckles thereby lending a potential tool for detecting the onset of precipitation the fraction of pas was evaluated at two coordinate surfaces to compare the precipitation of caso4 in the bulk feed 200 ¬µm above the membrane surface with that in the boundary layer 6 ¬µm above the membrane surface the plot of the fraction of pas versus time in fig 3 a indicates a relatively slow precipitation process in the bulk feed whereas a sharp increase in the fraction of pas is shown in the plot for the boundary layer fig 3b note that owing to the light attenuation the fraction of pas evaluated in the boundary layer is decreased after achieving a maximum nevertheless the varied precipitation kinetics confirms the effects of the coupled concentration and temperature polarization on the degree of supersaturation in the boundary layer in addition to the polarization phenomena the retrograde solubility of caso4 hoang et al 2007 makes it more difficult to understand the different crystallization behavior in the boundary layer such as the varied aspect ratio distribution of the crystals si figure s 7 that could result from the dependence of crystalline habit on the varied temperature field wang et al 2012 3 3 resolving the evolution of the scaling layer unraveling the morphological evolution of the scaling layer is a key to understand the reduction in the vapor evaporation rate the digitalized cake layers obtained at various times can be exploited to analyze the temporal variation in the geometrical characteristics that could dominate the complex interactions between the cake layer and membrane the calculated surface coverage i e the fraction of the membrane surface in direct contact with the scalants is plotted as a function of time in fig 4 a it clearly shows that the surface coverage is increased in an s shaped manner over the range approximately between t 220 min and 250 min this observation is at variance with the prediction based on the classical pore blockage model ang and mohammad 2015 iritani and katagiri 2016 khayet 2011 which describes an exponential increase in the surface coverage on the other hand the flux decline curve fig 1a is concave down during the initial scaling indicating that the flux decline rate was increased as the membrane surface was gradually covered by the deposited crystals as revealed by ho and zydney ho and zydney 1999 these nonclassical behaviors could be attributed to the highly interconnected structure of the employed membrane si figure s 7 which alleviated the effects of the blockage by allowing the vapor to flow in the lateral direction note that after achieving a maximum close to 1 the surface coverage is slowly decreased to a value around 0 7 this observation could be an optical artifact owing to the substantially attenuated incident light at the cake membrane interface the specific deposit was evaluated as the volume of deposits per unit area of the membrane surface the comparison between figs 1a and 4b indicates a strong dependence of the flux decline on the increase in the deposits given that the network created by depositing crystals of caso4 can be viewed as a hydrophilic scaling layer vora and ali 2019 the evaporation at the interface should be to a great extent independent of the liquid flow within the growing scaling layer therefore it is reasonable to attribute the loss of driving force to the temperature polarization whose degree could be substantially enhanced as more crystals were deposited on the membrane surface this hypothesis is more evidently supported by the cake growth over the range between t 250 min and 260 min when the effects of the surface coverage could be negligible despite the strong flux deposition correlation the characterization results indicate that the distillate flux continued to slowly decrease over the range of time greater than 260 min even though the scaling layer stopped growing in a statistical sense i e the mean of local cake thicknesses achieves a steady value of 0 08 mm in fig 4c note that the evaluation of local cake thicknesses should be immune to the light attenuation at the cake membrane interface thereby supporting the analysis for the long term scaling in a more reliable way a possible explanation for the continuing flux decline is that the degree of supersaturation could be maintained for a relatively long period by the cake enhanced concentration polarization chong et al 2008 i e a more severe polarized concentration profile caused by the lower mass transfer rate within the cake layer as a result the growth of the deposited crystals or the secondary nucleation in the voids formed by the deposited crystals i e a process similar to the crystallization in porous materials scherer 1999 would compact the scaling layer in some regions close to the cake membrane interface the compacted scaling layer could have some pores with a size within the range dominated by the kelvin effect fisher 1981 mitropoulos 2008 that is the vapor pressure could be substantially depressed owing to the liquid vapor interface that was curved toward the hydrophilic pore this hypothesis is consistent with prior studies chew et al 2014 goh et al 2013 tan et al 2016 that unraveled the vapor pressure depression when examining the flux decline resulting from the deposition of organic foulants the local growth rates i e the variation in the local cake thickness per unit time were approximately evaluated by comparing the digitalized cake layers obtained at two consecutive times the distribution of local growth rates is demonstrated by the red blue plot where the positive i e the deposition and negative i e the removal growth rates are denoted in red and blue respectively a sequence of representative red blue plots obtained at various times is displayed in fig 5 evidently showing three periods that are characteristic of distinct striping patterns in contrast to the scattered active regions in the red blue plots for the initial period t 250 min the scanned area is dominated by red stripes that are oriented in parallel with the crossflow although striping phenomena have been reported in prior studies that were based on ultrafiltration larsen 1991 li et al 2016 liu et al 2020a 2020b and forward osmosis liu et al 2020a to the best knowledge it is for the first time that stripe like patterns were resolved in a scaling process in md in terms of the linear stability analysis by larsen larsen 1991 the periodic deposition of foulant particles can be explained by the interplay between the polarized boundary layer and the fluctuated permeate flux however more complex mechanisms should be involved in the boundary layer in md since the vapor flux is dominated by the interfacial temperature it is not straightforward to simply extend the larsen model to the coupled mass and heat transfer on the other hand it can be seen that the patterns formed by alternating red and blue stripes are actually varied over time despite the predominance of red stripes corresponding to the rapid development of the scaling layer more blue stripes are resolved with relatively high spatial frequencies in the plots for the long term scaling t 270 min the increase in the blue stripes i e areas dominated by the removal of particles can be an indicator of higher shear rates since the channel was narrowed by the growing scaling layer moreover it is consistent with the variation in the average of local thicknesses fig 4c indicating that a dynamic equilibrium between the deposition and removal of crystals was established 4 conclusions the scaling of caso4 in md was studied using a mode associated with the concept of mszw the caso4 containing feed was gradually concentrated such that the temporal resolution could be enhanced for the scaling characterization the flux decline was analyzed in terms of the evolving cake layer that was digitalized using the oct datasets it was revealed that the reduction in evaporation rate could be dominated by different mechanisms as the cake layer of crystals was formed on the membrane surface instead of a random deposition process the striping phenomenon was visualized by mapping the local growth rates indicating that the temperature polarization could play an important role in inducing instability in the boundary layer all these observations confirm that the scaling of caso4 in md is a process in which various transport phenomena are coupled in a complex way it is desirable that mechanistic models with improved accuracy would be developed on the basis of these observations on the other hand the oct based characterization provided evidence for the membrane deformation resulting from the scaling of caso4 which should be of great value in understanding possible membrane damage during a md process the ability of resolving the precipitation kinetics in the boundary layer further confirms that oct can be explored to quantitatively study scaling processes in md with advantages absent in conventional characterization declaration of competing interest the authors
