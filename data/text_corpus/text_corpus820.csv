4100,barriers consisting of a composite geomembrane gmb and compacted clay liner ccl are the most widely used systems for the landfill bottom liner it is anticipated that for the case of intact gmb the ccl remains unsaturated under the thermal gradient sourcing from the decomposition of the wastes the existing knowledge on the effects of such coupled thermo hydraulic conditions on the leakage of organic compounds are rather limited an analytical solution is proposed to the non isothermal diffusion of organic compounds in the unsaturated gmb ccl composite liner the solution is based on the separation of variables for one dimensional problem which is tested against two benchmarks to demonstrate the accuracy of the solution the influences of thermal diffusion temperature dependent parameters and unsaturated water distribution on the overall transport of contaminant in the system were investigated the results show that the thermal gradient can affect the contaminant diffusion in two ways i by the soret effect and ii by the temperature dependent coefficient in gmb it is indicated that the contaminant concentration and flux can be significantly reduced when the state of underlying liner transfers from saturated to unsaturated the effect of unsaturated water distribution should be considered when the unsaturated exponent is larger than 0 1 m 1 keywords thermal

landfills due to their low permeability and relatively good compatibility with the leachate contaminant traditionally the investigation of contaminant transport through the liner system is conducted using simplified pure diffusion models based on the assumption of isothermal and saturated media touze foltz et al 2021 in reality however temperature of leachate may reach 410 k due to the heat generated by the reactive waste rowe and hoor 2009 stark et al 2012 rowe 2012 xie et al 2016 bouazza et al 2017 for example hot leachate is reported to have a long term 5 years level of temperature ranging from 330 k to 350 k which continuously acts on the lining system bouazza et al 2017 additionally the underlying liner is normally unsaturated as the landfills are commonly constructed in arid or semiarid areas lin and yeh 2020 chen et al 2019 the soil layer beneath the liner with a good constructive and intact gmb was reported to have a low water content in western areas of china liu and hu 2014 field tests demonstrated that unsaturated zone can commonly exist beneath a landfill which may lead to a conservative prediction of contaminant transport by the assumption of saturated soil beneath gmb king et al 1993 the non linear distribution of water content with depth in the unsaturated ccl can result in non linear variations of the effective diffusion coefficient in ccl studies conducted by çelik et al 2009 demonstrated that a substantial overestimation of the leakage by up to a factor of 3 5 was observed when the assessments are based on considering a fully saturated ccl chen et al 2019 showed that the contaminant released rate is controlled by the groundwater depth and water content distribution in unsaturated liner it is well known that a temperature gradient can induce mass flow chemicals in fluid and porous media as thermal diffusion processes e g soret ludwig effect or soret effect which is usually considered as a second order transport process compared to the molecular diffusion however the importance of soret effect on the non isothermal diffusion is well recognized as a non negligible governing mechanism of mass flow which is evident from experimental and analytical research e g longhurst 1985 costesèque et al 2002 in addition the effective diffusion coefficient of chemicals is reported as a temperature dependent parameter e g lasaga 2014 for example the recent experimental findings by jones and rowe 2016 and mcwatters et al 2016 have suggested that all geomembranes showed a decrease in partitioning sorption capacity diffusion and overall permeation coefficients with decreasing temperature therefore in addition to the direct influence by the thermal diffusion temperature dependent parameters in gmb may indirectly affect the non isothermal contaminant diffusion through liner system predictive capability for a quantitative assessment of the effects of non isothermal and unsaturated conditions on contaminant transport is necessary for designing an effective and well operational liner system the long term impacts of combinations of moisture distribution thermal diffusion and extent of the dependency of properties such as temperature dependent permeation of gmb are of particular interest the existing mathematical models for coupled thermal diffusion and chemical transport in unsaturated porous media e g sedighi 2011 thomas et al 2012 sedighi et al 2018 are mainly numerically resolved e g finite element the developments of analytical solutions for such coupled mathematical problems are rather very limited due to the non linearity involved e g depth dependent water distribution and temperature dependent coefficients an analytical solution to the contaminant migration problem in unsaturated gmb ccl composite liner has recently been proposed by chen et al 2019 and further simplified by lin and yeh 2020 however such analytical solutions disregard the influence of thermally coupled processes thermal diffusion and dependency of properties on temperature can pose considerable influence on chemical transport xie et al 2015 yan et al 2020 peng et al 2021 for example the permeation coefficient of vocs in gmb has been shown to decrease by two orders of magnitude when temperature varies from 295 k to 313 k to the best knowledge of the authors no analytical solution has been presented to consider the combined effects of non isothermal and unsaturated conditions in composite liners this paper aims to address the gap in knowledge in relation to extent of the direct effect of thermal diffusion unsaturated water distribution and indirect effect of temperature dependency of the transport parameters on the overall transport of contaminant in an intact composite liner system an analytical solution for thermally coupled contaminant transport in an unsaturated gmb ccl composite liner is presented the separation of variable approach is applied to derive a solution for the multi physics problem the accuracy of the solution is examined against two benchmarks in addition examples of contaminant diffusion under the non isothermal and unsaturated conditions are presented to demonstrate the influences of thermal diffusion temperature dependent parameters and unsaturated water distribution on the overall transport of contaminant in the system 2 non isothermal diffusion of chemical in unsaturated composite liner the conceptual model of a landfill composite liner system is shown in fig 1 the composite liner is composed of an intact gmb and a ccl the thicknesses of gmb and ccl are lg and ls respectively the organic compounds can diffuse through an intact gmb the major mechanisms controlling the reactive transport migration of chemical in ccl include molecular diffusion thermo diffusion and adsorption it is noted that considering the low hydraulic conductivity of ccl the advection is neglected the chemical diffusion in an intact gmb can be described by the fick s second law xie et al 2016 1 c g t x d g c g x where t is time and x is the distance c g and d g are the chemical concentration and diffusion coefficient in gmb the general governing equation for multicomponent chemical diffusion in clay under coupled electrochemical and thermal potentials e g sedighi 2011 thomas et al 2012 can be simplified for the one dimensional problem of diffusion of a single chemical species as 2 θ l c s t s t x τ d s θ l c s x x τ d t θ l t x where c s represents the concentration of chemical θ l stands for the volumetric liquid content τ is tortuosity d s is the molecular diffusion coefficient of the chemical d t is thermal diffusion coefficient s is the sorption and t is temperature we adopt a linear isotherm sorption model as follows yan et al 2021 3 s ρ s κ d c s where ρ s is the density of solid phase and κ d is the partitioning of the contaminant thermal diffusion coefficient of a single chemical species is described by yan et al 2020 4 d t d s s t c s where s t is soret coefficient the heat transfer is described based on the fourier s law 5 c p ρ t t x k λ t x where c p ρ and k λ are density thermal capacity and conductivity of ccl respectively in the scope of this study the heat transfer is assumed to be at steady state whilst a transient chemical diffusion under the concentration and thermal potentials is considered eq 2 the assumption of the steady state heat transfer is based on the fact that the thermal process can normally reach equilibrium more quickly than the chemical distribution through pure diffusion e g leaist and hui 1990 thomas et al 2012 xie et al 2015 the solution to eq 5 for one dimensional heat transfer under steady state condition can be expressed as follows 6 t a t x b t where a t and b t are constants and dependent only on the boundary conditions of the problem the volumetric liquid content θ l can be expressed as gardner 1958 7 θ l θ r θ s θ r e β ψ where θ s and θ r are the saturation and residual volumetric liquid contents respectively ψ is the pressure head β is the unsaturated exponent related to the particle distribution of clay the unsaturated exponent has been reported to be controlled by several factors including stress level zhou and ng 2014 and anisotropy zhou and chen 2021 in the analytical model presented here the unsaturated exponent is assumed to be constant to simplify the problem and derive the analytical solution the hydraulic head h in the clay is the sum of the pressure head ψ and elevation head l u z l u is the thickness of unsaturated zone which is assumed to be equal to the thickness of clay in this study if the flow in unsaturated composite liner is considered under hydrostatic equilibrium h in the composite remains zero which result in ψ z l u the residual volumetric liquid content is small and neglected therefore eq 7 can be simplified as 8 θ l θ s e β z l u substituting eqns 3 4 6 and 8 into eq 2 the diffusion of contaminant in unsaturated ccl under steady state heat transfer can be presented as 9 r d c s t τ d s 2 c s x 2 τ β d s τ d s s t a t c s x τ β d s s t a t c s where r d 1 ρ s κ d θ l in this study r d is assumed as a constant and expressed as r d 1 ρ s κ d θ s as the change of water content is small based on the results from the field data and numerical solution lin and yeh 2020 2 1 initial and boundary conditions the initial conditions for the chemical concentration distribution in the composite liner are assumed to be 10 c g x 0 c s x 0 0 the contaminant concentration in the leachate is assumed to be constant c0 chen et al 2009 the top boundary condition at the interface between gmb and the leachate can be expressed as 11 c g l g t c 0 s gf where s gf is the partition coefficient between the gmb and leachate the continuity condition for the concentration and flux at the interface between the gmb and ccl can be expressed by 12 c g 0 t c s 0 t s gf 13 d g c g 0 t x θ l d s c s 0 t x two types of bottom boundary conditions are considered in this study the first boundary condition is the dirichlet boundary condition dbc 14 c s l s t 0 where l s is the length of domain the boundary condition described by eq 14 can represent the underlying layer of the composite liner is an aquifer which can remove the all contaminants instantaneously yan et al 2021 the second boundary condition considered for the outflow boundary is the neumann boundary condition nbc and represents an impermeable boundary e g aquitard yan et al 2019 15 c s l s t x 0 3 analytical solution the gmb layer is thin e g l g 2 5 m m compared to the ccl therefore the contaminant flux in gmb may be approximated as the concentration difference between the top and the bottom of the gmb as follows lin and yeh 2020 16 d g c g x d g c g z 0 c g z l g l g from eqns 11 13 the contaminant flux through the gmb to the underlying ccl becomes 17 γ c s 0 t x c s 0 t c 0 where 18 γ l g θ l d s s gf d g several normalized and dimensionless coefficients are introduced to simplify the governing equation of contaminant transport in ccl eq 9 as follows 19 x x l s 20 t t r d l s 2 τ d s 21 p e p e 1 p e 2 β l s s t a t l s 22 d a β s t a t l s 2 where x is the characteristic length and t t is the characteristic time p e is the peclet number for which p e 1 and p e 2 stands for the advection induced by water content distribution and thermal diffusion respectively d a is the damkohler number substituting the normalized coefficients listed in eqns 21 22 into eq 9 leads to 23 c s t t 2 c s x 2 p e c s x d a c s in order to derive the analytical solution to the proposed mathematical model eq 23 the inhomogeneous boundary conditions eq 17 were converted to homogeneous conditions by adopting the principle of superposition for the linear equations as 24 c s x t t c s t x t t c s s x where c s s x is the steady state solution to the problem that fulfils the inhomogeneous boundary conditions and c s t x t t is the transient solution that fulfils the homogeneous boundary conditions the governing equation for the sub problem involving c s s x and c s t x t t are as follows 25 d 2 c s s x d x 2 p e d c s s x d x d a c s s x 0 26 c s t x t t t 2 c s t x t t x 2 p e c s t x t t x d a c s the general solution to the ordinary differential eq 25 is 27 c s s x a 1 exp x p e α 2 a 2 exp x p e α 2 28 α p e 2 4 d a where a1 and a2 are constants which are given in appendix a the solution to the partial differential eq 26 can be facilitated by introducing a transform defined as 29 c s t x t t w x t t exp d a p e 2 4 t p e x 2 substituting eq 29 into eq 26 gives the transformed governing equation 30 w x t t t 2 w x t t x 2 the boundary and initial conditions in eqns 10 14 15 and 17 are replaced by 31 w x 0 c s s x e p e x 2 32 γ w 0 t t x w 0 t t 33 w 1 t t 0 34 w 1 t t x p e 2 w 1 t t where eq 32 is known as the robin type boundary condition or the third type boundary condition which is taken as a flux matching relationship between the gmb and ccl the robin boundary condition can be reduced to dirichlet boundary condition if γ is zero contrarily it can stand for neumann boundary condition when γ tends to be infinite this implies that γ may induce a significantly influence on contaminant transport in the composite liner system the general solution to eq 30 can be derived by applying separation of variables and given as 35 w x t t n 1 c n e λ n 2 t t λ n cos λ n x sin λ n x where λ n is the eigenvalue of the problem the coefficient c n is obtained using the orthogonality of the eigenfunction details of the separation of variables and the expression of the coefficients are provided in appendix b the solution of c s x t t can be obtained by combining eqns 24 27 29 and 35 36 c s x t t a 1 e

migration through composite liner is examined against two bench marks including i the proposed analytical solution against finite element approach fea of the same problem and ii thermo diffusion of chloride cl through unsaturated soil which were developed based on experimental results by nassar et al 1992 4 1 test 1 comparison with numerical model fea the problem considered for the verification exercise is a 1 5 mm gmb 1 m ccl composite liner in which the coupled effects of thermal diffusion and unsaturated water distribution is studied the proposed analytical solution is compared with alternative finite element analysis comsol multiphysics fea of the same problem the convergence of the fea model was tested first by using systematic mesh refinement to its geometry until grid independent results were obtained the meshing of the model s geometry was finally optimized to the predefined finer physics based mesh elements further details of comsol simulations can be found in the supplemental material dichloromethane dcm was chosen to stand for the leachate constituents in landfill a typical vocs in landfill leachate yan et al 2021 the diffusion and partition coefficients of dcm in gmb are dg 8 86 10 13 m2 s and sgf 2 13 respectively park et al 2012a park et al 2012b the diffusivity of dcm and soret coefficient in ccl are τ d s 1 53 10 10 m2 s and st 0 01 k 1 respectively the retardation factors rd are assumed to be 1 26 lin and yeh 2020 the concentration of dcm in the leachate is set as 1 mg l temperature at top boundary is assumed to be constant 353 k and temperature at bottom boundary is assumed to be fixed at 293 k yan et al 2020 the saturated volumetric liquid content and unsaturated exponent are θ s 0 55 and β 0 01 m 1 the value of input parameters for test1 is listed in table 1 fig 2 a and 2b show the spatial concentration profile of dcm under dirichlet bc and neumann bc respectively the results of analytical model proposed here match the results of using the fea the present model performs well in describing contaminant diffusion and thermo diffusion through unsaturated composite liner 4 2 analysis of thermo diffusion in unsaturated soil we adopt an experimental study reported by nassar et al 1992 to investigate the accuracy of the proposed analytical model for the effect of thermo diffusion and unsaturated water content distribution on chloride cl transport a schematic diagram of experimental test is shown in fig 3 the length of soil column analysed is 10 cm the initial concentration of cl in the sample is 0 1 m the left side and right side of sample are zero flux boundary temperature applied at the left side and right side of cell was 282 k and 288 k respectively in the experimental programme adopted in this test the soil columns were sectioned at 60 h fig 4 c and 156 h fig 4d after the experiment initiated in the simulations the effective diffusivity of cl and the soret coefficient of the soil sample were assumed be τ d c l 4 10 10 m2 s and st 0 5 k 1 respectively the calibration parameters to describe the unsaturated water content distribution are θ s 0 21 and β 5 5 m 1 the value of parameters used in this section is provided in table 1 a schematic diagram of thermo diffusion in unsaturated soil column is also shown in fig 3 comparisons of temperature profiles between the simulation by eq 6 and experimental data are shown in fig 4a the comparison of unsaturated water content profile between this study eq 8 and experimental data is shown in fig 4b the profiles of the cl concentration at t 60 h and t 156 h calculated using the present model were compared with those reported from the experiment which are shown in fig 4c and fig 4d respectively the distributions of temperature and water content obtained by the simplified heat transfer and water transport equation correlates well with the experimental data the profiles of relative concentrations over time obtained by the experiments and those obtained by the proposed analytical solution are in close agreement the above results provide further confidence on the accuracy of the analytical solution under the conditions of this validation exercise it can be seen that despite the fact that zero flux boundaries are applied at the left and right boundary see fig 3 the concentration of cl at the left side is smaller compared to the concentration at the right side both model prediction and experimental measurements show the movement of cl toward the hot end the concentration of cl calculated using pure diffusion in saturated soil black dot lines and unsaturated soil black solid lines is plotted in fig 4c and fig 4d for better comparison with the model developed in this study the above results indicate the significant contributions of thermal diffusion and unsaturated water content distribution to migration of solute in soil 5 model applications in this section thermally induced diffusion of contaminant in unsaturated non isothermal composite liner is discussed the main objective is to evaluate the extent of the effects of primary governing processes e g soret effect and water content distribution and parameters e g temperature dependent coefficient on contaminant transport processes the effect of temperature on the performance of composite liner will be investigated first sec 5 1 the case is then extended to discuss the effect of unsaturated water content distribution sec 5 2 a design diagrams of the composite liner system using the present model is provided in sec 5 3 additionally a sensitivity analysis of various parameters on the performance of the gmb ccl composite barrier system will be provided in sec 5 4 5 1 temperature effects on performance of composite liner system the problem considered is the case that benzene diffusion through the unsaturated non isothermal composite liner the thickness of gmb and ccl is 1 5 mm and 1 m respectively the diffusivity of benzene and soret coefficient in ccl are τ d s 7 10 10 m2 s and st 0 01 k 1 respectively the retardation factors rd are assumed to be 1 31 the concentration of benzene in the leachate is set at 1 mg l temperature at bottom boundary is fixed at 293 k the saturated volumetric liquid content and unsaturated exponent are θ s 0 55 and β 0 1 m 1 the required input parameters are listed in table 1 the interest in particular is to obtain an evaluation of the contributions of soret effect st temperature dependent diffusion dg t and partitioning coefficient sgf t in gmb on the overall process the influence of the temperature dependent coefficients in gmb are recently investigated by experimental studies jones and rowe 2016 mcwatters et al 2016 the experimental observations indicated that the effectiveness of the gmb as a diffusion barrier can significantly decrease with the increase of temperature although the study conducted by yan et al 2020 indicates that the temperature dependent diffusion coefficient ds t in ccl may contribute to the migration of contaminant however ds t is assumed to be a constant due to the limitation of analytical solution proposed in this study it should be noted that the assumption of constant diffusion coefficient ds t in ccl may lead to a more conservative results compared to the case with temperature dependent diffusion coefficient 5 1 1 influence of temperature dependent coefficients in gmb the geomembrane is an important component of landfill liner system designed to minimize the transport of contaminants sourcing from the leachate to the underlying groundwater the key properties which define the diffusive characteristics of gmb are the diffusion coefficient dg and partitioning coefficient sgf and their product the permeation coefficient pg dg sgf the permeation coefficient can represent the combined influence of partitioning and diffusion processes the recent findings by jones and rowe 2016 mcwatters et al 2016 have suggested that all geomembranes showed a decrease in partitioning sorptive capacity diffusion and overall permeation coefficients with decreasing temperature the temperature dependent partitioning diffusion and permeation coefficients can be related by the arrhenius equation as given in eqns 37 39 naylor 1989 chainey 1990 37 d g t d g 0 e e d r t 38 s gf t s gf 0 e δ h s r t 39 p g t p g 0 e e p r t where e d is activation energy for diffusion j mol δ h s is heat of solution of the compound j mol and e p is activation energy for permeation j mol d g 0 s gf 0 and p g 0 are pre exponential coefficients for diffusion partitioning and permeation respectively r is universal gas constant fig 5 shows a comparison between the permeation coefficients calculated by arrhenius correlation and experimental data at different temperature for ethylbenzene toluene and benzene the horizontal axis is the inverse of temperature 1 t and the vertical axis is the natural logarithm of the permeation coefficient ln p g t the value of calculated arrhenius parameters for hdpe gmb for different vocs is listed in table 2 the temperature dependency of permeation coefficients p g t calculated using eq 39 correlates well with the experimental data see fig 5 a similar general trend is observed for all of the vocs the permeation coefficients showed an increase with the increase of temperature for example the value of p g t shows two orders of magnitude increase when temperature increases from 295 k to 313 k it can be concluded from the results that temperature changes can have significant impacts on the performance of gmb as a diffusive barrier within the scope and conditions of the problem considered in order to evaluate the influence of temperature dependent coefficients in gmb on the contaminant transport three simulation cases scenarios have been designed which include case 1 which includes molecular diffusion of contaminant under ambient isothermal 293 k conditions case 2 which includes combined effects of molecular diffusion and soret effect without considering the influence of temperature dependent coefficient in gmb case 3 for which the combined effects of diffusion soret effect and temperature dependent coefficient in gmb are considered the comparison between case 1 and case 2 can provide evidences on the influence of soret effect the comparison between case 2 and case 3 can highlight the influence of temperature dependent coefficient in gmb a comparison between cases 1 2 and 3 can reveal the relative importance of soret effect and temperature dependent coefficient in gmb fig 6 a and 6b present a comparison between the contaminant concentration profile at 10 years for the three cases under dirichlet boundary condition and neumann boundary condition respectively fig 7 a and 7b present a comparison between the contaminant bottom concentration and bottom flux with time for the different simulation cases significant differences can be found for the contaminant concentration profiles bottom concentration and bottom flux among these three cases as shown in fig 6b the bottom concentrations for the case 1 case 2 and case 3 are 0 14 mg l 0 18 mg l and 0 22 mg l respectively the steady state bottom flux for case 1 is 1 35 and 1 4 times smaller than those calculated for the case 2 and case 3 respectively see fig 7a the above results demonstrate the importance of the thermally coupled processes for the migration of contaminant in gmb ccl composite liner system it can be observed that the contaminant migration in the unsaturated composite liner is enhanced by thermal diffusion and under the conditions of the cases at a considerable level this is evident from the results of concentrations and flux calculated for the case 2 which is considerably larger than that of case 1 fig 6 and fig 7 in addition the temperature dependent coefficients in gmb can considerably enhance the rate of contaminant migration in the system as the contaminant concentration and flux observed for the case 3 is much larger compared to the other cases this observation indicates that the variation of p g t with temperature is non negligible part when the effects of temperature on contaminant migration are studied which is especially important at elevated temperatures at which p g t considerably increases with temperature refer to fig 5 in summary the results presented in figs 6 and 7 demonstrate that temperature can affect the contaminant diffusion through unsaturated composite liner in two ways i by the soret effect and ii by the temperature dependent coefficient in gmb 5 1 2 influence of thermal diffusion at ambient temperature the value of soret coefficient has been reported to range from 10 2 and 10 3 k 1 for organic mixtures or aqueous solutions platten 2006 in certain circumstances it could even reach 0 2 k 1 xie et al 2015 thus the range of soret coefficient chosen in this study is from 0 001 to 0 2 k 1 the range of temperature difference between the upper and the bottom surfaces of composite liner is from 0 to nearly 100 k the variations of bottom concentration and flux of the gmb ccl composite liner at 10 and 20 years with soret coefficient and temperature difference are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the bottom flux and concentration increase with the increase of soret coefficient and temperature difference this is due to the fact that thermal diffusion process is enhanced with the increase of s t and δ t the iso potential line with a value of 0 2 mg year represents the breakthrough flux marked as black dash liner in this case fig 8a and 8b the left area of the breakthrough line stands for un breakthrough zone contrarily the right area of the breakthrough line represents breakthrough zone it can be seen that the un breakthrough zone increasingly decreases with the increase of time similar trends can be observed in fig 8c and 8d the results of the series of simulation presented demonstrate that the contaminant transport in the composite liner is enhanced by thermal diffusion and under the conditions of the cases at a considerable level 5 2 influence of unsaturated water content distribution in this part the particular interest is to obtain an understanding of the effects of unsaturated water content distribution on contaminant migration through unsaturated gmb ccl composite liner the unsaturated exponent β is usually used to describe the water pressure condition when clay water content is stable in this section three values of β i e 0 1 and 5 m 1 are selected to stand for the water distribution conditions in particular β 0 represents the composite liner is saturated fig 9 shows the unsaturated water content distribution profile for different simulation cases it can be seen that when β increases from 0 to 1 the water content at the top of the composite liner decreases 0 55 to 0 2 and the state changes from saturated to unsaturated fig 10 a and 10b present a comparison between the contaminant concentration profile at 10 years for the three cases e g saturated β 1 m 1 and β 5 m 1 under dirichlet boundary condition and neumann boundary condition respectively it can be seen that the contaminant concentration profiles significantly decrease with the increase of β which leads to the state of composite liner transferring from saturated to unsaturated this is mainly due to the fact that the decrease of water content distribution can lead to a decrease of contaminant diffusion coefficient in the composite liner which may provide a better diffusion barrier fig 11 presents the effects of unsaturated exponent β on the steady state contaminant flux it can be seen that when β is larger than 1 m 1 the steady state bottom flux shows a considerable increase with the β however when β is smaller than 0 1 m 1 the effect of β is less significant on the steady state flux for instance the steady state flux for the case with β 0 1 m 1 and s t 0 01 k 1 can be only 1 04 times larger than the case with β 0 01 m 1 and s t 0 01 k 1 these results indicated that unsaturated water content distribution should be considered for contaminant diffusion through gmb ccl composite liner when the unsaturated exponent β is larger than 0 1 m 1 additionally the effect of s t on bottom flux decreases with the increase of β for example the difference of steady state flux for the case with β 10 m 1 under different s t is negligible see fig 11 it demonstrated that the unsaturated water content distribution may play a more important role compared to thermal diffusion processes when unsaturated exponent β is larger than 1 m 1 5 3 potential applications for development of design diagrams dichloromethane dcm was chosen to stand for the leachate constituents in landfill in this section the concentration of dcm in the landfill leachate is 4 15 mg l chen et al 2015 based on the drinking water standard mhprc 2006 the limit concentration of dcm in the groundwater is 0 02 mg l temperature values in the leachate and groundwater are assumed to be 353 k and 293 k respectively the problem is based on specified concentration of leachate constituent for a 30 year transit time of a landfill the design procedure for the landfill liner using the present analytical solution can be expressed as follows the desired relative concentration of dcm is 40 c n c c 0 0 02 4 15 0 004 a breakthrough curve of dcm under different thickness of ccl is provided in fig 12 the desired construction of composite liner is plotted by grey zone in fig 12 it is shown that the composite liner may not meet the requirement that the breakthrough time should be larger than 30 years if the thickness of ccl is smaller than 1 5 m for example the earlier breakthrough of dcm can be found at 4 years and 15 years for the case with ls 0 6 m and 1 m respectively it is noted that the minimum ccl thickness of around 1 5 m will meet the requirement of the specified leachate concentration criterion for dcm increasing the thickness of ccl can delay the breakthrough of dcm and provide longer term protection to the surrounding environments from pollution 5 4 sensitivity analysis in this section two sensitivity coefficients including the normalized sensitivity coefficient x k and differential importance measure dim k are introduced to investigate the effects of various parameters on the performance of the gmb ccl composite barrier system the normalized sensitivity coefficient x k is widely utilized for the efficient comparison of various parameters having different units and especially having different orders of magnitudes lin and yeh 2020 x k is defined as the partial derivative of the model dependent variable for a specific parameter p k 41 x k p k 0 l s c s x t p k d x p k where 0 l s c s x t d x is the amount of contaminant in the domain at any elapse time x k indicates the sensitivity of 0 l s c s x t p

this study the differential importance measure dim k is introduced by borgonovo and apostolakis 2001 which is widely utilized for the decision making of risk management dim k is given as 43 dim k δ p k 0 l s c x t p k d x p k j 1 n δ p j 0 l s c x t p j d x p j x k j 1 n x j where n is the total number of the parameters of interest the parameters of interest in this study are β θ s s t at and pg the sensitivity analysis of β and θ s can highlight the influence of water content distribution in the system s t at and pg provide evidences on the influence of temperature a comparison among these parameters can reveal relative importance of temperature variations and unsaturated water content distribution on contaminant migration through the gmb ccl composite liner fig 13 a and 13b show the distribution curves of x k at different time for dirichlet boundary and neuman boundary respectively a positive x k demonstrates that an increase of a specific parameter can result in an increase in 0 l s c s x t d x contrarily a negative indicates the increase of a specific parameter leading to a decrease in 0 l s c s x t d x it can be seen that the distribution curves of x k for all parameters have a similar trend for the case with dirichlet bc and neumann bc the increase of s t at and p g provides a positive feedback to the system however the increase of β and θ s may reduce the amount of contaminant in the domain the above observations coincide with phenomena shown in figs 6 11 the effects of the variation in parameters at on the migration of contaminant is most significant compared to the other parameters on the other hand the effects of the changes in β and s t are small before 1 year however after that time a rapid change is observed fig 14 a and 14b show the distribution curves of dim k at different time for dirichlet boundary and neuman boundary respectively the measure dim k provides a good indication for the parameter effect in this case as shown in fig 14afig15 the parameter at procures the largest effect followed by θ s pg s t and β this is due to the fact that at are the main parameter which directly affects the thermal diffusion process and temperature dependent coefficients in gmb it can be observed that θ s and pg show a similar effect while s t and β produce a negligible influence on the migration of contaminant before 1 year after 1 year s t becomes the most sensitive parameter followed by β θ s pg and at the decrease of dim k with time is observed for the parameters of θ s and pg the result indicated that the soret effect may play an increasingly significant role in the migration of contaminant at the meantime the effects of temperature dependent coefficient in gmb and unsaturated water distribution increasingly decrease with time these results indicated that the parameters associated with the temperature and unsaturated water distribution play an important role in contaminant migration in the composite gmb ccl liner especially the long term impacts of combined effects of unsaturated water distribution thermal diffusion and temperature dependent parameters on contaminant transport through the composite liner system are non negligible part for designing a stable effective and well operational liner system 6 conclusions we presented analytical solutions to the one dimensional contaminant diffusion in non isothermal and unsaturated gmb ccl composite liner which utilizes the separation of variable to derive a solution for the multi physics problem the solution was tested against two benchmarks which demonstrate successful development of the solution to the mathematical problem the examples provided for contaminant diffusion under the non isothermal and unsaturated conditions demonstrate the influences of thermal diffusion temperature dependent parameters and unsaturated water distribution on the overall transport of contaminant in the system the specific conclusions form this work are as follows 1 temperature can affect the contaminant diffusion through composite liner in two ways i by the soret effect and ii by the temperature dependent coefficient in gmb the value of permeation coefficient shows two orders of magnitude decrease when the temperature varies from 295 k to 313 k in addition the contaminant flux and concentration under non isothermal conditions can be 1 6 and 1 4 times larger than that of the case with isothermal conditions the results demonstrate the importance of the thermally coupled processes for the migration of contaminant in gmb ccl composite liner system 2 contaminant concentration and flux significantly decrease when the state of underlying liner transferring from saturated to unsaturated this is mainly due to the fact that the decrease of water content distribution can lead to a decrease of effective diffusion coefficient of contaminant under the conditions of the problem considered we show a threshold of unsaturated exponent β 0 1 m 1 where the unsaturated water distribution can induce a large influence on contaminant transport additionally unsaturated water content distribution may play a more important role compared to thermal diffusion processes when unsaturated exponent is larger than 1 m 1 3 two sensitivity coefficients e g x k and dim k are introduced to investigate the effects of various parameters on the performance of the gmb ccl composite barrier system the results indicated that the parameter at procures the largest effect followed by θ s pg s t and β the increase of s t at and p g provides a positive feedback to the system however the increase of β and θ s may reduce the amount of contaminant in the domain credit authorship contribution statement huaxiang yan conceptualization data curation methodology

4100,barriers consisting of a composite geomembrane gmb and compacted clay liner ccl are the most widely used systems for the landfill bottom liner it is anticipated that for the case of intact gmb the ccl remains unsaturated under the thermal gradient sourcing from the decomposition of the wastes the existing knowledge on the effects of such coupled thermo hydraulic conditions on the leakage of organic compounds are rather limited an analytical solution is proposed to the non isothermal diffusion of organic compounds in the unsaturated gmb ccl composite liner the solution is based on the separation of variables for one dimensional problem which is tested against two benchmarks to demonstrate the accuracy of the solution the influences of thermal diffusion temperature dependent parameters and unsaturated water distribution on the overall transport of contaminant in the system were investigated the results show that the thermal gradient can affect the contaminant diffusion in two ways i by the soret effect and ii by the temperature dependent coefficient in gmb it is indicated that the contaminant concentration and flux can be significantly reduced when the state of underlying liner transfers from saturated to unsaturated the effect of unsaturated water distribution should be considered when the unsaturated exponent is larger than 0 1 m 1 keywords thermal

landfills due to their low permeability and relatively good compatibility with the leachate contaminant traditionally the investigation of contaminant transport through the liner system is conducted using simplified pure diffusion models based on the assumption of isothermal and saturated media touze foltz et al 2021 in reality however temperature of leachate may reach 410 k due to the heat generated by the reactive waste rowe and hoor 2009 stark et al 2012 rowe 2012 xie et al 2016 bouazza et al 2017 for example hot leachate is reported to have a long term 5 years level of temperature ranging from 330 k to 350 k which continuously acts on the lining system bouazza et al 2017 additionally the underlying liner is normally unsaturated as the landfills are commonly constructed in arid or semiarid areas lin and yeh 2020 chen et al 2019 the soil layer beneath the liner with a good constructive and intact gmb was reported to have a low water content in western areas of china liu and hu 2014 field tests demonstrated that unsaturated zone can commonly exist beneath a landfill which may lead to a conservative prediction of contaminant transport by the assumption of saturated soil beneath gmb king et al 1993 the non linear distribution of water content with depth in the unsaturated ccl can result in non linear variations of the effective diffusion coefficient in ccl studies conducted by çelik et al 2009 demonstrated that a substantial overestimation of the leakage by up to a factor of 3 5 was observed when the assessments are based on considering a fully saturated ccl chen et al 2019 showed that the contaminant released rate is controlled by the groundwater depth and water content distribution in unsaturated liner it is well known that a temperature gradient can induce mass flow chemicals in fluid and porous media as thermal diffusion processes e g soret ludwig effect or soret effect which is usually considered as a second order transport process compared to the molecular diffusion however the importance of soret effect on the non isothermal diffusion is well recognized as a non negligible governing mechanism of mass flow which is evident from experimental and analytical research e g longhurst 1985 costesèque et al 2002 in addition the effective diffusion coefficient of chemicals is reported as a temperature dependent parameter e g lasaga 2014 for example the recent experimental findings by jones and rowe 2016 and mcwatters et al 2016 have suggested that all geomembranes showed a decrease in partitioning sorption capacity diffusion and overall permeation coefficients with decreasing temperature therefore in addition to the direct influence by the thermal diffusion temperature dependent parameters in gmb may indirectly affect the non isothermal contaminant diffusion through liner system predictive capability for a quantitative assessment of the effects of non isothermal and unsaturated conditions on contaminant transport is necessary for designing an effective and well operational liner system the long term impacts of combinations of moisture distribution thermal diffusion and extent of the dependency of properties such as temperature dependent permeation of gmb are of particular interest the existing mathematical models for coupled thermal diffusion and chemical transport in unsaturated porous media e g sedighi 2011 thomas et al 2012 sedighi et al 2018 are mainly numerically resolved e g finite element the developments of analytical solutions for such coupled mathematical problems are rather very limited due to the non linearity involved e g depth dependent water distribution and temperature dependent coefficients an analytical solution to the contaminant migration problem in unsaturated gmb ccl composite liner has recently been proposed by chen et al 2019 and further simplified by lin and yeh 2020 however such analytical solutions disregard the influence of thermally coupled processes thermal diffusion and dependency of properties on temperature can pose considerable influence on chemical transport xie et al 2015 yan et al 2020 peng et al 2021 for example the permeation coefficient of vocs in gmb has been shown to decrease by two orders of magnitude when temperature varies from 295 k to 313 k to the best knowledge of the authors no analytical solution has been presented to consider the combined effects of non isothermal and unsaturated conditions in composite liners this paper aims to address the gap in knowledge in relation to extent of the direct effect of thermal diffusion unsaturated water distribution and indirect effect of temperature dependency of the transport parameters on the overall transport of contaminant in an intact composite liner system an analytical solution for thermally coupled contaminant transport in an unsaturated gmb ccl composite liner is presented the separation of variable approach is applied to derive a solution for the multi physics problem the accuracy of the solution is examined against two benchmarks in addition examples of contaminant diffusion under the non isothermal and unsaturated conditions are presented to demonstrate the influences of thermal diffusion temperature dependent parameters and unsaturated water distribution on the overall transport of contaminant in the system 2 non isothermal diffusion of chemical in unsaturated composite liner the conceptual model of a landfill composite liner system is shown in fig 1 the composite liner is composed of an intact gmb and a ccl the thicknesses of gmb and ccl are lg and ls respectively the organic compounds can diffuse through an intact gmb the major mechanisms controlling the reactive transport migration of chemical in ccl include molecular diffusion thermo diffusion and adsorption it is noted that considering the low hydraulic conductivity of ccl the advection is neglected the chemical diffusion in an intact gmb can be described by the fick s second law xie et al 2016 1 c g t x d g c g x where t is time and x is the distance c g and d g are the chemical concentration and diffusion coefficient in gmb the general governing equation for multicomponent chemical diffusion in clay under coupled electrochemical and thermal potentials e g sedighi 2011 thomas et al 2012 can be simplified for the one dimensional problem of diffusion of a single chemical species as 2 θ l c s t s t x τ d s θ l c s x x τ d t θ l t x where c s represents the concentration of chemical θ l stands for the volumetric liquid content τ is tortuosity d s is the molecular diffusion coefficient of the chemical d t is thermal diffusion coefficient s is the sorption and t is temperature we adopt a linear isotherm sorption model as follows yan et al 2021 3 s ρ s κ d c s where ρ s is the density of solid phase and κ d is the partitioning of the contaminant thermal diffusion coefficient of a single chemical species is described by yan et al 2020 4 d t d s s t c s where s t is soret coefficient the heat transfer is described based on the fourier s law 5 c p ρ t t x k λ t x where c p ρ and k λ are density thermal capacity and conductivity of ccl respectively in the scope of this study the heat transfer is assumed to be at steady state whilst a transient chemical diffusion under the concentration and thermal potentials is considered eq 2 the assumption of the steady state heat transfer is based on the fact that the thermal process can normally reach equilibrium more quickly than the chemical distribution through pure diffusion e g leaist and hui 1990 thomas et al 2012 xie et al 2015 the solution to eq 5 for one dimensional heat transfer under steady state condition can be expressed as follows 6 t a t x b t where a t and b t are constants and dependent only on the boundary conditions of the problem the volumetric liquid content θ l can be expressed as gardner 1958 7 θ l θ r θ s θ r e β ψ where θ s and θ r are the saturation and residual volumetric liquid contents respectively ψ is the pressure head β is the unsaturated exponent related to the particle distribution of clay the unsaturated exponent has been reported to be controlled by several factors including stress level zhou and ng 2014 and anisotropy zhou and chen 2021 in the analytical model presented here the unsaturated exponent is assumed to be constant to simplify the problem and derive the analytical solution the hydraulic head h in the clay is the sum of the pressure head ψ and elevation head l u z l u is the thickness of unsaturated zone which is assumed to be equal to the thickness of clay in this study if the flow in unsaturated composite liner is considered under hydrostatic equilibrium h in the composite remains zero which result in ψ z l u the residual volumetric liquid content is small and neglected therefore eq 7 can be simplified as 8 θ l θ s e β z l u substituting eqns 3 4 6 and 8 into eq 2 the diffusion of contaminant in unsaturated ccl under steady state heat transfer can be presented as 9 r d c s t τ d s 2 c s x 2 τ β d s τ d s s t a t c s x τ β d s s t a t c s where r d 1 ρ s κ d θ l in this study r d is assumed as a constant and expressed as r d 1 ρ s κ d θ s as the change of water content is small based on the results from the field data and numerical solution lin and yeh 2020 2 1 initial and boundary conditions the initial conditions for the chemical concentration distribution in the composite liner are assumed to be 10 c g x 0 c s x 0 0 the contaminant concentration in the leachate is assumed to be constant c0 chen et al 2009 the top boundary condition at the interface between gmb and the leachate can be expressed as 11 c g l g t c 0 s gf where s gf is the partition coefficient between the gmb and leachate the continuity condition for the concentration and flux at the interface between the gmb and ccl can be expressed by 12 c g 0 t c s 0 t s gf 13 d g c g 0 t x θ l d s c s 0 t x two types of bottom boundary conditions are considered in this study the first boundary condition is the dirichlet boundary condition dbc 14 c s l s t 0 where l s is the length of domain the boundary condition described by eq 14 can represent the underlying layer of the composite liner is an aquifer which can remove the all contaminants instantaneously yan et al 2021 the second boundary condition considered for the outflow boundary is the neumann boundary condition nbc and represents an impermeable boundary e g aquitard yan et al 2019 15 c s l s t x 0 3 analytical solution the gmb layer is thin e g l g 2 5 m m compared to the ccl therefore the contaminant flux in gmb may be approximated as the concentration difference between the top and the bottom of the gmb as follows lin and yeh 2020 16 d g c g x d g c g z 0 c g z l g l g from eqns 11 13 the contaminant flux through the gmb to the underlying ccl becomes 17 γ c s 0 t x c s 0 t c 0 where 18 γ l g θ l d s s gf d g several normalized and dimensionless coefficients are introduced to simplify the governing equation of contaminant transport in ccl eq 9 as follows 19 x x l s 20 t t r d l s 2 τ d s 21 p e p e 1 p e 2 β l s s t a t l s 22 d a β s t a t l s 2 where x is the characteristic length and t t is the characteristic time p e is the peclet number for which p e 1 and p e 2 stands for the advection induced by water content distribution and thermal diffusion respectively d a is the damkohler number substituting the normalized coefficients listed in eqns 21 22 into eq 9 leads to 23 c s t t 2 c s x 2 p e c s x d a c s in order to derive the analytical solution to the proposed mathematical model eq 23 the inhomogeneous boundary conditions eq 17 were converted to homogeneous conditions by adopting the principle of superposition for the linear equations as 24 c s x t t c s t x t t c s s x where c s s x is the steady state solution to the problem that fulfils the inhomogeneous boundary conditions and c s t x t t is the transient solution that fulfils the homogeneous boundary conditions the governing equation for the sub problem involving c s s x and c s t x t t are as follows 25 d 2 c s s x d x 2 p e d c s s x d x d a c s s x 0 26 c s t x t t t 2 c s t x t t x 2 p e c s t x t t x d a c s the general solution to the ordinary differential eq 25 is 27 c s s x a 1 exp x p e α 2 a 2 exp x p e α 2 28 α p e 2 4 d a where a1 and a2 are constants which are given in appendix a the solution to the partial differential eq 26 can be facilitated by introducing a transform defined as 29 c s t x t t w x t t exp d a p e 2 4 t p e x 2 substituting eq 29 into eq 26 gives the transformed governing equation 30 w x t t t 2 w x t t x 2 the boundary and initial conditions in eqns 10 14 15 and 17 are replaced by 31 w x 0 c s s x e p e x 2 32 γ w 0 t t x w 0 t t 33 w 1 t t 0 34 w 1 t t x p e 2 w 1 t t where eq 32 is known as the robin type boundary condition or the third type boundary condition which is taken as a flux matching relationship between the gmb and ccl the robin boundary condition can be reduced to dirichlet boundary condition if γ is zero contrarily it can stand for neumann boundary condition when γ tends to be infinite this implies that γ may induce a significantly influence on contaminant transport in the composite liner system the general solution to eq 30 can be derived by applying separation of variables and given as 35 w x t t n 1 c n e λ n 2 t t λ n cos λ n x sin λ n x where λ n is the eigenvalue of the problem the coefficient c n is obtained using the orthogonality of the eigenfunction

migration through composite liner is examined against two bench marks including i the proposed analytical solution against finite element approach fea of the same problem and ii thermo diffusion of chloride cl through unsaturated soil which were developed based on experimental results by nassar et al 1992 4 1 test 1 comparison with numerical model fea the problem considered for the verification exercise is a 1 5 mm gmb 1 m ccl composite liner in which the coupled effects of thermal diffusion and unsaturated water distribution is studied the proposed analytical solution is compared with alternative finite element analysis comsol multiphysics fea of the same problem the convergence of the fea model was tested first by using systematic mesh refinement to its geometry until grid independent results were obtained the meshing of the model s geometry was finally optimized to the predefined finer physics based mesh elements further details of comsol simulations can be found in the supplemental material dichloromethane dcm was chosen to stand for the leachate constituents in landfill a typical vocs in landfill leachate yan et al 2021 the diffusion and partition coefficients of dcm in gmb are dg 8 86 10 13 m2 s and sgf 2 13 respectively park et al 2012a park et al 2012b the diffusivity of dcm and soret coefficient in ccl are τ d s 1 53 10 10 m2 s and st 0 01 k 1 respectively the retardation factors rd are assumed to be 1 26 lin and yeh 2020 the concentration of dcm in the leachate is set as 1 mg l temperature at top boundary is assumed to be constant 353 k and temperature at bottom boundary is assumed to be fixed at 293 k yan et al 2020 the saturated volumetric liquid content and unsaturated exponent are θ s 0 55 and β 0 01 m 1 the value of input parameters for test1 is listed in table 1 fig 2 a and 2b show the spatial concentration profile of dcm under dirichlet bc and neumann bc respectively the results of analytical model proposed here match the results of using the fea the present model performs well in describing contaminant diffusion and thermo diffusion through unsaturated composite liner 4 2 analysis of thermo diffusion in unsaturated soil we adopt an experimental study reported by nassar et al 1992 to investigate the accuracy of the proposed analytical model for the effect of thermo diffusion and unsaturated water content distribution on chloride cl transport a schematic diagram of experimental test is shown in fig 3 the length of soil column analysed is 10 cm the initial concentration of cl in the sample is 0 1 m the left side and right side of sample are zero flux boundary temperature applied at the left side and right side of cell was 282 k and 288 k respectively in the experimental programme adopted in this test the soil columns were sectioned at 60 h fig 4 c and 156 h fig 4d after the experiment initiated in the simulations the effective diffusivity of cl and the soret coefficient of the soil sample were assumed be τ d c l 4 10 10 m2 s and st 0 5 k 1 respectively the calibration parameters to describe the unsaturated water content distribution are θ s 0 21 and β 5 5 m 1 the value of parameters used in this section is provided in table 1 a schematic diagram of thermo diffusion in unsaturated soil column is also shown in fig 3 comparisons of temperature profiles between the simulation by eq 6 and experimental data are shown in fig 4a the comparison of unsaturated water content profile between this study eq 8 and experimental data is shown in fig 4b the profiles of the cl concentration at t 60 h and t 156 h calculated using the present model were compared with those reported from the experiment which are shown in fig 4c and fig 4d respectively the distributions of temperature and water content obtained by the simplified heat transfer and water transport equation correlates well with the experimental data the profiles of relative concentrations over time obtained by the experiments and those obtained by the proposed analytical solution are in close agreement the above results provide further confidence on the accuracy of the analytical solution under the conditions of this validation exercise it can be seen that despite the fact that zero flux boundaries are applied at the left and right boundary see fig 3 the concentration of cl at the left side is smaller compared to the concentration at the right side both model prediction and experimental measurements show the movement of cl toward the hot end the concentration of cl calculated using pure diffusion in saturated soil black dot lines and unsaturated soil black solid lines is plotted in fig 4c and fig 4d for better comparison with the model developed in this study the above results indicate the significant contributions of thermal diffusion and unsaturated water content distribution to migration of solute in soil 5 model applications in this section thermally induced diffusion of contaminant in unsaturated non isothermal composite liner is discussed the main objective is to evaluate the extent of the effects of primary governing processes e g soret effect and water content distribution and parameters e g temperature dependent coefficient on contaminant transport processes the effect of temperature on the performance of composite liner will be investigated first sec 5 1 the case is then extended to discuss the effect of unsaturated water content distribution sec 5 2 a design diagrams of the composite liner system using the present model is provided in sec 5 3 additionally a sensitivity analysis of various parameters on the performance of the gmb ccl composite barrier system will be provided in sec 5 4 5 1 temperature effects on performance of composite liner system the problem considered is the case that benzene diffusion through the unsaturated non isothermal composite liner the thickness of gmb and ccl is 1 5 mm and 1 m respectively the diffusivity of benzene and soret coefficient in ccl are τ d s 7 10 10 m2 s and st 0 01 k 1 respectively the retardation factors rd are assumed to be 1 31 the concentration of benzene in the leachate is set at 1 mg l temperature at bottom boundary is fixed at 293 k the saturated volumetric liquid content and unsaturated exponent are θ s 0 55 and β 0 1 m 1 the required input parameters are listed in table 1 the interest in particular is to obtain an evaluation of the contributions of soret effect st temperature dependent diffusion dg t and partitioning coefficient sgf t in gmb on the overall process the influence of the temperature dependent coefficients in gmb are recently investigated by experimental studies jones and rowe 2016 mcwatters et al 2016 the experimental observations indicated that the effectiveness of the gmb as a diffusion barrier can significantly decrease with the increase of temperature although the study conducted by yan et al 2020 indicates that the temperature dependent diffusion coefficient ds t in ccl may contribute to the migration of contaminant however ds t is assumed to be a constant due to the limitation of analytical solution proposed in this study it should be noted that the assumption of constant diffusion coefficient ds t in ccl may lead to a more conservative results compared to the case with temperature dependent diffusion coefficient 5 1 1 influence of temperature dependent coefficients in gmb the geomembrane is an important component of landfill liner system designed to minimize the transport of contaminants sourcing from the leachate to the underlying groundwater the key properties which define the diffusive characteristics of gmb are the diffusion coefficient dg and partitioning coefficient sgf and their product the permeation coefficient pg dg sgf the permeation coefficient can represent the combined influence of partitioning and diffusion processes the recent findings by jones and rowe 2016 mcwatters et al 2016 have suggested that all geomembranes showed a decrease in partitioning sorptive capacity diffusion and overall permeation coefficients with decreasing temperature the temperature dependent partitioning diffusion and permeation coefficients can be related by the arrhenius equation as given in eqns 37 39 naylor 1989 chainey 1990 37 d g t d g 0 e e d r t 38 s gf t s gf 0 e δ h s r t 39 p g t p g 0 e e p r t where e d is activation energy for diffusion j mol δ h s is heat of solution of the compound j mol and e p is activation energy for permeation j mol d g 0 s gf 0 and p g 0 are pre exponential coefficients for diffusion partitioning and permeation respectively r is universal gas constant fig 5 shows a comparison between the permeation coefficients calculated by arrhenius correlation and experimental data at different temperature for ethylbenzene toluene and benzene the horizontal axis is the inverse of temperature 1 t and the vertical axis is the natural logarithm of the permeation coefficient ln p g t the value of calculated arrhenius parameters for hdpe gmb for different vocs is listed in table 2 the temperature dependency of permeation coefficients p g t calculated using eq 39 correlates well with the experimental data see fig 5 a similar general trend is observed for all of the vocs the permeation coefficients showed an increase with the increase of temperature for example the value of p g t shows two orders of magnitude increase when temperature increases from 295 k to 313 k it can be concluded from the results that temperature changes can have significant impacts on the performance of gmb as a diffusive barrier within the scope and conditions of the problem considered in order to evaluate the influence of temperature dependent coefficients in gmb on the contaminant transport three simulation cases scenarios have been designed which include case 1 which includes molecular diffusion of contaminant under ambient isothermal 293 k conditions case 2 which includes combined effects of molecular diffusion and soret effect without considering the influence of temperature dependent coefficient in gmb case 3 for which the combined effects of diffusion soret effect and temperature dependent coefficient in gmb are considered the comparison between case 1 and case 2 can provide evidences on the influence of soret effect the comparison between case 2 and case 3 can highlight the influence of temperature dependent coefficient in gmb a comparison between cases 1 2 and 3 can reveal the relative importance of soret effect and temperature dependent coefficient in gmb fig 6 a and 6b present a comparison between the contaminant concentration profile at 10 years for the three cases under dirichlet boundary condition and neumann boundary condition respectively fig 7 a and 7b present a comparison between the contaminant bottom concentration and bottom flux with time for the different simulation cases significant differences can be found for the contaminant concentration profiles bottom concentration and bottom flux among these three cases as shown in fig 6b the bottom concentrations for the case 1 case 2 and case 3 are 0 14 mg l 0 18 mg l and 0 22 mg l respectively the steady state bottom flux for case 1 is 1 35 and 1 4 times smaller than those calculated for the case 2 and case 3 respectively see fig 7a the above results demonstrate the importance of the thermally coupled processes for the migration of contaminant in gmb ccl composite liner system it can be observed that the contaminant migration in the unsaturated composite liner is enhanced by thermal diffusion and under the conditions of the cases at a considerable level this is evident from the results of concentrations and flux calculated for the case 2 which is considerably larger than that of case 1 fig 6 and fig 7 in addition the temperature dependent coefficients in gmb can considerably enhance the rate of contaminant migration in the system as the contaminant concentration and flux observed for the case 3 is much larger compared to the other cases this observation indicates that the variation of p g t with temperature is non negligible part when the effects of temperature on contaminant migration are studied which is especially important at elevated temperatures at which p g t considerably increases with temperature refer to fig 5 in summary the results presented in figs 6 and 7 demonstrate that temperature can affect the contaminant diffusion through unsaturated composite liner in two ways i by the soret effect and ii by the temperature dependent coefficient in gmb 5 1 2 influence of thermal diffusion at ambient temperature the value of soret coefficient has been reported to range from 10 2 and 10 3 k 1 for organic mixtures or aqueous solutions platten 2006 in certain circumstances it could even reach 0 2 k 1 xie et al 2015 thus the range of soret coefficient chosen in this study is from 0 001 to 0 2 k 1 the range of temperature difference between the upper and the bottom surfaces of composite liner is from 0 to nearly 100 k the variations of bottom concentration and flux of the gmb ccl composite liner at 10 and 20 years with soret coefficient and temperature difference are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the bottom flux and concentration increase with the increase of soret coefficient and temperature difference this is due to the fact that thermal diffusion process is enhanced with the increase of s t and δ t the iso potential line with a value of 0 2 mg year represents the breakthrough flux marked as black dash liner in this case fig 8a and 8b the left area of the breakthrough line stands for un breakthrough zone contrarily the right area of the breakthrough line represents breakthrough zone it can be seen that the un breakthrough zone increasingly decreases with the increase of time similar trends can be observed in fig 8c and 8d the results of the series of simulation presented demonstrate that the contaminant transport in the composite liner is enhanced by thermal diffusion and under the conditions of the cases at a considerable level 5 2 influence of unsaturated water content distribution in this part the particular interest is to obtain an understanding of the effects of unsaturated water content distribution on contaminant migration through unsaturated gmb ccl composite liner the unsaturated exponent β is usually used to describe the water pressure condition when clay water content is stable in this section three values of β i e 0 1 and 5 m 1 are selected to stand for the water distribution conditions in particular β 0 represents the composite liner is saturated fig 9 shows the unsaturated water content distribution profile for different simulation cases it can be seen that when β increases from 0 to 1 the water content at the top of the composite liner decreases 0 55 to 0 2 and the state changes from saturated to unsaturated fig 10 a and 10b present a comparison between the contaminant concentration profile at 10 years for the three cases e g saturated β 1 m 1 and β 5 m 1 under dirichlet boundary condition and neumann boundary condition respectively it can be seen that the contaminant concentration profiles significantly decrease with the increase of β which leads to the state of composite liner transferring from saturated to unsaturated this is mainly due to the fact that the decrease of water content distribution can lead to a decrease of contaminant diffusion coefficient in the composite liner which may provide a better diffusion barrier fig 11 presents the effects of unsaturated exponent β on the steady state contaminant flux it can be seen that when β is larger than 1 m 1 the steady state bottom flux shows a considerable increase with the β however when β is smaller than 0 1 m 1 the effect of β is less significant on the steady state flux for instance the steady state flux for the case with β 0 1 m 1 and s t 0 01 k 1 can be only 1 04 times larger than the case with β 0 01 m 1 and s t 0 01 k 1 these results indicated that unsaturated water content distribution should be considered for contaminant diffusion through gmb ccl composite liner when the unsaturated exponent β is larger than 0 1 m 1 additionally the effect of s t on bottom flux decreases with the increase of β for example the difference of steady state flux for the case with β 10 m 1 under different s t is negligible see fig 11 it demonstrated that the unsaturated water content distribution may play a more important role compared to thermal diffusion processes when unsaturated exponent β is larger than 1 m 1 5 3 potential applications for development of design diagrams dichloromethane dcm was chosen to stand for the leachate constituents in landfill in this section the concentration of dcm in the landfill leachate is 4 15 mg l chen et al 2015 based on the drinking water standard mhprc 2006 the limit concentration of dcm in the groundwater is 0 02 mg l temperature values in the leachate and groundwater are assumed to be 353 k and 293 k respectively the problem is based on specified concentration of leachate constituent for a 30 year transit time of a landfill the design procedure for the landfill liner using the present analytical solution can be expressed as follows the desired relative concentration of dcm is 40 c n c c 0 0 02 4 15 0 004 a breakthrough curve of dcm under different thickness of ccl is provided in fig 12 the desired construction of composite liner is plotted by grey zone in fig 12 it is shown that the composite liner may not meet the requirement that the breakthrough time should be larger than 30 years if the thickness of ccl is smaller than 1 5 m for example the earlier breakthrough of dcm can be found at 4 years and 15 years for the case with ls 0 6 m and 1 m respectively it is noted that the minimum ccl thickness of around 1 5 m will meet the requirement of the specified leachate concentration criterion for dcm increasing the thickness of ccl can delay the breakthrough of dcm and provide longer term protection to the surrounding environments from pollution 5 4 sensitivity analysis in this section two sensitivity coefficients including the normalized sensitivity coefficient x k and differential importance measure dim k are introduced to investigate the effects of various parameters on the performance of the gmb ccl composite barrier system the normalized sensitivity coefficient x k is widely utilized for the efficient comparison of various parameters having different units and especially having different orders of magnitudes lin and yeh 2020 x k is defined as the partial derivative of the model dependent variable for a specific parameter p k 41 x k p k 0 l s c s x t p k d x p k where 0 l s c s x t d x is the amount of contaminant in the domain at any elapse time x k indicates the sensitivity of 0 l s c s x t p k d x to the kth input parameter p k the eq 41 can be approximated by a finite difference method as 42 x k p k 0 l s c x t p k δ p k d x 0 l s c x t p k d x δ p k where δ p k is chosen as 10 3 p k in this study the differential importance measure dim k is introduced by borgonovo and apostolakis 2001 which is widely utilized for the decision making of risk management dim k is given as 43 dim k δ p k 0 l s c x t p k d x p k j 1 n δ p j 0 l s c x t p j d x p j x k j 1 n x j where n is the total number of the parameters of interest the parameters of interest in this study are β θ s s t at and pg the sensitivity analysis of β and θ s can highlight the influence of water content distribution in the system s t at and pg provide evidences on the influence of temperature a comparison among these parameters can reveal relative importance of temperature variations and unsaturated water content distribution on contaminant migration through the gmb ccl composite liner fig 13 a and 13b show the distribution curves of x k at different time for dirichlet boundary and neuman boundary respectively a positive x k demonstrates that an increase of a specific parameter can result in an increase in 0 l s c s x t d x contrarily a negative indicates the increase of a specific parameter leading to a decrease in 0 l s c s x t d x it can be seen that the distribution curves of x k for all parameters have a similar trend for the case with dirichlet bc and neumann bc the increase of s t at and p g provides a positive feedback to the system however the increase of β and θ s may reduce the amount of contaminant in the domain the above observations coincide with phenomena shown in figs 6 11 the effects of the variation in parameters at on the migration of contaminant is most significant compared to the other parameters on the other hand the effects of the changes in β and s t are small before 1 year however after that time a rapid change is observed fig 14 a and 14b show the distribution curves of dim k at different time for dirichlet boundary and neuman boundary respectively the measure dim k provides a good indication for the parameter effect in this case as shown in fig 14afig15 the parameter at procures the largest effect followed by θ s pg s t and β this is due to the fact that at are the main parameter which directly affects the thermal diffusion process and temperature dependent coefficients in gmb it can be observed that θ s and pg show a similar effect while s t and β produce a negligible influence on the migration of contaminant before 1 year after 1 year s t becomes the most sensitive parameter followed by β θ s pg and at the decrease of dim k with time is observed for the parameters of θ s and pg the result indicated that the soret effect may play an increasingly significant role in the migration of contaminant at the meantime the effects of temperature dependent coefficient in gmb and unsaturated water distribution increasingly decrease with time these results indicated that the parameters associated with the temperature and unsaturated water distribution play an important role in contaminant migration in the composite gmb ccl liner especially the long term impacts of combined effects of unsaturated water distribution thermal diffusion and temperature dependent parameters on contaminant transport through the composite liner system are non negligible part for designing a stable effective and well operational liner system 6 conclusions we presented analytical solutions to the one dimensional contaminant diffusion in non isothermal and unsaturated gmb ccl composite liner which utilizes the separation of variable to derive a solution for the multi physics problem the solution was tested against two benchmarks which demonstrate successful development of the solution to the mathematical problem the examples provided for contaminant diffusion under the non isothermal and unsaturated conditions demonstrate the influences of thermal diffusion temperature dependent parameters and unsaturated water distribution on the overall transport of contaminant in the system the specific conclusions form this work are as follows 1 temperature can affect the contaminant diffusion through composite liner in two ways i by the soret effect and ii by the temperature dependent coefficient in gmb the value of permeation coefficient shows two orders of magnitude decrease when the temperature varies from 295 k to 313 k in addition the contaminant flux and concentration under non isothermal conditions can be 1 6 and 1 4 times larger than that of the case with isothermal conditions the results demonstrate the importance of the thermally coupled processes for the migration of contaminant in gmb ccl composite liner system 2 contaminant concentration and flux significantly decrease when the state of underlying liner transferring from saturated to unsaturated this is mainly due to the fact that the decrease of water content distribution can lead to a decrease of effective diffusion coefficient of contaminant under the conditions of the problem considered we show a threshold of unsaturated exponent β 0 1 m 1 where the unsaturated water distribution can induce a large influence on contaminant transport additionally unsaturated water content distribution may play a more important role compared to thermal diffusion processes when unsaturated exponent is larger than 1 m 1 3 two sensitivity coefficients e g x k and dim k are introduced to investigate the effects of various parameters on the performance of the gmb ccl composite barrier system the results indicated that the parameter at procures the largest effect followed by θ s pg s t and β the increase of s t at and p g provides a positive feedback to the system however the increase of β and θ s may reduce the amount of contaminant in the domain credit authorship contribution statement huaxiang yan conceptualization data curation methodology

4101,vegetation drag is a fundamental quantity directly affecting results for both long and short term coastal marsh and geomorphological studies the vegetation drag in coastal marshland has been modeled by various two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d numerical parameterizations 2d parameterizations treat coastal marshes as bottom roughness elements while 3d parameterizations resolve the vertically variable vegetation drag through the water column however differences in tidal propagation arising from different drag parameterizations within a single model are largely unknown and clear guidance on parameterization selection is still missing in this study we implemented four vegetation drag parameterizations into the model for prediction across scales ocean mpas o which include 1 a 2d parameterization using land cover type determined manning s n 2dlm 2 a 2d parameterization using vegetation determined manning s n 2dvm 3 a 3d parameterization for stiff vegetation 3dsv and 4 a 3d parameterization for flexible vegetation 3dfv estimates of the flow resistance effects from these parameterizations were compared using a series of idealized tidal propagation simulations given the same tidal condition flooding depth and flooding distance are the largest in the 2dlm simulations and the smallest in the 3dsv simulations 2dvm results are the closest to the 2dlm results 3dfv results are the closest to the average of 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv results 2dvm and 3dsv results are the least and most sensitive to the vegetation aboveground biomass respectively based on the input data requirement and computational efficiency of each parameterization a comparison summary is provided to help inform parameterization selection for specific applications the effects of these parameterizations on coastal geomorphology are further discussed and the results demonstrate that estimates of the long term evolution of coastal marshes and coastal morphology depend upon the selection of the vegetation drag parameterization abbreviations 1dv one dimensional vertical 2d two dimensional 2dv two dimensional vertical 2dlm a 2d vegetation drag parameterization using land cover

energy model keywords coastal marshland vegetation drag parameterization tidal propagation coastal flooding 1 introduction coastal marshland provides a range of ecosystem services including food production nutrient cycling and coastal erosion control costanza et al 1997 and help attenuate landward propagation of shallow water flows and storm surge e g wamsley et al 2010 möller et al 2014 leonardi et al 2018 marshes are a dominant control on bed roughness that alters the propagation of incoming shallow water flow leading to modified coastal hydrodynamics and inundation which further affects the transport of nutrients and sediment e g schulz et al 2003 temmerman et al 2005 and coastal erosion e g fagherazzi 2014 the surface inundation condition in turn affects the growth of coastal marshes and the marshland ecosystem functions silvestri and marani 2004 therefore an accurate prediction of water propagation on coastal marshland is critical for estimating the risk of coastal flooding on coastal ecosystems especially under intensified climate change to quantify the effects of coastal marshland on tidal propagation and flooding various vegetation drag parameterizations of coastal marshes are proposed e g loder et al 2009 azechi et al 2007 stone and shen 2002 luhar and nepf 2011 temmerman et al 2005 beudin et al 2017 in some two dimensional 2d vertically integrated e g luettich et al 1992 wamsley et al 2010 and even three dimensional 3d coastal hydrodynamic models e g chen et al 2003 shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the vegetation drag is simply represented in terms of the vegetation induced 2d bottom friction which can be computed by a quadratic law using a manning s n formulation marsooli et al 2016 this 2d manning s n approach mainly has two different parameterizations one is to assign constant manning s n values based on the land cover types with the manning s n values selected or interpolated from hydraulic literature this is the classic parameterization of vegetation drag and has been widely applied to hurricane and tsunami induced coastal surge inundation studies which are required to be computationally efficient for timely prediction e g loder et al 2009 wamsley et al 2010 bunya et al 2010 dietrich et al 2011a dietrich et al 2011b zhang et al 2012 kaiser et al 2011 ferreira et al 2014 yalcin 2020 the other less commonly applied is to consider the vegetation stem characteristics i e stem height stem density and stem diameter in computing the manning s n values azechi et al 2007 this parameterization was derived by evaluating the velocity field in an experimental open channel with vegetation and has been only applied to analyze the spatial and seasonal impact of the submerged vegetation drag on the coastal hydrodynamics moki et al 2020 the 2d parameterizations treat the aquatic vegetation as bottom roughness elements and assume a logarithmic flow profile above them baptist et al 2007 this is reasonable when the coastal marsh height is negligible compared to the water depth however for submerged or emergent marshes with the stem height comparable to water depth these parameterizations are unable to resolve the flow through the vegetation and thus fail to accurately quantify the flow resistance effects of coastal marshes on the coastal hydrodynamics e g nepf 2012 lapetina and sheng 2014 to overcome the limitation of the 2d parameterizations a two layer approach e g stone and shen 2002 huthoff et al 2007 baptist 2005 baptist et al 2007 cheng 2011 luhar and nepf 2013 has been proposed this approach separates the water column vertically into the surface layer for submerged vegetation and a vegetation layer and then computes the steady flows in the two layers separately based on the simplified momentum balances this approach however assumes a logarithmic velocity profile through the surface layer and resolves the flow through the vegetation layer either by a depth averaged simplification e g stone and shen 2002 or by a number of complex equations with parameterizations for eddy viscosity mixing length shear velocity etc e g baptist et al 2007 these make the two layer approach rarely applied in coastal hydrodynamic modeling studies recently 3d parameterizations of vegetation drag have been proposed to resolve the flows through and above vegetation e g temmerman et al 2005 lapetina and sheng 2014 beudin et al 2017 kalra et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b without the flow determining assumptions as in the two layer approach these 3d parameterizations account for coastal marsh morphology in computing the vertically variable vegetation drag through the marsh occupied water column however they only apply when the vegetation height is not negligible compared to the water depth or the description of the flow through a bulk representation of vegetation is required for example lapetina and sheng 2014 developed a 3d vegetation drag parameterization by incorporating a one dimensional vertical 1dv vegetation resolved turbulent kinetic energy model tkem into a 3d storm surge wave model some other 3d vegetation parameterization studies apply the quadratic drag law thompson and roberson 1976 to compute the vegetation drag and the vertical velocity distribution e g huai et al 2009 liu and zeng 2017 in a 3d form in addition coastal marsh vegetation is usually flexible with deformation resulting from the force balance between the hydrodynamic drag and the water buoyancy as well as the vegetation restoring force due to the blade stiffness zeller et al 2014 therefore if the vegetation deformation in response to flow is considerable the reduction of the vegetation drag due to the vegetation flexibility may be further evaluated e g luhar and nepf 2011 beudin et al 2017 lei and nepf 2019 in view of all these different vegetation drag parameterizations it is important to understand their different effects on tidal propagation and coastal flooding lapetina and sheng 2015 compared two vegetation drag parameterizations a 2d manning s n approach and their 3d parameterization in coastal hydrodynamic simulations but these comparisons were carried out using different numerical models one model in 2d and the other in 3d to our best knowledge there have been no studies to compare different parameterizations using the same numerical modeling system under a control of consistent simulation parameters lacking a rigorous parameterization intercomparison leads to uncertainty in the potential hydrodynamic differences arising from these parameterizations consequently a clear guidance on parameterization selection is also missing to fill these research gaps we implemented four different vegetation drag parameterizations of coastal marshes into a numerical model and designed the first series of idealized simulations that rigorously compared the effects of different vegetation drag parameterizations on tidal propagation and coastal flooding the rest of the paper is organized as follows a brief introduction of the selected numerical model the implementations of the four parameterizations and the configurations of the simulations are described in section 2 the simulation results represented by three defined metrics are presented in section 3 section 4 discusses the adjustment of manning s n in the 2d parameterizations and the vegetation flexibility in the 3d parameterizations and provides a comparison summary to inform parameterization selection in various applications the broad geomorphological implications of this study are also highlighted in section 4 finally the main conclusions of this study are summarized in section 5 2 methods 2 1 numerical modeling in this study we used the model for prediction across scales ocean mpas o ringler et al 2013 for vegetation drag implementation under different tidal conditions mpas o utilizes a hexagonal unstructured multi resolution horizontal mesh and employs a c grid finite volume method for the horizontal discretization the vertical coordinate of the model uses an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale approach with flexible configurations including z star and sigma coordinates for specific applications petersen et al 2015 the biharmonic viscosity and the leith turbulence closure are used to regularize the momentum equation for the horizontal turbulence closure the community ocean vertical mixing project version of the k profile parameterization kpp is implemented in the model for global ocean vertical mixing van roekel et al 2018 readers are referred to ringler et al 2013 and petersen et al 2015 for detailed descriptions of the model equations and numerical approach in order to simulate the coastal tidal flooding process we have implemented in mpas o a wetting and drying scheme following the thin film approach e g warner et al 2013 two validation test cases in warner et al 2013 the sloping channel case and the dam break case were reproduced to verify the wetting and drying implementation in mpas o the wetting and drying scheme the setup of the validation test cases as well as the validation results are provided in the appendix i to compare the potential hydrodynamic consequences of different parameterizations of vegetation drag within the same model the following four parameterizations were adopted from previous studies and implemented in mpas o 1 a 2d parameterization using land cover type determined manning s n 2dlm in this parameterization the vegetation drag is computed as bottom friction using the following equations with the manning s n values determined by the land cover types e g bunya et al 2010 dietrich et al 2011a dietrich et al 2011b 1 c d g n 2 h 1 3 2 τ b 1 2 ρ c d u b u b where c d is the bottom drag coefficient g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 ms 2 n is manning roughness coefficient sm 1 3 h is total water depth m τ b is bottom shear stress nm 2 ρ is the water density 1025 kgm 3 and u b is bottom velocity m s 1 2 a 2d parameterization using vegetation determined manning s n 2dvm similar to 2dlm this parameterization also computes the 2d vegetation drag using the equations 1 2 but the manning s n values are determined by three vegetation stem characteristics height density and diameter using the following equations azechi et al 2007 3 n h 2 3 β 2 c d λ h v c f gh α h v 2 1 exp α h v 1 α 2 h v h 1 exp α h v ln h h v h h v h 1 1 α h v 4 α c d λ 4 κ 2 h v 2 1 3 5 β α h v 2 1 exp 2 α h v 1 exp α h v 2 6 λ n d where α β and λ are intermediate parameters c d is the vegetation drag coefficient h v is the vegetation height m c f is bottom roughness κ is the von karman constant 0 4 n is the vegetation density m 2 and d is the vegetation diameter m in applications h v will be replaced by h in the above equations when the vegetation is not fully submerged 3 a 3d parameterization for stiff vegetation 3dsv this parameterization models the coastal marsh as stiff plants that do not bend and computes the 3d vegetation drag throughout the vegetation occupied water column via 7 τ veg z 1 2 ρ c d z n z d z h v z u z u z where τ veg is the vegetation drag n m 2 z is the vertical coordinate with positive upward c d is the vegetation drag coefficients and u is the flow velocity m s 1 through the water column the vertical variations of all the vegetation related variables on the right hand side of the equation are omitted in this study 4 a 3d parameterization for flexible vegetation 3dfv this parameterization is similar to 3dsv but it further considers the vegetation flexibility beudin et al 2017 it first computes the effective height h ve of flexible vegetation using the following equations then computes the vegetation drag using equation 7 with h v replaced by h ve 8 h ve h v 1 1 0 9 c a 1 3 1 c a 3 2 8 b 3 2 9 c a 0 5 ρ c d d u 2 h v 3 ei 10 b ρ ρ v g d t h v 3 ei i d t 3 12 where h ve is the effective vegetation height m b is the buoyancy parameter c a is the cauchy number e is the elastic modulus gpa ρ v the vegetation tissue density kgm 3 i is the second moment of area m 4 and t is the vegetation blade thickness m the vegetation flexibility can be evaluated using the following nondimensional number indicating the fraction by which the vegetation height decreases due to the vegetation deformation with the flow 12 v flex 1 h ve h v in which v flex increases with the vegetation flexibility in mpas o we implemented the 2d parameterizations as bottom drag in the implicit vertical mixing for momentum and implemented the 3d parameterizations explicitly by treating the vegetation drag as an individual velocity forcing in the 3d flow 2 2 numerical simulations we designed an idealized coastal transect for a series of two dimensional vertical 2dv tidal propagation experiments with the lateral effects excluded for model simplicity the idealized transect fig 1 is 8 km long and includes a coastal marshland simplified from the coastal marshlands at the delaware bay as used in zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b an upland segment and an offshore segment each segment is defined by its length and slope with parameters designated in table 1 only the marshland is covered by coastal marshes employing the vegetation drag effects the mean sea level is set to 3 m the same level as the elevation of the marshland at the ocean boundary a sinusoidal semi diurnal tide is imposed at the offshore open boundary which is initiated to propagate along the transect from the mean sea level purple dashed line in fig 1 this transect is a good representation of the geometric relationships between upland intertidal zone and subtidal zone during water propagation e g kirwan et al 2016 morris et al 2002 to conduct a focused study on the vegetation effect on tide driven water propagation we exclude wave effect on water propagation here because the regular wave can quickly dissipate when it reaches marsh vegetation and it would not have big impact on water propagation to the inland moftakhari et al 2017 zoccarato et al 2019 d alpaos et al 2007 muñoz et al 2020 wave effect will be investigated in a separate study in the future the horizontal resolution of the transect grid is 20 m and there are in total 50 vertical layers using a sigma coordinate with the bottom topography smoothly represented and the layer thickness vertically uniform the topographic characteristics of the idealized transect are summarized in table 1 to compare the four parameterizations of vegetation drag implemented in mpas o a series of tidal flooding simulations along the idealized transect were configured three different semi diurnal tidal amplitudes i e 0 8 m 1 6 m and 2 4 m were considered at the offshore open boundary of the idealized transect to represent the micro meso and macro tidal conditions respectively for a given tidal condition the bottom drag values at the upland and offshore regions were computed using equations 1 2 and the manning s n values provided in table 1 the vegetation drag at the marshland was computed using one of the four aforementioned parameterizations in the simulations using the 2dlm parameterization referred to as 2dlm simulations hereafter and so on for the simulations using other parameterizations constant manning s n values were assigned along the marshland based on four most common land cover types over the marshland as detailed in table 2 together the 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv simulations are called biomass variation simulations since all these simulations took into account the variation of vegetation stem characteristics as a function of vegetation aboveground biomass d alpaos et al 2007 namely 13 n 250 bio 0 3032 14 h v 0 0609 bio 0 1876 15 d 0 0006 bio 0 3 where bio represents the vegetation aboveground biomass g m 2 although these equations were derived based on salt marsh data morris and haskin 1990 we adopted them for all the vegetation types in this study because 1 in practice the vegetation aboveground biomass is relatively easier to get compared to the vegetation stem characteristics and 2 using same equations makes it easier to systematically control the values of the vegetation stem characteristics in our simulations for intercomparison analysis the justification of this adoption will need further study with sufficient field observations five different vegetation aboveground biomass values i e 100 500 1000 1500 and 2000 g m 2 table 3 were considered the first four biomass values were selected based on the observational data from crosby et al 2017 and the maximum biomass value 2000 g m 2 was adopted from previous numerical studies e g mudd et al 2004 d alpaos et al 2007 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b as a summary a concept map showing the simulation design is provided in fig 2 in the 2dvm simulations the bottom roughness c f used in equation 3 was calculated by equation 1 with n 0 0025 sm 1 3 which is a typical value for open water region in estuaries dietrich et al 2011b in the 3dsv and 3dfv simulations the value of vegetation drag coefficient c d is required the derivation of c d using either direct measurement method or the calibration methods is purely empirical and the selection of c d for real coastal cases is challenging as it is affected by different factors including the vegetation density vegetation morphology wave current interaction as well as flow reynolds number re e g nepf 2011 hu et al 2014 chen et al 2018 mancheño et al 2021 in this study c d in equation 7 was set to 1 0 which is a typical vegetation

tissue density ρ v was set to 800 kg m 3 the vegetation blade thickness t was set to 0 2 mm and the elastic modulus e was set to 1 0 gpa lei and nepf 2019 the minimum depth h min in the wetting and drying scheme is set to 1 0 10 3 m for all the simulations three evaluation metrics were defined to assess the potential hydrodynamic differences arising from different vegetation drag parameterizations flooding distance flooding velocity and flooding depth flooding distance was defined as the distance between the seaward edge of the marshland and the landward tip of the flooding water during the high tide fig 1 flooding velocity was defined as the averaged propagating velocity of water during the flooding process flooding depth was defined as the averaged water depth over the marshland during the high tide fig 1 these evaluation metrics represent three different physical aspects of the coastal flooding that are proxies for broader coastal processes 1 flooding distance could be considered as the flooding area on a 2d map 2 flooding velocity implies the ability of potential coastal erosion and 3 flooding depth indicates the inundation depth of the coastal marshes during tidal flooding each of the aforementioned simulations was spun up for three tidal cycles to reach a quasi steady state and the evaluation metrics were computed based on the hydrodynamic results during the fourth tidal cycle the sensitivity of the biomass variation simulations i e simulations of 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv to the vegetation aboveground biomass was also evaluated considering that each metric has a negative correlation with the vegetation aboveground biomass under a given tidal condition see section 3 2 we first computed the line of best fit between the normalized metric normalized by the largest value of the metric under the given tidal amplitude and the normalized vegetation aboveground biomass normalized by 2000 g m 2 using the linear least square regression method and then took the magnitude of the line slope as the decreasing trend of each metric a larger decreasing trend indicates a higher sensitivity of the metric to the vegetation aboveground biomass 3 results the 2dlm simulation results are presented first because 2dlm is 1 the most widely used classic parameterization and 2 the only parameterization in this study that determines the vegetation drag by marsh types the results of the biomass variation simulations are described together and then compared against the 2dlm simulations results 3 1 hydrodynamics from the 2dlm simulations results for the tidal flooding distance flooding velocity and flooding depth from the 2dlm simulations are shown in fig 3 all the evaluation metrics show positive correlations with the tidal amplitude and negative correlations with manning s n for all marsh types the values of the tidal flooding distance flooding velocity and flooding depth increase with the increasing tidal amplitude higher tidal amplitude indicates a larger amount of water propagating landward which results in larger metrics due to the mass and momentum conservations given one tidal condition the flooding distance flooding velocity and flooding depth all decrease as the marsh type changes from saline marsh to fresh marsh this is because as the marsh type becomes less salt tolerant the manning s n value table 2 as well as the corresponding bottom drag force become larger under the same tidal condition a larger drag force attenuates the tidal propagation along the transect and reduces the flooding distance and flooding velocity more strongly as less water propagates landward the mean water level over the marshland i e the flooding depth accordingly becomes smaller the relative variation of each metric differs with marsh types among all three metrics the flooding distance varies the least with different marsh types fig 3a regardless of what tidal boundary condition is applied in contrast the flooding velocity fig 3b and the flooding depth fig 3c vary more significantly with different marsh types under the microtidal condition the flooding distance decreases by 4 1 from saline marsh case 2 20 10 3 m to fresh marsh case 2 11 10 3 m the flooding velocity and the flooding depth decrease by 17 6 and 18 5 respectively under the mesotidal condition the decrease in the flooding distance the flooding velocity and the flooding depth are 1 8 12 6 and 5 2 respectively these values change to 1 5 6 5 and 3 4 respectively under the macrotidal condition the results indicate that the evaluation metrics have different sensitivity to the marsh types in the production of manning s n values in which flooding distance is the least sensitive metric and flooding velocity is the most sensitive one in addition all the evaluation metrics become less sensitive to the marsh types as the tidal amplitude increases evidence of this is seen in the flooding depth results under microtidal condition the values of the flooding depth from the brackish intermediate and fresh marsh cases 0 50 m 0 48 m and 0 44 m respectively are quite different while under macrotidal condition these values are nearly the same 2 01 m this is because 2dlm computes the vegetation drag as a bottom boundary drag as the tidal amplitude increases the water depth becomes larger thus the flow resistance effects of the bottom vegetation drag will become smaller over the entire water column 3 2 hydrodynamics from the biomass variation simulations results of the evaluation metrics from the biomass variation simulations are shown as solid lines in fig 4 and their numerical values are listed in table 4 in general all the evaluation metrics from the biomass variation simulations show positive correlations with the tidal amplitude which is similar to the 2dlm simulation results there also exists a negative correlation between the metrics and the vegetation aboveground biomass in these simulations the increasing vegetation aboveground biomass yields an increase in vegetation stem characteristics equations 13 15 which increases the manning s n values equations 3 6 and the bottom drag equations 1 2 in the 2dvm simulations as well as the drag force equations 7 in the 3dsv and 3dfv simulations the increased vegetation drag amplifies the flow resistance effects and further attenuates the tidal propagation leading to a reduced flooding distance flooding velocity and flooding depth the results of each metric using different parameterizations vary under the same simulation condition for example for the same tidal amplitude and the aboveground biomass the estimation of the flooding distance fig 4 a b and c is largest in the 2dvm simulation blue line with circle marker and smallest in the 3dsv simulation orange line with square marker while the estimation of the flooding distance in the 3dfv simulation green line with triangle marker is close to the averaged value black dash dot line of the simulations in 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv the range of the flooding distance between parameterizations actually increases with tidal amplitude these findings also hold for the results of the flooding velocity fig 4 d e and f and the flooding depth fig 4 g h and i among the biomass variation simulations 1 2dvm estimates the smallest flow resistance effects and 3dsv estimates the largest flow resistance effects while the estimates of the flow resistance effects using 3dfv are very close to the averaged values of the three parameterizations 2 the flow resistance differences arising from the three parameterizations become larger as the tidal amplitude increases and 3 considering that each metric implies a different aspect of tidal flooding consequence the potential hydrodynamic differences arising from the three parameterizations are consistent across various aspects of the tidal flooding as described in section 2 2 the decreasing trends of each metric to the vegetation aboveground biomass are evaluated using the slope of the best fit line between the normalized metric and the aboveground biomass for example under the microtidal condition the values of the flooding distance in the 2dvm simulations are 2 09 2 03 1 94 1 89 1 85 103 m which can be normalized as 1 0 0 97 0 93 0 90 0 89 by the largest flooding distance value 2 09 103 m the vegetation aboveground biomass can be normalized as 0 05 0 25 0 50 0 75 1 0 by its largest value 2000 g m 2 based on the linear least square regression method the relationship between the normalized vegetation aboveground biomass bio norm and the normalized flooding distance f d norm can be described as f d norm 0 12 bio norm 1 0 where the magnitude of the slope i e 0 12 is the decreasing trend of the flooding distance with the vegetation aboveground biomass in 2dvm simulations under the microtidal condition considering that a larger decreasing trend indicates a higher sensitivity of the metric to the vegetation aboveground biomass the results listed in table 5 indicate that 1 in terms of different evaluation metrics the flooding distance is the least sensitive metric to the aboveground biomass 2 in terms of different parameterizations 2dvm is least sensitive to the vegetation aboveground biomass while 3dsv is most sensitive to the vegetation aboveground biomass and 3 in terms of different tidal amplitudes the sensitivity of each parameterization to the vegetation aboveground biomass decreases with tidal amplitude due to the flexibility of coastal marshes the flow resistance effects estimated in the 3dfv simulations are always smaller than those in 3dsv simulations given the same tidal condition and vegetation aboveground biomass this can be evidenced from the larger evaluation metric values in 3dfv simulations than in 3dsv simulations see fig 4 moreover under a given tidal condition the relative difference of the metrics between the 3dsv and 3dfv simulations increase with the aboveground biomass for example under the micro tide with an aboveground biomass of 100 g m 2 the flooding distance result from the 3dsv simulation 2 08 km is 4 52 larger than the result from the 3dfv simulation 1 99 km as the vegetation aboveground biomass increases to 2000 g m 2 the 3dsv simulation result 1 64 km becomes 11 6 larger than the 3dfv simulation result 1 47 km although the absolute values of the flooding distance decrease with the increasing aboveground biomass 3 3 comparison of the 2dlm simulations and the biomass variation simulations to better compare the biomass variation simulations against the 2dlm simulations the variation ranges of each metric from the 2dlm simulations that correspond to the highest and lowest manning s value hereafter named as reference ranges in 2dlm are plotted as the horizontal gray bars on the corresponding subplots in fig 4 the 2dlm simulations did not explicitly account for the vegetation biomass variations therefore the reference ranges under a given tidal condition remain constant as the aboveground biomass increases along the x axis under the microtidal condition the reference ranges of the tidal flooding fig 4a tidal velocity fig 4d and tidal depth fig 4g are larger than the corresponding metric values from the biomass variation simulations and the differences become larger with the vegetation aboveground biomass under the mesotidal condition fig 4 b e and h the metric results from 2dvm simulations show some overlaps with the reference ranges when the vegetation aboveground biomass is less than 500 g m 2 as the tidal amplitude increases to macro tide fig 4 c f and i more overlaps between the reference ranges and 2dvm simulation results are found as the vegetation aboveground biomass is less than 1500 g m 2 these results indicate that 1 given the same tidal condition the flow resistance effects estimated by 2dlm is smaller than those estimated by the 3dsv and the 3dfv and the differences between them increase with the vegetation aboveground biomass 2 the 2dvm results of the vegetation drag are close to the 2dlm results especially when the vegetation aboveground biomass is smaller or the tidal amplitude is larger we also examined the vegetation drag evolution along the marshland for the selected subset of our simulations for each parameterization the results of this analysis demonstrate that the flow resistance effects of the marshland represented by the vegetation drag has been already captured by the chosen evaluation metrics see appendix ii for a more detailed discussion 4 discussion 4 1 adjustment of manning s n in 2d parameterizations 2dlm assigns the manning s n values based on the marsh types which is a classic way of estimating the vegetation drag in many coastal flooding studies however this classic parameterization has one intrinsic limitation it cannot account for the variations especially in time of the vegetation biomass and their resulting flow resistance effects particularly in natural settings the flow resistance for any given marsh type during peak growth season and vegetative decay season should differ therefore it is not reasonable to determine the manning s n values only by the land cover types in fact as pointed out in lapetina and sheng 2014 many real applications using 2dlm have considered the manning s n as a tuning parameter for better model performance however since the metrics have different sensitivity to the manning s n value section 3 1 tuning manning s n specifically for one output might not provide reasonable results for another lapetina and sheng 2015 for example in some applications using 2dlm excessive calibrations of the water level have led to deviations in the prediction of flow velocity which may cause inaccurate estimations of bottom shear stress e g hu et al 2015 as well as the corresponding sediment transport and coastal erosion in addition because hydrodynamic results are less sensitive to the manning s n value as the water depth increases it would be more difficult to calibrate 2dlm model results in relatively deeper water applications just by tuning manning s n within a reasonable range therefore a tuned manning s n does not have the predictive power of a prognostic one worse yet the implication is that these effects are effectively hidden within most studies using 2dlm so that the true role of vegetation sensitivity is unfortunately obscured 2dvm provides an alternative adjustment option for 2dlm it keeps the framework of the classic parameterization but abandons the determination role of marsh types on manning s n instead it introduces the vegetation stem characteristics to prognostically compute manning s n therefore 2dvm has the capability to capture the vegetation drag variation with respect to the vegetation biomass variation in the 2dvm simulations driven by a micro tide the aboveground biomass determines the overall flow resistance effects of the vegetation due to the relatively smaller water depth when the aboveground biomass is 100 g m 2 the averaged 2dvm manning s n value along the marshland during a tidal cycle is 0 072 sm 1 3 which is close to the maximum 2dlm manning s n value 0 065 sm 1 3 this averaged 2dvm manning s n value will increase with the aboveground biomass since there exists a positive correlation between the 2dvm manning s n and the aboveground biomass as indicated in equation 3 as a result the differences between 2dvm and 2dlm results become larger with increasing biomass although 2dvm considers the vegetation biomass in determining manning s n it inherits the limitation of 2dlm that the vegetation drag is treated only as a bottom drag which makes the flow resistance differences between 2dvm and 2dlm less significant in deeper waters because of this their evaluation metrics actually become more similar as the tidal amplitude increases however treating the vegetation drag only as a bottom drag results in an inaccurate quantification of the flow resistance effects of the coastal marsh throughout the vertical water column especially when the vegetation height is comparable to the water depth therefore compared to the 3d parameterizations the 2d vegetation drag parameterizations tend to underestimate the flow resistance effects and are less sensitive to the vegetation aboveground biomass all these limitations in the 2d vegetation drag parameterizations will lead to the failure to accurately simulate the vegetated shear flows and turbulence e g finnigan 2000 as well as the vertical mass transport e g ackerman 2002 water clarity through the removal of nutrient particulates and trace metals e g ghisalberti and nepf 2005 and sediment suspension and retention e g gacia et al 1999 hansen and reidenbach 2012 4 2 vegetation flexibility 3dsv and 3dfv resolve the vertically variable vegetation drag throughout the vegetation occupied water column which addresses the limitations of the 2d parameterizations that consider the vegetation drag only at the bottom e g nepf 2012 compared to 3dsv 3dfv considers the vegetation flexibility and its bending effects can reduce the effective vegetation height and the vegetation drag considerably e g bouma et al 2005 sand jensen 2008 dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 this is why the flow resistance effects estimated by 3dsv are larger than those estimated by 3dfv the variation of the vegetation flexibility v flex with the vegetation aboveground biomass was computed using equations 8 15 by setting ρ v 800 kg m 3 t 0 2 mm e 1 0 gpa bio 0 2000 g m 2 values used in 3dfv simulations and assuming a uniform flow u 0 1 m s 1 the result shown in fig 5 demonstrates that under a certain flow velocity the vegetation flexibility increases with the vegetation aboveground biomass in 3dsv simulations when the vegetation biomass increases the vegetation will occupy more of the water column and the vegetation drag at each layer of the vegetation occupied column will also increase in 3dfv simulations however the vegetation flexibility will increase with the vegetation biomass which reduces the fraction of vegetation occupied water column and decreases the flow resistance effects of the vegetation this explains why 3dfv is less sensitive to the vegetation aboveground biomass compared to 3dsv in addition to the vegetation biomass the vegetation flexibility is also determined by three other vegetation variables the vegetation tissue density ρ v vegetation blade thickness t and vegetation elastic modulus e these variables are set as constant in the present 3dfv simulations to the authors knowledge guidance in the literature is quite incomplete regarding the selection of accurate values for these variables for vegetation flexibility computation therefore we further analyzed the sensitivity of the vegetation flexibility to each of these variables we first adopted the value of each variable in 3dfv simulations as the reference value then assigned each variable a variation range of 25 which is 600 kg m 3 1000 kg m 3 for vegetation density 0 15 mm 0 25 mm for vegetation blade thickness and 0 75 gpa 1 25 gpa for vegetation elastic modulus respectively these ranges are reasonable for each variable based on lei and nepf 2019 and the references therein when the sensitivity of the vegetation flexibility to one variable was evaluated the remaining two variables were set at the reference values the sensitivity tests were carried out under a uniform flow with the velocity u 0 1 m s 1 and the vegetation aboveground biomass bio 1000 g m 2 the sensitivity results in fig 6 show that the vegetation flexibility has positive correlations with the blade thickness and the elastic modulus and a negative correlation with the vegetation elastic modulus more specifically in the vegetation blade thickness sensitivity tests the value of the vegetation flexibility decreases by 16 which is larger than the variation in the tissue density sensitivity tests 6 4 or in the elastic modulus sensitivity tests 5 3 these results indicate that the vegetation flexibility is more sensitive to the blade thickness than to the vegetation tissue density or vegetation elastic modulus for a given marsh type the vegetation tissue density and elastic modulus vary much smaller than the blade thickness lei and nepf 2019 therefore the blade thickness could be a more dominant parameter for the vegetation flexibility calculation it is worth noting that here we considered these three vegetation variables independently further observational and laboratory studies are needed to ascertain individual and joint sensitivity contributions occurring in real world as determined via measurement nevertheless this sensitivity test provides a reasonable reference pending future investigations for the parameter configurations of vegetation flexibility in numerical simulations 4 3 parameterization selection in applications the derivations and applications of different vegetation drag parameterizations in the introduction section have been summarized in the introduction selection of a vegetation drag parameterization for an application depends on many aspects of the parameterization such as its accuracy data requirement and availability and the computational efficiency accuracy is traditionally assessed by comparing the proximity of the model results and the calibration observational or analytical data this study focuses on the first order comparisons of different parameterizations in a series of idealized tidal flooding simulations and there are no calibration data available and no model tuning to directly determine the accuracy of each parameterization instead the relative accuracy of a parameterization is assessed by two characters of the parameterization 1 the relative magnitude of the estimated flow resistance effects and 2 the relative sensitivity to the vegetation aboveground biomass compared to the other parameterizations these characters were evaluated in sections 3 2 and 3 3 each parameterization requires different input data 2dlm requires the manning s n value which is either determined by marsh types or considered as a tunable parameter compared to 2dlm 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv require the data of the vegetation stem height stem diameter and stem density and 3dfv further requires three more vegetation variables tissue density blade thickness and elastic modulus to compute the effective vegetation height therefore 2dlm requires the least input data and 3dfv requires the most input data parameterizations also have different computational efficiency in this study each of the simulations was run in parallel using five nodes 36 cpus per node on the high performance computer grizzly tundra extreme scale xeon e5 2695v4 18c 2 1 ghz intel omni path at the los alamos national laboratory in 2dlm simulations the maximum time step was set at 2 s and each simulation took about 45 min in 2dvm simulations the maximum time step was also 2 s and each simulation took 75 min in 3dsv and 3dfvsimulations since the vegetation drag was computed at each vertical layer in an explicit model scheme 50 sigma layers in total a maximum time step was set as 0 5 s each 3dsv simulation took about 120 min while each 3dfv simulation took about 135 min performance and scaling are critical requirements for climate models such as mpas o especially when used in the doe energy exascale earth system model in mpas o each vegetation drag parameterization adds only about 0 8 compute time to the total simulation time excluding file read write time using a standard global 60 to 30 km resolution with 250 thousand horizontal gird cells and 60 vertical levels strong scaling tests at this global resolution spanning from 32 to 1024 computing cores show near perfect scaling with the vegetation drag component the comparisons of the four parameterizations in terms of the abovementioned aspects are summarized in table 6 which provide an assessment for parameterization selection for specific applications for example 2dlm might be more suitable for rapid surge forecast applications due to its simplicity in model structure and data requirement convenient tuning capability for water level prediction and high computational efficiency as a modification of 2dlm 2dvm provides a theoretical basis for choosing manning s n values making it feasible in simulating the spatial and seasonal variations of vegetation drags in shallow water 3dsv and 3dfv are the two options for the applications requiring vertical resolution of vegetation drag considering that coastal marshes are often flexible 3dfv is a better choice for flow turbulence and vertical mixing studies over vegetated coastal regions e g chapman et al 2015 these 3d approaches are clearly suited for site scale modeling studies where detailed flow characteristics are important however they are likely too detailed for large scale global applications where coastal mesh is only coarsely resolved e g much larger than km scale coastal mesh resolution 4 4 coastal geomorphological implications a different selection of vegetation drag parameterization will potentially result in different estimates of flooding associated coastal sediment transport processes which are a function of the flooding area flooding velocity and flooding depth as shown in fig 4 a b and c the flooding distances in the 2dlm and 2dvm are always larger than those in the 3dsv and 3dfv simulations the flooding distance in a 2dv model indicates the flooding area on a marshland surface this implies that the coastal hydrodynamic models treating vegetation drag as a bottom 2d drag may estimate a larger coastal flooding area than models considering vegetation drag in 3d since coastal marshes are often appear as major sediment sinks e g frey and basan 1978 a larger flooding area indicates more potential landward sediment transport and marshland sedimentation during the flooding process and this will further influence the long term marshland evolution because the sediment deposition is one of the key factors determining the vertical accretion of marshes e g zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b sediment erosion initiates when the flooding velocity exceeds the critical shear velocity the differences in flooding velocity shown in fig 4 d e and f indicate that different vegetation drag parameterizations will predict different degrees of coastal erosion especially under a higher tidal amplitude assuming the critical shear velocity for a given marshland bottom texture is 20 cm s 1 which is a typical value for fine sediment in shallow water e g van rijn 2016 shahmohammadi et al 2021 coastal erosion will occur in the 2dlm simulations under the macrotidal condition because the simulated flooding velocity is always above the critical shear velocity in contrast no coastal erosion will occur in the 3dsv simulations because the simulated flooding velocities are smaller than the critical shear velocity therefore using different vegetation drag parameterizations may lead to different coastal erosion and eventually coastal morphological evolution the salt tolerance of coastal marshes decreases landward as a consequence of the increasing inundation depth and water salinity over the marshland e g odum 1984 visser et al 1998 along with the different estimations in the flooding distances the distribution of salt water over the marshland will differ which will lead to the different salt intrusion estimations e g maccready and geyer 2010 this will further produce different long term projections of possible coastal marsh type evolution such as salt marsh landward transgression in response to salt intrusion e g craft et al 2009 fagherazzi et al 2019 as coastal marshes become more salt tolerant the tidal attenuation effects of marshland weaken section 3 1 which will eventually increase the risks of coastal inundation and coastal erosion 4 5 study limitations and future work the present work has illustrated some limitations requiring further study for example from a physics based perspective the flow resistance effects of coastal marshes consists of vegetation drag and inertia forces e g mendez and losada 2004 marsooli and wu 2014 this study only focused on the vegetation drag and neglected the vegetation induced inertia forces for model simplification although the inertia forces have been reported to be much smaller than the vegetation drag for typical flow condition e g mendez and losada 2004 this simplification should be justified in the future work in addition when this study was undertaken the mpas o model has not been incorporated a turbulence closure model for coastal simulations only deep ocean mixing via kpp was available as noted in van roekel et al 2018 therefore the influence of coastal marshes on the vertical mixing was not included in this study this limitation will be addressed in the future work when a new mpas o version is released with coastal turbulence closure options furthermore the vegetation drag coefficient c d has been related to the reynolds number r e in experimental studies e g méndez et al 1999 paul and amos 2011 hu et al 2014 möller et al 2014 its value is close to the order of one under high r e current condition e g in this study but could vary much more broadly under wave conditions e g vuik et al 2016 chen et al 2018 mancheño et al 2021 for instance vuik et al 2016 found out that the value of c d computed at the same re using different empirical equations may differ by a factor of 44 previous studies have investigated the contributions of hydrodynamic conditions to c d e g van veelen et al 2020 but a systematic sensitivity test of c d to different physical regimes particularly wave conditions and their effects on flow resistance is still lacking and worthy of further investigations 5 conclusions in this study four vegetation drag parameterizations for coastal marshes i e 2dlm 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv were implemented into mpas o a series of tidal flooding simulations along an idealized tidal transect were performed and three evaluation metrics i e flooding distance flooding velocity and flooding depth were defined to analyze the differences in coastal hydrodynamics due to these parameterizations the results demonstrated that among the four parameterizations 2dlm does not directly account for the variation of the vegetation biomass and tends to underestimate the flow resistance effects of the coastal marsh since manning s n is the only tunable parameter in 2dlm and the evaluation metrics have different sensitivity to it tuning 2dlm specifically for one output variable might not provide reasonable results for another at the same time 2dvm introduces the vegetation stem characteristics to prognostically compute the manning s n enabling it to capture the vegetation drag variations with respect to the vegetation biomass variation the flow resistance effects estimated from 2dvm are the closest to those from 2dlm especially when tidal amplitude is larger or the vegetation aboveground biomass is smaller in addition compared to the 3d parameterizations 2dvm is less sensitive to the vegetation aboveground biomass 3dsv estimates the largest flow resistance effects and it is most sensitive to the vegetation aboveground biomass due to the bending effects of the vegetation the estimates of the flow resistance effects from 3dfv simulations are always smaller than those from 3dsv simulations and are very close to the average estimations from 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv simulations the sensitivity of the vegetation flexibility to its three vegetation variables blade thickness tissue density and elastic modulus was analyzed and the results demonstrates that the blade thickness is a potential tuning parameter for the vegetation flexibility calculation the comparisons among the four parameterizations including the relative estimation magnitudes of flow resistance effects the data requirement data sensitivity model complexity and computational efficiency are summarized to help inform the parameterization selection for specific applications compared to the other three parameterizations 3dfv adds complexity to modeling efforts but it provides more degrees of freedom for model tuning and it also represents a step toward a more physics based quantitative estimation of vegetation drag e g abdolahpour et al 2018 different selections of the vegetation drag parameterization in coastal hydrodynamic simulations result in different coastal geomorphological implications because of the coastal flooding differences arising from the vegetation drag parameterizations the estimates of coastal sediment transport processes including the landward sediment transport marshland sedimentation and coastal erosion the marshland salt intrusion as well as the marsh elevation will differ these together will eventually influence the estimates of the long term evolution of coastal marshes and coastal morphology code and data availability the mpas o code with the four vegetation drag parameterizations and the simulation cases can be found at cao et al 2021a the simulation results from the four vegetation drag parameterizations are archived at cao et al 2021b cao et al 2021c cao et

implementation and validation of wetting and drying scheme in mpas o following warner et al 2013 the wetting and drying scheme implemented in mpas o applies the thin film algorithm in this algorithm a spatially uniform minimum depth h min is pre defined manually the magnitude of h min can vary from a few millimeters to several meters depending on the user defined applications warner et al 2013 at each time step the total water depth free surface plus bathymetry at the center of the mpas o grid cell is compared to h min if the total depth is smaller than h min the cell is then defined as dry and there will be no flux of water permitted out from the cell the flux can still go into the dry cell though if the total depth is larger than h min the cell is then defined as wet and the flux of water is permitted in and out from the cell freely two validation test cases in warner et al 2013 the sloping channel case and the dam break case were adopted to validate the wetting and drying scheme implementation in mpas o the sloping channel case simulated the one dimensional 1d tidal propagation along a 1 km wide and 25 km long channel with a constant bottom slope the depth of the channel is zero at the upland boundary and 10 m at the seaward boundary the computational grid resolution is 250 m a symmetric diurnal tide with amplitude as 10 m is assigned at the seaward boundary a threshold minimum wetting depth is set to 0 1 m following warner et al 2013 two simulations were performed with different bottom roughness c f one with c f 0 0025 and the other with c f 0 01 each simulation was run 0 5 days with a time step as 1 s and the water level along the slope was recorded every 5 min the dam break case simulated the water spills from a basin through an opening to flood through an initially dry floodplain the basin is 1 m wide in x direction and 2 m long in y direction and the initial water depth is 0 6 m the opening is 0 4 m wide centered on the edge of the basin in the y direction the floodplain extends 3 m in the x direction the grid resolution is 0 04 m this simulation was run 10 s with a time step as 0 0001 s and the water level at four stations were recorded every 0 01 s the bird view of the dam break and the floodplain as well as the stations can be found on the top left panel of fig a 2 the validation results are shown in fig a 1 sloping channel test and fig

triangles for six instances in time 0 05 0 15 0 25 0 30 0 40 and 0 50 days the comparison results identify a good agreement between the mpas o results roms results and the analytical solution in the dam break case six h min values i e 0 1 0 5 1 0 10 0 20 0 50 0 10 4 m were tested the results fig a 2 demonstrated that the variation of h min only significantly affects the results at station 8a the results with h min as 0 1 10 4 and 20 0 10 4 m were omitted to keep the figure neat due to the high pressure gradient initiated by the model discontinuity at station 8a in the dam break case there existed some oscillations in the water levels during the first few seconds these oscillations were smoothed by increasing the horizontal viscosity ν h in the momentum equation of the model the time series of water levels from mpas o with h min 1 0 10 4 m and ν h 5 0 10 3 m 2 s 1 solid red lines match quite well with the observations black circles and the roms results blue triangles at all five stations both cases became instable if the implemented wetting and drying scheme is turned off in the model together the results of these cases indicate the successful implementation of the wetting and drying scheme in mpas o appendix i i vegetation drag evolution along the marshland to validate the use of evaluation metrics to quantify the flow resistance effects of vegetation the vegetation drag evolution along the marshland was computed for each simulation and the tide averaged results of a subset simulations are shown in fig a 3 in 2dlm and 2dvm simulations the vegetation drag was computed as a drag force exerted on the bottom using the vegetation manning s n in 3dsv and 3dfv simulations the vegetation drag was computed as the integral of the drag forces over the vertical water column occupied by vegetation i e along the vegetation stem e g maza et al 2013 the variations of the vegetation drag in 2dlm simulations due to different manning s n values are shaded in grey for the biomass variation simulations considering that the flow resistance effects increase with vegetation aboveground biomass for a given tidal condition the vegetation drag forces under minimum 100 g m 2 and maximum 2000 g m 2 vegetation aboveground biomasses are plotted as the lower and upper bounds of the drag force respectively for each parameterization the lower bounds are shown as solid lines and the upper bounds are shown as dashed lines in general vegetation drag increases with the tidal amplitude see the changes of y axis magnitude in the subplots and decreases landward over the marshland for a given tidal condition both due to the variation of the flow velocity 2dlm estimates the smallest vegetation drag grey shading especially when the tidal amplitude is smaller 2dvm shows the closest vegetation drag results to 2dlm and their overlap increases with the tidal amplitude compare the overlap between the grey shading and the area in between the black solid and dashed lines in fig a 3 with the overlap between the reference range of 2dlm and the blue lines with circles in fig 4 3dsv provides the largest vegetation drag for a given tidal condition and vegetation aboveground biomass while the vegetation drag in 3dfv is intermediate between 2dvm and 2dvm the differences in the vegetation drag between 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv become larger as the tidal amplitude increases in contrast to the results in the other two tidal conditions the upper bounds of the vegetation drag in 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv under the micro tide dashed lines in fig a 3 a become zero at around 0 5 km instead of at the landward tip of the marshland this is because under the microtidal condition when the vegetation aboveground biomass is 2000 g m 2 the vegetation drag along the seaward side of the marshland is large enough to dissipate the incoming tides which do not propagate through the entire marshland as indicated in fig 4a when the vegetation aboveground biomass is 2000 g m 2 the flooding distances in the biomass variation simulations are smaller than the length of the marshland 2 0 km which is not found in the other simulations fig 4b and 4c therefore the vegetation drag in these simulations turns to zero earlier than the other simulations 
4101,vegetation drag is a fundamental quantity directly affecting results for both long and short term coastal marsh and geomorphological studies the vegetation drag in coastal marshland has been modeled by various two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d numerical parameterizations 2d parameterizations treat coastal marshes as bottom roughness elements while 3d parameterizations resolve the vertically variable vegetation drag through the water column however differences in tidal propagation arising from different drag parameterizations within a single model are largely unknown and clear guidance on parameterization selection is still missing in this study we implemented four vegetation drag parameterizations into the model for prediction across scales ocean mpas o which include 1 a 2d parameterization using land cover type determined manning s n 2dlm 2 a 2d parameterization using vegetation determined manning s n 2dvm 3 a 3d parameterization for stiff vegetation 3dsv and 4 a 3d parameterization for flexible vegetation 3dfv estimates of the flow resistance effects from these parameterizations were compared using a series of idealized tidal propagation simulations given the same tidal condition flooding depth and flooding distance are the largest in the 2dlm simulations and the smallest in the 3dsv simulations 2dvm results are the closest to the 2dlm results 3dfv results are the closest to the average of 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv results 2dvm and 3dsv results are the least and most sensitive to the vegetation aboveground biomass respectively based on the input data requirement and computational efficiency of each parameterization a comparison summary is provided to help inform parameterization selection for specific applications the effects of these parameterizations on coastal geomorphology are further discussed and the results demonstrate that estimates of the long term evolution of coastal marshes and coastal morphology depend upon the

production nutrient cycling and coastal erosion control costanza et al 1997 and help attenuate landward propagation of shallow water flows and storm surge e g wamsley et al 2010 möller et al 2014 leonardi et al 2018 marshes are a dominant control on bed roughness that alters the propagation of incoming shallow water flow leading to modified coastal hydrodynamics and inundation which further affects the transport of nutrients and sediment e g schulz et al 2003 temmerman et al 2005 and coastal erosion e g fagherazzi 2014 the surface inundation condition in turn affects the growth of coastal marshes and the marshland ecosystem functions silvestri and marani 2004 therefore an accurate prediction of water propagation on coastal marshland is critical for estimating the risk of coastal flooding on coastal ecosystems especially under intensified climate change to quantify the effects of coastal marshland on tidal propagation and flooding various vegetation drag parameterizations of coastal marshes are proposed e g loder et al 2009 azechi et al 2007 stone and shen 2002 luhar and nepf 2011 temmerman et al 2005 beudin et al 2017 in some two dimensional 2d vertically integrated e g luettich et al 1992 wamsley et al 2010 and even three dimensional 3d coastal hydrodynamic models e g chen et al 2003 shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the vegetation drag is simply represented in terms of the vegetation induced 2d bottom friction which can be computed by a quadratic law using a manning s n formulation marsooli et al 2016 this 2d manning s n approach mainly has two different parameterizations one is to assign constant manning s n values based on the land cover types with the manning s n values selected or interpolated from hydraulic literature this is the classic parameterization of vegetation drag and has been widely applied to hurricane and tsunami induced coastal surge inundation studies which are required to be computationally efficient for timely prediction e g loder et al 2009 wamsley et al 2010 bunya et al 2010 dietrich et al 2011a dietrich et al 2011b zhang et al 2012 kaiser et al 2011 ferreira et al 2014 yalcin 2020 the other less commonly applied is to consider the vegetation stem characteristics i e stem height stem density and stem diameter in computing the manning s n values azechi et al 2007 this parameterization was derived by evaluating the velocity field in an experimental open channel with vegetation and has been only applied to analyze the spatial and seasonal impact of the submerged vegetation drag on the coastal hydrodynamics moki et al 2020 the 2d parameterizations treat the aquatic vegetation as bottom roughness elements and assume a logarithmic flow profile above them baptist et al 2007 this is reasonable when the coastal marsh height is negligible compared to the water depth however for submerged or emergent marshes with the stem height comparable to water depth these parameterizations are unable to resolve the flow through the vegetation and thus fail to accurately quantify the flow resistance effects of coastal marshes on the coastal hydrodynamics e g nepf 2012 lapetina and sheng 2014 to overcome the limitation of the 2d parameterizations a two layer approach e g stone and shen 2002 huthoff et al 2007 baptist 2005 baptist et al 2007 cheng 2011 luhar and nepf 2013 has been proposed this approach separates the water column vertically into the surface layer for submerged vegetation and a vegetation layer and then computes the steady flows in the two layers separately based on the simplified momentum balances this approach however assumes a logarithmic velocity profile through the surface layer and resolves the flow through the vegetation layer either by a depth averaged simplification e g stone and shen 2002 or by a number of complex equations with parameterizations for eddy viscosity mixing length shear velocity etc e g baptist et al 2007 these make the two layer approach rarely applied in coastal hydrodynamic modeling studies recently 3d parameterizations of vegetation drag have been proposed to resolve the flows through and above vegetation e g temmerman et al 2005 lapetina and sheng 2014 beudin et al 2017 kalra et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b without the flow determining assumptions as in the two layer approach these 3d parameterizations account for coastal marsh morphology in computing the vertically variable vegetation drag through the marsh occupied water column however they only apply when the vegetation height is not negligible compared to the water depth or the description of the flow through a bulk representation of vegetation is required for example lapetina and sheng 2014 developed a 3d vegetation drag parameterization by incorporating a one dimensional vertical 1dv vegetation resolved turbulent kinetic energy model tkem into a 3d storm surge wave model some other 3d vegetation parameterization studies apply the quadratic drag law thompson and roberson 1976 to compute the vegetation drag and the vertical velocity distribution e g huai et al 2009 liu and zeng 2017 in a 3d form in addition coastal marsh vegetation is usually flexible with deformation resulting from the force balance between the hydrodynamic drag and the water buoyancy as well as the vegetation restoring force due to the blade stiffness zeller et al 2014 therefore if the vegetation deformation in response to flow is considerable the reduction of the vegetation drag due to the vegetation flexibility may be further evaluated e g luhar and nepf 2011 beudin et al 2017 lei and nepf 2019 in view of all these different vegetation drag parameterizations it is important to understand their different effects on tidal propagation and coastal flooding lapetina and sheng 2015 compared two vegetation drag parameterizations a 2d manning s n approach and their 3d parameterization in coastal hydrodynamic simulations but these comparisons were carried out using different numerical models one model in 2d and the other in 3d to our best knowledge there have been no studies to compare different parameterizations using the same numerical modeling system under a control of consistent simulation parameters lacking a rigorous parameterization intercomparison leads to uncertainty in the potential hydrodynamic differences arising from these parameterizations consequently a clear guidance on parameterization selection is also missing to fill these research gaps we implemented four different vegetation drag parameterizations of coastal marshes into a numerical model and designed the first series of idealized simulations that rigorously compared the effects of different vegetation drag parameterizations on tidal propagation and coastal flooding the rest of the paper is organized as follows a brief introduction of the selected numerical model the implementations of the four parameterizations and the configurations of the simulations are described in section 2 the simulation results represented by three defined metrics are presented in section 3 section 4 discusses the adjustment of manning s n in the 2d parameterizations and the vegetation flexibility in the 3d parameterizations and provides a comparison summary to inform parameterization selection in various applications the broad geomorphological implications of this study are also highlighted in section 4 finally the main conclusions of this study are summarized in section 5 2 methods 2 1 numerical modeling in this study we used the model for prediction across scales ocean mpas o ringler et al 2013 for vegetation drag implementation under different tidal conditions mpas o utilizes a hexagonal unstructured multi resolution horizontal mesh and employs a c grid finite volume method for the horizontal discretization the vertical coordinate of the model uses an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale approach with flexible configurations including z star and sigma coordinates for specific applications petersen et al 2015 the biharmonic viscosity and the leith turbulence closure are used to regularize the momentum equation for the horizontal turbulence closure the community ocean vertical mixing project version of the k profile parameterization kpp is implemented in the model for global ocean vertical mixing van roekel et al 2018 readers are referred to ringler et al 2013 and petersen et al 2015 for detailed descriptions of the model equations and numerical approach in order to simulate the coastal tidal flooding process we have implemented in mpas o a wetting and drying scheme following the thin film approach e g warner et al 2013 two validation test cases in warner et al 2013 the sloping channel case and the dam break case were reproduced to verify the wetting and drying implementation in mpas o the wetting and drying scheme the setup of the validation test cases as well as the validation results are provided in the appendix i to compare the potential hydrodynamic consequences of different parameterizations of vegetation drag within the same model the following four parameterizations were adopted from previous studies and implemented in mpas o 1 a 2d parameterization using land cover type determined manning s n 2dlm in this parameterization the vegetation drag is computed as bottom friction using the following equations with the manning s n values determined by the land cover types e g bunya et al 2010 dietrich et al 2011a dietrich et al 2011b 1 c d g n 2 h 1 3 2 τ b 1 2 ρ c d u b u b where c d is the bottom drag coefficient g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 ms 2 n is manning roughness coefficient sm 1 3 h is total water depth m τ b is bottom shear stress nm 2 ρ is the water density 1025 kgm 3 and u b is bottom velocity m s 1 2 a 2d parameterization using vegetation determined manning s n 2dvm similar to 2dlm this parameterization also computes the 2d vegetation drag using the equations 1 2 but the manning s n values are determined by three vegetation stem characteristics height density and diameter using the following equations azechi et al 2007 3 n h 2 3 β 2 c d λ h v c f gh α h v 2 1 exp α h v 1 α 2 h v h 1 exp α h v ln h h v h h v h 1 1 α h v 4 α c d λ 4 κ 2 h v 2 1 3 5 β α h v 2 1 exp 2 α h v 1 exp α h v 2 6 λ n d where α β and λ are intermediate parameters c d is the vegetation drag coefficient h v is the vegetation height m c f is bottom roughness κ is the von karman constant 0 4 n is the vegetation density m 2 and d is the vegetation diameter m in applications h v will be replaced by h in the above equations when the vegetation is not fully submerged 3 a 3d parameterization for stiff vegetation 3dsv this parameterization models the coastal marsh as stiff plants that do not bend and computes the 3d vegetation drag throughout the vegetation occupied water column via 7 τ veg z 1 2 ρ c d z n z d z h v z u z u z where τ veg is the vegetation drag n m 2 z is the vertical coordinate with positive upward c d is the vegetation drag coefficients and u is the flow velocity m s 1 through the water column the vertical variations of all the vegetation related variables on the right hand side of the equation are omitted in this study 4 a 3d parameterization for flexible vegetation 3dfv this parameterization is similar to 3dsv but it further considers the vegetation flexibility beudin et al 2017 it first computes the effective height h ve of flexible vegetation using the following equations then computes the vegetation drag using equation 7 with h v replaced by h ve 8 h ve h v 1 1 0 9 c a 1 3 1 c a 3 2 8 b 3 2 9 c a 0 5 ρ c d d u 2 h v 3 ei 10 b ρ ρ v g d t h v 3 ei i d t 3 12 where h ve is the effective vegetation height m b is the buoyancy parameter c a is the cauchy number e is the elastic modulus gpa ρ v the vegetation tissue density kgm 3 i is the second moment of area m 4 and t is the vegetation blade thickness m the vegetation flexibility can be evaluated using the following nondimensional number indicating the fraction by which the vegetation height decreases due to the vegetation deformation with the flow 12 v flex 1 h ve h v in which v flex increases with the vegetation flexibility in mpas o we implemented the 2d parameterizations as bottom drag in the implicit vertical mixing for momentum and implemented the 3d parameterizations explicitly by treating the vegetation drag as an individual velocity forcing in the 3d flow 2 2 numerical simulations we designed an idealized coastal transect for a series of two dimensional vertical 2dv tidal propagation experiments with the lateral effects excluded for model simplicity the idealized transect fig 1 is 8 km long and includes a coastal marshland simplified from the coastal marshlands at the delaware bay as used in zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b an upland segment and an offshore segment each segment is defined by its length and slope with parameters designated in table 1 only the marshland is covered by coastal marshes employing the vegetation drag effects the mean sea level is set to 3 m the same level as the elevation of the marshland at the ocean boundary a sinusoidal semi diurnal tide is imposed at the offshore open boundary which is initiated to propagate along the transect from the mean sea level purple dashed line in fig 1 this transect is a good representation of the geometric relationships between upland intertidal zone and subtidal zone during water propagation e g kirwan et al 2016 morris et al 2002 to conduct a focused study on the vegetation effect on tide driven water propagation we exclude wave effect on water propagation here because the regular wave can quickly dissipate when it reaches marsh vegetation and it would not have big impact on water propagation to the inland moftakhari et al 2017 zoccarato et al 2019 d alpaos et al 2007 muñoz et al 2020 wave effect will be investigated in a separate study in the future the horizontal resolution of the transect grid is 20 m and there are in total 50 vertical layers using a sigma coordinate with the bottom topography smoothly represented and the layer thickness vertically uniform the topographic characteristics of the idealized transect are summarized in table 1 to compare the four parameterizations of vegetation drag implemented in mpas o a series of tidal flooding simulations along the idealized transect were configured three different semi diurnal tidal amplitudes i e 0 8 m 1 6 m and 2 4 m were considered at the offshore open boundary of the idealized transect to represent the micro meso and macro tidal conditions respectively for a given tidal condition the bottom drag values at the upland and offshore regions were computed using equations 1 2 and the manning s n values provided in table 1 the vegetation drag at the marshland was computed using one of the four aforementioned parameterizations in the simulations using the 2dlm parameterization referred to as 2dlm simulations hereafter and so on for the simulations using other parameterizations constant manning s n values were assigned along the marshland based on four most common land cover types over the marshland as detailed in table 2 together the 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv simulations are called biomass variation simulations since all these simulations took into account the variation of vegetation stem characteristics as a function of vegetation aboveground biomass d alpaos et al 2007 namely 13 n 250 bio 0 3032 14 h v 0 0609 bio 0 1876 15 d 0 0006 bio 0 3 where bio represents the vegetation aboveground biomass g m 2 although these equations were derived based on salt marsh data morris and haskin 1990 we adopted them for all the vegetation types in this study because 1 in practice the vegetation aboveground biomass is relatively easier to get compared to the vegetation stem characteristics and 2 using same equations makes it easier to systematically control the values of the vegetation stem characteristics in our simulations for intercomparison analysis the justification of this adoption will need further study with sufficient field observations five different vegetation aboveground biomass values i e 100 500 1000 1500 and 2000 g m 2 table 3 were considered the first four biomass values were selected based on the observational data from crosby et al 2017 and the maximum biomass value 2000 g m 2 was adopted from previous numerical studies e g mudd et al 2004 d alpaos et al 2007 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b as a summary a concept map showing the simulation design is provided in fig 2 in the 2dvm simulations the bottom roughness c f used in equation 3 was calculated by equation 1 with n 0 0025 sm 1 3 which is a typical value for open water region in estuaries dietrich et al 2011b in the 3dsv and 3dfv simulations the value of vegetation drag coefficient c d is required the derivation of c d using either direct measurement method or the calibration methods is purely empirical and the selection of c d for real coastal cases is challenging as it is affected by different factors including the vegetation density vegetation morphology wave current interaction as well as flow reynolds number re e g nepf 2011 hu et al 2014 chen et al 2018 mancheño et al 2021 in this study c d in equation 7 was set to 1 0 which is a typical vegetation drag coefficient value at high re ο 10 4 in this study e g white 1991 armanini et al 2005 azechi et al 2007 luhar and nepf 2013 kalra et al 2017 moki et al 2020 in 3dfv simulations the vegetation tissue density ρ v was set to 800 kg m 3 the vegetation blade thickness t was set to 0 2 mm and the elastic modulus e was set to 1 0 gpa lei and nepf 2019 the minimum depth h min in the wetting and drying scheme is set to 1 0 10 3 m for all the simulations three evaluation metrics were defined to assess the potential hydrodynamic differences arising from different vegetation drag parameterizations flooding distance flooding velocity and flooding depth flooding distance was defined as the distance between the seaward edge of the marshland and the landward tip of the flooding water during the high tide fig 1 flooding velocity was defined as the averaged propagating velocity of water during the flooding process flooding depth was defined as the averaged water depth over the marshland during the high tide fig 1 these evaluation metrics represent three different physical aspects of the coastal flooding that are proxies for broader coastal processes 1 flooding distance could be considered as the flooding area on a 2d map 2 flooding velocity implies the ability of potential coastal erosion and 3 flooding depth indicates the inundation depth of the coastal marshes during tidal flooding each of the aforementioned simulations was spun up for three tidal cycles to reach a quasi steady state and the evaluation metrics were computed based on the hydrodynamic results during the fourth tidal cycle the sensitivity of the biomass variation simulations i e simulations of 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv to the vegetation aboveground biomass was also evaluated considering that each metric has a negative correlation with the vegetation aboveground biomass under a given tidal condition see section 3 2 we first computed the line of best fit between the normalized metric normalized by the largest value of the metric under the given tidal amplitude and the normalized vegetation aboveground biomass normalized by 2000 g m 2 using the linear least square regression method and then took the magnitude of the line slope as the decreasing trend of each metric a larger decreasing trend indicates a higher sensitivity of the metric to the vegetation aboveground biomass 3 results the 2dlm simulation results are presented first because 2dlm is 1 the most widely used classic parameterization and 2 the only parameterization in this study that determines the vegetation drag by marsh types the results of the biomass variation simulations are described together and then compared against the 2dlm simulations results 3 1 hydrodynamics from the 2dlm simulations results for the tidal flooding distance flooding velocity and flooding depth from the 2dlm simulations are shown in fig 3 all the evaluation metrics show positive correlations with the tidal amplitude and negative correlations with manning s n for all marsh types the values of the tidal flooding distance flooding velocity and flooding depth increase with the increasing tidal amplitude higher tidal amplitude indicates a larger amount of water propagating landward which results in larger metrics due to the mass and momentum conservations given one tidal condition the flooding distance flooding velocity and flooding depth all decrease as the marsh type changes from saline marsh to fresh marsh this is because as the marsh type becomes less salt tolerant the manning s n value table 2 as well as the corresponding bottom drag force become larger under the same tidal condition a larger drag force attenuates the tidal propagation along the transect and reduces the flooding distance and flooding velocity more strongly as less water propagates landward the mean water level over the marshland i e the flooding depth accordingly becomes smaller the relative variation of each metric differs with marsh types among all three metrics the flooding distance varies the least with different marsh types fig 3a regardless of what tidal boundary condition is applied in contrast the flooding velocity fig 3b and the flooding depth fig 3c vary more significantly with different marsh types under the microtidal condition the flooding distance decreases by 4 1 from saline marsh case 2 20 10 3 m to fresh marsh case 2 11 10 3 m the flooding velocity and the flooding depth decrease by 17 6 and 18 5 respectively under the mesotidal condition the decrease in the flooding distance the flooding velocity and the flooding depth are 1 8 12 6 and 5 2 respectively these values change to 1 5 6 5 and 3 4 respectively under the macrotidal condition the results indicate that the evaluation metrics have different sensitivity to the marsh types in the production of manning s n values in which flooding distance is the least sensitive metric and flooding velocity is the most sensitive one in addition all the evaluation metrics become less sensitive to the marsh types as the tidal amplitude increases evidence of this is seen in the flooding depth results under microtidal condition the values of the flooding depth from the brackish intermediate and fresh marsh cases 0 50 m 0 48 m and 0 44 m respectively are quite different while under macrotidal condition these values are nearly the same 2 01 m this is because 2dlm computes the vegetation drag as a bottom boundary drag as the tidal amplitude increases the water depth becomes larger thus the flow resistance effects of the bottom vegetation drag will become smaller over the entire water column 3 2 hydrodynamics from the biomass variation simulations results of the evaluation metrics from the biomass variation simulations are shown as solid lines in fig 4 and their numerical values are listed in table 4 in general all the evaluation metrics from the biomass variation simulations show positive correlations with the tidal amplitude which is similar to the 2dlm simulation results there also exists a negative correlation between the metrics and the vegetation aboveground biomass in these simulations the increasing vegetation aboveground biomass yields an increase in vegetation stem characteristics equations 13 15 which increases the manning s n values equations 3 6 and the bottom drag equations 1 2 in the 2dvm simulations as well as the drag force equations 7 in the 3dsv and 3dfv simulations the increased vegetation drag amplifies the flow resistance effects and further attenuates the tidal propagation leading to a reduced flooding distance flooding velocity and flooding depth the results of each metric using different parameterizations vary under the same simulation condition for example for the same tidal amplitude and the aboveground biomass the estimation of the flooding distance fig 4 a b and c is largest in the 2dvm simulation blue line with circle marker and smallest in the 3dsv simulation orange line with square marker while the estimation of the flooding distance in the 3dfv simulation green line with triangle marker is close to the averaged value black dash dot line of the simulations in 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv the range of the flooding distance between parameterizations actually increases with tidal amplitude these findings also hold for the results of the flooding velocity fig 4 d e and f and the flooding depth fig 4 g h and i among the biomass variation simulations 1 2dvm estimates the smallest flow resistance effects and 3dsv estimates the largest flow resistance effects while the estimates of the flow resistance effects using 3dfv are very close to the averaged values of the three parameterizations 2 the flow resistance differences arising from the three parameterizations become larger as the tidal amplitude increases and 3 considering that each metric implies a different aspect of tidal flooding consequence the potential hydrodynamic differences arising from the three parameterizations are consistent across various aspects of the tidal flooding as described in section 2 2 the decreasing trends of each metric to the vegetation aboveground biomass are evaluated using the slope of the best fit line between the normalized metric and the aboveground biomass for example under the microtidal condition the values of the flooding distance in the 2dvm simulations are 2 09 2 03 1 94 1 89 1 85 103 m which can be normalized as 1 0 0 97 0 93 0 90 0 89 by the largest flooding distance value 2 09 103 m the vegetation aboveground biomass can be normalized as 0 05 0 25 0 50 0 75 1 0 by its largest value 2000 g m 2 based on the linear least square regression method the relationship between the normalized vegetation aboveground biomass bio norm and the normalized flooding distance f d norm can be described as f d norm 0 12 bio norm 1 0 where the magnitude of the slope i e 0 12 is the decreasing trend of the flooding distance with the vegetation aboveground biomass in 2dvm simulations under the microtidal condition considering that a larger decreasing trend indicates a higher sensitivity of the metric to the vegetation aboveground biomass the results listed in table 5 indicate that 1 in terms of different evaluation metrics the flooding distance is the least sensitive metric to the aboveground biomass 2 in terms of different parameterizations 2dvm is least sensitive to the vegetation aboveground biomass while 3dsv is most sensitive to the vegetation aboveground biomass and 3 in terms of different tidal amplitudes the sensitivity of each parameterization to the vegetation aboveground biomass decreases with tidal amplitude due to the flexibility of coastal marshes the flow resistance effects estimated in the 3dfv simulations are always smaller than those in 3dsv simulations given the same tidal condition and vegetation aboveground biomass this can be evidenced from the larger evaluation metric values in 3dfv simulations than in 3dsv simulations see fig 4 moreover under a given tidal condition the relative difference of the metrics between the 3dsv and 3dfv simulations increase with the aboveground biomass for example under the micro tide with an aboveground biomass of 100 g m 2 the flooding distance result from the 3dsv simulation 2 08 km is 4 52 larger than the result from the 3dfv simulation 1 99 km as the vegetation aboveground biomass increases to 2000 g m 2 the 3dsv simulation result 1 64 km becomes 11 6 larger than the 3dfv simulation result 1 47 km although the absolute values of the flooding distance decrease with the increasing aboveground biomass 3 3 comparison of the 2dlm simulations and the biomass variation simulations to better compare the biomass variation simulations against the 2dlm simulations the variation ranges of each metric from the 2dlm simulations that correspond to the highest and lowest manning s value hereafter named as reference ranges in 2dlm are plotted as the horizontal gray bars on the corresponding subplots in fig 4 the 2dlm simulations did not explicitly account for the vegetation biomass variations therefore the reference ranges under a given tidal condition remain constant as the aboveground biomass increases along the x axis under the microtidal condition the reference ranges of the tidal flooding fig 4a tidal velocity fig 4d and tidal depth fig 4g are larger than the corresponding metric values from the biomass variation simulations and the differences become larger with the vegetation aboveground biomass under the mesotidal condition fig 4 b e and h the metric results from 2dvm simulations show some overlaps with the reference ranges when the vegetation aboveground biomass is less than 500 g m 2 as the tidal amplitude increases to macro tide fig 4 c f and i more overlaps between the reference ranges and 2dvm simulation results are found as the vegetation aboveground biomass is less than 1500 g m 2 these results indicate that 1 given the same tidal condition the flow resistance effects estimated by 2dlm is smaller than those estimated by the 3dsv and the 3dfv and the differences between them increase with the vegetation aboveground biomass 2 the 2dvm results of the vegetation drag are close to the 2dlm results especially when the vegetation aboveground biomass is smaller or the tidal amplitude is larger we also examined the vegetation drag evolution along the marshland for the selected subset of our simulations for each parameterization the results of this analysis demonstrate that the flow resistance effects of the marshland represented by the vegetation drag has been already captured by the chosen evaluation metrics see appendix ii for a more detailed discussion 4 discussion 4 1 adjustment of manning s n in 2d parameterizations 2dlm assigns the manning s n values based on the marsh types which is a classic way of estimating the vegetation drag in many coastal flooding studies however this classic parameterization has one intrinsic limitation it cannot account for the variations especially in time of the vegetation biomass and their resulting flow resistance effects particularly in natural settings the flow resistance for any given marsh type during peak growth season and vegetative decay season should differ therefore it is not reasonable to determine the manning s n values only by the land cover types in fact as pointed out in lapetina and sheng 2014 many real applications using 2dlm have considered the manning s n as a tuning parameter for better model performance however since the metrics have different sensitivity to the manning s n value section 3 1 tuning manning s n specifically for one output might not provide reasonable results for another lapetina and sheng 2015 for example in some applications using 2dlm excessive calibrations of the water level have led to deviations in the prediction of flow velocity which may cause inaccurate estimations of bottom shear stress e g hu et al 2015 as well as the corresponding sediment transport and coastal erosion in addition because hydrodynamic results are less sensitive to the manning s n value as the water depth increases it would be more difficult to calibrate 2dlm model results in relatively deeper water applications just by tuning manning s n within a reasonable range therefore a tuned manning s n does not have the predictive power of a prognostic one worse yet the implication is that these effects are effectively hidden within most studies using 2dlm so that the true role of vegetation sensitivity is unfortunately obscured 2dvm provides an alternative adjustment option for 2dlm it keeps the framework of the classic parameterization but abandons the determination role of marsh types on manning s n instead it introduces the vegetation stem characteristics to prognostically compute manning s n therefore 2dvm has the capability to capture the vegetation drag variation with respect to the vegetation biomass variation in the 2dvm simulations driven by a micro tide the aboveground biomass determines the overall flow resistance effects of the vegetation due to the relatively smaller water depth when the aboveground biomass is 100 g m 2 the averaged 2dvm manning s n value along the marshland during a tidal cycle is 0 072 sm 1 3 which is close to the maximum 2dlm manning s n value 0 065 sm 1 3 this averaged 2dvm manning s n value will increase with the aboveground biomass since there exists a positive correlation between the 2dvm manning s n and the aboveground biomass as indicated in equation 3 as a result the differences between 2dvm and 2dlm results become larger with increasing biomass although 2dvm considers the vegetation biomass in determining manning s n it inherits the limitation of 2dlm that the vegetation drag is treated only as a bottom drag which makes the flow resistance differences between 2dvm and 2dlm less significant in deeper waters because of this their evaluation metrics actually become more similar as the tidal amplitude increases however treating the vegetation drag only as a bottom drag results in an inaccurate quantification of the flow resistance effects of the coastal marsh throughout the vertical water column especially when the vegetation height is comparable to the water depth therefore compared to the 3d parameterizations the 2d vegetation drag parameterizations tend to underestimate the flow resistance effects and are less sensitive to the vegetation aboveground biomass all these limitations in the 2d vegetation drag parameterizations will lead to the failure to accurately simulate the vegetated shear flows and turbulence e g finnigan 2000 as well as the vertical mass transport e g ackerman 2002 water clarity through the removal of nutrient particulates and trace metals e g ghisalberti and nepf 2005 and sediment suspension and retention e g gacia et al 1999 hansen and reidenbach 2012 4 2 vegetation flexibility 3dsv and 3dfv resolve the vertically variable vegetation drag throughout the vegetation occupied water column which addresses the limitations of the 2d parameterizations that consider the vegetation drag only at the bottom e g nepf 2012 compared to 3dsv 3dfv considers the vegetation flexibility and its bending effects can reduce the effective vegetation height and the vegetation drag considerably e g bouma et al 2005 sand jensen 2008 dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 this is why the flow resistance effects estimated by 3dsv are larger than those estimated by 3dfv the variation of the vegetation flexibility v flex with the vegetation aboveground biomass was computed using equations 8 15 by setting ρ v 800 kg m 3 t 0 2 mm e 1 0 gpa bio 0 2000 g m 2 values used in 3dfv simulations and assuming a uniform flow u 0 1 m s 1 the result shown in fig 5 demonstrates that under a certain flow velocity the vegetation flexibility increases with the vegetation aboveground biomass in 3dsv simulations when the vegetation biomass increases the vegetation will occupy more of the water column and the vegetation drag at each layer of the vegetation occupied column will also increase in 3dfv simulations however the vegetation flexibility will increase with the vegetation biomass which reduces the fraction of vegetation occupied water column and decreases the flow resistance effects of the vegetation this explains why 3dfv is less sensitive to the vegetation aboveground biomass compared to 3dsv in addition to the vegetation biomass the vegetation flexibility is also determined by three other vegetation variables the vegetation tissue density ρ v vegetation blade thickness t and vegetation elastic modulus e these variables are set as constant in the present 3dfv simulations to the authors knowledge guidance in the literature is quite incomplete regarding the selection of accurate values for these variables for vegetation flexibility computation therefore we further analyzed the sensitivity of the vegetation flexibility to each of these variables we first adopted the value of each variable in 3dfv simulations as the reference value then assigned each variable a variation range of 25 which is 600 kg m 3 1000 kg m 3 for vegetation density 0 15 mm 0 25 mm for vegetation blade thickness and 0 75 gpa 1 25 gpa for vegetation elastic modulus respectively these ranges are reasonable for each variable based on lei and nepf 2019 and the references therein when the sensitivity of the vegetation flexibility to one variable was evaluated the remaining two variables were set at the reference values the sensitivity tests were carried out under a uniform flow with the velocity u 0 1 m s 1 and the vegetation aboveground biomass bio 1000 g m 2 the sensitivity results in fig 6 show that the vegetation flexibility has positive correlations with the blade thickness and the elastic modulus and a negative correlation with the vegetation elastic modulus more specifically in the vegetation blade thickness sensitivity tests the value of the vegetation flexibility decreases by 16 which is larger than the variation in the tissue density sensitivity tests 6 4 or in the elastic modulus sensitivity tests 5 3 these results indicate that the vegetation flexibility is more sensitive to the blade thickness than to the vegetation tissue density or vegetation elastic modulus for a given marsh type the vegetation tissue density and elastic modulus vary much smaller than the blade thickness lei and nepf 2019 therefore the blade thickness could be a more dominant parameter for the vegetation flexibility calculation it is worth noting that here we considered these three vegetation variables independently further observational and laboratory studies are needed to ascertain individual and joint sensitivity contributions occurring in real world as determined via measurement nevertheless this sensitivity test provides a reasonable reference pending future investigations for the parameter configurations of vegetation flexibility in numerical simulations 4 3 parameterization selection in applications the derivations and applications of different vegetation drag parameterizations in the introduction section have been summarized in the introduction selection of a vegetation drag parameterization for an application depends on many aspects of the parameterization such as its accuracy data requirement and availability and the computational efficiency accuracy is traditionally assessed by comparing the proximity of the model results and the calibration observational or analytical data this study focuses on the first order comparisons of different parameterizations in a series of idealized tidal flooding simulations and there are no calibration data available and no model tuning to directly determine the accuracy of each parameterization instead the relative accuracy of a parameterization is assessed by two characters of the parameterization 1 the relative magnitude of the estimated flow resistance effects and 2 the relative sensitivity to the vegetation aboveground biomass compared to the other parameterizations these characters were evaluated in sections 3 2 and 3 3 each parameterization requires different input data 2dlm requires the manning s n value which is either determined by marsh types or considered as a tunable parameter compared to 2dlm 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv require the data of the vegetation stem height stem diameter and stem density and 3dfv further requires three more vegetation variables tissue density blade thickness and elastic modulus to compute the effective vegetation height therefore 2dlm requires the least input data and 3dfv requires the most input data parameterizations also have different computational efficiency in this study each of the simulations was run in parallel using five nodes 36 cpus per node on the high performance computer grizzly tundra extreme scale xeon e5 2695v4 18c 2 1 ghz intel omni path at the los alamos national laboratory in 2dlm simulations the maximum time step was set at 2 s and each simulation took about 45 min in 2dvm simulations the maximum time step was also 2 s and each simulation took 75 min in 3dsv and 3dfvsimulations since the vegetation drag was computed at each vertical layer in an explicit model scheme 50 sigma layers in total a maximum time step was set as 0 5 s each 3dsv simulation took about 120 min while each 3dfv simulation took about 135 min performance and scaling are critical requirements for climate models such as mpas o especially when used in the doe energy exascale earth system model in mpas o each vegetation drag parameterization adds only about 0 8 compute time to the total simulation time excluding file read write time using a standard global 60 to 30 km resolution with 250 thousand horizontal gird cells and 60 vertical levels strong scaling tests at this global resolution spanning from 32 to 1024 computing cores show near perfect scaling with the vegetation drag component the comparisons of the four parameterizations in terms of the abovementioned aspects are summarized in table 6 which provide an assessment for parameterization selection for specific applications for example 2dlm might be more suitable for rapid surge forecast applications due to its simplicity in model structure and data requirement convenient tuning capability for water level prediction and high computational efficiency as a modification of 2dlm 2dvm provides a theoretical basis for choosing manning s n values making it feasible in simulating the spatial and seasonal variations of vegetation drags in shallow water 3dsv and 3dfv are the two options for the applications requiring vertical resolution of vegetation drag considering that coastal marshes are often flexible 3dfv is a better choice for flow turbulence and vertical mixing studies over vegetated coastal regions e g chapman et al 2015 these 3d approaches are clearly suited for site scale modeling studies where detailed flow characteristics are important however they are likely too detailed for large scale global applications where coastal mesh is only coarsely resolved e g much larger than km scale coastal mesh resolution 4 4 coastal geomorphological implications a different selection of vegetation drag parameterization will potentially result in different estimates of flooding associated coastal sediment transport processes which are a function of the flooding area flooding velocity and flooding depth as shown in fig 4 a b and c the flooding distances in the 2dlm and 2dvm are always larger than those in the 3dsv and 3dfv simulations the flooding distance in a 2dv model indicates the flooding area on a marshland surface this implies that the coastal hydrodynamic models treating vegetation drag as a bottom 2d drag may estimate a larger coastal flooding area than models considering vegetation drag in 3d since coastal marshes are often appear as major sediment sinks e g frey and basan 1978 a larger flooding area indicates more potential landward sediment transport and marshland sedimentation during the flooding process and this will further influence the long term marshland evolution because the sediment deposition is one of the key factors determining the vertical accretion of marshes e g zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b sediment erosion initiates when the flooding velocity exceeds the critical shear velocity the differences in flooding velocity shown in fig 4 d e and f indicate that different vegetation drag parameterizations will predict different degrees of coastal erosion especially under a higher tidal amplitude assuming the critical shear velocity for a given marshland bottom texture is 20 cm s 1 which is a typical value for fine sediment in shallow water e g van rijn 2016 shahmohammadi et al 2021 coastal erosion will occur in the 2dlm simulations under the macrotidal condition because the simulated flooding velocity is always above the critical shear velocity in contrast no coastal erosion will occur in the 3dsv simulations because the simulated flooding velocities are smaller than the critical shear velocity therefore using different vegetation drag parameterizations may lead to different coastal erosion and eventually coastal morphological evolution the salt tolerance of coastal marshes decreases landward as a consequence of the increasing inundation depth and water salinity over the marshland e g odum 1984 visser et al 1998 along with the different estimations in the flooding distances the distribution of salt water over the marshland will differ which will lead to the different salt intrusion estimations e g maccready and geyer 2010 this will further produce different long term projections of possible coastal marsh type evolution such as salt marsh landward transgression in response to salt intrusion e g craft et al 2009 fagherazzi et al 2019 as coastal marshes become more salt tolerant the tidal attenuation effects of marshland weaken section 3 1 which will eventually increase the risks of coastal inundation and coastal erosion 4 5 study limitations and future work the present work has illustrated some limitations requiring further study for example from a physics based perspective the flow resistance effects of coastal marshes consists of vegetation drag and inertia forces e g mendez and losada 2004 marsooli and wu 2014 this study only focused on the vegetation drag and neglected the vegetation induced inertia forces for model simplification although the inertia forces have been reported to be much smaller than the vegetation drag for typical flow condition e g mendez and losada 2004 this simplification should be justified in the future work in addition when this study was undertaken the mpas o model has not been incorporated a turbulence closure model for coastal simulations only deep ocean mixing via kpp was available as noted in van roekel et al 2018 therefore the influence of coastal marshes on the vertical mixing was not included in this study this limitation will be addressed in the future work when a new mpas o version is released with coastal turbulence closure options furthermore the vegetation drag coefficient c d has been related to the reynolds number r e in experimental studies e g méndez et al 1999 paul and amos 2011 hu et al 2014 möller et al 2014 its value is close to the order of one under high r e current condition e g in this study but could vary much more broadly under wave conditions e g vuik et al 2016 chen et al 2018 mancheño et al 2021 for instance vuik et al 2016 found out that the value of c d computed at the same re using different empirical equations may differ by a factor of 44 previous studies have investigated the contributions of hydrodynamic conditions to c d e g van veelen et al 2020 but a systematic sensitivity test of c d to different physical regimes particularly wave conditions and their effects on flow resistance is still lacking and worthy of further investigations 5 conclusions in this study four vegetation drag parameterizations for coastal marshes i e 2dlm 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv were implemented into mpas o a series of tidal flooding simulations along an idealized tidal transect were performed and three evaluation metrics i e flooding distance flooding velocity and flooding depth were defined to analyze the differences in coastal hydrodynamics due to these parameterizations the results demonstrated that among the four parameterizations 2dlm does not directly account for the variation of the vegetation biomass and tends to underestimate the flow resistance effects of the coastal marsh since manning s n is the only tunable parameter in 2dlm and the evaluation metrics have different sensitivity to it tuning 2dlm specifically for one output variable might not provide reasonable results for another at the same time 2dvm introduces the vegetation stem characteristics to prognostically compute the manning s n enabling it to capture the vegetation drag variations with respect to the vegetation biomass variation the flow resistance effects estimated from 2dvm are the closest to those from 2dlm especially when tidal amplitude is larger or the vegetation aboveground biomass is smaller in addition compared to the 3d parameterizations 2dvm is less sensitive to the vegetation aboveground biomass 3dsv estimates the largest flow resistance effects and it is most sensitive to the vegetation aboveground biomass due to the bending effects of the vegetation the estimates of the flow resistance effects from 3dfv simulations are always smaller than those from 3dsv simulations and are very close to the average estimations from 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv simulations the sensitivity of the vegetation flexibility to its three vegetation variables blade thickness tissue density and elastic modulus was analyzed and the results demonstrates that the blade thickness is a potential tuning parameter for the vegetation flexibility calculation the comparisons among the four parameterizations including the relative estimation magnitudes of flow resistance effects the data requirement data sensitivity model complexity and computational efficiency are summarized to help inform the parameterization selection for specific applications compared to the other three parameterizations 3dfv adds complexity to modeling efforts but it provides more degrees of freedom for model tuning and it also represents a step toward a more physics based quantitative estimation of vegetation drag e g abdolahpour et al 2018 different selections of the vegetation drag parameterization in coastal hydrodynamic simulations result in different coastal geomorphological implications because of the coastal flooding differences arising from the vegetation drag parameterizations the estimates of coastal sediment transport processes including the landward sediment transport marshland sedimentation and coastal erosion the marshland salt intrusion as well as the marsh elevation will differ these together will eventually influence the estimates of the long term evolution of coastal marshes and coastal morphology code and data availability the mpas o code with the four vegetation drag parameterizations and the simulation cases can be found at cao et al 2021a the simulation results from the four vegetation drag parameterizations are archived at cao et al 2021b cao et al 2021c cao et

implementation and validation of wetting and drying scheme in mpas o following warner et al 2013 the wetting and drying scheme implemented in mpas o applies the thin film algorithm in this algorithm a spatially uniform minimum depth h min is pre defined manually the magnitude of h min can vary from a few millimeters to several meters depending on the user defined applications warner et al 2013 at each time step the total water depth free surface plus bathymetry at the center of the mpas o grid cell is compared to h min if the total depth is smaller than h min the cell is then defined as dry and there will be no flux of water permitted out from the cell the flux can still go into the dry cell though if the total depth is larger than h min the cell is then defined as wet and the flux of water is permitted in and out from the cell freely two validation test cases in warner et al 2013 the sloping channel case and the dam break case were adopted to validate the wetting and drying scheme implementation in mpas o the sloping channel case simulated the one dimensional 1d tidal propagation along a 1 km wide and 25 km long channel with a constant bottom slope the depth of the channel is zero at the upland boundary and 10 m at the seaward boundary the computational grid resolution is 250 m a symmetric diurnal tide with amplitude as 10 m is assigned at the seaward boundary a threshold minimum wetting depth is set to 0 1 m following warner et al 2013 two simulations were performed with different bottom roughness c f one with c f 0 0025 and the other with c f 0 01 each simulation was run 0 5 days with a time step as 1 s and the water level along the slope was recorded every 5 min the dam break case simulated the water spills from a basin through an opening to flood through an initially dry floodplain the basin is 1 m wide in x direction and 2 m long in y direction and the initial water depth is 0 6 m the opening is 0 4 m wide centered on the edge of the basin in the y direction the floodplain extends 3 m in the x direction the grid resolution is 0 04 m this simulation was run 10 s with a time step as 0 0001 s and the water level at four stations were recorded every 0 01 s the bird view of the dam break and the floodplain as well as the stations can be found on the top left panel of fig a 2 the validation results are shown in fig a 1 sloping channel test and fig a 2 dam break test in the sloping channel case the simulation results of the free surface from mpas o solid red lines were compared against the analytical solutions black circles and roms results blue triangles for six instances in time 0 05 0 15 0 25 0 30 0 40 and 0 50 days the comparison results identify a good agreement between the mpas o results roms results and the analytical solution in the dam break case six h min values i e 0 1 0 5 1 0 10 0 20 0 50 0 10 4 m were tested the results fig a 2 demonstrated that the variation of h min only significantly affects the results at station 8a the results with h min as 0 1 10 4 and 20 0 10 4 m were omitted to keep the figure neat due to the high pressure gradient initiated by the model discontinuity at station 8a in the dam break case there existed some oscillations in the water levels during the first few seconds these oscillations were smoothed by increasing the horizontal viscosity ν h in the momentum equation of the model the time series of water levels from mpas o with h min 1 0 10 4 m and ν h 5 0 10 3 m 2 s 1 solid red lines match quite well with the observations black circles and the roms results blue triangles at all five stations both cases became instable if the implemented wetting and drying scheme is turned off in the model together the results of these cases indicate the successful implementation of the wetting and drying scheme in mpas o appendix i i vegetation drag evolution along the marshland to validate the use of evaluation metrics to quantify the flow resistance effects of vegetation the vegetation drag evolution along the marshland was computed for each simulation and the tide averaged results of a subset simulations are shown in fig a 3 in 2dlm and 2dvm simulations the vegetation drag was computed as a drag force exerted on the bottom using the vegetation manning s n in 3dsv and 3dfv simulations the vegetation drag was computed as the integral of the drag forces over the vertical water column occupied by vegetation i e along the vegetation stem e g maza et al 2013 the variations of the vegetation drag in 2dlm simulations due to different manning s n values are shaded in grey for the biomass variation simulations considering that the flow resistance effects increase with vegetation aboveground biomass for a given tidal condition the vegetation drag forces under minimum 100 g m 2 and maximum 2000 g m 2 vegetation aboveground biomasses are plotted as the lower and upper bounds of the drag force respectively for each parameterization the lower bounds are shown as solid lines and the upper bounds are shown as dashed lines in general vegetation drag increases with the tidal amplitude see the changes of y axis magnitude in the subplots and decreases landward over the marshland for a given tidal condition both due to the variation of the flow velocity 2dlm estimates the smallest vegetation drag grey shading especially when the tidal amplitude is smaller 2dvm shows the closest vegetation drag results to 2dlm and their overlap increases with the tidal amplitude compare the overlap between the grey shading and the area in between the black solid and dashed lines in fig a 3 with the overlap between the reference range of 2dlm and the blue lines with circles in fig 4 3dsv provides the largest vegetation drag for a given tidal condition and vegetation aboveground biomass while the vegetation drag in 3dfv is intermediate between 2dvm and 2dvm the differences in the vegetation drag between 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv become larger as the tidal amplitude increases in contrast to the results in the other two tidal conditions the upper bounds of the vegetation drag in 2dvm 3dsv and 3dfv under the micro tide dashed lines in fig a 3 a become zero at around 0 5 km instead of at the landward tip of the marshland this is because under the microtidal condition when the vegetation aboveground biomass is 2000 g m 2 the vegetation drag along the seaward side of the marshland is large enough to dissipate the incoming tides which do not propagate through the entire marshland as indicated in fig 4a when the vegetation aboveground biomass is 2000 g m 2 the flooding distances in the biomass variation simulations are smaller than the length of the marshland 2 0 km which is not found in the other simulations fig 4b and 4c therefore the vegetation drag in these simulations turns to zero earlier than the other simulations 
4102,mountainous catchments cover a broad range of elevations and their response to a warming climate is expected to vary significantly in space nevertheless studies on climate change impacts typically examine the changes in flow statistics only at the catchment outlet in this study we instead demonstrate the high variability of the hydrological response to climate change at the sub catchment scale investigating in detail the contribution of all components of the hydrological cycle in two mountainous catchments thur and kleine emme in the swiss alps the analysis was conducted with a two dimensional weather generator model that simulated gridded climate variables at an hourly and 2 km resolution until the end of the 21st century for the rcp8 5 emission scenario the climate ensemble was used as input into a distributed hydrological model to estimate the changes in hydrological processes at 100 m and hourly resolutions climate models show that precipitation intensifies during winter but weakens during summer in the order of 5 10 toward the end of the century temperature will rise by up to 4 c leading to a 50 reduction in snowmelt 10 increase in evapotranspiration and shift in precipitation type from snowfall to rainfall as a result streamflow is projected to increase by 40 in winter but decrease by 20 to 40 during summer with winter floods becoming more frequent the changes to streamflow mean and extreme low and high flows at the sub catchments show a strong dependency with elevation in contrast to the small changes projected at the outlet of the catchments streamflow shows a reduction at higher elevations up to 20 change in mean streamflow for sub catchments at elevations exceeding 1400 m and an increase at lower elevations up to 5 for kleine emme and 20 for the thur at elevations below 600 m these impacts are tied to the changes in precipitation as well as changes in snowmelt at high elevation and evapotranspiration at low elevation the results reveal the causes and diversity of hydrological response to climate change emphasizing the importance of investigating the distributed impacts of climate change in mountainous environments

which in turn can lead to serious impacts on infrastructure irrigation demand hydropower production and tourism with significant economic consequences abegg et al 2007 zubler et al 2015 savelsberg et al 2018 weingartner et al 2013 adapting to these changes and mitigating their effects requires modelling the hydrological response of mountainous catchments at scales appropriate for the involved hydrological processes and suitable to represent the highly heterogeneous mountainous topography this implies spatial resolutions in the order of kilometers and time steps of hours or less e g mastrotheodoros et al 2020 achieving this level of detail is challenging as modelling at these fine scales demands substantial computational resources and large amounts of high resolution observations to calibrate and validate models moreover a changing climate means that relations between hydro meteorological variables in the past may no longer hold in the future questioning the validity of data driven relations in predicting future behavior milly et al 2008 hence the appeal of physically based distributed models for estimating the hydrological response to a changing climate physically based also known as process based hydrological models are suited to estimate the hydrological response of catchments under changing climatic forcing fatichi et al 2016b with little to no parameter calibration they capture the dynamics of atmosphere land interactions and reproduce them in theory for any catchment or climatic input while spatially lumped hydrological models cannot reproduce the diversity of responses within the catchments distributed models can provide a meaningful cause and effect association throughout the catchment mascaro et al 2015 by forcing them with climate variables from climate models physically based hydrological models can be used to compute the impact of global warming on other hydrological variables besides streamflow such as soil moisture snowmelt and evapotranspiration et this approach has provided valuable insights into for example the role of storm structure in runoff generation paschalis et al 2014 the sensitivity of climate change response to the overall soil permeability of the catchment camici et al 2017 the relation between runoff and elevation and its meaning for future hydropower production fatichi et al 2015 and the detailed understanding of the eco hydrological response to changing climate conditions mastrotheodoros et al 2020 the effects of global warming on individual climate variables are typically inferred from general circulation models gcm and regional climate models rcm albeit at scales that make them unsuitable to study most hydrological processes in particular at the scale that controls the response of mountainous catchments fatichi et al 2013 mateo et al 2017 therefore downscaling of climate variables to suitable space time scales is required smiatek and kunstmann 2019 this can be accomplished using stochastic weather generators wg as alternatives to other dynamic or statistical methods see review papers by fowler et al 2007 maraun et al 2010 trzaska and schnarr 2014 using historical observations and gcm rcm outputs wgs combine physical relationships among climatic variables and a stochastic approach to generate synthetic time series that reproduce the statistics of the observed data and once suitably re parameterized simulate climate variables for future periods e g fatichi et al 2011 fowler et al 2007 peleg et al 2017 semenov barrow 1997 wilks wilby 1999 wheater et al 2005 most wgs simulate climate variables at either the point scale fatichi et al 2011 parket al 2018 or at multiple sites bordoy and burlando 2014 keller et al 2017 keller et al 2015 in recent years two dimensional wgs were developed such as storm singer et al 2018 singer and michaelides 2017 and awe gen 2d peleg et al 2017 capable of downscaling gridded climate variables besides downscaling the purpose of wgs is to produce climatic ensembles i e multiple realizations characterizing the climate conditions which allows probabilistic analysis of change and quantification of uncertainty the present study aims to quantify the effects of climate change on hydrological processes in mountainous catchments and to assess how the hydrological response varies in space we hypothesize that the magnitude and perhaps even the direction signal of change will be related to elevation because some of the hydrological components that contribute to streamflow e g evapotranspiration or snow accumulation and melt are elevation dependent to that end we combine a high resolution gridded wg model awe gen 2d peleg et al 2017 with a distributed hydrological model topkapi eth fatichi et al 2015 to quantify the impacts of climate change within two mountainous catchments that are exemplary of typical mesoscale catchments in the european alps we estimate the impact of climate change throughout the 21st century on a broad range of hydrological processes such as streamflow evapotranspiration soil moisture and snow water equivalent to explore a the contribution of catchment wide hydrological processes to annual and seasonal streamflow change at the outlet b the propagation of changes in extreme rainfall to floods and whether flood changes follow the climatic signal in extreme rainfall and c the signal of streamflow change in many sub catchments at different elevations identifying the main hydrological causal components and answering the question if the signal at the outlets reflects the spatial variability of changes across the catchments 2 methods 2 1 study area and data the thur and kleine emme catchments which represent typical mountainous sub alpine non glacierized catchments were chosen for this study fig s 1 the river regime of both catchments is close to natural there are no reservoirs artificial lakes or dams in either of the catchments nor major withdrawals for irrigation or hydropower production in addition the catchments are glacier free the thur catchment is located in the northeastern part of switzerland 47 4 n 9 1 e it is a tributary of the rhine with a

areas and villages the catchments are covered mostly by natural vegetation and pastures both catchments have already been studied in the context of climate change impacts in the alpine domain addor et al 2014 brunner et al 2019 brunner et al 2018 hakala et al 2019 keller et al 2019 middelkoop et al 2001 muelchi et al 2020 rössler et al 2019 topographic information for both catchments was obtained by resampling a 25 m resolution digital elevation model swisstopo 2002 to a 100 m 100 m grid distributed land use information was obtained from the 100 m resolution corine dataset clc 2014 and soil information was extracted from the soil map of switzerland bodeneignungskarte 2012 following paschalis et al 2014 the depths of the two top layers of soil for the hydrological model were set as part of the model parameterization with the top of the groundwater layer set at a 2 m depth for zones nearby rivers and lakes and at 5 m depth for the rest of the domain meteorological data used for calibration and validation of the wg and the hydrological model precipitation temperature and sunshine hours were obtained from the meteoswiss ground station network swissmetnet at hourly resolution table s 1 information on the rainfall spatial structure was derived from the meteoswiss c band weather radar system data at 2 km and 5 min germann et al 2006 hourly cloud cover data and geostrophic wind velocity at 500 hpa were obtained from the merra 2 reanalysis dataset rienecker et al 2011 gridded datasets for temperature tabsd and precipitation rhiresd at 2 km and daily resolution were obtained from the meteoswiss archive wüest et al 2010 meteoswiss 2016 streamflow observations thur at andelfingen and kleine emme at emmen were provided by the swiss federal office for the environment nine climate projections obtained from gcm rcm model chains from the euro cordex archive jacob et al 2014 kotlarski et al 2014 pre processed by meteoswiss ch2018 2018 were used to compute factors of change fc see section 2 2 on a seasonal basis for 30 year moving windows every 10 years until the end of the century they all follow the rcp8 5 emission scenario path and are available at a spatial resolution of 12 5 km 12 5 km table s 2 2 2 weather generator the awe gen 2d model two dimensional advanced weather generator peleg et al 2017 was used to generate multiple time series at high space time resolution e g 2 km and 1 h of the climate variables that are needed as inputs into the hydrological model that includes precipitation cloud cover and near surface air temperature at 2 m above ground referred to as temperature here based on ground observations of precipitation the model reproduces the storm arrival wet dry durations as an alternating renewal process peleg and morin 2014 precipitation and cloud fields are simulated jointly during wet periods areal statistics wet area ratio mean areal precipitation intensity and cloud area ratio are calibrated to replicate the storm structure observed by weather radars whereas during dry periods the cloud area ratio is calibrated using satellite observations which are also used to simulate the advection of clouds and precipitation near surface air temperature is simulated for a reference elevation using estimated radiation that depends on the cloud cover generated in the previous step this value is interpolated to the whole domain through a stochastic lapse rate calibrated by ground temperature observations the model parameters calibration and validation processes and advantages and limitations of the approach are discussed by peleg et al 2017 the awe gen 2d model was successfully applied to catchments of different sizes and for various climate regions e g nyman et al 2021 peleg et al 2020 skinner et al 2020 and its validation for the catchments used in this study is presented in section 3 1 awe gen 2d can be used to generate ensembles of present climate simulations when calibrated with observed meteorological data this enables us to represent the natural climate variability which is a fundamental component to characterize hydrological uncertainties fatichi et al 2014 especially for the extremes as presented in molnar et al 2020 and ruiz villanueva and molnar 2020 to simulate climate variables for future periods the model is re parameterized based on data from rcms and using the fc approach e g bordoy and burlando 2014 fatichi et al 2011 fc consist of the ratio or difference between climate statistics estimated from the future and present climate simulations and can be used to force the change signal in awe gen 2d simulations representative of the future this method has been previously applied in awe gen 2d by peleg et al 2019 to produce high resolution future climate ensembles in a nearby study area 2 3 hydrological model the topkapi eth model fatichi et al 2015 was applied to quantify the hydrological response of the catchments to climate change it is a fully distributed hydrological model that simulates hydrological processes in a physically explicit manner surface topography is represented as a regular square grid of hillslope and channel cells while the subsurface is discretized in three layers simulating the process of infiltration and lateral flow the top two layers represent shallow and deep soil horizons where the lateral flow is modelled by the kinematic wave approximation dependent on soil moisture content and soil hydraulic properties in hillslope cells subsurface flow and surface roughness and water depth and slope in hillslope and channel cells overland flow and channel flow the third layer represents the groundwater system and is modelled as a linear reservoir for flow between cells the model simulates the lateral surface and subsurface flow between cells while considering vertical fluxes such as infiltration exfiltration et and snow and ice melt over each grid cell the grids are connected in the surface and subsurface according to topographic gradients topkapi eth was selected because it represents a reasonable compromise between a fully physically based representation of hydrological processes and computational time for large domains 1000 km2 which allows long term several decades high resolution sub kilometer grid cells hourly time steps distributed simulation e g battista et al 2020a fatichi et al 2015 it can preserve the effects of high resolution topography which is an important element of hydrological simulation in complex terrain that relies on representation of overland and channel flow e g battista et al 2020b the model parameters calibration and validation processes as well as their advantages and limitations are discussed in detail by fatichi et al 2015 the model validation is presented in section 3 2 2 4 experimental design the numerical experiment performed in this study consisted of simulating large ensembles of climate data using awe gen 2d which were in turn used as inputs to topkapi eth to obtain simulated present and future hydrological variables fig 1 as a first step both models were calibrated independently to simulate the climate and hydrological variables for the current climate conditions awe gen 2d was calibrated and validated using climate observations obtained between 1982 and 2015 following the methodologies presented by peleg et al 2017 the simulated time series include hourly temperature at a 100 m resolution precipitation at a 2 km resolution and catchment averaged cloud cover the hydrological model was calibrated and validated with streamflow at the outlet of the catchments for the period between 2000 and 2009 using observed climate forcing following the procedures presented by pappas et al 2015 in a second step fc were computed for temperature and precipitation using the outputs of the climate models simulations corresponding to their control 1976 2005 and future periods 2010 2089 following peleg et al 2019 fc were used to re parametrize awe gen 2d to enable the simulations of continuous time series toward the end of the century two climate ensembles were simulated the ensemble for the present climate consists of 15 realizations replicates of 30 years each the ensemble for the future climate consists of 10 realizations of 80 years each simulated for each of the nine climate model signals 90 trajectories in total from this ensemble the multi model mean is computed as the average of the nine climate model trajectories and ten realizations in total the ensembles consist of 7650 years of simulations for each catchment 30 15 80 9 10 third hydrological ensembles were simulated to obtain gridded datasets at hourly and 100 m resolution of streamflow snow height snowmelt evapotranspiration et and soil moisture and point simulations of streamflow at the river network junctions for 97 and 145 sub catchments in the kleine emme and the thur respectively fig s 2 the selected sub catchments correspond to river reaches of strahler order 2 or higher strahler 1957 and can be nested in each other last the impacts of climate change on snow depth et and soil moisture as well as on the streamflow mean minimum and maximum within the catchments and at the outlet were estimated by comparing the present and future hydrological ensembles 3 validation of models 3 1 awe gen 2d the calibration of awe gen 2d requires extensive datasets thus often leaving few available observations for the validation process a common assumption and procedure in the validation of wgs is that of using the same dataset necessary for the calibration but looking at different statistics and scales entekhabi et al 1989 peleg et al 2017 for example comparing the simulated mean annual temperature to the gridded tabsd product on a cell to cell basis reveals that most grid cells in kleine emme 73 show a difference between observed and simulated temperatures smaller than 1 c fig s 3 all figures related to the wg validation are presented as supplementary information the same applies to the thur catchment except for the high mountain region in the south east where the underestimation of the temperature can reach up to 3 c figure s 3 we also directly compared ground observations with the corresponding simulated grid cell in the domain and found that the wg model captures the observed temperature satisfactorily figure s 4 97 of the simulated months for the kleine emme stations are within 1 c of the observed mean while in thur the percentage drops to 67 with the largest mean errors found in ebnat kappel ebk 2 5 c and the mountain station of säntis sae 2 c which are however still within natural climate variability at those sites examining the diurnal cycle of temperature figure s 5 we find that the timing of the simulated maximum and minimum daily temperatures agrees well with the observed data at all stations with the largest mean offsets in hourly temperature of 0 6 c in pilatus pil kleine emme and 1 9 c in ebnat kappel ebk thur the spatial distribution of precipitation fig s 6 is well captured in kleine emme while there is a slight overestimation of the average precipitation in the wg model over the catchment in comparison to observations the maximum overestimation is in the order of 4 thus well within the typical measurement errors and the c 10 expected internal climate variability for annual precipitation in this region fatichi et al 2016a in the thur catchment the model slightly underestimates precipitation in the north low elevation region and overestimates precipitation in the southern mountainous part with errors in the order of 3 and well within internal climate variability on the one hand the model successfully reproduces the seasonal dynamics in luzern napf and aadorf tänikon stations while it shows discrepancies during the spring months in ebnat kappel although observations are still within the variability range of the ensemble simulations fig s 7 on the other hand there are noticeable discrepancies for the stations pilatus and säntis where the model does not reproduce the recorded precipitation statistics well although some discrepancy is expected due to the challenge of measuring precipitation in mountaintop stations we also evaluated awe gen 2d ability to reproduce extreme precipitation at the hourly scale fig s 8 the median extreme hourly precipitation computed from the simulation ensemble indicates that the model generally underestimates the extremes but we note that i the observed line falls within the 5 95th ensemble range for both kleine emme and thur and that ii there is considerable uncertainty in the estimates of observations as well we also remark that awe gen 2d was not calibrated to simulate sub daily precipitation explicitly but only on daily precipitation amounts 3 2 topkapi eth topkapi eth was validated at the hourly and monthly scales using streamflow observations at the outlet of the catchments for the 2000 2009 period the overall agreement of the observed and simulated time series was quantified using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index at the hourly scale yielding values of 0 64 for kleine emme and 0 60 for thur fig s 9 in both catchments the model tends to slightly underestimate the hourly peak flow values fig s 10 a closer inspection of the simulations shows that the shapes of the hydrographs are reasonably similar even if in some cases the simulation reaches the peak earlier than the observation notwithstanding the reproduced peak values are within the uncertainty range of the flood series statistical model especially for return periods lower than 30 years at the monthly scale fig s 11 topkapi eth reaches nse values of 0 76 and 0 78 for the kleine emme and thur catchments respectively although it underestimates mean flows for october and november in the thur catchment up to 13 6 m3 s 1 while not perfect we assess that the model characterizes the dynamics of streamflow correctly in terms of seasonality the timing of the peaks their magnitude and hydrograph recessions furthermore the nse values are within the range obtained using other hydrological models such as hbv prevah and wasim for the thur catchment 0 86 0 81 0 70 respectively addor et al 2014 while at the same time achieving good performance at the hourly scale for sake of consistency and to remove the biases that the weather generated forcing may introduce the results presented in the following sections are based on the comparison of simulations using the climate ensembles future vs present as input rather than on a comparison with observed data i e future vs observed calibrated model this is the standard approach anytime wg forcing is used in climate change studies e g addor et al 2014 camici et al 2017 fatichi et al 2015 4 results we begin by presenting the results of the changes in climate at the catchment scale and how they affect the hydrological budget and the streamflow at the outlet of the catchments section 4 1 then the changes to the hydrological budget and streamflow at many sub catchments and their relation with elevation are presented section 4 2 all of the future climate statistics represent the multi model mean i e the combination of simulations using the nine future climate trajectories considered in this study table s 2 4 1 catchment wide impacts of climate change the changes in temperature and precipitation are presented in fig 2 temperature is projected to rise progressively throughout the century until reaching an increase in the order of 4 c in the period 2080 2089 as compared to the present climate for both catchments the increase in temperature affects all seasons with slightly higher increases in summer and is relatively homogenous in space in contrast the changes in precipitation vary in space and time precipitation decreases over the mountainous regions southern areas of the catchments and increases in the relatively low areas toward the outlets northwest in the thur and northeast in the kleine emme fig 2b 2d winters are projected to be wetter particularly in the thur catchment and summers are projected to be drier especially in the kleine emme catchment overall mean precipitation is expected to decrease by 6 in kleine emme and increase by 5 in thur by the end of the century the changes in temperature and precipitation influence changes in streamflow comparing the end of the century 2080 2089 and the present period both catchments experience an increase in winter flows at the outlets by up to 40 while summer flows at the outlets are predicted to decrease by about 20 in the kleine emme and by 40 in the thur fig 3 c d the changes in streamflow at the outlet are largely following the changes in precipitation and snowmelt fig 3c d the mean annual snow water equivalent swe in the thur decreases from 23 9 mm to 5 5 mm leading to a 48 decrease in snowmelt contribution to streamflow at the outlet on an annual average in the kleine emme the swe change is similar with a decrease in the mean from 29 9 mm to 5 1 mm and a 57 decrease in snowmelt contribution to streamflow fig s 12 the increase in streamflow at the outlet during winter djf fig 3c d is a result of both increase in total precipitation and a shift in precipitation type from snowfall to rainfall the latter allows precipitation to reach streamflow sooner than in the present climate i e during djf instead of mam as a larger portion of precipitation is not stored in the snowpack and subsequently released as snowmelt during spring mam the loss in snowmelt offsets the small increase in precipitation in both catchments at least at the outlet the streamflow is not affected by the changes in snowmelt during summer jja and autumn son likewise the effect of climate change can be noticed on other hydrological components for example the average effective saturation of the top soil layer in the thur remains nearly the same 25 5 to 25 7 fig 4 d while a small increase is detected in kleine emme from 55 to 59 fig 4a the mean annual et is projected to increase by 8 thur and 10 kleine emme by the end of the century fig 4c f the changes to et have minor effects on the streamflow at the outlet during spring and summer and no effect during autumn and winter fig 3c d in addition to the changes in mean streamflow at the outlet we also explored the changes to extreme flows and their main driving factor the areal extreme precipitation intensity over the catchment extreme hourly and daily precipitation intensities computed from annual maxima and fitted using a generalized extreme value gev distribution in both the kleine emme and the thur catchments will not change considerably under climate change for the high frequency extremes but are projected to slightly intensify for less frequent events up to 10 for t 25y fig 5 a d however these changes are not statistically significant as the change in the median of the computed values is minor compared to the stochastic variability obtained from analyzing multiple realizations table s 3 in contrast the magnitude of flood events fig 5e h shows with one exception a statistically significant decrease at the kleine emme with a 5 significance level using a mann whitney wilcoxon test table s 3 and particularly for the more frequent low return period events whereas the decrease is not statistically significant in the thur this apparent contradiction i e an intensification although of small magnitude in extreme precipitation intensities but a decrease in extreme streamflow can be explained by changes in the antecedent soil conditions fig 4 fig s 13 and is discussed in section 5 additionally a shift in the timing of the flood events is also projected while summer will still be the season with most flood events the frequency of floods is projected to decline during summertime and increase in the other seasons in the future fig 6 following the foreseen changes in precipitation fig 2 4 2 climate change impacts at the sub catchment scale at the sub catchment scale the impacts of climate change on streamflow vary considerably in space to show that we explore the relationship between the mean elevation of the sub catchments and the change rate of the annual maximum hourly flow simply termed maximum from hereafter mean annual flow mean and the 7 days with the lowest flow every year minimum computed as the difference between the future and the present streamflow divided by the present streamflow the changes in maximum fig 7 a b and mean flows fig 7c d show a clear negative correlation with sub catchment elevation higher elevation sub catchments show a decrease in mean and maximum streamflow while the lower elevation sub catchments show an increase particularly for maximum flows with increments up to 30 in the thur and 10 in the kleine emme changes to the minimum flows on the other hand have no clear relation with elevation fig 7e f we did not find any significant correlation between the flow change rate and the size of the catchments or stream order not shown six sub catchments within the kleine emme catchment as defined in fig s 14 that cover a range of elevations low mid and high and sizes small and large were selected for a further examination of the causality of the changes to the hydrological budget fig 8 we found that snowmelt is a significant contributor to streamflow in sub catchments located in high elevations during spring for the present climate and its decrease is the main cause of decreasing flows in spring months sub catchments located at lower elevation are less sensitive to changes in snowmelt the reduction in precipitation and streamflow during summer is more noticeable higher up in the river network the et contribution to changes in streamflow is relatively small in all sub catchments however this contribution increases in the lower elevations where et is higher overall the expected impacts of climate changes on the streamflow of lower sub catchments in kleine emme are almost negligible not only at the annual scale fig 7c but at the seasonal scale as well fig 9 b d for thur fig s 15 however changes are considerably larger at these lower elevations and mostly dictated by higher precipitation moreover we computed the first and second most important hydrological component in terms of the total volume contributed to the sub catchment streamflow in the kleine emme catchment in each season for the present and end of the century climates fig 9 in the present climate rainfall is the most dominant component across all seasons excluding low sub catchments in djf and high sub catchments in mam where snowmelt is the most important contributor to streamflow with the decreasing snowmelt by the end of the century however even the streamflow in these sub catchments will be dominated by liquid precipitation furthermore for many of the sub catchments where snowmelt is currently the second most important component et will replace it as a relatively larger contributor by the end of the century in summer jja and autumn son rainfall will remain the most important contributor throughout the catchment as the et increase in jja drives a decrease in overall streamflow in son we note that very little variation in streamflow is expected similar results are found for the thur catchment fig s 15 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of climate change on swiss mountainous catchments considering streamflow changes at the outlet for both catchments the mean annual streamflow is projected to decrease by around 7 8 toward the end of the century fig 3 for the thur catchment similar estimates of change were found by jasper et al 2004 köplin et al 2012 addor et al 2014 and muelchi et al 2020 these studies used different hydrological models wasim eth prevah 3 hydrological models hbv prevah and wasim and prevah respectively and climate scenarios as inputs gcmdat ch2011 ch2011 and ch2018 respectively this points to a convergence in the estimate of the average magnitude of the change likewise the above studies agree with the projected changes to streamflow at the seasonal scale i e a decrease in summer streamflow and an increase in winter streamflow by the end 21st century fig 3 similar degrees of change in mean annual and seasonal streamflow were reported in other european alpine catchments bavay et al 2013 etter et al 2017 fatichi et al 2015 meißl et al 2017 ragettli et al 2021 in this study we add a new perspective on elevation dependent changes in the sign and magnitude of streamflow at sub catchment scales fig 7 while at almost all elevations and in all seasons precipitation is found to be the key driver of the change fig 9 we show that snowmelt for sub catchments located at high elevation and et at low elevations can also become important contributors to the changes in streamflow in a warmer climate fig 8 as the changes in precipitation are a key driver their uncertainties and impacts on the streamflow in mountainous catchments need to be better understood and this should be investigated in more detail for example in our simulation of future precipitation only the intensities were modified using fc while the spatial and temporal structure of the precipitation process remained unchanged i e we assumed the wet periods the temporal intermittency and the wet area ratio to follow the same statistics as of today modelling these parameters in a future climate requires precipitation data outputs from climate models at a sub daily resolution that are not commonly available in current experiments the projection of a decrease in snow water equivalent and its temporal shift in a future climate is in agreement with other studies in the region bavay et al 2013 etter et al 2017 frei et al 2018 jenicek et al 2018 particularly at higher elevations fig 8 bavay et al 2013 forecast a loss of between one and two thirds of swe by the end of the century depending on the driving climate model which is in line with our results although the results agree on an increase of winter flows they point to increases in spring as well albeit for a domain with overall higher elevations than the study sites analysed here frei et al 2018 show that snowfall will decrease dramatically by the end of the century except during the winter months for higher elevations above 2000 m a s l likewise our results show snowfall rates at around 70 of the present climate for the same months and elevations fig s 16 jenicek et al 2018 conclude that changing swe availability will translate into a stark decrease of low flows in the lowest catchments but not at higher elevations whereas our results are more ambiguous fig 7 lastly it has to be mentioned that the presence of glaciers will certainly affect flow seasonality and especially low flow statistics in a future climate bavay et al 2013 which is obviously not reflected in the results presented here for these two glacier free catchments the rising temperature will cause evapotranspiration to increase all over the study catchments fig 4 mastrotheodoros et al 2020 noted a clear correlation between et increase and elevation simulated over the european alps which we observe for the kleine emme but not for the thur fig s 17 5 2 changes to high and low flow extremes the changes in extreme precipitation are not significant as extreme rainfall remains the same for the high frequency return periods and increases only slightly at low frequencies fig 5 top row yet hourly and daily streamflow extremes in our analysis are projected to slightly decrease fig 5 bottom row this apparent contradiction can largely be explained by drier antecedent soil wetness conditions prior to heavy rainfall events paschalis et al 2014 used the same hydrological model topkapi eth and catchment kleine emme in an event based analysis to show that drier pre event soil moisture conditions lead to lower flood peaks on average indeed in both catchments we detect a deficit in the soil wetness before high flow events when comparing the present and end of century periods fig s 13 this is caused by more intense drying of the soils by et and soil water drainage during inter storm periods in the warm season in a future climate we found that the magnitudes of the annual maximum flows are projected to decrease slightly for almost all return periods at the outlets of the thur and kleine emme catchments at the end of the century fig 5 our findings seem to contradict results from other studies in switzerland which also use the ch2018 data albeit with different hydrological models and different parameterizations that report a projected increase in annual maximum daily streamflow toward the end of the century brunner et al 2019 molnar et al 2020 ruiz villanueva and molnar 2020 nonetheless it is worth noting that all the studies agree on the high uncertainty that accompanies such predictions the discrepancy in the changes of the annual maximum flow magnitudes in these studies can be explained by the climatic input data used to run the hydrological models although the same data source was used i e climate variables processed in the ch2018 project here we further downscaled the precipitation and temperature data to obtain a higher space time resolution using the wg while the space time structure of precipitation is statistically similar to the native ch2018 data the wg is calibrated to reproduce these statistics see peleg et al 2017 it is not identical in terms of timing flood occurrence is foreseen to partly shift toward the cold season nonetheless warm season extreme flow events driven mostly by high intensity rainfall events barton et al 2020 panziera et al 2018 panziera et al 2015 are projected to continue to be the most frequent extreme events also in the future fig 6 another possible contributor to floods are rain on snow events ros which may play an important role in alpine settings beniston stoffel 2016 although topkapi eth does consider events of rainfall over snow covered grid cells it does so in a simplified way that does not fully account for interactions with the snowpack a more sophisticated approach including the distributed modelling of snowpack characteristics could provide interesting insight into the occurrence of ros triggered events 5 3 elevation dependence of the hydrological response to climate change the results of this study clearly show that the hydrological response to climate change in mountainous catchments at the sub catchment scale is strongly dependent on elevation fig 7 for example we show that annual mean streamflow is foreseen to decrease by 10 15 in the upper sub catchments of the thur kleine emme while an increase of 15 5 is projected in some of the lower elevation reaches and the estimated change at the outlet is 7 8 similarly floods at the hourly scale are projected to decrease by up to 15 20 in the upper sub catchments but increase up to 30 10 in the lowest parts of the catchment and change only 2 10 at the outlet fatichi et al 2015 also examined the changes to the streamflow response with elevation using the same hydrological model but with different climate scenarios as inputs for a much larger alpine catchment the upper rhone in switzerland they reported a much higher variability in the hydrological response than found here mostly related to a much larger variability in the projected rainfall patterns based on the two catchments explored here and the work of fatichi et al 2015 we conclude that the variability of the response with elevation is strongly related to the projected rainfall patterns and the catchment size and river network connectivity overall the results highlight the need to analyze the hydrological response to climate change not only at the outlet of mountainous catchments but also within catchments settlements in these catchments are often located along the main river channel as well as in the sub catchments at lower elevations connected to it analyzing only the response at the outlet the risk emerging from floods in future climate can be significantly underestimated or even the direction of change may be misrepresented for example in the thur river no change is projected to the maximum streamflow at the outlet of the catchment while the maximum streamflow in some of the sub catchments near the outlet is projected to increase by more than 20 fig 7 this type of information is critical for urban planners civil and environmental engineers and policymakers that aim at planning a flood resilient environment this shows how the methodological framework presented in this work leads to results that emphasize the relevance of using high resolution distributed climatic and hydrological models for revealing important details of the hydrological response in such mountainous environments 6 conclusions the impacts of climate change on mountainous catchments were studied using a high resolution weather generator and a fully distributed hydrological model to analyze the spatially explicit hydrological response within two mountainous catchments in the swiss alps changes in precipitation patterns and a strong reduction in snowfall and snowmelt drive noticeable changes in streamflow at the outlet of the catchments throughout the 21st century with decreasing summer and increasing winter flows in terms of streamflow extremes we show that despite no significant change in extreme precipitation magnitudes maximum floods at the outlets of the catchments will decline slightly and shift in time towards the cold season most importantly exploring the changes at the sub catchment scale we show that the mean and extreme streamflow at high elevation sub catchments is projected to decrease whereas for the lower sub catchments an increase in both mean and extreme streamflow is foreseen in contrast with less significant changes at the catchment outlets while rainfall was found to be the most critical component in driving the changes in streamflow we show that snow related processes dominate the changes at the sub catchments located at higher elevations while changes in et are relevant for the changes in streamflow only for lower elevation sub catchments overall this study highlights the value of using high resolution

4102,mountainous catchments cover a broad range of elevations and their response to a warming climate is expected to vary significantly in space nevertheless studies on climate change impacts typically examine the changes in flow statistics only at the catchment outlet in this study we instead demonstrate the high variability of the hydrological response to climate change at the sub catchment scale investigating in detail the contribution of all components of the hydrological cycle in two mountainous catchments thur and kleine emme in the swiss alps the analysis was conducted with a two dimensional weather generator model that simulated gridded climate variables at an hourly and 2 km resolution until the end of the 21st century for the rcp8 5 emission scenario the climate ensemble was used as input into a distributed hydrological model to estimate the changes in hydrological processes at 100 m and hourly resolutions climate models show that precipitation intensifies during winter but weakens during summer in the order of 5 10 toward the end of the century temperature will rise by up to 4 c leading to a 50 reduction in snowmelt 10 increase in evapotranspiration and shift in precipitation type from snowfall to rainfall as a result streamflow is projected to increase by 40 in winter but decrease by 20 to 40 during summer with winter floods becoming more frequent the changes to streamflow mean and extreme low and high flows at the sub catchments show a strong dependency with elevation in contrast to the small changes projected at the outlet of the catchments streamflow shows a reduction at higher elevations up to 20 change in mean streamflow for sub catchments at elevations exceeding 1400 m and an increase at lower elevations up to 5 for kleine emme and 20 for the thur at elevations below 600 m these impacts are tied to the changes in precipitation as well as changes in snowmelt at high elevation and evapotranspiration at low elevation the results reveal the causes and diversity of hydrological response to climate change emphasizing the importance of investigating the distributed impacts of climate change in mountainous environments

which in turn can lead to serious impacts on infrastructure irrigation demand hydropower production and tourism with significant economic consequences abegg et al 2007 zubler et al 2015 savelsberg et al 2018 weingartner et al 2013 adapting to these changes and mitigating their effects requires modelling the hydrological response of mountainous catchments at scales appropriate for the involved hydrological processes and suitable to represent the highly heterogeneous mountainous topography this implies spatial resolutions in the order of kilometers and time steps of hours or less e g mastrotheodoros et al 2020 achieving this level of detail is challenging as modelling at these fine scales demands substantial computational resources and large amounts of high resolution observations to calibrate and validate models moreover a changing climate means that relations between hydro meteorological variables in the past may no longer hold in the future questioning the validity of data driven relations in predicting future behavior milly et al 2008 hence the appeal of physically based distributed models for estimating the hydrological response to a changing climate physically based also known as process based hydrological models are suited to estimate the hydrological response of catchments under changing climatic forcing fatichi et al 2016b with little to no parameter calibration they capture the dynamics of atmosphere land interactions and reproduce them in theory for any catchment or climatic input while spatially lumped hydrological models cannot reproduce the diversity of responses within the catchments distributed models can provide a meaningful cause and effect association throughout the catchment mascaro et al 2015 by forcing them with climate variables from climate models physically based hydrological models can be used to compute the impact of global warming on other hydrological variables besides streamflow such as soil moisture snowmelt and evapotranspiration et this approach has provided valuable insights into for example the role of storm structure in runoff generation paschalis et al 2014 the sensitivity of climate change response to the overall soil permeability of the catchment camici et al 2017 the relation between runoff and elevation and its meaning for future hydropower production fatichi et al 2015 and the detailed understanding of the eco hydrological response to changing climate conditions mastrotheodoros et al 2020 the effects of global warming on individual climate variables are typically inferred from general circulation models gcm and regional climate models rcm albeit at scales that make them unsuitable to study most hydrological processes in particular at the scale that controls the response of mountainous catchments fatichi et al 2013 mateo et al 2017 therefore downscaling of climate variables to suitable space time scales is required smiatek and kunstmann 2019 this can be accomplished using stochastic weather generators wg as alternatives to other dynamic or statistical methods see review papers by fowler et al 2007 maraun et al 2010 trzaska and schnarr 2014 using historical observations and gcm rcm outputs wgs combine physical relationships among climatic variables and a stochastic approach to generate synthetic time series that reproduce the statistics of the observed data and once suitably re parameterized simulate climate variables for future periods e g fatichi et al 2011 fowler et al 2007 peleg et al 2017 semenov barrow 1997 wilks wilby 1999 wheater et al 2005 most wgs simulate climate variables at either the point scale fatichi et al 2011 parket al 2018 or at multiple sites bordoy and burlando 2014 keller et al 2017 keller et al 2015 in recent years two dimensional wgs were developed such as storm singer et al 2018 singer and michaelides 2017 and awe gen 2d peleg et al 2017 capable of downscaling gridded climate variables besides downscaling the purpose of wgs is to produce climatic ensembles i e multiple realizations characterizing the climate conditions which allows probabilistic analysis of change and quantification of uncertainty the present study aims to quantify the effects of climate change on hydrological processes in mountainous catchments and to assess how the hydrological response varies in space we hypothesize that the magnitude and perhaps even the direction signal of change will be related to elevation because some of the hydrological components that contribute to streamflow e g evapotranspiration or snow accumulation and melt are elevation dependent to that end we combine a high resolution gridded wg model awe gen 2d peleg et al 2017 with a distributed hydrological model topkapi eth fatichi et al 2015 to quantify the impacts of climate change within two mountainous catchments that are exemplary of typical mesoscale catchments in the european alps we estimate the impact of climate change throughout the 21st century on a broad range of hydrological processes such as streamflow evapotranspiration soil moisture and snow water equivalent to explore a the contribution of catchment wide hydrological processes to annual and seasonal streamflow change at the outlet b the propagation of changes in extreme rainfall to floods and whether flood changes follow the climatic signal in extreme rainfall and c the signal of streamflow change in many sub catchments at different elevations identifying the main hydrological causal components and answering the question if the signal at the outlets reflects the spatial variability of changes across the catchments 2 methods 2 1 study area and data the thur and kleine emme catchments which represent typical mountainous sub alpine non glacierized catchments were chosen for this study fig s 1 the river regime of both catchments is close to natural there are no reservoirs artificial lakes or dams in either of the catchments nor major withdrawals for irrigation or hydropower production in addition the catchments are glacier free the thur catchment is located in the northeastern part of switzerland 47 4 n 9 1 e it is a tributary of the rhine with a total drainage area of 1 730 km2 and an elevation range between 359 and 2434 m the average precipitation over the catchment for the present climate is 1350 mm y 1 the average annual temperature is 8 4 c with average streamflow at the outlet of 46 7 m3 s 1 851 mm yr 1 the kleine emme catchment is located in central switzerland 46 9 n 8 e it has a total drainage area of 477 km2 and an elevation range between 430 and 2330 m the precipitation average over the catchment for the present climate is 1650 mm y 1 and the average streamflow at the outlet is 12 6 m3 s 1 833 mm yr 1 except for small cropland areas and villages the catchments are covered mostly by natural vegetation and pastures both catchments have already been studied in the context of climate change impacts in the alpine domain addor et al 2014 brunner et al 2019 brunner et al 2018 hakala et al 2019 keller et al 2019 middelkoop et al 2001 muelchi et al 2020 rössler et al 2019 topographic information for both catchments was obtained by resampling a 25 m resolution digital elevation model swisstopo 2002 to a 100 m 100 m grid distributed land use information was obtained from the 100 m resolution corine dataset clc 2014 and soil information was extracted from the soil map of switzerland bodeneignungskarte 2012 following paschalis et al 2014 the depths of the two top layers of soil for the hydrological model were set as part of the model parameterization with the top of the groundwater layer set at a 2 m depth for zones nearby rivers and lakes and at 5 m depth for the rest of the domain meteorological data used for calibration and validation of the wg and the hydrological model precipitation temperature and sunshine hours were obtained from the meteoswiss ground station network swissmetnet at hourly resolution table s 1 information on the rainfall spatial structure was derived from the meteoswiss c band weather radar system data at 2 km and 5 min germann et al 2006 hourly cloud cover data and geostrophic wind velocity at 500 hpa were obtained from the merra 2 reanalysis dataset rienecker et al 2011 gridded datasets for temperature tabsd and precipitation rhiresd at 2 km and daily resolution were obtained from the meteoswiss archive wüest et al 2010 meteoswiss 2016 streamflow observations thur at andelfingen and kleine emme at emmen were provided by the swiss federal office for the environment nine climate projections obtained from gcm rcm model chains from the euro cordex archive jacob et al 2014 kotlarski et al 2014 pre processed by meteoswiss ch2018 2018 were used to compute factors of change fc see section 2 2 on a seasonal basis for 30 year moving windows every 10 years until the end of the century they all follow the rcp8 5 emission scenario path and are available at a spatial resolution of 12 5 km 12 5 km table s 2 2 2 weather generator the awe gen 2d model two dimensional advanced weather generator peleg et al 2017 was used to generate multiple time series at high space time resolution e g 2 km and 1 h of the climate variables that are needed as inputs into the hydrological model that includes precipitation cloud cover and near surface air temperature at 2 m above ground referred to as temperature here based on ground observations of precipitation the model reproduces the storm arrival wet dry durations as an alternating renewal process peleg and morin 2014 precipitation and cloud fields are simulated jointly during wet periods areal statistics wet area ratio mean areal precipitation intensity and cloud area ratio are calibrated to replicate the storm structure observed by weather radars whereas during dry periods the cloud area ratio is calibrated using satellite observations which are also used to simulate the advection of clouds and precipitation near surface air temperature is simulated for a reference elevation using estimated radiation that depends on the cloud cover generated in the previous step this value is interpolated to the whole domain through a stochastic lapse rate calibrated by ground temperature observations the model parameters calibration and validation processes and advantages and limitations of the approach are discussed by peleg et al 2017 the awe gen 2d model was successfully applied to catchments of different sizes and for various climate regions e g nyman et al 2021 peleg et al 2020 skinner et al 2020 and its validation for the catchments used in this study is presented in section 3 1 awe gen 2d can be used to generate ensembles of present climate simulations when calibrated with observed meteorological data this enables us to represent the natural climate variability which is a fundamental component to characterize hydrological uncertainties fatichi et al 2014 especially for the extremes as presented in molnar et al 2020 and ruiz villanueva and molnar 2020 to simulate climate variables for future periods the model is re parameterized based on data from rcms and using the fc approach e g bordoy and burlando 2014 fatichi et al 2011 fc consist of the ratio or difference between climate statistics estimated from the future and present climate simulations and can be used to force the change signal in awe gen 2d simulations representative of the future this method has been previously applied in awe gen 2d by peleg et al 2019 to produce high resolution future climate ensembles in a nearby study area 2 3 hydrological model the topkapi eth model fatichi et al 2015 was applied to quantify the hydrological response of the catchments to climate change it is a fully distributed hydrological model that simulates hydrological processes in a physically explicit manner surface topography is represented as a regular square grid of hillslope and channel cells while the subsurface is discretized in three layers simulating the process of infiltration and lateral flow the top two layers represent shallow and deep soil horizons where the lateral flow is modelled by the kinematic wave approximation dependent on soil moisture content and soil hydraulic properties in hillslope cells subsurface flow and surface roughness and water depth and slope in hillslope and channel cells overland flow and channel flow the third layer represents the groundwater system and is modelled as a linear reservoir for flow between cells the model simulates the lateral surface and subsurface flow between cells while considering vertical fluxes such as infiltration exfiltration et and snow and ice melt over each grid cell the grids are connected in the surface and subsurface according to topographic gradients topkapi eth was selected because it represents a reasonable compromise between a fully physically based representation of hydrological processes and computational time for large domains 1000 km2 which allows long term several decades high resolution sub kilometer grid cells hourly time steps distributed simulation e g battista et al 2020a fatichi et al 2015 it can preserve the effects of high resolution topography which is an important element of hydrological simulation in complex terrain that relies on representation of overland and channel flow e g battista et al 2020b the model parameters calibration and validation processes as well as their advantages and limitations are discussed in detail by fatichi et al 2015 the model validation is presented in section 3 2 2 4 experimental design the numerical experiment performed in this study consisted of simulating large ensembles of climate data using awe gen 2d which were in turn used as inputs to topkapi eth to obtain simulated present and future hydrological variables fig 1 as a first step both models were calibrated independently to simulate the climate and hydrological variables for the current climate conditions awe gen 2d was calibrated and validated using climate observations obtained between 1982 and 2015 following the methodologies presented by peleg et al 2017 the simulated time series include hourly temperature at a 100 m resolution precipitation at a 2 km resolution and catchment averaged cloud cover the hydrological model was calibrated and validated with streamflow at the outlet of the catchments for the period between 2000 and 2009 using observed climate forcing following the procedures presented by pappas et al 2015 in a second step fc were computed for temperature and precipitation using the outputs of the climate models simulations corresponding to their control 1976 2005 and future periods 2010 2089 following peleg et al 2019 fc were used to re parametrize awe gen 2d to enable the simulations of continuous time series toward the end of the century two climate ensembles were simulated the ensemble for the present climate consists of 15 realizations replicates of 30 years each the ensemble for the future climate consists of 10 realizations of 80 years each simulated for each of the nine climate model signals 90 trajectories in total from this ensemble the multi model mean is computed as the average of the nine climate model trajectories and ten realizations in total the ensembles consist of 7650 years of simulations for each catchment 30 15 80 9 10 third hydrological ensembles were simulated to obtain gridded datasets at hourly and 100 m resolution of streamflow snow height snowmelt evapotranspiration et and soil moisture and point simulations of streamflow at the river network junctions for 97 and 145 sub catchments in the kleine emme and the thur respectively fig s 2 the selected sub catchments correspond to river reaches of strahler order 2 or higher strahler 1957 and can be nested in each other last the impacts of climate change on snow depth et and soil moisture as well as on the streamflow mean minimum and maximum within the catchments and at the outlet were estimated by comparing the present and future hydrological ensembles 3 validation of models 3 1 awe gen 2d the calibration of awe gen 2d requires extensive datasets thus often leaving few available observations for the validation process a common assumption and procedure in the validation of wgs is that of using the same dataset necessary for the calibration but looking at different statistics and scales entekhabi et al 1989 peleg et al 2017 for example comparing the simulated mean annual temperature to the gridded tabsd product on a cell to cell basis reveals that most grid cells in kleine emme 73 show a difference between observed and simulated temperatures smaller than 1 c fig s 3 all figures related to the wg validation are presented as supplementary information the same applies to the thur catchment except for the high mountain region in the south east where the underestimation of the temperature can reach up to 3 c figure s 3 we also directly compared ground observations with the corresponding simulated grid cell in the domain and found that the wg model captures the observed temperature satisfactorily figure s 4 97 of the simulated months for the kleine emme stations are within 1 c of the observed mean while in thur the percentage drops to 67 with the largest mean errors found in ebnat kappel ebk 2 5 c and the mountain station of säntis sae 2 c which are however still within natural climate variability at those sites examining the diurnal cycle of temperature figure s 5 we find that the timing of the simulated maximum and minimum daily temperatures agrees well with the observed data at all stations with the largest mean offsets in hourly temperature of 0 6 c in pilatus pil kleine emme and 1 9 c in ebnat kappel ebk thur the spatial distribution of precipitation fig s 6 is well captured in kleine emme while there is a slight overestimation of the average precipitation in the wg model over the catchment in comparison to observations the maximum overestimation is in the order of 4 thus well within the typical measurement errors and the c 10 expected internal climate variability for annual precipitation in this region fatichi et al 2016a in the thur catchment the model slightly underestimates precipitation in the north low elevation region and overestimates precipitation in the southern mountainous part with errors in the order of 3 and well within internal climate variability on the one hand the model successfully reproduces the seasonal dynamics in luzern napf and aadorf tänikon stations while it shows discrepancies during the spring months in ebnat kappel although observations are still within the variability range of the ensemble simulations fig s 7 on the other hand there are noticeable discrepancies for the stations pilatus and säntis where the model does not reproduce the recorded precipitation statistics well although some discrepancy is expected due to the challenge of measuring precipitation in mountaintop stations we also evaluated awe gen 2d ability to reproduce extreme precipitation at the hourly scale fig s 8 the median extreme hourly precipitation computed from the simulation ensemble indicates that the model generally underestimates the extremes but we note that i the observed line falls within the 5 95th ensemble range for both kleine emme and thur and that ii there is considerable uncertainty in the estimates of observations as well we also remark that awe gen 2d was not calibrated to simulate sub daily precipitation explicitly but only on daily precipitation amounts 3 2 topkapi eth topkapi eth was validated at the hourly and monthly scales using streamflow observations at the outlet of the catchments for the 2000 2009 period the overall agreement of the observed and simulated time series was quantified using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index at the hourly scale yielding values of 0 64 for kleine emme and 0 60 for thur fig s 9 in both catchments the model tends to slightly underestimate the hourly peak flow values fig s 10 a closer inspection of the simulations shows that the shapes of the hydrographs are reasonably similar even if in some cases the simulation reaches the peak earlier than the observation notwithstanding the reproduced peak values are within the uncertainty range of the flood series statistical model especially for return periods lower than 30 years at the monthly scale fig s 11 topkapi eth reaches nse values of 0 76 and 0 78 for the kleine emme and thur catchments respectively although it underestimates mean flows for october and november in the thur catchment up to 13 6 m3 s 1 while not perfect we assess that the model characterizes the dynamics of streamflow correctly in terms of seasonality the timing of the peaks their magnitude and hydrograph recessions furthermore the nse values are within the range obtained using other hydrological models such as hbv prevah and wasim for the thur catchment 0 86 0 81 0 70 respectively addor et al 2014 while at the same time achieving good performance at the hourly scale for sake of consistency and to remove the biases that the weather generated forcing may introduce the results presented in the following sections are based on the comparison of simulations using the climate ensembles future vs present as input rather than on a comparison with observed data i e future vs observed calibrated model this is the standard approach anytime wg forcing is used in climate change studies e g addor et al 2014 camici et al 2017 fatichi et al 2015 4 results we begin by presenting the results of the changes in climate at the catchment scale and how they affect the hydrological budget and the streamflow at the outlet of the catchments section 4 1 then the changes to the hydrological budget and streamflow at many sub catchments and their relation with elevation are presented section 4 2 all of the future climate statistics represent the multi model mean i e the combination of simulations using the nine future climate trajectories considered in this study table s 2 4 1 catchment wide impacts of climate change the changes in temperature and precipitation are presented in fig 2 temperature is projected to rise progressively throughout the century until reaching an increase in the order of 4 c in the period 2080 2089 as compared to the present climate for both catchments the increase in temperature affects all seasons with slightly higher increases in summer and is relatively homogenous in space in contrast the changes in precipitation vary in space and time precipitation decreases over the mountainous regions southern areas of the catchments and increases in the relatively low areas toward the outlets northwest in the thur and northeast in the kleine emme fig 2b 2d winters are projected to be wetter particularly in the thur catchment and summers are projected to be drier especially in the kleine emme catchment overall mean precipitation is expected to decrease by 6 in kleine emme and increase by 5 in thur by the end of the century the changes in temperature and precipitation influence changes in streamflow comparing the end of the century 2080 2089 and the present period both catchments experience an increase in winter flows at the outlets by up to 40 while summer flows at the outlets are predicted to decrease by about 20 in the kleine emme and by 40 in the thur fig 3 c d the changes in streamflow at the outlet are largely following the changes in precipitation and snowmelt fig 3c d the mean annual snow water equivalent swe in the thur decreases from 23 9 mm to 5 5 mm leading to a 48 decrease in snowmelt contribution to streamflow at the outlet on an annual average in the kleine emme the swe change is similar with a decrease in the mean from 29 9 mm to 5 1 mm and a 57 decrease in snowmelt contribution to streamflow fig s 12 the increase in streamflow at the outlet during winter djf fig 3c d is a result of both increase in total precipitation and a shift in precipitation type from snowfall to rainfall the latter allows precipitation to reach streamflow sooner than in the present climate i e during djf instead of mam as a larger portion of precipitation is not stored in the snowpack and subsequently released as snowmelt during spring mam the loss in snowmelt offsets the small increase in precipitation in both catchments at least at the outlet the streamflow is not affected by the changes in snowmelt during summer jja and autumn son likewise the effect of climate change can be noticed on other hydrological components for example the average effective saturation of the top soil layer in the thur remains nearly the same 25 5 to 25 7 fig 4 d while a small increase is detected in kleine emme from 55 to 59 fig 4a the mean annual et is projected to increase by 8 thur and 10 kleine emme by the end of the century fig 4c f the changes to et have minor effects on the streamflow at the outlet during spring and summer and no effect during autumn and winter fig 3c d in addition to the changes in mean streamflow at the outlet we also explored the changes to extreme flows and their main driving factor the areal extreme precipitation intensity over the catchment extreme hourly and daily precipitation intensities computed from annual maxima and fitted using a generalized extreme value gev distribution in both the kleine emme and the thur catchments will not change considerably under climate change for the high frequency extremes but are projected to slightly intensify for less frequent events up to 10 for t 25y fig 5 a d however these changes are not statistically significant as the change in the median of the computed values is minor compared to the stochastic variability obtained from analyzing multiple realizations table s 3 in contrast the magnitude of flood events fig 5e h shows with one exception a statistically significant decrease at the kleine emme with a 5 significance level using a mann whitney wilcoxon test table s 3 and particularly for the more frequent low return period events whereas the decrease is not statistically significant in the thur this apparent contradiction i e an intensification although of small magnitude in extreme precipitation intensities but a decrease in extreme streamflow can be explained by changes in the antecedent soil conditions fig 4 fig s 13 and is discussed in section 5 additionally a shift in the timing of the flood events is also projected while summer will still be the season with most flood events the frequency of floods is projected to decline during summertime and increase in the other seasons in the future fig 6 following the foreseen changes in precipitation fig 2 4 2 climate change impacts at the sub catchment scale at the sub catchment scale the impacts of climate change on streamflow vary considerably in space to show that we explore the relationship between the mean elevation of the sub catchments and the change rate of the annual maximum hourly flow simply termed maximum from hereafter mean annual flow mean and the 7 days with the lowest flow every year minimum computed as the difference between the future and the present streamflow divided by the present streamflow the changes in maximum fig 7 a b and mean flows fig 7c d show a clear negative correlation with sub catchment elevation higher elevation sub catchments show a decrease in mean and maximum streamflow while the lower elevation sub catchments show an increase particularly for maximum flows with increments up to 30 in the thur and 10 in the kleine emme changes to the minimum flows on the other hand have no clear relation with elevation fig 7e f we did not find any significant correlation between the flow change rate and the size of the catchments or stream order not shown six sub catchments within the kleine emme catchment as defined in fig s 14 that cover a range of elevations low mid and high and sizes small and large were selected for a further examination of the causality of the changes to the hydrological budget fig 8 we found that snowmelt is a significant contributor to streamflow in sub catchments located in high elevations during spring for the present climate and its decrease is the main cause of decreasing flows in spring months sub catchments located at lower elevation are less sensitive to changes in snowmelt the reduction in precipitation and streamflow during summer is more noticeable higher up in the river network the et contribution to changes in streamflow is relatively small in all sub catchments however this contribution increases in the lower elevations where et is higher overall the expected impacts of climate changes on the streamflow of lower sub catchments in kleine emme are almost negligible not only at the annual scale fig 7c but at the seasonal scale as well fig 9 b d for thur fig s 15 however changes are considerably larger at these lower elevations and mostly dictated by higher precipitation moreover we computed the first and second most important hydrological component in terms of the total volume contributed to the sub catchment streamflow in the kleine emme catchment in each season for the present and end of the century climates fig 9 in the present climate rainfall is the most dominant component across all seasons excluding low sub catchments in djf and high sub catchments in mam where snowmelt is the most important contributor to streamflow with the decreasing snowmelt by the end of the century however even the streamflow in these sub catchments will be dominated by liquid precipitation furthermore for many of the sub catchments where snowmelt is currently the second most important component et will replace it as a relatively larger contributor by the end of the century in summer jja and autumn son rainfall will remain the most important contributor throughout the catchment as the et increase in jja drives a decrease in overall streamflow in son we note that very little variation in streamflow is expected similar results are found for the thur catchment fig s 15 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of climate change on swiss mountainous catchments considering streamflow changes at the outlet for both catchments the mean annual streamflow is projected to decrease by around 7 8 toward the end of the century fig 3 for the thur catchment similar estimates of change were found by jasper et al 2004 köplin et al 2012 addor et al 2014 and muelchi et al 2020 these studies used different hydrological models wasim eth prevah 3 hydrological models hbv prevah and wasim and prevah respectively and climate scenarios as inputs gcmdat ch2011 ch2011 and ch2018 respectively this points to a convergence in the estimate of the average magnitude of the change likewise the above studies agree with the projected changes to streamflow at the seasonal scale i e a decrease in summer streamflow and an increase in winter streamflow by the end 21st century fig 3 similar degrees of change in mean annual and seasonal streamflow were reported in other european alpine catchments bavay et al 2013 etter et al 2017 fatichi et al 2015 meißl et al 2017 ragettli et al 2021 in this study we add a new perspective on elevation dependent changes in the sign and magnitude of streamflow at sub catchment scales fig 7 while at almost all elevations and in all seasons precipitation is found to be the key driver of the change fig 9 we show that snowmelt for sub catchments located at high elevation and et at low elevations can also become important contributors to the changes in streamflow in a warmer climate fig 8 as the changes in precipitation are a key driver their uncertainties and impacts on the streamflow in mountainous catchments need to be better understood and this should be investigated in more detail for example in our simulation of future precipitation only the intensities were modified using fc while the spatial and temporal structure of the precipitation process remained unchanged i e we assumed the wet periods the temporal intermittency and the wet area ratio to follow the same statistics as of today modelling these parameters in a future climate requires precipitation data outputs from climate models at a sub daily resolution that are not commonly available in current experiments the projection of a decrease in snow water equivalent and its temporal shift in a future climate is in agreement with other studies in the region bavay et al 2013 etter et al 2017 frei et al 2018 jenicek et al 2018 particularly at higher elevations fig 8 bavay et al 2013 forecast a loss of between one and two thirds of swe by the end of the century depending on the driving climate model which is in line with our results although the results agree on an increase of winter flows they point to increases in spring as well albeit for a domain with overall higher elevations than the study sites analysed here frei et al 2018 show that snowfall will decrease dramatically by the end of the century except during the winter months for higher elevations above 2000 m a s l likewise our results show snowfall rates at around 70 of the present climate for the same months and elevations fig s 16 jenicek et al 2018 conclude that changing swe availability will translate into a stark decrease of low flows in the lowest catchments but not at higher elevations whereas our results are more ambiguous fig 7 lastly it has to be mentioned that the presence of glaciers will certainly affect flow seasonality and especially low flow statistics in a future climate bavay et al 2013 which is obviously not reflected in the results presented here for these two glacier free catchments the rising temperature will cause evapotranspiration to increase all over the study catchments fig 4 mastrotheodoros et al 2020 noted a clear correlation between et increase and elevation simulated over the european alps which we observe for the kleine emme but not for the thur fig s 17 5 2 changes to high and low flow extremes the changes in extreme precipitation are not significant as extreme rainfall remains the same for the high frequency return periods and increases only slightly at low frequencies fig 5 top row yet hourly and daily streamflow extremes in our analysis are projected to slightly decrease fig 5 bottom row this apparent contradiction can largely be explained by drier antecedent soil wetness conditions prior to heavy rainfall events paschalis et al 2014 used the same hydrological model topkapi eth and catchment kleine emme in an event based analysis to show that drier pre event soil moisture conditions lead to lower flood peaks on average indeed in both catchments we detect a deficit in the soil wetness before high flow events when comparing the present and end of century periods fig s 13 this is caused by more intense drying of the soils by et and soil water drainage during inter storm periods in the warm season in a future climate we found that the magnitudes of the annual maximum flows are projected to decrease slightly for almost all return periods at the outlets of the thur and kleine emme catchments at the end of the century fig 5 our findings seem to contradict results from other studies in switzerland which also use the ch2018 data albeit with different hydrological models and different parameterizations that report a projected increase in annual maximum daily streamflow toward the end of the century brunner et al 2019 molnar et al 2020 ruiz villanueva and molnar 2020 nonetheless it is worth noting that all the studies agree on the high uncertainty that accompanies such predictions the discrepancy in the changes of the annual maximum flow magnitudes in these studies can be explained by the climatic input data used to run the hydrological models although the same data source was used i e climate variables processed in the ch2018 project here we further downscaled the precipitation and temperature data to obtain a higher space time resolution using the wg while the space time structure of precipitation is statistically similar to the native ch2018 data the wg is calibrated to reproduce these statistics see peleg et al 2017 it is not identical in terms of timing flood occurrence is foreseen to partly shift toward the cold season nonetheless warm season extreme flow events driven mostly by high intensity rainfall events barton et al 2020 panziera et al 2018 panziera et al 2015 are projected to continue to be the most frequent extreme events also in the future fig 6 another possible contributor to floods are rain on snow events ros which may play an important role in alpine settings beniston stoffel 2016 although topkapi eth does consider events of rainfall over snow covered grid cells it does so in a simplified way that does not fully account for interactions with the snowpack a more sophisticated approach including the distributed modelling of snowpack characteristics could provide interesting insight into the occurrence of ros triggered events 5 3 elevation dependence of the hydrological response to climate change the results of this study clearly show that the hydrological response to climate change in mountainous catchments at the sub catchment scale is strongly dependent on elevation fig 7 for example we show that annual mean streamflow is foreseen to decrease by 10 15 in the upper sub catchments of the thur kleine emme while an increase of 15 5 is projected in some of the lower elevation reaches and the estimated change at the outlet is 7 8 similarly floods at the hourly scale are projected to decrease by up to 15 20 in the upper sub catchments but increase up to 30 10 in the lowest parts of the catchment and change only 2 10 at the outlet fatichi et al 2015 also examined the changes to the streamflow response with elevation using the same hydrological model but with different climate scenarios as inputs for a much larger alpine catchment the upper rhone in switzerland they reported a much higher variability in the hydrological response than found here mostly related to a much larger variability in the projected rainfall patterns based on the two catchments explored here and the work of fatichi et al 2015 we conclude that the variability of the response with elevation is strongly related to the projected rainfall patterns and the catchment size and river network connectivity overall the results highlight the need to analyze the hydrological response to climate change not only at the outlet of mountainous catchments but also within catchments settlements in these catchments are often located along the main river channel as well as in the sub catchments at lower elevations connected to it analyzing only the response at the outlet the risk emerging from floods in future climate can be significantly underestimated or even the direction of change may be misrepresented for example in the thur river no change is projected to the maximum streamflow at the outlet of the catchment while the maximum streamflow in some of the sub catchments near the outlet is projected to increase by more than 20 fig 7 this type of information is critical for urban planners civil and environmental engineers and policymakers that aim at planning a flood resilient environment this shows how the methodological framework presented in this work leads to results that emphasize the relevance of using high resolution distributed climatic and hydrological models for revealing important details of the hydrological response in such mountainous environments 6 conclusions the impacts of climate change on mountainous catchments were studied using a high resolution weather generator and a fully distributed hydrological model to analyze the spatially explicit hydrological response within two mountainous catchments in the swiss alps changes in precipitation patterns and a strong reduction in snowfall and snowmelt drive noticeable changes in streamflow at the outlet of the catchments throughout the 21st century with decreasing summer and increasing winter flows in terms of streamflow extremes we show that despite no significant change in extreme precipitation magnitudes maximum floods at the outlets of the catchments will decline slightly and shift in time towards the cold season most importantly exploring the changes at the sub catchment scale we show that the mean and extreme streamflow at high elevation sub catchments is projected to decrease whereas for the lower sub catchments an increase in both mean and extreme streamflow is foreseen in contrast with less significant changes at the catchment outlets while rainfall was found to be the most critical component in driving the changes in streamflow we show that snow related processes dominate the changes at the sub catchments located at higher elevations while changes in et are relevant for the changes in streamflow only for lower elevation sub catchments overall this study highlights the value of using high resolution

4103,accurate detection and monitoring of drought events are important particularly in arid and semi arid regions of the world gravity recovery and climate experiment grace gravity estimates have been used widely for this purpose and a number of indices have been developed using the grace terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa values in the current study a new approach is proposed to enhance the performance of the grace based water storage deficit index wsdi the proposed enhanced water storage deficit index ewsdi was developed based on the grid based standardization of the water storage deficit wsd values the decomposed time series of the twsa were computed in an attempt to evaluate the performance of the approach based on different components of the twsa time series standardized precipitation index spi and modelled soil moisture storage sms were also used to validate the functionality of this new grace derived index the applicability of the ewsdi index was tested in the semi arid climatic conditions of turkey and the results showed that the detrended ewsdi better correlated with spi 09 and annual spi with correlation coefficient values of 0 70 and 0 76 respectively the findings also suggested an approximate enhancement of 13 over the existing wsdi when applied on the detrended twsa the findings of this study reveal that the proposed approach is effective in improving the performance of the existing wsdi to detect drought events in terms of monthly and annual correlation coefficients achieved keywords enhanced water storage deficit index terrestrial water

introduction water plays a critical role in the existence and continuation of human and wildlife the amount of water stored in surface and subsurface water resources demonstrates a highly variable pattern in time and space domains in particular climate change and increasing water use have amplified the already existing unequal distribution of water on the planet khorrami and gunduz 2019a droughts are among the consequences of this phenomenon that result in severe implications associated with a net water deficit between the available water and water requirements khorrami and gunduz 2021 particularly in arid areas drought occurrence and water deficit are interconnected such that higher water deficiency can intensify the severity of a drought event and vice versa dharpure et al 2020 today it is typically accepted that the losses resulting from drought events overweight those of any other natural disasters in terms of socio economic and environmental costs hagman 1984 wilhite 2000 sinha et al 2019 dharpure et al 2020 water scarcity is expected to influence about half the population of the world by 2030 endangering the lives of almost 700 million people dharpure et al 2020 the destructive impacts of droughts are projected to be amplified with the current ascending trends of climate change and population growth gerdener et al 2020 therefore accurate drought detection and monitoring are becoming more vital especially in regions with arid and semi arid climates gravity recovery and climate experiment grace administrated by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the german aerospace centre geoforschungszentrum wu et al 2021 is one of the recent achievements in the remote sensing field the grace mission consists of two twin satellites orbiting the earth with an estimated distance of 270 km to collect the variations in the earth s gravitational field khorrami and gunduz 2021 since the gravity variations are mainly ascribed to the mass movements of water beneath the earth s surface grace signals are translated into the terrestrial total water storage anomalies twsa hu et al 2019 grace is the first remote sensing satellite mission offering the estimations of groundwater storage changes frappart and ramillien 2018 tapley et al 2019 vishwakarma 2020 as well as twsa grace based twsa is a composite value of different water cycle compartments including surface water ice and snow water soil moisture content groundwater and water contained in biomass wu et al 2021 representing all water storage of the planet thus acting as a potent alternative for hydrological information rodell and famiglietti 2001 rodell et al 2009 therefore numerous researches report the use of grace data for investigating drought events including but not limited to ramillien et al 2008 houborg et al 2012 long et al 2013 vishwakarma et al 2013 thomas et al 2014 forootan et al 2019 kvas et al 2019 and liu et al 2020 several drought indices based on grace twsa estimates have so far been introduced and developed in attempts to evaluate and improve the performance of drought assessments yirdaw et al 2008 proposed a total storage deficit index tsdi using the twsa values of grace by adopting the palmer drought severity index pdsi and soil moisture deficit index smdi thomas et al 2014 developed a water storage deficit wsd approach they defined the wsd as the deviations of grace twsa time series from climatology twsa values where negative values depict water storage deficits sinha et al 2017 developed thomas s method into water storage deficit index wsdi based on the standardization of the wsd time series yi and wen 2016 suggested a grace based hydrological drought index ghdi they used the traditional palmer hydrological drought index phdi principles for developing a new grace based drought index zhao et al 2017 introduced a grace drought severity index gdsi using the regional variability of grace twsa hosseini moghari et al 2019 developed a modified total storage deficit index mtsdi using residual time series of twsa to remove the anthropogenic impacts on twsa variations sinha et al 2019 proposed a new combined climatologic deviation index ccdi by integrating the precipitation anomalies into grace twsa being located in one of the arid belts of the world turkey has experienced some dramatic drought events especially in its recent history posing critical problems to the country taking the geographic location of turkey as well as its rapid development and the impacts of climate change into account it is projected that the country will face serious challenges regarding water availability in the future harmancioglu and altinbilek 2020 therefore monitoring and mitigation of drought are of predominant priority for the country in general drought indicators have a very important role in detecting monitoring and characterizing drought conditions therefore are helpful to determine the best way to take prompt and apt measures in order to mitigate their harsh impacts steinemann and cavalcanti 2006 each drought index developed based on grace twsa estimations has its own pros and cons regarding the used approach and consequently their ability in detecting drought events on the other hand drought detection is a formidable task which not only necessitates the development of new indices but also advances on improving the performance of the current indices moreover the decomposition of grace twsa values into individual components can improve grace based drought characterization applications andrew et al 2017 any enhancement of the spectral indices can provide better characterization and detection of the environmental phenomena which is deemed important for better monitoring and taking opt measures to manage and mitigate the harsh impacts ascribed to such events within the scope of the current study the authors introduced an enhanced water storage deficit index ewsdi for the assessment of the recent droughts over turkey the currently available grace based wsdi and the newly proposed ewsdi were investigated together to test the performance and feasibility of the proposed approach the authors also utilized the decomposed twsa time series to evaluate the performance of the known wsdi and its enhanced form in drought detection 2 methodology 2 1 data description 2 1 1 grace data grace data are processed and offered by three main processing centres the centre for space research at university of texas austin csr geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl jing et al 2019 grace solutions are offered in two forms the standard spherical harmonics sh and mass concentrations masscons the latter has undergone some post processing such as filtering and scaling offered by landerer and swenson 2012 to diminish the noises by mitigating the signal attenuation and leakage errors and consequently augment the accuracy of the estimations xu et al 2019 moreover unlike the sh solutions with a 1 degree resolution the spatial resolution of masscons is half a degree these improvements have led to more demand for masscons data in this study the monthly and the long term monthly averages climatology values of twsa estimates from the latest release of grace twsa masscons 2003 to 2016 processed by the jpl centre were received from nasa s webpage https earth gsfc nasa gov geo data grace mascons there are some missing data in the time series of grace twsa due to repeat orbit constellations jensen et al 2020 which were reconstructed by the linear interpolation li method long et al 2015 yang et al 2017 2 1 2 soil moisture and precipitation data to validate the results of the analysis soil moisture estimates from the remote sensing dataset and field observations of precipitation were used the turkish state meteorological service tsms the administrative organization of the meteorological network of turkey provided this study with the monthly precipitation data observed in 107 meteorological stations distributed almost homogenously over the country fig 1 soil moisture deficit seriously influences agriculture and water supply wang et al 2011 so its variations can be used as a drought indicator unfortunately in situ soil moisture data are not available except for some specific areas of the world robock et al 2000 moreover the observed data are limited in space and time which curtails the application of soil moisture observations in drought analysis due to the unavailability of field based observations of soil moisture over the study area the authors opted for remotely sensed data and used soil moisture values modelled under noah land surface model lsm offered by the global land data assimilation system gldas mission the observed point wise precipitation data were used to calculate the standardized precipitation index spi values the spi values were then interpolated using the kriging technique to generate spi surfaces of the study area to draw a logical analogy the soil moisture anomaly and spi layers were resampled by using the bilinear resampling technique so that they conform to the 0 5 degree resolution of grace data in fig 2 the methodological flowchart of the study is given in brief 2 2 study area turkey is located between the latitudes 36 n and 42 n and longitudes 26 e and 45 e fig 1 it is one of the countries in the middle east that face numerous challenges regarding its water resources hydro climatic variables over the country are highly dissimilar harmancioglu and altinbilek 2020 because of the diversity of the dominant climate in different regions of turkey posing a potential threat to its water accessibility according to apaydin 2011 turkey s dominant climate is of semi arid type however the vast diversity in the topography of the country alongside the deep geographic discrepancies among different regions render the climatic situation very disharmonious over the geographic regions of turkey thus the coastal regions of the country have milder climates while the central parts suffer from hot summer and cold winter conditions sensoy et al 2008 the mean annual precipitation map of turkey is 391 9 mm mgm 2020 where the highest and lowest amounts of precipitation fall in the north eastern black sea and central anatolia regions respectively aksoy 2020 the long term climatic situation of turkey regarding the map and mean annual evapotranspiration maet is shown in fig 3 for the maet map of the study area the modelled evapotranspiration values were extracted from the actual evapotranspiration estimations dataset offered by the modis mission which produced the et values based on the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model senay et al 2013 precipitation map was generated using the co kriging interpolation technique khorrami and gunduz 2019b where the surface elevation layer was incorporated into the interpolation process as an auxiliary variable to obtain a more realistic portrayal of the spatial distribution of precipitation values over turkey the current climate variability and the outlook of the country s climatic condition introduce a moderate to high climate risk to turkey turkes 2020 the country has experienced severe drought events over the last four decades between 1971 and 1974 1983 1984 1989 1990 1996 2001 2007 2008 and in 2014 kurnaz 2014 okay ahi and jin 2019 khorrami and gunduz 2021 2 3 temporal decomposition of grace signals the decomposition of grace signals is a common practice that has been done for a variety of purposes including disintegrating twsa components extracting spatio temporal patterns of grace signals and isolating the time series components humphrey et al 2016 the latter is generally used to infer the relative importance and impact of the time series components on the temporal variability of grace twsa barletta et al 2012 frappart et al 2013 temporal decomposition of time series into its compartments is a key procedure for the statistical analysis of data by which trends and seasonal patterns are revealed dokumentov and hyndman 2020 there are a number of techniques to decompose time series dokumentov and hyndman 2020 which traditionally fall into two main categories i additive and ii multiplicative decomposition models pollock 1993 eqs 1 and 2 define these two models respectively 1 y t s t t t r t 2 y t s t t t r t where y t represents original time series data and s t t t and r t denote the seasonal cycle long term trend and sub seasonal residual components of the corresponding time series respectively adenomon and ojehomon 2014 humphrey et al 2016 detailed information on time series decomposition can be found in falk 2006 kirchgässner and wolters 2007 and cryer and chen 2008 to make a decision on which model to use one can apply statistical analysis to evaluate the precision of each model in this study the authors utilized minitab software https www minitab com to compare the two available models based on three commonly used accuracy assessment parameters mean absolute deviation mad mean absolute percentage error mape and mean squared deviation msd karmaker et al 2017 these parameters are defined in eqs 3 5 respectively 3 mad i 1 n e t n 4 mape i 1 n e t x t n 100 5 msd i 1 n e t 2 n where e x and n represent the deviation of actual from the predicted time series values actual values and the number of data points respectively in general the lower the parameter the better the fit of the model cooray 2008 2 4 enhanced water storage deficit index ewsdi water storage deficit wsd expresses the water surplus or deficit in terms of deviations of monthly twsa values from monthly climatology values wang et al 2020 the standardization of wsd yields wsdi as shown in eqs 6 and 7 6 wsd ij twsa ij twsa j 7 wsdi wsd μ σ where twsa ij defines the value of twsa for the month j of the year i the climatology value of each month is given by twsa j μ and σ denote the mean and standard deviation of the wsd time series respectively as mentioned in eq 7 wsdi is computed using the mean and standard deviation of the time series of wsd in this study the authors applied a new grid based approach and used those mean and standard deviation values extracted for each raster layer of each i and j in this way the index for each month is generated based on the raster derived mean and standard deviation thus the proposed enhanced water storage index ewsdi is defined as follow 8 ewsdi ij wsd ij x ij σ ij where x ij and σ ij represent the areal average values of the mean and standard deviation of wsd in month j of the year i respectively 2 5 soil moisture storage sms global land data assimilation gldas system is a large scale remote sensing based modelling platform which generates a variety of hydro climatic variables integrating remotely sensed and field observations under advanced modelling processes ramillien et al 2008 gldas includes several models the community land model clm variable infiltration capacity vic model noah model mosaic model and catchment land surface model clsm rahaman et al 2019 soil moisture values for the study area were extracted from the noah model which simulates soil moisture content in four different soil depths 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm the layers of each corresponding depth were extracted and assimilated into one layer representing the soil moisture storage of the study area the anomalies of soil moisture over turkey were calculated based on the monthly deviations from the mean baseline 2004 2009 similar to that of grace 2 6 standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation index spi was first developed by mckee et al 1993 it is one of the well known and commonly used drought indices which was also recommended by the lincoln declaration on drought indices stagge et al 2015 spi is widely used by many hydro meteorological researchers around the world for drought detection and monitoring zarei et al 2021 hayes et al 2011 it is generally calculated by fitting a gamma distribution hosseini moghari et al 2019 to precipitation data and then transforming probability distributions into the standardized normal distribution malik et al 2021 the spi is generally computed based on different periods either shorter or longer time scales to reflect different lags of water cycle response to precipitation anomalies moreira et al 2008 in this study to better depict the drought events over turkey spi values at different time scales 01 03 06 09 12 and 24 months were calculated using the r studio program it should be noted that an improved version of spi is the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which however additionally requires accurate evapotranspiration data as reliable evapotranspiration data is not available for entire turkey this analysis was not based on spei 3 results 3 1 variations of twsa the time series of twsa values over turkey were extracted from grace masscons grids from 2003 to 2016 the areal mean of each month was then used to graph the temporal fluctuations of twsa fig 4 the time series of twsa show a meaningful p 0 05 descending trend khorrami and gunduz 2021 with a total water storage loss of 11 cm during the 14 years of this study the maximum water deficit 19 cm over turkey was experienced in september 2008 and 2014 the time series graph also reveals a seasonality for twsa over turkey with seasonal fluctuations throughout the study period the seasonality indicates that the water storage surplus and deficit happen during the months of april may and september october respectively 3 2 seasonal and trend decomposition of twsa time series to partition the twsa time series into its components additive and multiplicative models were used then the accuracy of each model was investigated based on the accuracy parameters of mape mad and msd the results of the accuracy assessment are given in table 1 the results here indicate that the multiplicative model with lower msd and mape fits better to the twsa values over the study area therefore the multiplicative model was used for the time series decomposition task the monthly values of twsa jan 2003 to dec 2016 were dismantled into the seasonal trend and residual components using the multiplicative model to detrend the twsa values the trend component of the time series was first calculated according to the trend equation given in fig 4 later the trend values were removed from the original twsa time series to generate the de trended time series the de seasoned time series of twsa was calculated based on the seasonal factors obtained from the fitted model table 2 for each month there is a special value indicating the seasonal impact on the time series the de seasoned time series of twsa illustrates the twsa without the impacts of seasonality by getting rid of trends and seasonality residuals are generated figs 5 and 6 give the time series components as well as de trended and de seasoned time series of twsa over turkey respectively the accumulative decomposed values of each component of the time series estimate the overall variance in the twsa time series shamsudduha and taylor 2020 according to the accumulated values of each individual component fig 7 a trend of 42 determines the majority of the twsa variance over the study area residual contributes to 41 of the variance and seasonality represents only 17 of the time series variance 3 3 evaluating the performance of wsdi and ewsdi to investigate the performance of grace derived drought indices wsdi and ewsdi drought indices were applied on the decomposed twsa alongside the original twsa values separately the performance of the ewsdi by analogy with wsdi in detecting droughts over turkey was evaluated based on spi and soil moisture storage sms values table 3 demonstrates the correlation coefficients achieved between each grace based index and spi and sms in monthly and annual scales the results manifest that while the higher correlation values between spi and grace derived indices were obtained for spi 9 and spi 12 both indices correlate the best with spi 9 over turkey although among the wsd indices the residual based wsdi shows the best performance according to the correlation achieved for spi 09 0 58 and annual spi 0 72 the de trended ewsdi offers the best agreement with spi 09 0 70 and annual spi 0 76 the association between monthly and annual values of ewsdi wsdi and sms however indicates that original wsdi and de trended ewsdi are more correlated with monthly sms with correlations of 0 65 and 0 64 respectively the annual correlations of sms and indices on the other hand suggest that residual wsdi and de trended ewsdi agree the best with sms over turkey with the correlation values of 0 79 and 0 87 respectively the best performances achieved for residual and detrended twsa can be ascribed to the fact that the majority of twsa variations are represented by trend and residual values fig 7 therefore the application of these components in spite of the original twsa values enhances the performance of drought indices overall the results highlight that the enhancement of wsdi proposed in this study alongside the application of the decomposed grace twsa outperforms the traditional wsdi in detecting droughts over turkey the monthly and annual time series of grace derived drought indices spi and sms are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively the figures illustrate the temporal associations between the variants of wsdi and ewsdi with spi and sms regardless of some disharmonies among grace based indices they were all able to detect the drought events of 2007 2008 and 2014 although both monthly and annual graphs show the captured dry periods over turkey the associations for annual time series are more clearly depicted and the indices are seen in more harmony fluctuating in lockstep with spi and sms 3 4 spatial illustration of ewsdi to investigate the spatial pattern of drought events based on the enhanced wsdi the most severe drought event in 2008 was mapped according to the drought index values received from de trended ewsdi as the best drought indicator for the study area the spi and sms distribution maps were also generated for the same event in order to look over the spatial consistency between the indices visually fig 10 the ewsdi map illustrates the spatial patterns of grace derived drought values where the southern mediterranean coasts have experienced the most severe drought while the black sea coasts have suffered the least from the drought in 2008 it also reveals that the aegean region in the west and the south eastern anatolia region in the east of turkey have experienced a harsh drought condition at the same time the spatial correlation maps fig 11 were then generated using the station wise correlation values achieved for spi and smsa with ewsdi fig 11 a shows that ewsdi is highly correlated over the eastern regions of the country it also reveals higher correlation values for the western and some parts of central turkey over the marmara region and a small proportion of the black sea region ewsdi shows lower correlation with spi the spatial correlation map of ewsdi and smsa fig 11 b also suggests almost the same pattern with the higher correlation values over the east and the west of the country the ewsdi in the central part of turkey on the other hand turns out to be less correlated with smsa 4 discussions 4 1 decomposition of grace twsa grace reports the variations in the total water storage of the earth in terms of the varying gravitational pull the earth s water storage amount is changed on account of the variations in the different components of the hydrological water cycle resulting from a number of the anthropogenic and natural factors therefore a combination of different elements contributes to the variations of grace twsa grace based studies need to use the dismantled twsa values so as to get rid of those contributing factors that bring about changes in the grace detected signals the trend and seasonality of twsa over turkey were decomposed using a multiplicative decomposition model the seasonality of twsa is described in terms of seasonal factors which are decomposed twsa values they are calculated for each season using the average values of the corresponding months for each season e g mar apr and may spring june jul and aug summer sep oct and nov fall and dec jan and feb winter the seasonal decomposition of the grace time series indicates that the maximum and minimum water storage variations in turkey happen in spring and fall seasons with 3 32 and 1 43 cm respectively fig 12 the seasonal cycles found for the study area correspond exactly with the findings of humphrey et al 2016 about the seasonal cycles of twsa over the temperate regions in the northern hemisphere the decomposition of the grace twsa time series was implemented using the multiplicative model on account of the statistical measurements of model accuracy the best performance achieved for de trended wsdi among the used indices also highlights the nature of the twsa variations over turkey since grace twsa values in arid and semi arid regions are largely affected by anthropogenic water consumption rather than climatic extremes singh et al 2012 voss et al 2013 joodaki et al 2014 forootan et al 2014 hosseini moghari et al 2019 it can be inferred that the ewsdi is more sensitive to long term variations of total water storage than wsdi therefore it can be concluded that de trending twsa for the study area improves the enhanced index s capability to detect droughts using more sophisticated techniques may improve the outcome of the time series decomposition and result in more accurate inputs for drought index calculation on the other hand the time span for this study is limited to 14 years by extending the study period using grace fo estimations the background information of grace twsa time series may be revealed more precisely which in turn may enhance the overall applicability of the grace twsa time series for analysing the extreme climatic conditions 4 2 validation of grace derived drought indices the spi variations indicate that there have been three major drought periods 2005 2007 2008 and 2014 in turkey during the 2003 2016 period among these three events the drought events of 2007 2008 and 2014 were found to be more severe these findings agree with the previous studies done by marım et al 2008 türkeş et al 2009 kurnaz 2014 and okay ahi and jin 2019 the results of sms do not fully comply with spi in terms of temporal fluctuations according to wet and dry months even though it shows the dry periods of 2007 2008 and 2014 clearly furthermore regardless of the uncertainties associated with gldas model outputs qi et al 2020 soil moisture derived from the noah model manifests a stronger association with grace derived indices on an annual scale the spatial illustration of the ewsdi spi and ewsdi smsa correlation maps also suggest an overall good and acceptable harmony between the ewsdi with spi and smsa over turkey however there are some discrepancies in the spatial distribution of the correlated values especially in the south eastern parts of the country which is believed to be linked to the large scale analysis of the data where results are highly prone to uncertainties resulting from the differences in the resolution of the datasets furthermore the results are totally based on the areal mean values which in turn affects the local scale results and complicates the interpretation of the results considering the current resolution and accuracy of the grace data the approach proposed in this study seems to be a viable option for assessing drought via remotely sensed data according to the validation results ewsdi yields more precise results compared to wsdi fig 13 demonstrates the average improvement of ewsdi in detecting drought based on different time scales for spi and sms over turkey the correlation coefficient achieved for de trended ewsdi and spi 9 shows a 20 percent increase in comparison with that of de trended wsdi the proposed ewsdi approach turned out to outperform the traditional wsdi by an average improvement of 13 percent which can reach as high as 19 percent and 20 percent with spi06 and spi09 this outcome suggests that the enhancement of wsdi proposed in this study works well in improving the performance of the traditional wsdi 4 3 spatiotemporal trend of drought the analogy among the spatial variability maps of the 2008 drought event over turkey overall accentuates that grace has the potentiality to reveal the spatial patterns of extreme climatic events the disharmonies seen in some areas indeed stem from the uncertainties associated with grace signals resulting from either leakage errors or data processing induced noises in general the drought trend tends to concentrate on the southern coastline of the country extending towards the southeast anatolia region as well as the western territories of the country fig 14 furthermore it is found that the grace based drought indices emulate the trend of the twsa time series where the southern coastal areas of the country and the aegean and eastern regions manifest descending trends in the variations of the total water storage over turkey while the coastal black sea and marmara regions have experienced ascending trends at the same period from 2003 to 2016 this can be ascribed to the fact that the trend component dominates the twsa time series over the study area so that using the de trended time series instead of the original twsa values enhances the precision of the index 5 conclusions and recommendations within the scope of this study grace twsa values were used to generate drought indices based on the twsa and its decomposed time series the authors introduced a new grace based drought index using a different approach for calculating wsdi the enhanced wsdi ewsdi is computed using the areal means for mean and standard deviation values of monthly wsd grids instead of those of time series which are generally used for wsdi spi and sms values were then used to check the precision of the indices and draw an analogy between wsdi and ewsdi the findings of this study demonstrate the fact that the introduced ewsdi performs better in drought detection and monitoring in comparison with the traditional wsdi it is found that using de trended ewsdi over the study area is promising regarding drought detection especially the annual dry periods the results also indicate that our proposed index is successful in improving the accuracy of the current wsdi compared to spi and sms values in different time scales one specific advantage of using ewsdi instead of wsdi is the ease of computation of the index where just a simple statistical approach is needed to be applied one of the main obstacles in grace related analysis is the coarse resolution of the data which seems to omit some detailed signals culminating in some sort of uncertainties the authors believe that with possible further improvements of grace resolution in the near future the performance of this index would be boosted significantly on the other hand the uncertainty analysis of grace with different resolutions will provide more details regarding the influence of spatial resolutions of twsa in the ability of grace driven drought indices to catch dry periods with more precision finally grace derived drought indices rely on the quality of grace data therefore more accurate results may be achieved with finer grace data under such conditions remote estimation and monitoring of environmental phenomena like droughts would be more accurate both spatially and

4103,accurate detection and monitoring of drought events are important particularly in arid and semi arid regions of the world gravity recovery and climate experiment grace gravity estimates have been used widely for this purpose and a number of indices have been developed using the grace terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa values in the current study a new approach is proposed to enhance the performance of the grace based water storage deficit index wsdi the proposed enhanced water storage deficit index ewsdi was developed based on the grid based standardization of the water storage deficit wsd values the decomposed time series of the twsa were computed in an attempt to evaluate the performance of the approach based on different components of the twsa time series standardized precipitation index spi and modelled soil moisture storage sms were also used to validate the functionality of this new grace derived index the applicability of the ewsdi index was tested in the semi arid climatic conditions of turkey and the results showed that the detrended ewsdi better correlated with spi 09 and annual spi with correlation coefficient values of 0 70 and 0 76 respectively the findings also suggested an approximate enhancement of 13 over the existing wsdi when applied on the detrended twsa the findings of this study reveal that the proposed approach is effective in improving the performance of the existing wsdi to detect drought events in terms of monthly and annual correlation coefficients achieved keywords enhanced water storage deficit index terrestrial water

introduction water plays a critical role in the existence and continuation of human and wildlife the amount of water stored in surface and subsurface water resources demonstrates a highly variable pattern in time and space domains in particular climate change and increasing water use have amplified the already existing unequal distribution of water on the planet khorrami and gunduz 2019a droughts are among the consequences of this phenomenon that result in severe implications associated with a net water deficit between the available water and water requirements khorrami and gunduz 2021 particularly in arid areas drought occurrence and water deficit are interconnected such that higher water deficiency can intensify the severity of a drought event and vice versa dharpure et al 2020 today it is typically accepted that the losses resulting from drought events overweight those of any other natural disasters in terms of socio economic and environmental costs hagman 1984 wilhite 2000 sinha et al 2019 dharpure et al 2020 water scarcity is expected to influence about half the population of the world by 2030 endangering the lives of almost 700 million people dharpure et al 2020 the destructive impacts of droughts are projected to be amplified with the current ascending trends of climate change and population growth gerdener et al 2020 therefore accurate drought detection and monitoring are becoming more vital especially in regions with arid and semi arid climates gravity recovery and climate experiment grace administrated by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the german aerospace centre geoforschungszentrum wu et al 2021 is one of the recent achievements in the remote sensing field the grace mission consists of two twin satellites orbiting the earth with an estimated distance of 270 km to collect the variations in the earth s gravitational field khorrami and gunduz 2021 since the gravity variations are mainly ascribed to the mass movements of water beneath the earth s surface grace signals are translated into the terrestrial total water storage anomalies twsa hu et al 2019 grace is the first remote sensing satellite mission offering the estimations of groundwater storage changes frappart and ramillien 2018 tapley et al 2019 vishwakarma 2020 as well as twsa grace based twsa is a composite value of different water cycle compartments including surface water ice and snow water soil moisture content groundwater and water contained in biomass wu et al 2021 representing all water storage of the planet thus acting as a potent alternative for hydrological information rodell and famiglietti 2001 rodell et al 2009 therefore numerous researches report the use of grace data for investigating drought events including but not limited to ramillien et al 2008 houborg et al 2012 long et al 2013 vishwakarma et al 2013 thomas et al 2014 forootan et al 2019 kvas et al 2019 and liu et al 2020 several drought indices based on grace twsa estimates have so far been introduced and developed in attempts to evaluate and improve the performance of drought assessments yirdaw et al 2008 proposed a total storage deficit index tsdi using the twsa values of grace by adopting the palmer drought severity index pdsi and soil moisture deficit index smdi thomas et al 2014 developed a water storage deficit wsd approach they defined the wsd as the deviations of grace twsa time series from climatology twsa values where negative values depict water storage deficits sinha et al 2017 developed thomas s method into water storage deficit index wsdi based on the standardization of the wsd time series yi and wen 2016 suggested a grace based hydrological drought index ghdi they used the traditional palmer hydrological drought index phdi principles for developing a new grace based drought index zhao et al 2017 introduced a grace drought severity index gdsi using the regional variability of grace twsa hosseini moghari et al 2019 developed a modified total storage deficit index mtsdi using residual time series of twsa to remove the anthropogenic impacts on twsa variations sinha et al 2019 proposed a new combined climatologic deviation index ccdi by integrating the precipitation anomalies into grace twsa being located in one of the arid belts of the world turkey has experienced some dramatic drought events especially in its recent history posing critical problems to the country taking the geographic location of turkey as well as its rapid development and the impacts of climate change into account it is projected that the country will face serious challenges regarding water availability in the future harmancioglu and altinbilek 2020 therefore monitoring and mitigation of drought are of predominant priority for the country in general drought indicators have a very important role in detecting monitoring and characterizing drought conditions therefore are helpful to determine the best way to take prompt and apt measures in order to mitigate their harsh impacts steinemann and cavalcanti 2006 each drought index developed based on grace twsa estimations has its own pros and cons regarding the used approach and consequently their ability in detecting drought events on the other hand drought detection is a formidable task which not only necessitates the development of new indices but also advances on improving the performance of the current indices moreover the decomposition of grace twsa values into individual components can improve grace based drought characterization applications andrew et al 2017 any enhancement of the spectral indices can provide better characterization and detection of the environmental phenomena which is deemed important for better monitoring and taking opt measures to manage and mitigate the harsh impacts ascribed to such events within the scope of the current study the authors introduced an enhanced water storage deficit index ewsdi for the assessment of the recent droughts over turkey the currently available grace based wsdi and the newly proposed ewsdi were investigated together to test the performance and feasibility of the proposed approach the authors also utilized the decomposed twsa time series to evaluate the performance of the known wsdi and its enhanced form in drought detection 2 methodology 2 1 data description 2 1 1 grace data grace data are processed and offered by three main processing centres the centre for space research at university of texas austin csr geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl jing et al 2019 grace solutions are offered in two forms the standard spherical harmonics sh and mass concentrations masscons the latter has undergone some post processing such as filtering and scaling offered by landerer and swenson 2012 to diminish the noises by mitigating the signal attenuation and leakage errors and consequently augment the accuracy of the estimations xu et al 2019 moreover unlike the sh solutions with a 1 degree resolution the spatial resolution of masscons is half a degree these improvements have led to more demand for masscons data in this study the monthly and the long term monthly averages climatology values of twsa estimates from the latest release of grace twsa masscons 2003 to 2016 processed by the jpl centre were received from nasa s webpage https earth gsfc nasa gov geo data grace mascons there are some missing data in the time series of grace twsa due to repeat orbit constellations jensen et al 2020 which were reconstructed by the linear interpolation li method long et al 2015 yang et al 2017 2 1 2 soil moisture and precipitation data to validate the results of the analysis soil moisture estimates from the remote sensing dataset and field observations of precipitation were used the turkish state meteorological service tsms the administrative organization of the meteorological network of turkey provided this study with the monthly precipitation data observed in 107 meteorological stations distributed almost homogenously over the country fig 1 soil moisture deficit seriously influences agriculture and water supply wang et al 2011 so its variations can be used as a drought indicator unfortunately in situ soil moisture data are not available except for some specific areas of the world robock et al 2000 moreover the observed data are limited in space and time which curtails the application of soil moisture observations in drought analysis due to the unavailability of field based observations of soil moisture over the study area the authors opted for remotely sensed data and used soil moisture values modelled under noah land surface model lsm offered by the global land data assimilation system gldas mission the observed point wise precipitation data were used to calculate the standardized precipitation index spi values the spi values were then interpolated using the kriging technique to generate spi surfaces of the study area to draw a logical analogy the soil moisture anomaly and spi layers were resampled by using the bilinear resampling technique so that they conform to the 0 5 degree resolution of grace data in fig 2 the methodological flowchart of the study is given in brief 2 2 study area turkey is located between the latitudes 36 n and 42 n and longitudes 26 e and 45 e fig 1 it is one of the countries in the middle east that face numerous challenges regarding its water resources hydro climatic variables over the country are highly dissimilar harmancioglu and altinbilek 2020 because of the diversity of the dominant climate in different regions of turkey posing a potential threat to its water accessibility according to apaydin 2011 turkey s dominant climate is of semi arid type however the vast diversity in the topography of the country alongside the deep geographic discrepancies among different regions render the climatic situation very disharmonious over the geographic regions of turkey thus the coastal regions of the country have milder climates while the central parts suffer from hot summer and cold winter conditions sensoy et al 2008 the mean annual precipitation map of turkey is 391 9 mm mgm 2020 where the highest and lowest amounts of precipitation fall in the north eastern black sea and central anatolia regions respectively aksoy 2020 the long term climatic situation of turkey regarding the map and mean annual evapotranspiration maet is shown in fig 3 for the maet map of the study area the modelled evapotranspiration values were extracted from the actual evapotranspiration estimations dataset offered by the modis mission which produced the et values based on the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model senay et al 2013 precipitation map was generated using the co kriging interpolation technique khorrami and gunduz 2019b where the surface elevation layer was incorporated into the interpolation process as an auxiliary variable to obtain a more realistic portrayal of the spatial distribution of precipitation values over turkey the current climate variability and the outlook of the country s climatic condition introduce a moderate to high climate risk to turkey turkes 2020 the country has experienced severe drought events over the last four decades between 1971 and 1974 1983 1984 1989 1990 1996 2001 2007 2008 and in 2014 kurnaz 2014 okay ahi and jin 2019 khorrami and gunduz 2021 2 3 temporal decomposition of grace signals the decomposition of grace signals is a common practice that has been done for a variety of purposes including disintegrating twsa components extracting spatio temporal patterns of grace signals and isolating the time series components humphrey et al 2016 the latter is generally used to infer the relative importance and impact of the time series components on the temporal variability of grace twsa barletta et al 2012 frappart et al 2013 temporal decomposition of time series into its compartments is a key procedure for the statistical analysis of data by which trends and seasonal patterns are revealed dokumentov and hyndman 2020 there are a number of techniques to decompose time series dokumentov and hyndman 2020 which traditionally fall into two main categories i additive and ii multiplicative decomposition models pollock 1993 eqs 1 and 2 define these two models respectively 1 y t s t t t r t 2 y t s t t t r t where y t represents original time series data and s t t t and r t denote the seasonal cycle long term trend and sub seasonal residual components of the corresponding time series respectively adenomon and ojehomon 2014 humphrey et al 2016 detailed information on time series decomposition can be found in falk 2006 kirchgässner and wolters 2007 and cryer and chen 2008 to make a decision on which model to use one can apply statistical analysis to evaluate the precision of each model in this study the authors utilized minitab software https www minitab com to compare the two available models based on three commonly used accuracy assessment parameters mean absolute deviation mad mean absolute percentage error mape and mean squared deviation msd karmaker et al 2017 these parameters are defined in eqs 3 5 respectively 3 mad i 1 n e t n 4 mape i 1 n e t x t n 100 5 msd i 1 n e t 2 n where e x and n represent the deviation of actual from the predicted time series values actual values and the number of data points respectively in general the lower the parameter the better the fit of the model cooray 2008 2 4 enhanced water storage deficit index ewsdi water storage deficit wsd expresses the water surplus or deficit in terms of deviations of monthly twsa values from monthly climatology values wang et al 2020 the standardization of wsd yields wsdi as shown in eqs 6 and 7 6 wsd ij twsa ij twsa j 7 wsdi wsd μ σ where twsa ij defines the value of twsa for the month j of the year i the climatology value of each month is given by twsa j μ and σ denote the mean and standard deviation of the wsd time series respectively as mentioned in eq 7 wsdi is computed using the mean and standard deviation of the time series of wsd in this study the authors applied a new grid based approach and used those mean and standard deviation values extracted for each raster layer of each i and j in this way the index for each month is generated based on the raster derived mean and standard deviation thus the proposed enhanced water storage index ewsdi is defined as follow 8 ewsdi ij wsd ij x ij σ ij where x ij and σ ij represent the areal average values of the mean and standard deviation of wsd in month j of the year i respectively 2 5 soil moisture storage sms global land data assimilation gldas system is a large scale remote sensing based modelling platform which generates a variety of hydro climatic variables integrating remotely sensed and field observations under advanced modelling processes ramillien et al 2008 gldas includes several models the community land model clm variable infiltration capacity vic model noah model mosaic model and catchment land surface model clsm rahaman et al 2019 soil moisture values for the study area were extracted from the noah model which simulates soil moisture content in four different soil depths 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm the layers of each corresponding depth were extracted and assimilated into one layer representing the soil moisture storage of the study area the anomalies of soil moisture over turkey were calculated based on the monthly deviations from the mean baseline 2004 2009 similar to that of grace 2 6 standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation index spi was first developed by mckee et al 1993 it is one of the well known and commonly used drought indices which was also recommended by the lincoln declaration on drought indices stagge et al 2015 spi is widely used by many hydro meteorological researchers around the world for drought detection and monitoring zarei et al 2021 hayes et al 2011 it is generally calculated by fitting a gamma distribution hosseini moghari et al 2019 to precipitation data and then transforming probability distributions into the standardized normal distribution malik et al 2021 the spi is generally computed based on different periods either shorter or longer time scales to reflect different lags of water cycle response to precipitation anomalies moreira et al 2008 in this study to better depict the drought events over turkey spi values at different time scales 01 03 06 09 12 and 24 months were calculated using the r studio program it should be noted that an improved version of spi is the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which however additionally requires accurate evapotranspiration data as reliable evapotranspiration data is not available for entire turkey this analysis was not based on spei 3 results 3 1 variations of twsa the time series of twsa values over turkey were extracted from grace masscons grids from 2003 to 2016 the areal mean of each month was then used to graph the temporal fluctuations of twsa fig 4 the time series of twsa show a meaningful p 0 05 descending trend khorrami and gunduz 2021 with a total water storage loss of 11 cm during the 14 years of this study the maximum water deficit 19 cm over turkey was experienced in september 2008 and 2014 the time series graph also reveals a seasonality for twsa over turkey with seasonal fluctuations throughout the study period the seasonality indicates that the water storage surplus and deficit happen during the months of april may and september october respectively 3 2 seasonal and trend decomposition of twsa time series to partition the twsa time series into its components additive and multiplicative models were used then the accuracy of each model was investigated based on the accuracy parameters of mape mad and msd the results of the accuracy assessment are given in table 1 the results here indicate that the multiplicative model with lower msd and mape fits better to the twsa values over the study area therefore the multiplicative model was used for the time series decomposition task the monthly values of twsa jan 2003 to dec 2016 were dismantled into the seasonal trend and residual components using the multiplicative model to detrend the twsa values the trend component of the time series was first calculated according to the trend equation given in fig 4 later the trend values were removed from the original twsa time series to generate the de trended time series the de seasoned time series of twsa was calculated based on the seasonal factors obtained from the fitted model table 2 for each month there is a special value indicating the seasonal impact on the time series the de seasoned time series of twsa illustrates the twsa without the impacts of seasonality by getting rid of trends and seasonality residuals are generated figs 5 and 6 give the time series components as well as de trended and de seasoned time series of twsa over turkey respectively the accumulative decomposed values of each component of the time series estimate the overall variance in the twsa time series shamsudduha and taylor 2020 according to the accumulated values of each individual component fig 7 a trend of 42 determines the majority of the twsa variance over the study area residual contributes to 41 of the variance and seasonality represents only 17 of the time series variance 3 3 evaluating the performance of wsdi and ewsdi to investigate the performance of grace derived drought indices wsdi and ewsdi drought indices were applied on the decomposed twsa alongside the original twsa values separately the performance of the ewsdi by analogy with wsdi in detecting droughts over turkey was evaluated based on spi and soil moisture storage sms values table 3 demonstrates the correlation coefficients achieved between each grace based index and spi and sms in monthly and annual scales the results manifest that while the higher correlation values between spi and grace derived indices were obtained for spi 9 and spi 12 both indices correlate the best with spi 9 over turkey although among the wsd indices the residual based wsdi shows the best performance according to the correlation achieved for spi 09 0 58 and annual spi 0 72 the de trended ewsdi offers the best agreement with spi 09 0 70 and annual spi 0 76 the association between monthly and annual values of ewsdi wsdi and sms however indicates that original wsdi and de trended ewsdi are more correlated with monthly sms with correlations of 0 65 and 0 64 respectively the annual correlations of sms and indices on the other hand suggest that residual wsdi and de trended ewsdi agree the best with sms over turkey with the correlation values of 0 79 and 0 87 respectively the best performances achieved for residual and detrended twsa can be ascribed to the fact that the majority of twsa variations are represented by trend and residual values fig 7 therefore the application of these components in spite of the original twsa values enhances the performance of drought indices overall the results highlight that the enhancement of wsdi proposed in this study alongside the application of the decomposed grace twsa outperforms the traditional wsdi in detecting droughts over turkey the monthly and annual time series of grace derived drought indices spi and sms are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively the figures illustrate the temporal associations between the variants of wsdi and ewsdi with spi and sms regardless of some disharmonies among grace based indices they were all able to detect the drought events of 2007 2008 and 2014 although both monthly and annual graphs show the captured dry periods over turkey the associations for annual time series are more clearly depicted and the indices are seen in more harmony fluctuating in lockstep with spi and sms 3 4 spatial illustration of ewsdi to investigate the spatial pattern of drought events based on the enhanced wsdi the most severe drought event in 2008 was mapped according to the drought index values received from de trended ewsdi as the best drought indicator for the study area the spi and sms distribution maps were also generated for the same event in order to look over the spatial consistency between the indices visually fig 10 the ewsdi map illustrates the spatial patterns of grace derived drought values where the southern mediterranean coasts have experienced the most severe drought while the black sea coasts have suffered the least from the drought in 2008 it also reveals that the aegean region in the west and the south eastern anatolia region in the east of turkey have experienced a harsh drought condition at the same time the spatial correlation maps fig 11 were then generated using the station wise correlation values achieved for spi and smsa with ewsdi fig 11 a shows that ewsdi is highly correlated over the eastern regions of the country it also reveals higher correlation values for the western and some parts of central turkey over the marmara region and a small proportion of the black sea region ewsdi shows lower correlation with spi the spatial correlation map of ewsdi and smsa fig 11 b also suggests almost the same pattern with the higher correlation values over the east and the west of the country the ewsdi in the central part of turkey on the other hand turns out to be less correlated with smsa 4 discussions 4 1 decomposition of grace twsa grace reports the variations in the total water storage of the earth in terms of the varying gravitational pull the earth s water storage amount is changed on account of the variations in the different components of the hydrological water cycle resulting from a number of the anthropogenic and natural factors therefore a combination of different elements contributes to the variations of grace twsa grace based studies need to use the dismantled twsa values so as to get rid of those contributing factors that bring about changes in the grace detected signals the trend and seasonality of twsa over turkey were decomposed using a multiplicative decomposition model the seasonality of twsa is described in terms of seasonal factors which are decomposed twsa values they are calculated for each season using the average values of the corresponding months for each season e g mar apr and may spring june jul and aug summer sep oct and nov fall and dec jan and feb winter the seasonal decomposition of the grace time series indicates that the maximum and minimum water storage variations in turkey happen in spring and fall seasons with 3 32 and 1 43 cm respectively fig 12 the seasonal cycles found for the study area correspond exactly with the findings of humphrey et al 2016 about the seasonal cycles of twsa over the temperate regions in the northern hemisphere the decomposition of the grace twsa time series was implemented using the multiplicative model on account of the statistical measurements of model accuracy the best performance achieved for de trended wsdi among the used indices also highlights the nature of the twsa variations over turkey since grace twsa values in arid and semi arid regions are largely affected by anthropogenic water consumption rather than climatic extremes singh et al 2012 voss et al 2013 joodaki et al 2014 forootan et al 2014 hosseini moghari et al 2019 it can be inferred that the ewsdi is more sensitive to long term variations of total water storage than wsdi therefore it can be concluded that de trending twsa for the study area improves the enhanced index s capability to detect droughts using more sophisticated techniques may improve the outcome of the time series decomposition and result in more accurate inputs for drought index calculation on the other hand the time span for this study is limited to 14 years by extending the study period using grace fo estimations the background information of grace twsa time series may be revealed more precisely which in turn may enhance the overall applicability of the grace twsa time series for analysing the extreme climatic conditions 4 2 validation of grace derived drought indices the spi variations indicate that there have been three major drought periods 2005 2007 2008 and 2014 in turkey during the 2003 2016 period among these three events the drought events of 2007 2008 and 2014 were found to be more severe these findings agree with the previous studies done by marım et al 2008 türkeş et al 2009 kurnaz 2014 and okay ahi and jin 2019 the results of sms do not fully comply with spi in terms of temporal fluctuations according to wet and dry months even though it shows the dry periods of 2007 2008 and 2014 clearly furthermore regardless of the uncertainties associated with gldas model outputs qi et al 2020 soil moisture derived from the noah model manifests a stronger association with grace derived indices on an annual scale the spatial illustration of the ewsdi spi and ewsdi smsa correlation maps also suggest an overall good and acceptable harmony between the ewsdi with spi and smsa over turkey however there are some discrepancies in the spatial distribution of the correlated values especially in the south eastern parts of the country which is believed to be linked to the large scale analysis of the data where results are highly prone to uncertainties resulting from the differences in the resolution of the datasets furthermore the results are totally based on the areal mean values which in turn affects the local scale results and complicates the interpretation of the results considering the current resolution and accuracy of the grace data the approach proposed in this study seems to be a viable option for assessing drought via remotely sensed data according to the validation results ewsdi yields more precise results compared to wsdi fig 13 demonstrates the average improvement of ewsdi in detecting drought based on different time scales for spi and sms over turkey the correlation coefficient achieved for de trended ewsdi and spi 9 shows a 20 percent increase in comparison with that of de trended wsdi the proposed ewsdi approach turned out to outperform the traditional wsdi by an average improvement of 13 percent which can reach as high as 19 percent and 20 percent with spi06 and spi09 this outcome suggests that the enhancement of wsdi proposed in this study works well in improving the performance of the traditional wsdi 4 3 spatiotemporal trend of drought the analogy among the spatial variability maps of the 2008 drought event over turkey overall accentuates that grace has the potentiality to reveal the spatial patterns of extreme climatic events the disharmonies seen in some areas indeed stem from the uncertainties associated with grace signals resulting from either leakage errors or data processing induced noises in general the drought trend tends to concentrate on the southern coastline of the country extending towards the southeast anatolia region as well as the western territories of the country fig 14 furthermore it is found that the grace based drought indices emulate the trend of the twsa time series where the southern coastal areas of the country and the aegean and eastern regions manifest descending trends in the variations of the total water storage over turkey while the coastal black sea and marmara regions have experienced ascending trends at the same period from 2003 to 2016 this can be ascribed to the fact that the trend component dominates the twsa time series over the study area so that using the de trended time series instead of the original twsa values enhances the precision of the index 5 conclusions and recommendations within the scope of this study grace twsa values were used to generate drought indices based on the twsa and its decomposed time series the authors introduced a new grace based drought index using a different approach for calculating wsdi the enhanced wsdi ewsdi is computed using the areal means for mean and standard deviation values of monthly wsd grids instead of those of time series which are generally used for wsdi spi and sms values were then used to check the precision of the indices and draw an analogy between wsdi and ewsdi the findings of this study demonstrate the fact that the introduced ewsdi performs better in drought detection and monitoring in comparison with the traditional wsdi it is found that using de trended ewsdi over the study area is promising regarding drought detection especially the annual dry periods the results also indicate that our proposed index is successful in improving the accuracy of the current wsdi compared to spi and sms values in different time scales one specific advantage of using ewsdi instead of wsdi is the ease of computation of the index where just a simple statistical approach is needed to be applied one of the main obstacles in grace related analysis is the coarse resolution of the data which seems to omit some detailed signals culminating in some sort of uncertainties the authors believe that with possible further improvements of grace resolution in the near future the performance of this index would be boosted significantly on the other hand the uncertainty analysis of grace with different resolutions will provide more details regarding the influence of spatial resolutions of twsa in the ability of grace driven drought indices to catch dry periods with more precision finally grace derived drought indices rely on the quality of grace data therefore more accurate results may be achieved with finer grace data under such conditions remote estimation and monitoring of environmental phenomena like droughts would be more accurate both spatially and temporarily 6 data availability statement the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author author initials upon reasonable request funding this research did

4104,the drought events during the summer monsoon season june september have a considerable impact on the water availability and major staple crop production in india in this study the temporal and spatial variability of drought events has been examined utilizing the standardized precipitation index spi moreover the future drought events pattern has been investigated based on four shared socio economic pathways based scenarios i e ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 after evaluating the suitable cmip6 gcm simulations using spatial and temporal statistical metrics the observation in the recent decade 1951 2014 showed that the drought events in the summer monsoon season are more pronounced and has a significant negative impact on agricultural production moreover the most severe droughts have a tendency to occur during the years with el niño events having a significant negative correlation r 0 6 p value 0 05 between the equatorial eastern pacific ocean epo sea surface temperature and spi indices the result of the statistics revealed that out of 10 gcms and their ensemble mean the ec earth3 ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 model well simulate the indian summer monsoon precipitation variability both for spatial and temporal scale in the historical period 1901 2014 future projection 2071 2100 of the all india droughts from the selected models indicates the more frequent droughts in the ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 in comparison to ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 besides the el niño contribution to the drought years is likely to rise in the future period due to the decreasing sea level pressure slp over the equatorial epo and increasing slp over the western pacific ocean under the high emission scenario thereby giving rise to the considerable challenges in the future food production in india keywords indian summer monsoon droughts spi enso agricultural production dry period 1 introduction india being the seventh largest country in the world is situated in the north of the equator from 8 n to 37 n latitude and 68 e to 97 e longitude covering an area of 3 million km2 the wide variety of physiographical features result in diverse climatic conditions in india even though the substantial volume of himalayan water flows into this country the precipitation plays a vital role in indian agriculture contributing a significant proportion 13 7 of the total gross domestic product gdp in the country census of india 2011 the location of india provides a distinguished character to its topography and climate that results in disparities in the precipitation

monsoon season during june september jain et al 2019 however a strong variability of the indian summer monsoon precipitation ismp has been stated in the previous studies naidu et al 2009 kumar et al 2010 saha and ghosh 2019 preethi et al 2019 where the deficiency of the ismp is related to drought events that have a significant impact on the economy due to the lower production of the food grains kumar et al 2013a gill et al 2015 preethi et al 2017 despite the increasing rate of food crop production due to the technological advancement and large scale application of a high yielding variety of seeds during the green revolution in the mid 20th century the summer monsoon drought events significantly impact the yield of many staple crops in india mishra et al 2020 owing to the strong relationship between precipitation and agricultural production it is important to better comprehend the future changes of ismp variability under the warming climate with expanding population pressure and food demands in india the el niño southern oscillation enso is found to be strongly associated with the variability of ismp in past studies mooley et al 1983 roy and tedeschi 2016 li et al 2018 huang et al 2020 mishra et al 2020 and references therein interestingly few studies also reported the significant effects of indian ocean dipole iod ashok et al 2004 bala and singh 2007 pacific decadal oscillation pdo and north atlantic oscillation nao krishnan and sugi 2003 dutta and maity 2018 chen et al 2020 on the variability of ismp many studies reported that the enso relationship with ismp was significant till 1980 and reduced greatly thereafter li et al 2018 mishra et al 2020 while the influence of iod on ismp has been increased in the recent decades ashok and saji 2007 besides the warming phase of equatorial sst has been attributed to a possible cause of ismp deficit by modulating monsoon circulation over the equatorial pacific and indian ocean roxy et al 2015 even though the significant warming trend of sst has been observed in recent decades little efforts have been put forward in order to understand the possible contribution of enso on the variability of indian drought events in the future periods therefore it is indispensable to perceive the effects of changing sst on the variability and intensity of indian summer monsoon droughts particularly in the future warming scenario the coupled model inter comparison project cmip provides different global circulation models gcms which explain the future climatic situations eyring et al 2016 numerous researches have been performed for making future predictions of ismp using the cmip3 models and its updated version of cmip5 kripalani et al 2007 sperber et al 2013 shashikanth et al 2014 su et al 2013 song and zhou 2014 despite the fact that the gcms in cmip5 include new components most of them are failing to capture the local influences such as topography land use change in simulating the climatic conditions kamworapan and surussavadee 2019 jain et al 2019 hence numerous statistical and dynamical downscaling approaches have been suggested by the researchers in the last decades in order to remove the biases presented in the gcms and apply the simulations at the local scale salvi et al 2013 yhang et al 2017 but in most of the cases these approaches yielded insignificant results and in a few cases the results deteriorated to great extent sharma et al 2018 jain et al 2019 many studies have also pointed out the downside of cmip5 models i e over underprediction of the monsoon precipitation and intra seasonal variability over the south asian countries including india which minimize the reliability of future projection shashikanth et al 2014 kitoh et al 2013 saha et al 2014 ramesh and goswami 2014 sharmila et al 2015 jain et al 2019 the cmip5 models concerning ismp and enso events were criticized for their erratic performance as the projected simulations performed by the models on the sst and circulation pattern of the indo pacific region were proved to be inconsistent and impractical gong et al 2018 fang et al 2019 some researchers shrestha et al 2012 eekhout and de vente 2018 de oliveira etal 2019 prefer to use the regional climate models rcms for future projection due to its high resolution grid scale however mehr et al 2019 and yuan et al 2016 in their work found that rcms are not very suitable when drought is assessed especially for future prediction the rcms tend to produce large amounts of uncertainties when used for temporal variation in case of indian climate both akhtar et al 2009 and kumar et al 2013b concluded that application of rcms resulted in high inconsistency in their final outcome especially over extreme events by performing major over under prediction dimri et al 2013 also found large discrepancy when used rcms for projecting future indian precipitation this may occur due to the internal variability of the rcms and their tendency of overlooking anthropogenic inputs that result in such uncertainties in future projections and even error correction methods often fail remove these uncertainties sufficiently themeßl et al 2011 gómez navarro et al 2015 to overcome these issues recently updated version of gcms is released under the sixth phase of cmip with the improved emissions model parameterization physical processes a land use under different shared socio economic pathways based scenarios eyring et al 2016 additionally this also provides the historical runs that started in 1850 which can furnish the comprehensive picture of the long term precipitation change cmip6 with its gcms that are more climate sensitive than those of cmip5 and with a better framework that take different socio economic and climatic processes into account has become quite popular among the scientific community therefore it has been applied successfully by several scholars both regionally and globally to analyze the future climatic conditions and their resulting consequence boer et al 2016 chen et al 2020 grose et al 2020 lyu et al 2020 few environmental impact studies have also been conducted in india and its adjacent areas using cmip6 almazroui et al 2020 krishnan bhaskaran 2020 shrestha et al 2020 and found a reliable outcomes with having the shortcomings of cmip3 cmip5 and rcm models there is a strong need to understand the future contribution of enso on the drought events using the newly developed cmip6 gcms over india being an agrarian country india s economy is greatly dependent on its agricultural production which is highly controlled by climatic conditions therefore erratic and inconsistent future projections of climatic conditions may seriously affect the future planning and management of crop production food availability and economic structure of the country the better and highly consistent results of cmip6 can help to overcome such issues however not much work has been done that proficiently applies the cmip6 model in projecting future ismp patterns highlighting the occurrences of drought events along with analyzing its major drivers and its impact upon the crop production in this country therefore the objectives of the study are to 1 demonstrate the impacts of indian summer monsoon droughts on major staple crop production in india 2 show the temporal and spatial variability of the summer monsoon drought events and their potential drivers i e enso phenomenon and low level circulation using observations 3 identify the most suitable gcms for the region from cmip6 models through a systematic comparison of their performances with the observed precipitation pattern and 4 investigate the future occurrence of the droughts in relation to enso events under different shared socio economic pathways ssp based scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources 2 1 1 observed datasets observed gridded 0 25 0 25 precipitation data for the span of 1901 2014 provided by the indian meteorological department imd was collected for this work the observed data set was prepared using the daily precipitation value from the 6955 rain gauge stations over the whole country pai et al 2015 some additional materials such as the monthly mean gridded 1 1 sea surface temperature data hadisst 1 1 rayner et al 2003 was collected from the website of met office hadley centre observations http www metoffice gov uk hadobs the ncep ncar reanalysis monthly mean wind data 2 5 2 5 was collected from https psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep reanalysis pressure html in addition to this the observed agricultural production yield kg ha 1 data for rice and food grain have been collected from the website of directorate economics and statistics india https eands dacnet nic in latest 20011 htm accessed on 10th july 2020 2 1 2 global climate model simulation for future projection precipitation outputs of 10 cmip6 gcms eyring et al 2016 have been used considering the similar historical runs and variant r1i1p1 available at the earth system grid federation esgf website https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 table 1 these models were selected because of their availability and aided as a vibrant standard for evaluating model performance against the observation rivera and arnould 2020 the cmip6 model simulations for the 1901 2014 period was considered for showing the historical drought events however in order to compare the drought events a 30 years time span for historical 1971 2000 and far future period 2071 2100 were considered under four shared socioeconomic pathways based scenarios ssps i e ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 2 2 methods 2 2 1 estimation of spi among the different drought indices standardized precipitation index spi is very common which is derived by fitting a gamma distribution function to the precipitation data and most widely used indices both locally and globally wang et al 2011 pai et al 2017 preethi et al 2019 however some researchers argued that fitting a two parameter gamma distribution function may not be a good choice because the spi values are reasonably sensitive in the tail of the distribution kumar et al 2009 quiring 2009 therefore the non parametric method has been used for estimating the drought indices spi over the indian sub continent for the summer monsoon gringorten plotting position following gringorten 1963 was used for the calculation of the marginal probability of precipitation for the region under consideration and expressed in eq 1 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 1 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 where i is the rank of non zero precipitation p xi is the associated empirical probability and n denotes the size of the samples the eq 1 can be converted into a standardized index si as 2 si 1 p where ϕ and p denote the standard normal distribution function and the probability derived from eq 1 respectively the standardize of the percentile can be done using the commonly used approximation of eq 2 kumar et al 2009 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 3 si t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 i f 0 p 0 5 t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 i f 0 5 p 1 where c 0 2

when the spi value reaches an intensity of 1 mckee et al 1993 therefore in this study the spi value 1 is considered as drought years 2 2 2 precipitation anomaly with agricultural production the relationship between the precipitation anomaly and the agricultural productions i e rice and food grains during the summer monsoon season in india was established by comparing the year to year change first difference of the precipitation and agricultural production time series following wang et al 2015 and feng et al 2018 this was done with the aim of reducing the effects of different agricultural management practices such as the application of a high yielding variety of seeds high grade fertilizers improved irrigation facility 2 2 3 estimation of sst anomaly the sst anomaly of niño 3 4 region 5 n 5 s 170 w 120 w was calculated to appraise the association between all india summer monsoon drought events and el niño southern oscillation enso index as advocated by krishnamurthy and kirtman 2009 a close relationship can be observed between the sst existing over the pacific ocean and indian summer monsoon precipitation during the period of monsoon in the country which is why the sst data for the span of monsoon has been used in this analysis the previous studies reported the strong linear trend of the sst during the summer monsoon season in the future period choudhury et al 2019 mishra et al 2020 hence the linear detrending method using the least square regression has been performed before estimating the sst anomaly in the niño3 4 regions for the future period 2 2 4 selection of the suitable gcms for future simulation selecting the most suitable gcms for simulating the future scenarios of the indian summer monsoon precipitation is a vital part of this analysis firstly the bilinear interpolation method has been applied in order to match the selected gcms grid to the observed grid size i e 0 25 0 25 then the quantile mapping bias correction method was incorporated to remove the biases presented in the gcms followed by the evaluation of those gcms performed through the correlation r root mean square error rmse and standard deviation sd using the taylor diagram for more details see taylor 2001 furthermore the spatial closeness between the observed and gcms simulated precipitation was evaluated using spatial efficiency metric spaef the performance of the spaef metric is well admired because of its ability to perform analysis of robust nature demirel et al 2018 this method combines three statistical measures namely pearson correlation coefficient coefficient of variation and histogram overlap into one metric as spaef compares between two spatial pattern maps the monthly average summer monsoon precipitation 1901 2014 has been taken for this analysis the spaef values between the observed and gcms simulated precipitation maps were calculated using eq 5 where α is the pearson correlation coefficient β is the coefficient of variation and γ is the percentage of histogram overlap between the observed and gcm simulated precipitation maps the spaef value varies from to 1 where a value closer to 1 demonstrates higher spatial closeness for α x is the observed and y is the simulated precipitation and n is the total number of values eq 6 eq 7 and eq 8 were used to calculate the β and γ respectively where σg and σo are the standard deviation and μg and μo are the mean of simulated and observed precipitation in eq 8 k and l denotes the histogram values of the observed and simulated precipitation and n represented the number of bins herein 100 bins in a histogram ahmed et al 2019 the histogram intersection percentage between the observed and gcm simulated precipitation spatial maps were performed after normalization to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 z score in order to overcome the bias or variance differences between the maps 5 spaef 1 α 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 6 α n x y x y n x 2 x 2 n y 2 y 2 7 β σ g μ g σ o μ o 8 γ j 1 n m i n

food grains yield has remarkably escalated at a rate of 26 5 and 24 8 kg ha 1 annually from 1951 to 2014 fig 1 a however the inter annual precipitation anomaly has a substantial influence on the yield of staple crops i e rice and food grains in india during this season fig 1b d strong statistically significant p value 0 05 correlation can be observed between the precipitation anomaly and the total rice r 0 70 and the food grain r 0 71 yields in india fig 1e the year with decreasing summer monsoon precipitation has been correlated with the reduction in yields the top nine years 1957 125 mm 1965 228 mm 1974 127 mm 1976 108 mm 1979 232 mm 2002 113 mm 2004 125 mm 2009 169 mm 2014 170 mm with shortfalls in summer monsoon precipitation 100 mm are also related to the major differences in crop yields with the reduction of rice and food grain by 110 41 1957 216 27 1965 105 2 1974 146 50 1976 254 146 1979 335 199 2002 95 75 2004 53 111 2009 and 25 92 2014 kg ha 1 although the largest negative precipitation anomaly was found in 1979 the year 2002 was considered to be the severe drought year because of the larger areal extent 52 with the greatest shortfall of rice 335 kg ha 1 and food grain 199 kg ha 1 yields the 2002 drought was mainly concentrated over the north west and southern india supplementary fig s1b overall the general consensus is that the drought events in india are related to the significant reductions in rice and food grain yields that leads to a larger variation in indian food production anomalies over this period 3 2 observed temporal variability of the drought india s drought events were estimated using the non parametric standardized precipitation index spi for the summer monsoon season where the spi less than 1 was categorized as a drought year overall india experienced eighteen 1901 1904 1905 1911 1918 1920 1951 1965 1966 1968 1972 1979 1982 1987 2002 2004 2009 2014 drought events during the span of 1901 2014 fig 2 a table 2 earlier studies have revealed that if 40 or more areas of the country experienced rainwater deficiency the year would be considered as the severe drought year preethi et al 2019 mishra et al 2020 considering the fact out of eighteen drought years only four years 1918 1972 1987 2002 were identified as the most severe drought years during the observed period 1901 2014 table2 it is worth noting that droughts occurrences are more apparent during the post 1960 period with 11 drought years indicating the increased frequency of drought events it should also be noted that out of the four severe droughts three have occurred in the post 1960 which indicates increased drought intensity in recent decades table 2 3 3 observed spatial variability of the precipitation during drought events the spatial variability and distribution of precipitation during the drought years over india has been examined using the precipitation composite for 18 drought years table 2 identified from the imd observed daily gridded precipitation and provided in fig 3 b the summer monsoon precipitation climatology for the period of 1901 2014 is provided in fig 3a for reference the difference between the precipitation climatology and drought composites is shown in fig 3c india receives heavy precipitation during the summer monsoon season with an average value of above 18 mm day 1 over the west coast of india konkan and goa coastal karnataka and kerala and the north eastern himalayan foothills west bengal assam meghalaya sikkim attributed to the strong orographic effects of the mountain range besides several depressions and low pressure system developed over the bay of bengal during each monsoon period brings torrential precipitation over central india with the values varies from 6 to 12 mm day 1 fig 3a a significant amount of precipitation is also received over the west coast of india during the drought years similar to the climatology however with the low rate that varies from 14 to 18 mm day 1 fig 3b the north and western parts of india receive precipitation lower than the climatological mean 2 mm day 1 conversely northeast india receives precipitation greater than precipitation climatology exceeding 20 mm day 1 these deviations are visible in the composite precipitation anomaly fig 3c where a statistically significant p value 0 05 positive precipitation deviation 2 4 mm day 1 is observed in northeast india assam meghalaya and some parts of arunachal pradesh during the drought years conversely the significant p value 0 05 negative precipitation anomaly about 4 5 mm day 1 and 2 3 mm day 1 is observed on india s west coast and central part 3 4 teleconnection of drought with sst and low level circulation pearson s correlation coefficient between the drought years spi and sst is shown in fig 4 the statistically significant negative correlation r 0 6 p value 0 05 between the equatorial eastern pacific ocean epo sst and spi indices is evident in fig 4b which explain all india s intensification of droughts with the rising sst over the equatorial epo out of 18 drought years during this period 1901 2014 nine 1901 1905 1951 1965 1972 1982 1987 2002 and 2009 years were associated with strong el niño events fig 2b with sst anomalies 0 5 c over the niño3 4 region notably a similar significant negative correlation pattern r 0 55 p value 0 05 is also evident in the western indian ocean wio though the strength of the correlation is somewhat lesser compared to the equatorial epo this suggests that the wio could also intensify the all india droughts in addition to the warming of the equatorial epo sst on the contrary the western pacific ocean wpo sst has shown a significant positive relationship r 0 45 p value 0 05 with the spi indices suggesting a reduction of drought intensity with increasing sst in the wpo the analysis shows that all india drought has an in phase relationship with the sst over the eastern epo and wio whereas an out phase relationship is observed with the wpo sst in order to identify the low level circulation pattern during the drought years wind anomaly at 850 hpa throughout the summer monsoon drought years of 1901 2014 is given in fig 5 a in addition to this the composite wind anomaly during the years when spi 1 flood years is also shown fig 5b to compare the wind pattern during the flood years the considerable differences in wind circulation are clearly visible in all cases of the summer monsoon during the drought years divergent wind circulation is observed over the indian sub continent and the westerly wind anomaly is observed over the western pacific ocean whereas during the flood years an abnormal cyclonic circulation was observed over the arabian sea and central india besides the decrease in convection in the eastern equatorial pacific ocean and increase over the east indian ocean is quite prominent 3 5 selection of the gcms for future projection the quantile mapping bias correction efficiently removed the biases present in the selected cmip6 gcms supplementary fig s2 as spi requires a monthly precipitation value we converted the daily data to monthly and compared it with the observed high resolution imd precipitation data the models were compared through the taylor diagram that helped to review their degrees of correspondence by considering the correlation coefficient of the precipitation patterns of the models the standard deviation along with the root mean square error according to fig 6 the highest correlation r 0 76 and lowest root mean square error rmse 40 mm was found in the ensemble model but the low standard deviation std 46 69 mm of the ensemble model shows less variability of precipitation compared to the other cmip6 models the canesm5 model showed the worst performance of the precipitation prediction having low r 0 18 and high rmse 72 mm which makes it difficult to consider for future simulation of the indian precipitation however the ipsl cm6a lr ec earth3and miroc6 model shows a fair r 0 64 0 62 0 56 moderate rmse 50 mm 56 mm 55 5 mm and more or less similar std 51 44 mm 63 34 mm 52 92 mm to the observed value representing the good predictive ability of the precipitation furthermore the models were spatially evaluated using the spaef metric and shown in fig 7 it is observed that no cmip6 models can capture the spatial pattern of monsoon precipitation completely for instance the can esm5 model under predicted the precipitation in the western coast and north eastern part of india about 100 200 mm month 1 failing to capture the orographic effects having a low spaef 0 62 value on the other hand bcc csm2 mr over predicted the precipitation particularly on the western coast of india by 40 60 mm month 1 however some models such as ec earth3 samo unicon and cesm2 are close to the observation with high spaef 0 85 0 8 0 8 among all the selected cmip6 gcms the ec earth3 ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 models show a good agreement with the observed data for both spatial spaef 0 85 0 7 0 77 and temporal scales therefore these models have been selected for future projection of the summer monsoon drought over india for the four emission scenarios i e ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 3 6 climate model simulations of droughts scenario the changes in precipitation and spi obtained from the ec earth3 ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 models were assessed based on historical 1971 2000 and future 2071 2100 periods likewise the association between the enso and drought events were investigated using these two periods for the summer monsoon season the ec earth3 model shows that the summer monsoon precipitation in india is going to increase by 27 31 41 and 48 at the end of 2100 under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 emission scenarios fig 8 a similarly ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 model also showed an increasing summer monsoon precipitation but at a lower rate 14 28 9 16 under low ssp1 2 6 to high ssp5 8 5 emission scenarios fig 8b 8c our observation results clearly depicted the occurrence of 4 drought years during the historical period 1971 2000 out of which india experienced 2 severe drought years 1972 1987 which covers 40 of the area table 2 nevertheless the ec earth3 and miroc6 model has identified the more frequent all india drought years 11 and 8 years than that of the observations 4 years out of which india experienced 6 1973 1980 1981 1986 1987 and 1992 and 4 1973 1974 1984 and 1993 severe drought years and it is projected to increase in the future period under high emission scenario table3 apart the ipsl cm6a lr model has simulated 4 all india drought years for this period similar to the observation where india experienced only 1 severe drought year 1972 besides a significant rising spi value is also projected for future periods over india by the kernel density function fig 8d f the ranksum and kolmogorov smirnov ks test shows a significant difference p value 0 05 in terms of mean and variance for the precipitation and spi values between the historical and future period the increasing spi value in the far future 2071 2100 indicates the decreasing frequency of the drought due to increasing precipitation during the monsoon period it is noted here that despite the substantial rise in precipitation in the future period fig 8a c spi density over the far future period 2071 2100 is not considerably different though significant p value 0 05 under the ssp1 2 6 scenario fig 9 d f the composite of sst anomaly during the 11 drought years obtained from the ec earth3 model shows the significant warming impact of east pacific ocean sst el niño on the drought events in the region fig 9a b similarly based on 13 drought years with spi less than 1 in the future period under four ssp scenarios also shows a strong influence of el niño on the drought events in india fig 9c j a similar result was also found in the other two models i e ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 for the historical and future periods supplementary fig s3 fig s4 however the association of enso and drought is not uniform over india and it varies with the gcm projections conforming to the ec earth3 model the central southern and western states will be affected by severe droughts in the ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 scenarios whereas the northern and western states will be affected in the ssp5 8 5 scenario the eastern states of india will remain unaffected by drought events throughout all scenarios nevertheless the situation is different in the case of ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 models the ipsl cm6a lr model shows the more or less similar spatial pattern of droughts as the ec earth3 model but in the case of high ssp scenario ssp5 8 5 northern southern and eastern states of india will be unaffected by drought events but the miroc6 mode depicted that the northeastern and southern states will be affected by severe drought in ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in order to understand the drivers of such enso influences on summer monsoon drought we estimated the linear trends in sea level pressure slp for slightly longer periods in the historical 1951 2000 and future 2051 2100 climates under different ssp scenarios fig 10 over the domain 15 s 15 n 0 360 the increasing trend in slp has been found over the western pacific while a decreasing trend is observed over the eastern pacific ocean in the historical period 1951 2000 moreover the slp is projected to decline rapidly over the eastern pacific ocean in the future 2051 2100 in comparison to the historical period 1951 2000 in all the selected models under high emission scenarios showing the weakening of the walker circulation 4 discussion future changes in summer monsoon drought events with continued global warming scenarios are indispensable for regional acclimation mishra et al 2020 the summer monsoon drought magnitude and frequency have largely been overlooked because of the overemphasizing the precipitation extremes over the indian sub continent hence the present study seeks to investigate the yields of the major food crops of india being significantly influenced by the major drought events occurring in the country moreover the link has been established between the el niño and the occurrence of these drought events furthermore the study also illustrates the future changes of these events with changing climate under different shared socio economic pathways ssp the agricultural production along with the gross domestic product gdp of the country both experience a blow by the negative anomaly of indian summer monsoon precipitation gadgil et al 2004 the country s major drought events are also closely linked with the agricultural production i e rice and food crops of the country fig 1 among these events 2002 was considered as the major drought year covers 50 area of the country to which the rice and food grain yields kharif crops have largely decreased by 335 and 199 kg ha 1 the declined agricultural production in the 2002 drought event cut down the country s gdp by 1 5 22 billion dollars gadgil et al 2004 gadgil and gadgil 2006 as reported by rajeevan et al 2010 the monsoonal break conditions existed for almost the whole july month of 2002 causing abnormal daytime temperatures as a result the drying soil moisture condition during this month contributed to the severity of drought conditions leading to the country s declining agricultural crop production the frequency of all india severe drought events is escalated after the 1960s which corroborated with the studies done by pai et al 2017 preethi et al 2019 and mishra et al 2020 the negative precipitation anomaly over india s central and west coast during the drought years clearly indicates the failure of monsoon precipitation this could be attributed to the absence of active monsoon depression the westward shift of the monsoon trough and the non appearance of good airflow across the equator preethi et al 2017 however the fact that the north eastern part of the country experiences an out of phase relationship compare to the other homogeneous regions characterising positive precipitation change is elucidated in this study this is maybe because of the variability in enso which causes the area to experience instability in atmospheric conditions which is in turn causing higher moisture concentration in this region goswami et al 2010 this study suggests that droughts are more frequent during the el niño periods which demonstrated enso s role in causing the summer monsoon droughts moreover the wind structure and the low level jet stream llj at the height of around 850 hpa during the el niño periods are distinctly different from normal years joseph and sijikumar 2004 stated that the llj is responsible for transferring the moisture from the ocean to indian landmass and consequently plays a vibrant role in controlling indian summer monsoon precipitation characteristics the study also points to the diverging nature of the wind circulation pattern over the country fig 5a because of the el niño events prominently occurring over the equatorial epo during the summer monsoon period the llj becomes weak due to the influence of the warm sst in the western indian ocean arabian sea near the east coast of africa this phenomenon leads to a notable inflexion to drive the low level circulation similarly a westerly wind anomaly developed over the wpo because of the warm sst over the equatorial epo during the el niño events these two divergent wind movements pull the dry continental air and make the indian landmass more drought prone during the summer monsoon period during flood years fig 5b the llj become strong particularly in the arabian sea and the indian peninsula the weak westerlies from the north western region create an abnormal cyclonic circulation over the arabian sea leading to the intensification of the convective precipitation over these regions yadav 2011 varikoden and preethi 2013 aneesh and sijikumar 2017 however the relationship between the all india droughts event and enso s warming phase is not always one to one even though the severe drought events occurred during the el niño years india also experienced several droughts without el niño years while the wio sst and all india drought events are closely related which is also evident in the study during the drought years the high sst over the wio bears a positive iod structure and is consistent with the outcomes of ashok et al 2001 and pai et al 2017 the monsoon circulation may get hampered by the observed warming sst of the wio resulting in intensified convection and reduced the land sea temperature contrast deser et al 2010 anil et al 2016 nevertheless a detailed study is suggested in order to identify the physical causes in the relationship between iod and summer monsoon drought frequency over india the use of gcms in climate change impact studies has increased during the last decades eyring et al 2016 however over the varying region and climatic conditions the performance of the gcm may become erratic as these gcms are mostly applicable to a particular region or climatic setups therefore the proper decision over selecting the most suitable gcm for a certain region or climate for consistent outcomes is highly suggested khan et al 2018 in this study the suitable gcms for the region were selected after evaluating the precipitation pattern over the indian region from 10 latest available cmip6 models and their ensemble means in the historical runs over a centennial 1901 2014 period for summer monsoon season using the imd dataset as an observation although the spatial statistics show a good association between the gcms and the observed precipitation the most substantial discrepancy observed in terms of their magnitude particularly in the west coast and north eastern part of india fails to capture the orographic effects however the study elucidates that the ec earth3 ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 models exhibited excellent performance in terms of precipitation temporal and spatial magnitude for the summer monsoon season showing the suitability of the future simulation this is maybe because of their upgraded physical parameters williamson et al 2015 haarsma et al 2020 in our study the ipsl cm6a lr predicts that the summer monsoon precipitation in india is expected to rise by 14 28 in future the result corroborated with the findings of ha et al 2020 and aadhar and mishra 2020 where they found that the precipitation is estimated to increase by 20 30 over the asian countries in the future periods however the result derived from the ec earth3 evidently made an overestimation 27 48 of the future precipitation over india while miroc6 clearly underestimated it 9 16 showing less reliability as compared to the ipsl cm6a lr model on the contrary gusain et al 2020 reported that the ipsl cm6a lr model is unsuitable for simulating the future indian climatic conditions as the model made serious underestimation of the peak seasons this could be the reason for re gridding the low spatial resolution gcms to high spatial resolution which may significantly underestimate the high precipitation intensity and the bias could be worse for extremes jain et al 2019 the spi indices projected by ec earth3 ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 have suggested less frequent droughts in the high emission ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 in comparison to low emission ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 scenarios due to the rising precipitation in the future periods nevertheless the droughts with el niño events are more pronounced in the future periods over the country because of the decreasing slp trend in the equatorial epo and the increasing slp trend over the wpo weakening of the walker circulation the high slp over the wpo indicates a low amount of precipitation a fundamental stipulation for the occurrences of drought in the past years in this case the ec earth3 and ipsl cm6a lr models have presented a much better outcome of the slp scenario compare to the miroc6 over the pacific ocean elucidating the occurrence of el niño and its effect on indian summer monsoon conditions as well as on the drought events in the country which poses a substantial threat to the future food security over the indian subcontinent being of different resolution the gcms were re gridded to match with the observed data however this re gridding may have affected the resolution of our results causing uncertainties in data ipsl cm6a lr model also had a tendency to underestimate the spatial distribution of summer monsoon precipitation patterns in the eastern coast of india while overestimating that of the western coast these also aid to some of the uncertainties in our results the anomaly in predicting the frequency of future drought events may also occur due to the internal variability and biases of the different gcms the gcm that produced better outcomes in the past periods is expected to be a reliable tool for performing simulations for future climatic conditions zamani and berndtsson 2018 likewise it should be remembered that the optimal gcm for a specific region may not be the best suitable in other regions because of the different climatic conditions errasti et al 2011 considering the fact the models selected for this study is valid for indian landmass during the summer monsoon season the model may not perform equally if other regions or seasons are considered 5 conclusions the present study aimed to understand the historical and future spatial and temporal variability of indian summer monsoon drought events and its relation to major staple crop production over the region to achieve the aim a standardized precipitation index spi was calculated which is considered as a widely accepted drought index globally the years with spi 1 was regarded as the drought years and the percentage of area 40 covered by the drought event was considered as the severe drought years moreover the relationship between the sea surface temperature and drought events were also examined since gcms are considered to be the principal tool for assessing the future predictions of precipitation patterns the performance of these models was examined using the spatial and temporal statistical measures to simulate the future changeability of summer monsoon droughts over india the analysis was done for historical 1971 2000 and future periods 2071 2100 under four shared socio economic pathways scenarios i e ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 ssp5 8 5 the increasing frequency and the intensification of severe droughts have been observed in recent decades specifically during the post 1960 period these drought events resulted in lowered agricultural production rice and food grains however while some parts of the country such as regions along the west coast of the country konkan and goa coastal karnataka and kerala experienced the declining summer monsoon precipitation anomaly in other parts especially over north western india the positive precipitation anomaly can be witnessed that denotes an out of phase relationship with the rest of the country interestingly the positive ssts over the eastern equatorial extent of the pacific ocean and the western part of the indian ocean was noted to be in an in phase relationship with the whole country encompassing drought scenarios while they showed to be in an out of phase connection with the sst over the western pacific ocean the study reflects the strong possibility of intensification of the all india drought scenario due to rising sst as illustrated by the future simulations of cmip6 gcms the influence of el niño is predicted to be strengthening as the walker circulation weakens and an anomaly in the trend of slp in wpo and epo which again adds to the future occurrences of el niño influenced droughts in india a thorough consultation of the gcms shows that the southern region of the country is evidently going to be affected by severe drought events while the eastern parts are to remain comparatively untouched by such events other parts of the country are also predicted to be suffering varying degrees of drought in future due to the intensification of el niño induced drought events in the country among the three models i e ec earth3 ipsl cm6a lr miroc6 showing the change in precipitation in india the ipsl cm6a lr model provided the best and most reliable results when compared with the observed dataset of the other two the ec earth3 gave quite good results that followed the present trend however it also showed a tendency to overpredict the scenario on the other hand the miroc6 did an underprediction of the precipitation trend therefore as ipsl cm6a lr gave an overall better and consistent result throughout the study we recommend this model is more suitable for the indian condition the present study aid the research of the future climatic conditions of india and act as a base for the prediction of drought conditions in the country this may help to devise adaptation and mitigation plans in such harsh conditions and it can also help to cope with the crop production and food availability issues in this country even though the models suggested the less frequent drought events in the high emission scenarios gupta and jain 2018 and mishra et al 2020 argued that despite the increasing monsoon precipitation the rise in surface air temperature and potential evapotranspiration may reduce the overall water availability which will increase the frequency of hot and dry extremes drought over the coming century therefore a study on drought events associated with temperature and evapotranspiration is recommended in future research credit authorship contribution

4104,the drought events during the summer monsoon season june september have a considerable impact on the water availability and major staple crop production in india in this study the temporal and spatial variability of drought events has been examined utilizing the standardized precipitation index spi moreover the future drought events pattern has been investigated based on four shared socio economic pathways based scenarios i e ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 after evaluating the suitable cmip6 gcm simulations using spatial and temporal statistical metrics the observation in the recent decade 1951 2014 showed that the drought events in the summer monsoon season are more pronounced and has a significant negative impact on agricultural production moreover the most severe droughts have a tendency to occur during the years with el niño events having a significant negative correlation r 0 6 p value 0 05 between the equatorial eastern pacific ocean epo sea surface temperature and spi indices the result of the statistics revealed that out of 10 gcms and their ensemble mean the ec earth3 ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 model well simulate the indian summer monsoon precipitation variability both for spatial and temporal scale in the historical period 1901 2014 future projection 2071 2100 of the all india droughts from the selected models indicates the more frequent droughts in the ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 in comparison to ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 besides the el niño contribution to the drought years is likely to rise in the future period due to the decreasing sea level pressure slp over the equatorial epo and increasing slp over the western pacific ocean under the high emission scenario thereby giving rise to the considerable challenges in the future food production in india keywords indian summer monsoon droughts spi enso agricultural production dry period 1 introduction india being the seventh largest country in the world is situated in the north of the equator from 8 n to 37 n latitude and 68 e to 97 e longitude covering an area of 3 million km2 the wide variety of physiographical features result in diverse climatic conditions in india even though the substantial volume of himalayan water flows into this country the precipitation plays a vital role in indian agriculture contributing a significant proportion 13 7 of the total gross domestic product gdp in the country census of india 2011 the location of india provides a distinguished character to its topography and climate that results in disparities in the precipitation occurrences in this country in both time and space most parts of india mainly the western ghats central india north and northeast india receives around 78 of the annual precipitation in the south west monsoon season during june september jain et al 2019 however a strong variability of the indian summer monsoon precipitation ismp has been stated in the previous studies naidu et al 2009 kumar et al 2010 saha and ghosh 2019 preethi et al 2019 where the deficiency of the ismp is related to drought events that have a significant impact on the economy due to the lower production of the food grains kumar et al 2013a gill et al 2015 preethi et al 2017 despite the increasing rate of food crop production due to the technological advancement and large scale application of a high yielding variety of seeds during the green revolution in the mid 20th century the summer monsoon drought events significantly impact the yield of many staple crops in india mishra et al 2020 owing to the strong relationship between precipitation and agricultural production it is important to better comprehend the future changes of ismp variability under the warming climate with expanding population pressure and food demands in india the el niño southern oscillation enso is found to be strongly associated with the variability of ismp in past studies mooley et al 1983 roy and tedeschi 2016 li et al 2018 huang et al 2020 mishra et al 2020 and references therein interestingly few studies also reported the significant effects of indian ocean dipole iod ashok et al 2004 bala and singh 2007 pacific decadal oscillation pdo and north atlantic oscillation nao krishnan and sugi 2003 dutta and maity 2018 chen et al 2020 on the variability of ismp many studies reported that the enso relationship with ismp was significant till 1980 and reduced greatly thereafter li et al 2018 mishra et al 2020 while the influence of iod on ismp has been increased in the recent decades ashok and saji 2007 besides the warming phase of equatorial sst has been attributed to a possible cause of ismp deficit by modulating monsoon circulation over the equatorial pacific and indian ocean roxy et al 2015 even though the significant warming trend of sst has been observed in recent decades little efforts have been put forward in order to understand the possible contribution of enso on the variability of indian drought events in the future periods therefore it is indispensable to perceive the effects of changing sst on the variability and intensity of indian summer monsoon droughts particularly in the future warming scenario the coupled model inter comparison project cmip provides different global circulation models gcms which explain the future climatic situations eyring et al 2016 numerous researches have been performed for making future predictions of ismp using the cmip3 models and its updated version of cmip5 kripalani et al 2007 sperber et al 2013 shashikanth et al 2014 su et al 2013 song and zhou 2014 despite the fact that the gcms in cmip5 include new components most of them are failing to capture the local influences such as topography land use change in simulating the climatic conditions kamworapan and surussavadee 2019 jain et al 2019 hence numerous statistical and dynamical downscaling approaches have been suggested by the researchers in the last decades in order to remove the biases presented in the gcms and apply the simulations at the local scale salvi et al 2013 yhang et al 2017 but in most of the cases these approaches yielded insignificant results and in a few cases the results deteriorated to great extent sharma et al 2018 jain et al 2019 many studies have also pointed out the downside of cmip5 models i e over underprediction of the monsoon precipitation and intra seasonal variability over the south asian countries including india which minimize the reliability of future projection shashikanth et al 2014 kitoh et al 2013 saha et al 2014 ramesh and goswami 2014 sharmila et al 2015 jain et al 2019 the cmip5 models concerning ismp and enso events were criticized for their erratic performance as the projected simulations performed by the models on the sst and circulation pattern of the indo pacific region were proved to be inconsistent and impractical gong et al 2018 fang et al 2019 some researchers shrestha et al 2012 eekhout and de vente 2018 de oliveira etal 2019 prefer to use the regional climate models rcms for future projection due to its high resolution grid scale however mehr et al 2019 and yuan et al 2016 in their work found that rcms are not very suitable when drought is assessed especially for future prediction the rcms tend to produce large amounts of uncertainties when used for temporal variation in case of indian climate both akhtar et al 2009 and kumar et al 2013b concluded that application of rcms resulted in high inconsistency in their final outcome especially over extreme events by performing major over under prediction dimri et al 2013 also found large discrepancy when used rcms for projecting future indian precipitation this may occur due to the internal variability of the rcms and their tendency of overlooking anthropogenic inputs that result in such uncertainties in future projections and even error correction methods often fail remove these uncertainties sufficiently themeßl et al 2011 gómez navarro et al 2015 to overcome these issues recently updated version of gcms is released under the sixth phase of cmip with the improved emissions model parameterization physical processes a land use under different shared socio economic pathways based scenarios eyring et al 2016 additionally this also provides the historical runs that started in 1850 which can furnish the comprehensive picture of the long term precipitation change cmip6 with its gcms that are more climate sensitive than those of cmip5 and with a better framework that take different socio economic and climatic processes into account has become quite popular among the scientific community therefore it has been applied successfully by several scholars both regionally and globally to analyze the future climatic conditions and their resulting consequence boer et al 2016 chen et al 2020 grose et al 2020 lyu et al 2020 few environmental impact studies have also been conducted in india and its adjacent areas using cmip6 almazroui et al 2020 krishnan bhaskaran 2020 shrestha et al 2020 and found a reliable outcomes with having the shortcomings of cmip3 cmip5 and rcm models there is a strong need to understand the future contribution of enso on the drought events using the newly developed cmip6 gcms over india being an agrarian country india s economy is greatly dependent on its agricultural production which is highly controlled by climatic conditions therefore erratic and inconsistent future projections of climatic conditions may seriously affect the future planning and management of crop production food availability and economic structure of the country the better and highly consistent results of cmip6 can help to overcome such issues however not much work has been done that proficiently applies the cmip6 model in projecting future ismp patterns highlighting the occurrences of drought events along with analyzing its major drivers and its impact upon the crop production in this country therefore the objectives of the study are to 1 demonstrate the impacts of indian summer monsoon droughts on major staple crop production in india 2 show the temporal and spatial variability of the summer monsoon drought events and their potential drivers i e enso phenomenon and low level circulation using observations 3 identify the most suitable gcms for the region from cmip6 models through a systematic comparison of their performances with the observed precipitation pattern and 4 investigate the future occurrence of the droughts in relation to enso events under different shared socio economic pathways ssp based scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources 2 1 1 observed datasets observed gridded 0 25 0 25 precipitation data for the span of 1901 2014 provided by the indian meteorological department imd was collected for this work the observed data set was prepared using the daily precipitation value from the 6955 rain gauge stations over the whole country pai et al 2015 some additional materials such as the monthly mean gridded 1 1 sea surface temperature data hadisst 1 1 rayner et al 2003 was collected from the website of met office hadley centre observations http www metoffice gov uk hadobs the ncep ncar reanalysis monthly mean wind data 2 5 2 5 was collected from https psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep reanalysis pressure html in addition to this the observed agricultural production yield kg ha 1 data for rice and food grain have been collected from the website of directorate economics and statistics india https eands dacnet nic in latest 20011 htm accessed on 10th july 2020 2 1 2 global climate model simulation for future projection precipitation outputs of 10 cmip6 gcms eyring et al 2016 have been used considering the similar historical runs and variant r1i1p1 available at the earth system grid federation esgf website https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 table 1 these models were selected because of their availability and aided as a vibrant standard for evaluating model performance against the observation rivera and arnould 2020 the cmip6 model simulations for the 1901 2014 period was considered for showing the historical drought events however in order to compare the drought events a 30 years time span for historical 1971 2000 and far future period 2071 2100 were considered under four shared socioeconomic pathways based scenarios ssps i e ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 2 2 methods 2 2 1 estimation of spi among the different drought indices standardized precipitation index spi is very common which is derived by fitting a gamma distribution function to the precipitation data and most widely used indices both locally and globally wang et al 2011 pai et al 2017 preethi et al 2019 however some researchers argued that fitting a two parameter gamma distribution function may not be a good choice because the spi values are reasonably sensitive in the tail of the distribution kumar et al 2009 quiring 2009 therefore the non parametric method has been used for estimating the drought indices spi over the indian sub continent for the summer monsoon gringorten plotting position following gringorten 1963 was used for the calculation of the marginal probability of precipitation for the region under consideration and expressed in eq 1 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 1 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 where i is the rank of non zero precipitation p xi is the associated empirical probability and n denotes the size of the samples the eq 1 can be converted into a standardized index si as 2 si 1 p where ϕ and p denote the standard normal distribution function and the probability derived from eq 1 respectively the standardize of the percentile can be done using the commonly used approximation of eq 2 kumar et al 2009 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 3 si t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 i f 0 p 0 5 t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 i f 0 5 p 1 where c 0 2

when the spi value reaches an intensity of 1 mckee et al 1993 therefore in this study the spi value 1 is considered as drought years 2 2 2 precipitation anomaly with agricultural production the relationship between the precipitation anomaly and the agricultural productions i e rice and food grains during the summer monsoon season in india was established by comparing the year to year change first difference of the precipitation and agricultural production time series following wang et al 2015 and feng et al 2018 this was done with the aim of reducing the effects of different agricultural management practices such as the application of a high yielding variety of seeds high grade fertilizers improved irrigation facility 2 2 3 estimation of sst anomaly the sst anomaly of niño 3 4 region 5 n 5 s 170 w 120 w was calculated to appraise the association between all india summer monsoon drought events and el niño southern oscillation enso index as advocated by krishnamurthy and kirtman 2009 a close relationship can be observed between the sst existing over the pacific ocean and indian summer monsoon precipitation during the period of monsoon in the country which is why the sst data for the span of monsoon has been used in this analysis the previous studies reported the strong linear trend of the sst during the summer monsoon season in the future period choudhury et al 2019 mishra et al 2020 hence the linear detrending method using the least square regression has been performed before estimating the sst anomaly in the niño3 4 regions for the future period 2 2 4 selection of the suitable gcms for future simulation selecting the most suitable gcms for simulating the future scenarios of the indian summer monsoon precipitation is a vital part of this analysis firstly the bilinear interpolation method has been applied in order to match the selected gcms grid to the observed grid size i e 0 25 0 25 then the quantile mapping bias correction method was incorporated to remove the biases presented in the gcms followed by the evaluation of those gcms performed through the correlation r root mean square error rmse and standard deviation sd using the taylor diagram for more details see taylor 2001 furthermore the spatial closeness between the observed and gcms simulated precipitation was evaluated using spatial efficiency metric spaef the performance of the spaef metric is well admired because of its ability to perform analysis of robust nature demirel et al 2018 this method combines three statistical measures namely pearson correlation coefficient coefficient of variation and histogram overlap into one metric as spaef compares between two spatial pattern maps the monthly average summer monsoon precipitation 1901 2014 has been taken for this analysis the spaef values between the observed and gcms simulated precipitation maps were calculated using eq 5 where α is the pearson correlation coefficient β is the coefficient of variation and γ is the percentage of histogram overlap between the observed and gcm simulated precipitation maps the spaef value varies from to 1 where a value closer to 1 demonstrates higher spatial closeness for α x is the observed and y is the simulated precipitation and n is the total number of values eq 6 eq 7 and eq 8 were used to calculate the β and γ respectively where σg and σo are the standard deviation and μg and μo are the mean of simulated and observed precipitation in eq 8 k and l denotes the histogram values of the observed and simulated precipitation and n represented the number of bins herein 100 bins in a histogram ahmed et al 2019 the histogram intersection percentage between the observed and gcm simulated precipitation spatial maps were performed after normalization to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 z score in order to overcome the bias or variance differences between the maps 5 spaef 1 α 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 6 α n x y x y n x 2 x 2 n y 2 y 2 7 β σ g μ g σ o μ o 8 γ j 1 n m i n

food grains yield has remarkably escalated at a rate of 26 5 and 24 8 kg ha 1 annually from 1951 to 2014 fig 1 a however the inter annual precipitation anomaly has a substantial influence on the yield of staple crops i e rice and food grains in india during this season fig 1b d strong statistically significant p value 0 05 correlation can be observed between the precipitation anomaly and the total rice r 0 70 and the food grain r 0 71 yields in india fig 1e the year with decreasing summer monsoon precipitation has been correlated with the reduction in yields the top nine years 1957 125 mm 1965 228 mm 1974 127 mm 1976 108 mm 1979 232 mm 2002 113 mm 2004 125 mm 2009 169 mm 2014 170 mm with shortfalls in summer monsoon precipitation 100 mm are also related to the major differences in crop yields with the reduction of rice and food grain by 110 41 1957 216 27 1965 105 2 1974 146 50 1976 254 146 1979 335 199 2002 95 75 2004 53 111 2009 and 25 92 2014 kg ha 1 although the largest negative precipitation anomaly was found in 1979 the year 2002 was considered to be the severe drought year because of the larger areal extent 52 with the greatest shortfall of rice 335 kg ha 1 and food grain 199 kg ha 1 yields the 2002 drought was mainly concentrated over the north west and southern india supplementary fig s1b overall the general consensus is that the drought events in india are related to the significant reductions in rice and food grain yields that leads to a larger variation in indian food production anomalies over this period 3 2 observed temporal variability of the drought india s drought events were estimated using the non parametric standardized precipitation index spi for the summer monsoon season where the spi less than 1 was categorized as a drought year overall india experienced eighteen 1901 1904 1905 1911 1918 1920 1951 1965 1966 1968 1972 1979 1982 1987 2002 2004 2009 2014 drought events during the span of 1901 2014 fig 2 a table 2 earlier studies have revealed that if 40 or more areas of the country experienced rainwater deficiency the year would be considered as the severe drought year preethi et al 2019 mishra et al 2020 considering the fact out of eighteen drought years only four years 1918 1972 1987 2002 were identified as the most severe drought years during the observed period 1901 2014 table2 it is worth noting that droughts occurrences are more apparent during the post 1960 period with 11 drought years indicating the increased frequency of drought events it should also be noted that out of the four severe droughts three have occurred in the post 1960 which indicates increased drought intensity in recent decades table 2 3 3 observed spatial variability of the precipitation during drought events the spatial variability and distribution of precipitation during the drought years over india has been examined using the precipitation composite for 18 drought years table 2 identified from the imd observed daily gridded precipitation and provided in fig 3 b the summer monsoon precipitation climatology for the period of 1901 2014 is provided in fig 3a for reference the difference between the precipitation climatology and drought composites is shown in fig 3c india receives heavy precipitation during the summer monsoon season with an average value of above 18 mm day 1 over the west coast of india konkan and goa coastal karnataka and kerala and the north eastern himalayan foothills west bengal assam meghalaya sikkim attributed to the strong orographic effects of the mountain range besides several depressions and low pressure system developed over the bay of bengal during each monsoon period brings torrential precipitation over central india with the values varies from 6 to 12 mm day 1 fig 3a a significant amount of precipitation is also received over the west coast of india during the drought years similar to the climatology however with the low rate that varies from 14 to 18 mm day 1 fig 3b the north and western parts of india receive precipitation lower than the climatological mean 2 mm day 1 conversely northeast india receives precipitation greater than precipitation climatology exceeding 20 mm day 1 these deviations are visible in the composite precipitation anomaly fig 3c where a statistically significant p value 0 05 positive precipitation deviation 2 4 mm day 1 is observed in northeast india assam meghalaya and some parts of arunachal pradesh during the drought years conversely the significant p value 0 05 negative precipitation anomaly about 4 5 mm day 1 and 2 3 mm day 1 is observed on india s west coast and central part 3 4 teleconnection of drought with sst and low level circulation pearson s correlation coefficient between the drought years spi and sst is shown in fig 4 the statistically significant negative correlation r 0 6 p value 0 05 between the equatorial eastern pacific ocean epo sst and spi indices is evident in fig 4b which explain all india s intensification of droughts with the rising sst over the equatorial epo out of 18 drought years during this period 1901 2014 nine 1901 1905 1951 1965 1972 1982 1987 2002 and 2009 years were associated with strong el niño events fig 2b with sst anomalies 0 5 c over the niño3 4 region notably a similar significant negative correlation pattern r 0 55 p value 0 05 is also evident in the western indian ocean wio though the strength of the correlation is somewhat lesser compared to the equatorial epo this suggests that the wio could also intensify the all india droughts in addition to the warming of the equatorial epo sst on the contrary the western pacific ocean wpo sst has shown a significant positive relationship r 0 45 p value 0 05 with the spi indices suggesting a reduction of drought intensity with increasing sst in the wpo the analysis shows that all india drought has an in phase relationship with the sst over the eastern epo and wio whereas an out phase relationship is observed with the wpo sst in order to identify the low level circulation pattern during the drought years wind anomaly at 850 hpa throughout the summer monsoon drought years of 1901 2014 is given in fig 5 a in addition to this the composite wind anomaly during the years when spi 1 flood years is also shown fig 5b to compare the wind pattern during the flood years the considerable differences in wind circulation are clearly visible in all cases of the summer monsoon during the drought years divergent wind circulation is observed over the indian sub continent and the westerly wind anomaly is observed over the western pacific ocean whereas during the flood years an abnormal cyclonic circulation was observed over the arabian sea and central india besides the decrease in convection in the eastern equatorial pacific ocean and increase over the east indian ocean is quite prominent 3 5 selection of the gcms for future projection the quantile mapping bias correction efficiently removed the biases present in the selected cmip6 gcms supplementary fig s2 as spi requires a monthly precipitation value we converted the daily data to monthly and compared it with the observed high resolution imd precipitation data the models were compared through the taylor diagram that helped to review their degrees of correspondence by considering the correlation coefficient of the precipitation patterns of the models the standard deviation along with the root mean square error according to fig 6 the highest correlation r 0 76 and lowest root mean square error rmse 40 mm was found in the ensemble model but the low standard deviation std 46 69 mm of the ensemble model shows less variability of precipitation compared to the other cmip6 models the canesm5 model showed the worst performance of the precipitation prediction having low r 0 18 and high rmse 72 mm which makes it difficult to consider for future simulation of the indian precipitation however the ipsl cm6a lr ec earth3and miroc6 model shows a fair r 0 64 0 62 0 56 moderate rmse 50 mm 56 mm 55 5 mm and more or less similar std 51 44 mm 63 34 mm 52 92 mm to the observed value representing the good predictive ability of the precipitation furthermore the models were spatially evaluated using the spaef metric and shown in fig 7 it is observed that no cmip6 models can capture the spatial pattern of monsoon precipitation completely for instance the can esm5 model under predicted the precipitation in the western coast and north eastern part of india about 100 200 mm month 1 failing to capture the orographic effects having a low spaef 0 62 value on the other hand bcc csm2 mr over predicted the precipitation particularly on the western coast of india by 40 60 mm month 1 however some models such as ec earth3 samo unicon and cesm2 are close to the observation with high spaef 0 85 0 8 0 8 among all the selected cmip6 gcms the ec earth3 ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 models show a good agreement with the observed data for both spatial spaef 0 85 0 7 0 77 and temporal scales therefore these models have been selected for future projection of the summer monsoon drought over india for the four emission scenarios i e ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 3 6 climate model simulations of droughts scenario the changes in precipitation and spi obtained from the ec earth3 ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 models were assessed based on historical 1971 2000 and future 2071 2100 periods likewise the association between the enso and drought events were investigated using these two periods for the summer monsoon season the ec earth3 model shows that the summer monsoon precipitation in india is going to increase by 27 31 41 and 48 at the end of 2100 under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 emission scenarios fig 8 a similarly ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 model also showed an increasing summer monsoon precipitation but at a lower rate 14 28 9 16 under low ssp1 2 6 to high ssp5 8 5 emission scenarios fig 8b 8c our observation results clearly depicted the occurrence of 4 drought years during the historical period 1971 2000 out of which india experienced 2 severe drought years 1972 1987 which covers 40 of the area table 2 nevertheless the ec earth3 and miroc6 model has identified the more frequent all india drought years 11 and 8 years than that of the observations 4 years out of which india experienced 6 1973 1980 1981 1986 1987 and 1992 and 4 1973 1974 1984 and 1993 severe drought years and it is projected to increase in the future period under high emission scenario table3 apart the ipsl cm6a lr model has simulated 4 all india drought years for this period similar to the observation where india experienced only 1 severe drought year 1972 besides a significant rising spi value is also projected for future periods over india by the kernel density function fig 8d f the ranksum and kolmogorov smirnov ks test shows a significant difference p value 0 05 in terms of mean and variance for the precipitation and spi values between the historical and future period the increasing spi value in the far future 2071 2100 indicates the decreasing frequency of the drought due to increasing precipitation during the monsoon period it is noted here that despite the substantial rise in precipitation in the future period fig 8a c spi density over the far future period 2071 2100 is not considerably different though significant p value 0 05 under the ssp1 2 6 scenario fig 9 d f the composite of sst anomaly during the 11 drought years obtained from the ec earth3 model shows the significant warming impact of east pacific ocean sst el niño on the drought events in the region fig 9a b similarly based on 13 drought years with spi less than 1 in the future period under four ssp scenarios also shows a strong influence of el niño on the drought events in india fig 9c j a similar result was also found in the other two models i e ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 for the historical and future periods supplementary fig s3 fig s4 however the association of enso and drought is not uniform over india and it varies with the gcm projections conforming to the ec earth3 model the central southern and western states will be affected by severe droughts in the ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 scenarios whereas the northern and western states will be affected in the ssp5 8 5 scenario the eastern states of india will remain unaffected by drought events throughout all scenarios nevertheless the situation is different in the case of ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 models the ipsl cm6a lr model shows the more or less similar spatial pattern of droughts as the ec earth3 model but in the case of high ssp scenario ssp5 8 5 northern southern and eastern states of india will be unaffected by drought events but the miroc6 mode depicted that the northeastern and southern states will be affected by severe drought in ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios in order to understand the drivers of such enso influences on summer monsoon drought we estimated the linear trends in sea level pressure slp for slightly longer periods in the historical 1951 2000 and future 2051 2100 climates under different ssp scenarios fig 10 over the domain 15 s 15 n 0 360 the increasing trend in slp has been found over the western pacific while a decreasing trend is observed over the eastern pacific ocean in the historical period 1951 2000 moreover the slp is projected to decline rapidly over the eastern pacific ocean in the future 2051 2100 in comparison to the historical period 1951 2000 in all the selected models under high emission scenarios showing the weakening of the walker circulation 4 discussion future changes in summer monsoon drought events with continued global warming scenarios are indispensable for regional acclimation mishra et al 2020 the summer monsoon drought magnitude and frequency have largely been overlooked because of the overemphasizing the precipitation extremes over the indian sub continent hence the present study seeks to investigate the yields of the major food crops of india being significantly influenced by the major drought events occurring in the country moreover the link has been established between the el niño and the occurrence of these drought events furthermore the study also illustrates the future changes of these events with changing climate under different shared socio economic pathways ssp the agricultural production along with the gross domestic product gdp of the country both experience a blow by the negative anomaly of indian summer monsoon precipitation gadgil et al 2004 the country s major drought events are also closely linked with the agricultural production i e rice and food crops of the country fig 1 among these events 2002 was considered as the major drought year covers 50 area of the country to which the rice and food grain yields kharif crops have largely decreased by 335 and 199 kg ha 1 the declined agricultural production in the 2002 drought event cut down the country s gdp by 1 5 22 billion dollars gadgil et al 2004 gadgil and gadgil 2006 as reported by rajeevan et al 2010 the monsoonal break conditions existed for almost the whole july month of 2002 causing abnormal daytime temperatures as a result the drying soil moisture condition during this month contributed to the severity of drought conditions leading to the country s declining agricultural crop production the frequency of all india severe drought events is escalated after the 1960s which corroborated with the studies done by pai et al 2017 preethi et al 2019 and mishra et al 2020 the negative precipitation anomaly over india s central and west coast during the drought years clearly indicates the failure of monsoon precipitation this could be attributed to the absence of active monsoon depression the westward shift of the monsoon trough and the non appearance of good airflow across the equator preethi et al 2017 however the fact that the north eastern part of the country experiences an out of phase relationship compare to the other homogeneous regions characterising positive precipitation change is elucidated in this study this is maybe because of the variability in enso which causes the area to experience instability in atmospheric conditions which is in turn causing higher moisture concentration in this region goswami et al 2010 this study suggests that droughts are more frequent during the el niño periods which demonstrated enso s role in causing the summer monsoon droughts moreover the wind structure and the low level jet stream llj at the height of around 850 hpa during the el niño periods are distinctly different from normal years joseph and sijikumar 2004 stated that the llj is responsible for transferring the moisture from the ocean to indian landmass and consequently plays a vibrant role in controlling indian summer monsoon precipitation characteristics the study also points to the diverging nature of the wind circulation pattern over the country fig 5a because of the el niño events prominently occurring over the equatorial epo during the summer monsoon period the llj becomes weak due to the influence of the warm sst in the western indian ocean arabian sea near the east coast of africa this phenomenon leads to a notable inflexion to drive the low level circulation similarly a westerly wind anomaly developed over the wpo because of the warm sst over the equatorial epo during the el niño events these two divergent wind movements pull the dry continental air and make the indian landmass more drought prone during the summer monsoon period during flood years fig 5b the llj become strong particularly in the arabian sea and the indian peninsula the weak westerlies from the north western region create an abnormal cyclonic circulation over the arabian sea leading to the intensification of the convective precipitation over these regions yadav 2011 varikoden and preethi 2013 aneesh and sijikumar 2017 however the relationship between the all india droughts event and enso s warming phase is not always one to one even though the severe drought events occurred during the el niño years india also experienced several droughts without el niño years while the wio sst and all india drought events are closely related which is also evident in the study during the drought years the high sst over the wio bears a positive iod structure and is consistent with the outcomes of ashok et al 2001 and pai et al 2017 the monsoon circulation may get hampered by the observed warming sst of the wio resulting in intensified convection and reduced the land sea temperature contrast deser et al 2010 anil et al 2016 nevertheless a detailed study is suggested in order to identify the physical causes in the relationship between iod and summer monsoon drought frequency over india the use of gcms in climate change impact studies has increased during the last decades eyring et al 2016 however over the varying region and climatic conditions the performance of the gcm may become erratic as these gcms are mostly applicable to a particular region or climatic setups therefore the proper decision over selecting the most suitable gcm for a certain region or climate for consistent outcomes is highly suggested khan et al 2018 in this study the suitable gcms for the region were selected after evaluating the precipitation pattern over the indian region from 10 latest available cmip6 models and their ensemble means in the historical runs over a centennial 1901 2014 period for summer monsoon season using the imd dataset as an observation although the spatial statistics show a good association between the gcms and the observed precipitation the most substantial discrepancy observed in terms of their magnitude particularly in the west coast and north eastern part of india fails to capture the orographic effects however the study elucidates that the ec earth3 ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 models exhibited excellent performance in terms of precipitation temporal and spatial magnitude for the summer monsoon season showing the suitability of the future simulation this is maybe because of their upgraded physical parameters williamson et al 2015 haarsma et al 2020 in our study the ipsl cm6a lr predicts that the summer monsoon precipitation in india is expected to rise by 14 28 in future the result corroborated with the findings of ha et al 2020 and aadhar and mishra 2020 where they found that the precipitation is estimated to increase by 20 30 over the asian countries in the future periods however the result derived from the ec earth3 evidently made an overestimation 27 48 of the future precipitation over india while miroc6 clearly underestimated it 9 16 showing less reliability as compared to the ipsl cm6a lr model on the contrary gusain et al 2020 reported that the ipsl cm6a lr model is unsuitable for simulating the future indian climatic conditions as the model made serious underestimation of the peak seasons this could be the reason for re gridding the low spatial resolution gcms to high spatial resolution which may significantly underestimate the high precipitation intensity and the bias could be worse for extremes jain et al 2019 the spi indices projected by ec earth3 ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 have suggested less frequent droughts in the high emission ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 in comparison to low emission ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 scenarios due to the rising precipitation in the future periods nevertheless the droughts with el niño events are more pronounced in the future periods over the country because of the decreasing slp trend in the equatorial epo and the increasing slp trend over the wpo weakening of the walker circulation the high slp over the wpo indicates a low amount of precipitation a fundamental stipulation for the occurrences of drought in the past years in this case the ec earth3 and ipsl cm6a lr models have presented a much better outcome of the slp scenario compare to the miroc6 over the pacific ocean elucidating the occurrence of el niño and its effect on indian summer monsoon conditions as well as on the drought events in the country which poses a substantial threat to the future food security over the indian subcontinent being of different resolution the gcms were re gridded to match with the observed data however this re gridding may have affected the resolution of our results causing uncertainties in data ipsl cm6a lr model also had a tendency to underestimate the spatial distribution of summer monsoon precipitation patterns in the eastern coast of india while overestimating that of the western coast these also aid to some of the uncertainties in our results the anomaly in predicting the frequency of future drought events may also occur due to the internal variability and biases of the different gcms the gcm that produced better outcomes in the past periods is expected to be a reliable tool for performing simulations for future climatic conditions zamani and berndtsson 2018 likewise it should be remembered that the optimal gcm for a specific region may not be the best suitable in other regions because of the different climatic conditions errasti et al 2011 considering the fact the models selected for this study is valid for indian landmass during the summer monsoon season the model may not perform equally if other regions or seasons are considered 5 conclusions the present study aimed to understand the historical and future spatial and temporal variability of indian summer monsoon drought events and its relation to major staple crop production over the region to achieve the aim a standardized precipitation index spi was calculated which is considered as a widely accepted drought index globally the years with spi 1 was regarded as the drought years and the percentage of area 40 covered by the drought event was considered as the severe drought years moreover the relationship between the sea surface temperature and drought events were also examined since gcms are considered to be the principal tool for assessing the future predictions of precipitation patterns the performance of these models was examined using the spatial and temporal statistical measures to simulate the future changeability of summer monsoon droughts over india the analysis was done for historical 1971 2000 and future periods 2071 2100 under four shared socio economic pathways scenarios i e ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 ssp5 8 5 the increasing frequency and the intensification of severe droughts have been observed in recent decades specifically during the post 1960 period these drought events resulted in lowered agricultural production rice and food grains however while some parts of the country such as regions along the west coast of the country konkan and goa coastal karnataka and kerala experienced the declining summer monsoon precipitation anomaly in other parts especially over north western india the positive precipitation anomaly can be witnessed that denotes an out of phase relationship with the rest of the country interestingly the positive ssts over the eastern equatorial extent of the pacific ocean and the western part of the indian ocean was noted to be in an in phase relationship with the whole country encompassing drought scenarios while they showed to be in an out of phase connection with the sst over the western pacific ocean the study reflects the strong possibility of intensification of the all india drought scenario due to rising sst as illustrated by the future simulations of cmip6 gcms the influence of el niño is predicted to be strengthening as the walker circulation weakens and an anomaly in the trend of slp in wpo and epo which again adds to the future occurrences of el niño influenced droughts in india a thorough consultation of the gcms shows that the southern region of the country is evidently going to be affected by severe drought events while the eastern parts are to remain comparatively untouched by such events other parts of the country are also predicted to be suffering varying degrees of drought in future due to the intensification of el niño induced drought events in the country among the three models i e ec earth3 ipsl cm6a lr miroc6 showing the change in precipitation in india the ipsl cm6a lr model provided the best and most reliable results when compared with the observed dataset of the other two the ec earth3 gave quite good results that followed the present trend however it also showed a tendency to overpredict the scenario on the other hand the miroc6 did an underprediction of the precipitation trend therefore as ipsl cm6a lr gave an overall better and consistent result throughout the study we recommend this model is more suitable for the indian condition the present study aid the research of the future climatic conditions of india and act as a base for the prediction of drought conditions in the country this may help to devise adaptation and mitigation plans in such harsh conditions and it can also help to cope with the crop production and food availability issues in this country even though the models suggested the less frequent drought events in the high emission scenarios gupta and jain 2018 and mishra et al 2020 argued that despite the increasing monsoon precipitation the rise in surface air temperature and potential evapotranspiration may reduce the overall water availability which will increase the frequency of hot and dry extremes drought over the coming century therefore a study on drought events associated with temperature and evapotranspiration is recommended in future research credit authorship contribution
