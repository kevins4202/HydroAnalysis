ammonia oxidizing microorganisms aoms in redox fluctuating aquifers to ros via field investigation and in lab verification using transcriptomes metatranscriptome and rt qpcr ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa dominated recharge aquifers with lower ros levels whereas ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and heterotrophic nitrifying aerobic bacteria hnb predominated in discharge areas with higher ros levels similar succession in aom enrichments was found in that the dominant aoms changed from aoa nitrosopumilus to aob nitrosomonas with increasing ros ammonia oxidation and antioxidant capacity differed significantly among three aom isolates exposed to ros ros decreased the amoa gene expression of aoa strain nitrososphaera viennensis plx03 accompanied by inhibited ammonia oxidation capacity by contrast the catalase and superoxide dismutase activities of the aob strain nitrosomonas oligotropha pll12 and hnb strain pseudomonas aeruginosa pll01 increased and the antioxidant genes katg soda ahpc and ahpf were significantly upregulated these results demonstrate that ros exert an important influence on aoms in redox fluctuating aquifers this study improves our understanding of the

from seawater more molecular evidence suggested that aoa and aob dominated ammonia oxidation in diverse ecosystems including seawater mangrove forests paddy soil wetlands and landfill leachate beman et al 2010 duan et al 2021 for example aob nitrosomonas and nitrosospira inhabit mainly soil and freshwater environments while aoa nitrosopumilus nitrosocosmicus and nitrososphaera are generally found in oceans soils and acidic environments abby et al 2020 wang et al 2016 ward et al 2002 in addition as typical heterotrophic nitrification denitrifying species hnb are widely distributed across diverse environments including soils wetlands waters and marine ecosystems duan et al 2021 martikainen 2022 shu et al 2022 tan et al 2021 previous studies have reported that various environmental

ferrous sulfate addition the ros production and community reestablishment cycles were repeated 3 times to simulate the frequent hydrological fluctuations in the in situ environment a blank control group without inoculation was established to measure ros in the absence of microbes another control group included the addition of fe2 before microbial inoculation to eliminate the interference of additional fe3 from ferrous sulfate oxidation fig s3 intracellular ros concentrations were measured fluorescently by utilizing 2 7 dichlorofluorescin diacetate dcfh da with a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan to further explore the potential response mechanisms of aoms to ros three isolated aom strains were exposed to ros at different concentrations detailed procedures

forward and reverse reads with at least 30 bp overlap and less than 25 mismatches were assembled using fast length adjustment of short reads flash magoc and salzberg 2011 the joined sequences were trimmed after assembles using btrim yong 2011 sequences with high qualities were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus by unoise3 edgar 2016 the generated zotu table and geochemical variation table were used for further statistical analysis using vegan and hmisc package in rstudio dixon 2003 jr and dupont 2015 the hydrologic parameters of samples were analyzed by principal component analysis pca with canoco 5 0 software in addition to determine the main factors affecting nh4 n content and the ammonia oxidation process correlation analysis between the main environmental factors and the abundance of amoa transcripts from the 0 and 200 Î¼m ferrous sulfate addition experiments was carried out in r 4 0 2 pathway with significant enrichment in transcriptome analysis using kegg pathways and applied hypergeometric tests to identify pathways with significant enrichment in differentially expressed genes functional variation between the control and ros groups at kegg level 3 were normalized using absolute abundance in r 4 0 2 3 results 3 1 in situ response of aoms to ros in redox fluctuating aquifers a transect from a recharge area with relatively high no3 n do and oxidation reduction potential orp levels to the discharge area with high nh4 n fe2 and ros levels were investigated fig 1 table s8 significant correlations were found between ros levels and redox sensitive parameters including nh4 n no3 n fe2 do and orp in the field investigation table s9 notably oh and h2o2 levels were positively correlated with nh4 n and fe2 levels nh4 n oh r 0 71 fe2 oh r 0 66 fe2 h2o2 r 0 76 p 0 01 fig 1 table s9 these redox conditions of fluctuating do and orp levels in the presence of fe2 were suitable for ros production yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a rna based sequencing of the 16s rrna and amoa transciripts as well as rt qpcr detection of the abundances of active aoms indicated that the aom communities gradually shifted from archaea to bacteria along the groundwater transect fig 1 table s10 the abundance of both arch amoa and bac amoa transcripts were significantly correlated with ros concentrations and redox sensitive parameters related to ros such as fe2 do and orp indicating that aoa dominated the piedmont recharge area whereas aob and hnb were predominant in the discharge area the composition of aom populations also changed along the groundwater flow path bacteria aob nitrosomonas hnb pseudomonas were dominant near the drainage area of plain while archaea aoa nitrosopumilus and nitrososphaera were the main aom populations in the recharge area fig 1b in discharge area the nitrosomonas were more closely associated with nh4 n and h2o2 while the pseudomonas preferred fe2 and oh fig 1b 3 2 aom community succession in the presence of ros at the laboratory scale to verify the population level responses to ros aom enrichment was conducted using samples obtained from the study area the aoa enrichment culture was composed mainly of nitrosopumilus nitrososphaera nitrosocosmicus and nitrosotenuis while nitrosomonas and pseudomonas dominated the enrichment cultures of aob and hnb respectively fig s4 aom communities grew similarly to the control under low ros concentrations fig 2 when the ros concentrations were high all enrichment communities exhibited mortality in the presence of 2 9 Î¼mol l oh the abundances of both active aob and hnb increased steadily while the diversity and abundance of active aoa decreased with the dominant aoa shifting from nitrosopumilus to nitrososphaera fig 2 the succession of aoms was consistent with their in situ spatial distributions along the transect of our study area fig 1 when mixed with other aoms aoa exhibit increased resistance to ros fig 2a metatranscriptome analysis of the mixed enrichment cultures showed that ros affected the succession of aom communities changing the dominant species fig 2b while also causing down regulation of gene expression related to ammonia oxidation and partial up regulation of gene expression related to antioxidants fig 2c the highly differentially expressed genes including soda katg ahpc and ahpf might be necessary for resistance to ros stress 3 3 distinct responses of aom isolates exposed to ros three aom isolates were identified as nitrososphaera viennensis plx03 aoa nitrosomonas oligotropha pll12 aob and pseudomonas aeruginosa pll01 hnb respectively fig s5 the copy numbers of 16s rrna genes for these strains differed significantly and were differentially affected by ros with the nitrososphaera viennensis plx03 being substantially inhibited at middle ros concentration fig 3 a conversely the growth of aob and hnb was not affected by h2o2 and oh concentrations of 0 6 and 1 2 Î¼mol l respectively and was not completely inhibited even at 2 9 Î¼mol l oh fig 3 in contrast to aoa the diversities and abundances of active aob and hnb increased sharply along the flow path in our study nitrosopumilus was more sensitive to ros than other aoa populations the slow decrease in intracellular ros concentration in aoa suggested that nitrososphaera viennensis plx03 lacked the capacity to quickly degrade intracellular ros and that residual ros might increase mortality among aoa populations fig 3 the two control groups demonstrated that iron had little effect on aoms and that ros had no effect on ammonia concentrations fig s6 varying decreases in amoa transcript levels were also observed fig 4 according to the amino acid sequence of translated amoa aoa experienced gene deletion and mutation events following ros exposure fig 4a aob and hnb tended to have more stable amoa transcript levels and sequences and thus stronger resistance to ros exposure the ammonia oxidation capacity of aoms was inhibited by ros to differing extents fig s7 and the decrease in amoa transcript abundance covaried with the change in ammonia oxidation capacity fig s8 two typical antioxidant enzymes cat and sod encoded by the genes soda and katg were used to characterize the antioxidant systems of aoms under ros exposure fig 5 fig s9 despite massive mortality among living cells intracellular ros sod and cat activities and the abundances of soda and katg increased notably the response of the antioxidation system was weaker in aoa than in aob and hnb sod and cat activities in aob and hnb cells peaked at 0 5 h while increases in sod activity and soda gene expression occurred later in aoa cells fig 5 moreover the genes related to antioxidant systems oxidation resistance dna damage and cytomembrane protection in the aoa strain nitrososphaera viennensis plx03 were generally down regulated or absent fig s9 correspondingly the intracellular ros concentrations in aob and hnb increased briefly and then decreased below the detection limit fig 3 at 0 5 h intracellular ros levels were lower in aob and hnb than aoa at 1 h the intracellular ros levels in aob and hnb were negligible 4 discussion 4 1 oxidation resistances mechanisms determined the individual responses of aoms to ros our study indicated different responses of aoa aob and hnb to ros in groundwater a few similar findings of aoa were reported in ocean studies alleman et al 1987 bayer et al 2019 kim et al 2016 tolar et al 2016 previous studies found that nitrosopumilus isolates detoxified h2o2 with Î± keto acids kim et al 2016 or symbiotic bacteria bayer et al 2019 a glyoxylate shunt that produces nadh was also recently found to protect against oxidative stress in the hnb pseudomonas aeruginosa ahn et al 2016 these studies provide useful imformation to improve our understanding about the response of aoms to ros in our study we further demonstrated the different responses of aoms microbial community succession to ros within redox fluctuating aquifers as well as laboratory scale cell growth enzyme activities and amoa gene expression which provides evidences of the different oxidation resistances to ros among aoms it was previously shown that exogenous ros can directly enter cells and cause decrease survival such as growth inhibition belenky et al 2015 ghosh et al 2018 dna damage ishii and sekiguchi 2019 and cell rupture borisov et al 2021 hong et al 2019 as we detected in the aom enrichments and isolates the distinct intracellular responses of aoms to ros in our study could be attributed to the different antioxidant systems including oxidation resistance katg ahpc and soda dna damage repair fhnf dps and cytomembrane protection mepm which further affected the ammonium metabolisms the accumulation of varying levels of intracellular ros led to distinct survival abilities of aom resulting in different responses of their antioxidant systems another explanation for higher tolerance of aob and hnb to ros than that of aoa might be a higher mutation rate in amoa transcripts of aoa when exposed to ros previous studies have shown that nucleic acids are susceptible to ros damage as ros can chemically modify and oxidize macromolecules including rna dna and proteins markkanen 2017 simms and zaher 2016 permanant damaged to genes involved in ammonia oxidation can not be replaced leading to changes in functional gene expression and reduction in ammonium oxidation capacity ishii and sekiguchi 2019 whether this particular mechanism which ros impair aoms by specifically damaging genes involved ammonia oxidation requires further exploration 4 2 ros as another important factor affecting aom communities in redox fluctuating environments previous studies have examined the key variables shaping aom communities in different ecosystems dai et al 2021 jung et al 2022 qin et al 2017 yang et al 2021 according to the niche theory aom community composition is affected by deterministic processes such as selection tripathi et al 2015 while ammonium and oxygen are important environmental factors affecting the distribution of aom communities dai et al 2021 ma et al 2019 qin et al 2017 yang et al 2021 some studies have shown that oxygen is the key environmental factor shaping the distribution of aoms and that aoa dominate anaerobic environments such as the deep ocean jung et al 2022 konneke et al 2005 martens habbena et al 2009 other studies have reported that the concentration of ammonium rather than do plays the most important role in determining aom distribution due to differences in ammonium affinities ma et al 2019 wang et al 2021b it is difficult to determine whether ammonium or do concentration predominantly controls the distribution of aoms in this study in addition to nh4 n and do aoms were found to covary with ros concentrations in microbial community distribution cell growth and even intracellular oxidation resistances which indicated that ros could be a key determining factor shaping aoms in aqufiers to date studies of the ros effects on aoms have been limited to shallow oceans this work improves our understanding of ros effects on aoms in redox fluctuating aquifers recent studies have shown that ros is widespread in surface subsurface environments where water redox values fluctuate and reducing substances can act as electron donors to support o2 reduction and progressive ros generation page et al 2013 yu et al 2022 yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a the widespread and seasonal dominance of aob in redox fluctuating environments diem et al 2013 li et al 2011 pdr et al 2021 zheng et al 2013 and the domination of aoa in stable areas dai et al 2021 wang et al 2017 yang et al 2021 implies that ros might be another important factor affecting the distribution of aoms in turbulent areas including the hyporheic zone coastal alluvial plains wetlands intertidal zones the ocean surface and mangrove swamps bialowiec et al 2012 diem et al 2013 meng et al 2022 page et al 2013 pdr et al 2021 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2016 further studies that focus on the influences of ros on aoms in these ecosystems are warranted 5 conclusion ros was found to affect aom community succession along the in situ groundwater flow path and verified at the laboratory scale the more active responses in oxidation resistance of aob and hnb in cell growth enzyme activiyies as well as oxidation resistances and a greater mutation rate of amoa genes in aoa isolates exposed to ros yeild insights into the mechanism for how ros may affect the distribution of aom communities ros could thus be a major factor for aom community distributions in redox fluctuating aquifers this study expands our understanding of ecological niches of aoms in

wang et al 2021b zhou et al 2021 as a terminal electron acceptor the concentration of oxygen also determines the distributions of aoa aob and hnb to different extents zhang et al 2020c it is difficult for hnb to compete with aoa and aob for niches because hnb cannot use ammonia n as an energy source french et al 2021 liu et al 2023 aoa are reported to vary more widely in their ammonia affinity compared with aob and they often inhabit oligotrophic environments dai et al 2021 martens habbena et al 2009 yang et al 2021 in addition to oxygen and ammonia h2o2 was recently found to affect the growth and distribution of aoa in open ocean surface waters bayer et al 2019 kim et al 2016 qin et al 2017 tolar et al 2016 it was found that nitrosopumilus were sensitive to h2o2 and could detoxify it using Î± keto acids or symbiotic heterotrophic bacteria bayer et al 2019 kim et al 2016 previous studies of ros effects on aoms focused on cultivated aoa or communities in open ocean environments

generally occurs in such ecosystems with aob and hnb dominating turbulent areas within fluctuating redox zones where ros are ubiquitous yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b ros might be an important yet neglected environmental factor affecting the spatiotemporal succession of aoa aob and hnb in redox fluctuating aquifers the responses of aoms to ros and the underlying potential mechanisms have not been investigated in the redox fluctuating zones of aquifers this study aimed to investigate the role of ros in community succession among aoa aob and hnb in redox fluctuating aquifers and to provide

inoculation the ph was adjusted to 7 0 with sodium hydroxide to oxidize fe2 to produce ros based on the fenton reaction tong et al 2016 zhang et al 2020a the concentrations of ferrous iron were set according to the in situ ferrous iron contents in our study and previous studies fig 1 wang et al 2021b the generated ros concentrations were detected within 1 h after adding different concentrations of ferrous sulfate at each sampling time table s3 the cultures were incubated with shaker rocking at 150 r min and 25 c in the dark and samples were collected after 1 h and then every 8 h after ferrous sulfate addition the ros production and community reestablishment cycles were repeated 3 times to simulate the frequent hydrological fluctuations in the in situ environment a blank control group without inoculation was established to measure ros in the absence of microbes another control group included the addition of fe2 before microbial inoculation to eliminate the interference of additional fe3 from ferrous sulfate oxidation fig s3 intracellular ros concentrations were measured fluorescently by utilizing 2 7 dichlorofluorescin diacetate dcfh da with a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan to further explore the potential response mechanisms of aoms to ros three isolated aom strains were exposed to ros at different concentrations detailed procedures

variation table were used for further statistical analysis using vegan and hmisc package in rstudio dixon 2003 jr and dupont 2015 the hydrologic parameters of samples were analyzed by principal component analysis pca with canoco 5 0 software in addition to determine the main factors affecting nh4 n content and the ammonia oxidation process correlation analysis between the main environmental factors and the abundance of amoa transcripts from the 0 and 200 Î¼m ferrous sulfate addition experiments was carried out in r 4 0 2 pathway with significant enrichment in transcriptome analysis using kegg pathways and applied hypergeometric tests to identify pathways with significant enrichment in differentially expressed genes functional variation between the control and ros groups at kegg level 3 were normalized using absolute abundance in r 4 0 2 3 results 3 1 in situ response of aoms to ros in redox fluctuating aquifers a transect from a recharge area with relatively high no3 n do and oxidation reduction potential orp levels to the discharge area with high nh4 n fe2 and ros levels were investigated fig 1 table s8 significant correlations were found between ros levels and redox sensitive parameters including nh4 n no3 n fe2 do and orp in the field investigation table s9 notably oh and h2o2 levels were positively correlated with nh4 n and fe2 levels nh4 n oh r 0 71 fe2 oh r 0 66 fe2 h2o2 r 0 76 p 0 01 fig 1 table s9 these redox conditions of fluctuating do and orp levels in the presence of fe2 were suitable for ros production yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a rna based sequencing of the 16s rrna and amoa transciripts as well as rt qpcr detection of the abundances of active aoms indicated that the aom communities gradually shifted from archaea to bacteria along the groundwater transect fig 1 table s10 the abundance of both arch amoa and bac amoa transcripts were significantly correlated with ros concentrations and redox sensitive parameters related to ros such as fe2 do and orp indicating that aoa dominated the piedmont recharge area whereas aob and hnb were predominant in the discharge area the composition of aom populations also changed along the groundwater flow path bacteria aob nitrosomonas hnb pseudomonas were dominant near the drainage area of plain while archaea aoa nitrosopumilus and nitrososphaera were the main aom populations in the recharge area fig 1b in discharge area the nitrosomonas were more closely associated with nh4 n and h2o2 while the pseudomonas preferred fe2 and oh fig 1b 3 2 aom community succession in the presence of ros at the laboratory scale to verify the population level responses to ros aom enrichment was conducted using samples obtained from the study area the aoa enrichment culture was composed mainly of nitrosopumilus nitrososphaera nitrosocosmicus and nitrosotenuis while nitrosomonas and pseudomonas dominated the enrichment cultures of aob and hnb respectively fig s4 aom communities grew similarly to the control under low ros concentrations fig 2 when the ros concentrations were high all enrichment communities exhibited mortality in the presence of 2 9 Î¼mol l oh the abundances of both active aob and hnb increased steadily while the diversity and abundance of active aoa decreased with the dominant aoa shifting from nitrosopumilus to nitrososphaera fig 2 the succession of aoms was consistent with their in situ spatial distributions along the transect of our study area fig 1 when mixed with other aoms aoa exhibit increased resistance to ros fig 2a metatranscriptome analysis of the mixed enrichment cultures showed that ros affected the succession of aom communities changing the dominant species fig 2b while also causing down regulation of gene expression related to ammonia oxidation and partial up regulation of gene expression related to antioxidants fig 2c the highly differentially expressed genes including soda katg ahpc and ahpf might be necessary for resistance to ros stress 3 3 distinct responses of aom isolates exposed to ros three aom isolates were identified as nitrososphaera viennensis plx03 aoa nitrosomonas oligotropha pll12 aob and pseudomonas aeruginosa pll01 hnb respectively fig s5 the copy numbers of 16s rrna genes for these strains differed significantly and were differentially affected by ros with the nitrososphaera viennensis plx03 being substantially inhibited at middle ros concentration fig 3 a conversely the growth of aob and hnb was not affected by h2o2 and oh concentrations of 0 6 and 1 2 Î¼mol l respectively and was not completely inhibited even at 2 9 Î¼mol l oh fig 3 in contrast to aoa the diversities and abundances of active aob and hnb increased sharply along the flow path in our study nitrosopumilus was more sensitive to ros than other aoa populations the slow decrease in intracellular ros concentration in aoa suggested that nitrososphaera viennensis plx03 lacked the capacity to quickly degrade intracellular ros and that residual ros might increase mortality among aoa populations fig 3 the two control groups demonstrated that iron had little effect on aoms and that ros had no effect on ammonia concentrations fig s6 varying decreases in amoa transcript levels were also observed fig 4 according to the amino acid sequence of translated amoa aoa experienced gene deletion and mutation events following ros exposure fig 4a aob and hnb tended to have more stable amoa transcript levels and sequences and thus stronger resistance to ros exposure the ammonia oxidation capacity of aoms was inhibited by ros to differing extents fig s7 and the decrease in amoa transcript abundance covaried with the change in ammonia oxidation capacity fig s8 two typical antioxidant enzymes cat and sod encoded by the genes soda and katg were used to characterize the antioxidant systems of aoms under ros exposure fig 5 fig s9 despite massive mortality among living cells intracellular ros sod and cat activities and the abundances of soda and katg increased notably the response of the antioxidation system was weaker in aoa than in aob and hnb sod and cat activities in aob and hnb cells peaked at 0 5 h while increases in sod activity and soda gene expression occurred later in aoa cells fig 5 moreover the genes related to antioxidant systems oxidation resistance dna damage and cytomembrane protection in the aoa strain nitrososphaera viennensis plx03 were generally down regulated or absent fig s9 correspondingly the intracellular ros concentrations in aob and hnb increased briefly and then decreased below the detection limit fig 3 at 0 5 h intracellular ros levels were lower in aob and hnb than aoa at 1 h the intracellular ros levels in aob and hnb were negligible 4 discussion 4 1 oxidation resistances mechanisms determined the individual responses of aoms to ros our study indicated different responses of aoa aob and hnb to ros in groundwater a few similar findings of aoa were reported in ocean studies alleman et al 1987 bayer et al 2019 kim et al 2016 tolar et al 2016 previous studies found that nitrosopumilus isolates detoxified h2o2 with Î± keto acids kim et al 2016 or symbiotic bacteria bayer et al 2019 a glyoxylate shunt that produces nadh was also recently found to protect against oxidative stress in the hnb pseudomonas aeruginosa ahn et al 2016 these studies provide useful imformation to improve our understanding about the response of aoms to ros in our study we further demonstrated the different responses of aoms microbial community succession to ros within redox fluctuating aquifers as well as laboratory scale cell growth enzyme activities and amoa gene expression which provides evidences of the different oxidation resistances to ros among aoms it was previously shown that exogenous ros can directly enter cells and cause decrease survival such as growth inhibition belenky et al 2015 ghosh et al 2018 dna damage ishii and sekiguchi 2019 and cell rupture borisov et al 2021 hong et al 2019 as we detected in the aom enrichments and isolates the distinct intracellular responses of aoms to ros in our study could be attributed to the different antioxidant systems including oxidation resistance katg ahpc and soda dna damage repair fhnf dps and cytomembrane protection mepm which further affected the ammonium metabolisms the accumulation of varying levels of intracellular ros led to distinct survival abilities of aom resulting in different responses of their antioxidant systems another explanation for higher tolerance of aob and hnb to ros than that of aoa might be a higher mutation rate in amoa transcripts of aoa when exposed to ros previous studies have shown that nucleic acids are susceptible to ros damage as ros can chemically modify and oxidize macromolecules including rna dna and proteins markkanen 2017 simms and zaher 2016 permanant damaged to genes involved in ammonia oxidation can not be replaced leading to changes in functional gene expression and reduction in ammonium oxidation capacity ishii and sekiguchi 2019 whether this particular mechanism which ros impair aoms by specifically damaging genes involved ammonia oxidation requires further exploration 4 2 ros as another important factor affecting aom communities in redox fluctuating environments previous studies have examined the key variables shaping aom communities in different ecosystems dai et al 2021 jung et al 2022 qin et al 2017 yang et al 2021 according to the niche theory aom community composition is affected by deterministic processes such as selection tripathi et al 2015 while ammonium and oxygen are important environmental factors affecting the distribution of aom communities dai et al 2021 ma et al 2019 qin et al 2017 yang et al 2021 some studies have shown that oxygen is the key environmental factor shaping the distribution of aoms and that aoa dominate anaerobic environments such as the deep ocean jung et al 2022 konneke et al 2005 martens habbena et al 2009 other studies have reported that the concentration of ammonium rather than do plays the most important role in determining aom distribution due to differences in ammonium affinities ma et al 2019 wang et al 2021b it is difficult to determine whether ammonium or do concentration predominantly controls the distribution of aoms in this study in addition to nh4 n and do aoms were found to covary with ros concentrations in microbial community distribution cell growth and even intracellular oxidation resistances which indicated that ros could be a key determining factor shaping aoms in aqufiers to date studies of the ros effects on aoms have been limited to shallow oceans this work improves our understanding of ros effects on aoms in redox fluctuating aquifers recent studies have shown that ros is widespread in surface subsurface environments where water redox values fluctuate and reducing substances can act as electron donors to support o2 reduction and progressive ros generation page et al 2013 yu et al 2022 yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a the widespread and seasonal dominance of aob in redox fluctuating environments diem et al 2013 li et al 2011 pdr et al 2021 zheng et al 2013 and the domination of aoa in stable areas dai et al 2021 wang et al 2017 yang et al 2021 implies that ros might be another important factor affecting the distribution of aoms in turbulent areas including the hyporheic zone coastal alluvial plains wetlands intertidal zones the ocean surface and mangrove swamps bialowiec et al 2012 diem et al 2013 meng et al 2022 page et al 2013 pdr et al 2021 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2016 further studies that focus on the influences of ros on aoms in these ecosystems are warranted 5 conclusion ros was found to affect aom community succession along the in situ groundwater flow path and verified at the laboratory scale the more active responses in oxidation resistance of aob and hnb in cell growth enzyme activiyies as well as oxidation resistances and a greater mutation rate of amoa genes in aoa isolates exposed to ros yeild insights into the mechanism for how ros may affect the distribution of aom communities ros could thus be a major factor for aom community distributions in redox fluctuating aquifers this study expands our understanding of ecological niches of aoms in

application of antibiotics in the medical industry for more than seventy years has become a growing public health problem due to the generation of emerging antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes hao et al 2015 reardon 2015 zhang et al 2015 chloramphenicol cap a halogen containing antibiotic has been applied extensively since 1949 and is a suspected carcinogen min et al 2021 cap contains a nitro

previous studies demonstrated that fes and fes2 produced by sulfidation increase the hydrophobicity of s zvi and s zvi with fes2 as the dominant sulfur speciation is more hydrophobic and exhibits better reactivity to hydrophobic contaminants than fes dominated species xu et al 2020 2021 although sulfidation inhibits the hydrophilic denitration of cap by nzvi cao et al 2020 the sulfidation effects on the cap degradation by micron sized zvi especially the role of fes and fes2 in the reduction of hydrophilic no2 and hydrophobic cl groups remains unclear therefore it is necessary to systematically investigate cap s degradation pathway and mechanism by s zvi synthesized via stable natural fes x minerals and amorphous fes x precursors herein fes x zvi bm hybrid materials were prepared via ball milling micron zvi with crystalline iron ii sulfide or pyrite minerals and fes x zvi samples were fabricated via aqueous decoration of zvi by amorphous fes or fes2 precursors

characterization results as shown in fig 1 a during the synthesis of fes x zvi bm fes x and zvi powders first experienced the breaking phase with shear and brittle fracture followed by the cold welding and ductile flattening to form the solid solution alloys fes x zvi samples fes zvi and fes2 zvi were prepared by the deposition and decoration of generated fes x aggregates fig 1b sem eds characterization figs 1c f exhibited that both fine fesbm and fes2 bm particles independently existed on zvi surface in their physical mixtures fes x bm zvibm while sulfur uniformly distributed on fes x zvi bm surface and fes2 zvi bm had the rougher surface than fes zvi bm many nfes x particles bound to zvi surface can be observed from figs 1g h confirming the proposed sulfidation mechanism of fes x zvi via aqueous coprecipitation xrd patterns fig 1i showed that only the diffraction peaks of fe0 were detected in fes x zvi bm and fes x zvi samples s fe 0 112 and the absence of iron sulfides peak might be due to its low content or poor crystallinity at a higher s fe ratio s fe 0 224 xrd detected clear fes2 signals in fes2 bm zvibm but only a limited signal in fes2 zvi bm fig s1 high energy cold plastic deformation might induce microstrains and lattice defects in fes x and zvi particles and sulfur was embedded in the fe fe lattice of fe0 resulting in less exposure of fes x crystal planes to be undetected the diffraction peak intensity of fes x zvi bm samples was significantly greater than that of fes x zvi perhaps because the deposited nfes x particles acted as a capping material on fe0 crystal planes of fes x zvi xps analysis exhibited that the surface of s zvi samples was composed of fe ii fe iii o and fe ii fe iii s compounds fig s2 and fes x zvi bm surface had less sulfur content than fes x zvi due to the incorporation of sulfur into the bulk of fes x zvi bm fig 1j besides fes zvi and fes2 zvi surface had more low valent sulfur species s2 s2 2 and s0 than fes x zvi bm samples 3 2 comparison of cap degradation by s zvi samples 3 2 1 effect of s fe molar ratio as shown in fig 2 a and fig s3 zvibm fesbm and fes2 bm were only able to remove 4 2 1 5 and 0 2 of cap under oxic conditions respectively fesbm zvibm and fes2 bm zvibm could remove 9 4 16 1 and 6 0 33 0 respectively with the increase of s fe molar ratio or fes x bm content fes2 bm zvibm performed better cap degradation except for s fe 0 224 while fesbm zvibm exhibited a limited increase and was inferior to fes2 bm zvibm both fes zvi bm and fes2 zvi bm demonstrated better cap degradation than zvibm and fes x bm zvibm samples due to the effective bulk co doping and surface activation via the interaction of fe0 and fes x with the increase in s fe molar ratio increasing fes had little effect on cap removal of fes zvi bm and increasing fes2 slightly improved the cap removal capabilities of fes2 zvi bm at s fe 0 224 theoretical fe0 wt 74 0 however as the s fe molar ratio further increased to 0 448 cap removal of fes x zvi bm decreased dramatically due to low fe0 content as the electron donor theoretical fe0 wt 58 7 as shown in figs s4 5 the kinetics of cap removal by fes x zvi bm was divided into rapid 0 30 min and slow 30 120 min stages ascribing to the accumulation of iron hydro oxides and a two stage pseudo first order kinetics model text s2 was used to describe the process and obtain the rate constant at the rapid stage the fes x zvi bm rate constant varied overall in a downward parabolic pattern with s fe molar ratios while rate constants decreased linearly with the increase of sulfur content at the slow stage fes and fes2 were not directly involved in cap degradation as electron donors but could be oxidized by oxygen to produce iron hydro oxides causing the rate retardation therefore more fes x was not conducive to sustainable cap degradation by fes x zvi bm under oxic conditions although the specific surface area of zvibm 1 55 m2 g 1 was much larger than that of zvi 0 90 m2 g 1 zvi alone degraded 8 4 cap and exhibited better performance than zvibm during zvibm preparation the exposed fe0 produced by high energy ball milling was oxidized by residual o2 to form oxides hindering electron transfer nano nfes and nfes2 particles prepared by aqueous precipitation could remove 2 5 and 1 9 of cap respectively slightly superior to fesbm and fes2 bm due to more reactive surfaces fes zvi and fes2 zvi prepared via the decoration of nfes or nfes2 exhibited better cap removal than zvi and nfes x samples fes zvi had better performance than fes2 zvi at different s fe molar ratios except for s fe 0 112 and the reactivity of fes x zvi was inferior to fes x zvi bm samples the entire degradation behavior of cap by fes x zvi could be well described with pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 97 with a rate constant significantly lower than that of fes x zvi bm at 0 30 min but larger at 30 120 min especially at s fe 0 56 therefore fes x zvi bm with low sulfur content and fes x zvi with high sulfur content were the optimal choices for the continuous degradation of cap 3 2 2 effect of initial ph as shown in fig 3 and fig s6 the cap degradation by fes x zvi bm was superior to fes x zvi samples under different initial ph ph0 and fes x zvi bm rapidly reached the equilibrium stage at low ph0 fes2 zvi bm had better cap degradation than fes zvi bm and the fes2 zvi performance was also better than fes zvi except at ph0 3 cap removal of fes prepared s zvi slightly decreased with the increase of ph0 while fes2 prepared s zvi showed a parabolic variation with ph0 and reached optimal degradation at ph0 5 6 the effect of ph on cap removal by s zvi was attributed to the following aspects i ph altered the cap species distribution and the s zvi surface charge controlling their attractive or repulsive electrostatic force it was documented that the isoelectric point of s zvi was around 6 tang et al 2016 wu et al 2018 liang et al 2020 as shown in fig s7 cap is the neutral microspecies at ph 7 and it is transformed into negatively charged molecules via amide deprotonation when ph is 7 9 increasing ph from 3 to 9 increases the negative charge of cap and the electrostatic attraction between cap species and zvi s zvi is transformed to electrostatic repulsion inhibiting their direct contact ii cap deprotonation increased the energy of lumo e lumo to decrease its oxidizability and altered the homo group to inhibit the acquisition of protons h by nitro table s1 iii low ph could provide more h for cap degradation iv ph altered s zvi surface activity and fe ii species distribution probably increasing the competitive depletion of active sites by o2 and thus promoting the accumulation of iron oxyhydr oxide films the do changed in line with the typical sag curves consisting of oxygen depletion and reaeration the variation of the measured redox potential was analogous to the change of do fig s6 during cap degradation ph increased first and then decreased to an equilibrium stage and the final ph in cap degradation by fes x zvi bm increased with ph0 the variation of do ph and eh parameters for fes x zvi bm samples was significantly greater than for fes zvi samples and their correlation analysis will be discussed in detail below 3 2 3 effect of o2 as shown in fig 4 a zvi and s zvi samples degraded cap sustainably without any equilibrium stage in the absence of o2 and exhibited better reactivity than under oxic conditions under o2 free conditions cap removal of s zvi samples was in the order of fes2 zvi bm fes zvi bm fes2 zvi fes zvi in agreement with the results in oxic conditions o2 inhibited cap degradation probably due to three aspects i o2 competed with cap to deplete fe0 and h reducing the available active sites for cap removal see section 3 3 ii o2 accelerated the rapid formation and accumulation of iron oxyhydr oxides on zvi and s zvi surfaces hindering electron transfer and resulting in the retarded cap degradation as shown in figs s8a d under oxic conditions fe0 was consumed severely to produce lepidocrocite magnetite and goethite while the peak intensity of fe0 slightly decreased and fe3o4 was mainly detected under anoxic conditions o2 accelerated the transformation of fe3o4 to Î³ feooh iii o2 oxidized low valent sulfur to so4 2 fig s9 resulting in the dissolution loss of sulfur fig 2j and the failure of sulfidation enhancement iv reductive species surface associated fe ii fe0 and fes x of s zvi might activate o2 to produce reactive oxidative species e g h2o2 and oh cheng et al 2020 xiu et al 2021 which could reoxidize the degradation products back to cap after adding h2o2 into the solution wherein cap was completely degraded by fes2 zvi bm under anoxic conditions 14 6 mg l of cap was regenerated under oxic conditions ph of fes x zvi bm samples increased from 5 to 10 followed by a rapid decrease to about 6 3 while their ph slightly decreased after increasing to 8 9 in anoxic conditions under anoxic conditions cap oxidized fe0 to produce fe ii and oh the accumulation of fe ii induced partial hydrolysis k sp fe oh 2 4 10 16 resulting in a slight ph decrease in the presence of o2 the generated fe ii was further oxidized by o2 to fe iii which underwent hydrolysis even at low concentrations k sp fe oh 3 4 10 38 to produce massive quantities of h at the starting points eh levels were lower in anoxic than in oxic conditions and gradually decreased and reached a lower equilibrium due to the continuous degradation of oxidative cap and the production of reductive fe ii hence cap degradation by zvi or s zvi was determined by their reducibility and the late slow rise of eh under oxic conditions was caused by reaeration 3 2 4 the role of sulfidation and sulfur species fes and fes2 as mentioned above under oxic and anoxic conditions fes x zvi bm and fes x zvi exhibited better cap removal efficiency than zvi and maintained excellent performance at different ph0 as shown in fig 5 a sulfidation increased the specific surface areas exposing more active sites for cap adsorption and degradation besides sulfidation reduced the electrochemical impedance of s zvi and accelerated the electron transfer fig 5b after normalization of rate constants by specific surface area fig s10a fes zvi exhibited better cap degradation than fes2 zvi probably due to its lower impedance although the fes x zvi bm samples impedance was larger than that of fes x zvi the former normalized rate constant remained superior to the latter attributed to the following reasons i fes x of fes x zvi samples were mainly decorated on the surface of fe0 while fes x of fes x zvi bm could form the alloy like substance with fe0 and increase the sulfur induced zones ii mechanical ball milling exposed more fe0 sites to react with cap in addition to increasing specific surface area and accelerating electron transfer fes x promoted the cap degradation by zvi ascribed to the following aspects i fes x bm had a larger potential than zvibm fig s10b thus their mixtures could form the micro galvanic cell with zvibm as the anode and fes x bm as the cathode to facilitate the anodic corrosion of fe0 erfanian et al 2022 ii fine fes x particles adhered to the zvi surface might cause acidification in local regions at the interface iii oxidative sulfur species could induce pitting corrosion and activate reductive zvi surface to generate fes x as shown in fig 5c zhang et al 2018 all possible roles of sulfidation are proposed in fig 5d fes2 bm exhibited better promotion on the degradation of cap by zvibm than fesbm fig 2a for the following reasons i the larger potential difference between fes2 bm and zvibm was beneficial to the formation of galvanic cells fig s10b ii surface species of fes2 bm including fe iii s i and sulfur vacancies produced by mechanical ball milling li et al 2022c could oxidize fe0 and be in favor of surface activation ling et al 2021 iii the oxidation dissolution of fes2 bm by oxygen could release more protons than fesbm for accelerating cap removal evangelou and zhang 1995 moreover fes2 was more resistant to h corrosion than fes figs 5c and s11 so s zvi with fes2 as the dominant sulfur species is more suitable for acidic conditions 3 3 the change of chemical parameters ph do eh and cap 3 3 1 correlation analysis of parameters as shown in figs s3 6 and fig 4 under oxic conditions changes in do eh and ph reflect the balance of depletion and replenishment processes and their maximum variations mainly occurred within the first 15 min the correlation of the maximum changes of parameters capmax domax phmax ehmax was analyzed figs s12 13 fes2 zvi bm removed more cap than fes zvi bm however the former domax phmax and ehmax were slightly lower than the latter domax was correlated with phmax due to o2 depletion accompanied by h consumption or oh production table s2 eh indicated the redox status of the working solution and eh decreased with the depletion of do and increased with reaeration capmax linearly correlated with domax fig 6 a as shown in fig 4a zvi and s zvi exhibited better cap degradation under anoxic than oxic conditions therefore o2 was mainly involved in cap removal as a competitor and domax indicated the reduction capacity of materials as illustrated in fig 6a the capmax domax molar ratio of fes zvi bm samples was 0 35 and was less than the fes2 zvi bm samples 0 58 revealing that more fes zvi bm electrons were consumed by o2 and fes zvi bm had the less electron utilization than fes2 zvi bm similarly the electron utilization efficiency of fes2 zvi was larger than that of fes zvi and both were superior to fes x zvi bm samples the domax of nfes and fesbm was larger than that of nfes2 and fes2 bm respectively confirming that fes was more reactive than fes2 for o2 depletion fig 6a therefore fes2 prepared s zvi was more resistant to oxygen oxidation than fes prepared s zvi resulting in better electron utilization the low electron utilization efficiency of fes x zvi bm probably stemmed from the fact that many fe0 sites exposed via ball milling participated in o2 reduction at the same time the fe0 core of fes x zvi samples was covered by the fes x layer which hindered the o2 diffusion to the fe0 core 3 3 2 competitive dynamics model between cap and o2 a competitive dynamics model between cap and aqueous o2 o2 aq for consuming active sites was constructed to assess the competitive reaction rates of cap and o2 the consumed o2 aq can be supplemented and reaerated by the equilibration process with atmospheric oxygen o2 atm schematically the competitive dynamics model is represented as 1 c a p s k c a p p r o d u c t s 2 o 2 a q s k o 2 p r o d u c t s 3 o 2 a t m k o 2 r a o 2 a q where s represents active surface sites reactions eq 1 2 depict the competitive reactions of cap and o2 aq with active sites and reaction eq 3 represents reaeration ordinary differential equations corresponding to eqs 1 3 are written as 4 d cap d t k cap cap s 5 d o 2 a q d t k o 2 o 2 a q s k o 2 r a o 2 a q s a t o 2 a q 6 d s d t k c a p c a p s k o 2 o 2 a q s where k c a p k o 2 and k o 2 r a are rate constants of cap degradation o2 aq depletion and reaeration respectively the brackets represent species concentration mmol l 1 and o 2 aq sat is the o2 aq saturation concentration considering all experiments were conducted in the same reactor with the same temperature and mixing rates we treated k o 2 ra as a global parameter and the remaining k cap k o 2 and initial active sites s0 were local parameters all parameters were obtained using global Ï2 minimization fitting 3 3 3 competitive reaction mechanism between cap and o2 as shown in fig 6b the o2 reduction rate by s zvi was 10 times faster compared to cap according to the frontier molecular orbital theory the lumo acts as an electron acceptor and its smaller e lumo indicates stronger oxidizability and electrophilicity lewis acid fassihi et al 2020 the homo acts as an electron donor and a larger e homo represents stronger reducibility and nucleophilicity lewis base dft calculations exhibited that the e lumo of o2 4 986 ev was less than cap 2 856 ev and its e homo 6 925 ev was larger than that of cap 7 535 ev resulting in the stronger oxidizability and protophilicity of o2 as shown in fig s12 and table s2 o2 was the main contributor species to ph and eh changes therefore o2 consumed more electrons and protons and its reaction rate was larger than the cap degradation rate under anoxic conditions fig s14a the competitive reaction rate of cap with o2 as a function of initial ph was also evaluated as shown in fig s15 the degradation rate of cap decreased with increasing ph which was consistent with a previous study that weak acidic conditions provided protons to favor cap degradation liu et al 2018 the o2 aq depletion rate changed parabolically with initial ph fig 6c with the fastest rate obtained under weakly acidic conditions ph 4 6 the o2 aq depletion rate normalized by specific surface areas of fes x zvi bm was larger than that of fes x zvi fig s14b because more fe0 was exposed as electron donors furthermore low valent sulfur and fe ii species were also used as electron donors for o2 consumption dissolved fe ii species were mainly present as fe2 and feso4 aq in na2so4 solution at ph 3 8 fig s16a and part of mackinawite was dissolved to produce fe2 fehs feso4 aq and h2s aq at ph 7 figs s16c d the distribution of dissolved fe iii generated from fe ii species oxidation is shown in figs s16b the redox potential of fe ii and fe iii species decreased linearly with ph increase and their reducing ability was in the order of fe2 feso4 aq feoh fe oh 2 aq fehs figs s17a d a previous study demonstrated that the apparent oxidation rate of fe oh 2 aq was larger than that of feoh and fe2 santana casiano et al 2005 reasonable speculation yielded that fehs was the most important fe ii contribution species to o2 aq depletion by s zvi at ph 5 6 under alkaline conditions the o2 reduction rate depended on the dissolved fe ii and sulfur species the surface activity of fe0 and fes solids and the o2 inward diffusion it is worth noting that the low valent sulfur in fehs and mackinawite was oxidized before fe ii oxidation in aqueous solutions due to the lower oxidation potential of fe ii so4 2 compared to fe iii so4 2 fig s17 also reported in the previous study rickard and luther 2007 the high o2 aq consumption rate and low cap degradation rate under alkaline conditions meant that electrons were not efficiently utilized and the electron utilization efficiency decreased with the ph increase except for fes2 zvi fig 6d 3 4 product analysis and mechanism of cap degradation 3 4 1 products distribution and degradation pathway the corresponding degradation products of cap by s zvi samples were determined by hplc ms figs s18a e the cap nitro reduction only produced nitroso products nitroso cap under oxic conditions under anoxic conditions the main products of nitro cap degradation by fes x zvi bm were identified as nitroso cap azoxy azoxy cap aromatic amine amine cap and monodechlorination amine cap cl products as shown in fig 7 a azoxy cap was first identified in the chemical reduction of cap and might be produced through a condensation reaction between the oxidized nitroso group of nitroso cap and the reduced hydroxylamine group of hydroxylamine intermediates hydroxylamine cap as exhibited in fig 7a fes x zvi reduced cap to produce nitroso cap azoxy cap and amine cap but no dechlorination in the absence of o2 in contrast the removal of cap by zvi only produced nitroso cap therefore fes x zvi bm degraded more cap and its intermediates than fes x zvi and zvi as exhibited in fig s19 with the degradation of cap by fes x zvi bm nitroso cap azoxy cap and amine cap rapidly accumulated first and then decreased azoxy cap could be successfully reduced to azo intermediates hydrazo intermediates and amine cap fig s18f similar to the reduction of azoxy benzenes nishiyama et al 2022 monodechlorination exhibited the slow and rapid accumulation stages and the fast increase of amine cap cl was along with the rapid decrease of amine cap therefore amine cap cl was mainly produced from the dechlorination of amine cap and its slow stage was determined by the slowly simultaneous dechlorination and hydroxylamine reduction of hydroxylamine cap because its lumo was located at chlorine groups as the electron acceptor although cts simulation showed that cap could be further completely dechlorinated by hydrogenolysis or nucleophilic substitutions and occurred amide hydrolysis fig 7a either the limitation of available electrons and protons or the short term reaction only caused cap monodechlorination by fes x zvi bm different reduction capacities of s zvi and zvi resulted in a different distribution of degradation products and iron sulfide species did not alter the proposed transformation pathways of cap fig 7a 3 4 2 chain decay multispecies model of cap degradation based on the assumption of the pseudo first order reaction and the fractionation into different degradation pathways previously reported arnold and roberts 2000 metzgen et al 2022 a modified chain decay multispecies model was used to describe the degradation of cap and its products eqs 7 11 7 d cap d t k cap cap 8 d nitroso d t k nitroso nitroso f cap to nitroso k cap cap d azoxy d t k azoxy azoxy 0 5 f cap to azoxy k cap cap 9 0 5 f nitroso to azoxy k nitroso nitroso 10 d amine d t k amine amine 1 f cap to nitroso f cap to azoxy k cap cap 1 f nitroso to azoxy k nitroso nitroso 2 k azoxy azoxy 11 d monodechlorination d t k amine amine where k cap k nitroso k azoxy and k amine are pseudo first order degradation rates of cap and its nitroso azoxy and amine products respectively and f cap to nitroso f cap to azoxy f nitroso to azoxy are molar transfer coefficients for the degradation steps of cap to nitroso cap cap to azoxy cap and nitroso cap to azoxy cap respectively the molar concentrations of nitroso cap azoxy cap amine cap and amine cap cl were estimated via the ratio of the hplc peak area to its hplc response coefficient roughly calculated as described in the text s3 to evaluate rate constants and molar transfer coefficients eqs 7 11 were solved in a consecutive fit algorithm starting with an unweighted fit of cap profiles k cap and then continuing with the fit of nitroso cap profiles k nitroso cap f cap to nitroso followed successively by fitting profiles of azoxy cap k nitroso cap f cap to azoxy f nitroso to azoxy and amine cap k amine cap as shown in fig s20a if all degraded cap was transformed to nitroso cap namely f cap to nitroso 1 the model computed nitroso cap was considerably more than the experimental data indicating that part of cap was degraded to other products if the production of azoxy cap was only from nitroso cap f cap to azoxy 0 the fitting results showed that although the degraded nitroso cap was all converted to azoxy cap the calculated nitroso cap was still significantly less than the experimental data fig s20b therefore the direct degradation of cap to generate azoxy cap cannot be neglected as exhibited in fig 8 a e the chain decay multispecies model well depicted the degradation of cap and its products the reduction rate of cap was better than that of nitroso cap and both were slightly lower than that of azoxy cap except for fes zvi bm which might be attributed to the stronger protophilicity of azoxy cap fig s21 the dechlorination rate of amine cap was an order of magnitude lower than the reduction rates of cap nitroso cap and azoxy cap probably because amine cap had a higher e lumo fig 7b resulting in the smaller oxidizability and degradation rate e lumo of amine cap cl was only 0 35 ev and its lumo as an electron acceptor was located on the benzene ring hindering further dechlorination of amine cap cl model calculations exhibited that f cap to nitroso f cap to azoxy f cap to amine and f nitroso to azoxy of fes x zvi bm samples were 45 2 12 5 27 5 8 7 27 3 3 8 and 100 fig 7a and fig s22 respectively indicating that the condensation routine with azoxy cap as vital intermediates was the main pathway for the nitroso reduction to the amine group besides f cap to azoxy of fes x zvi and zvi was 3 2 0 4 and 0 respectively and their corresponding f cap to amine were 45 3 11 3 and 25 4 1 7 fig s22 therefore multiple pathways lead to cap degradation to produce amine cap fig s23 without nitroso cap as an intermediate prerequisite nitroso cap could not be directly degraded to amine cap by hydrogenolysis of hydroxylamine cap possibly because lumo of hydroxylamine cap was located in chlorine rather than hydroxylamine group fig 7b fes x zvi bm exhibited a more rapid transformation of cap and its degradation products than fes x zvi and s zvi prepared by fes2 displayed superior performance to that fabricated by fes 3 4 3 the role of atomic hydrogen in nitro reduction and dechlorination there were two routes for cap to obtain electrons from s zvi one was the direct electron transfer det from s zvi to the electrophilic site of cap and the proton dissociated no bonds to produce water the other was that protons accepted electrons to form atomic hydrogen h then completed cap s nitro reduction and dechlorination via hydrogenolysis adequate tba was applied as the scavenger for h 1 0 11 5 105 m 1 s 1 lymar and schwarz 2012 to investigate the contribution of h and det to the reductive transformation of cap and its degradation products as shown in fig 8f s22 and s24 tba inhibited cap degradation and altered the molar transfer fraction of cap multipath degradation tba restrained nitro and nitroso reduction of cap but had little effect on azoxy cap and 38 of cap degraded by zvibm was attributed to h sulfidation promoted the det contribution to cap and nitroso cap degradation and fes x zvi bm promoted it less than fes x zvi probably due to the former fe0 exposure with more h production tba significantly inhibited the monodechlorination of amine cap by fes x zvi bm and h accounted for 57 65 thus amine cap was mainly dechlorinated by hydrogenolysis h contribution to the step to step nitro reduction and monodechlorination was in the order amine cap nitroso cap cap azoxy cap h contribution of fes2 prepared s zvi was lower than fes prepared because the more hydrophobic fes2 had a weaker h2o affinity and a lower h surface coverage than fes xu et al 2020 3 4 4 toxicity assessment of cap and its reduction products the ecotoxicity of cap and degradation intermediates was estimated via quantitative structure activity relationships using the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t and is exhibited in figs s25a d the acute toxicity obtained from 96 h fathead minnow showed a considerable increase from toxic cap to more toxic nitroso cap and azoxy cap after nitro reduction and dechlorination amine cap and amine cap cl became less toxic under ideal conditions the complete dechlorination of cap and its amide hydrolysis could produce less toxic terminal products furthermore nitro reduction of cap reduced the bioaccumulation capability while its dechlorination increased bioaccumulation fig s25b cap is a developmental toxicant that produces harmful effects on immature offspring but its degradation products developmental toxicity is low fig s25c fig s25d revealed that nitro cap amine cap and amine cap cl could be assessed as mutagenic positive the comprehensive evaluation suggests that the nitro reduction of cap produced bio toxic intermediates and the complete dechlorination of cap could effectively reduce the bio toxicity therefore to eliminate the potential risk of cap and its products in the ecosystem excessive zvi or s zvi particles should be applied to accelerate the transformation of toxic nitroso and azoxy products and decrease their retention time 4 conclusion this study systematically investigated the degradation pathway and mechanism of cap by s zvi synthesized via natural fes x minerals and s zvi prepared via amorphous fes or fes2 precursors surface morphology material composition physicochemical properties and cap degradation performance of fes x zvi bm and fes x zvi were comprehensively compared sulfidation promoted iron corrosion and accelerated electron transfer to enhance cap degradation via coupling multiple strategies fes x zvi bm exhibited better cap removal than fes x zvi due to larger specific surface areas and more sulfur enhanced zones under oxic conditions o2 had a faster electron consumption rate than cap ascribed to its lower e lumo and higher proton affinity and fes x zvi exhibited better electron utilization than fes x zvi bm due to less fe0 exposure dft calculation and output of the chain decay multispecies model indicated that fes x zvi bm degraded cap to produce nitroso cap amine cap azoxy cap and amine cap cl under anoxic conditions via multi pathways at the same time fes x zvi did not initiate the monodechlorination of cap a new transformation pathway was proposed that azoxy cap intermediates mediated the reduction of nitroso cap to amine cap and their e lumo determined the competitive reaction rate of cap and its degradation products sulfidation promoted the det contribution to cap and nitroso cap degradation and fes x zvi bm exhibited less improvement of det contribution but a more rapid transformation of cap and its products than fes x zvi there are two aspects to reducing the potential ecotoxicity during the reductive degradation of cap one is that excessive s zvi particles are applied to accelerate the rapid transformation of toxic nitroso and azoxy products to decrease their retention time the other is selectively reductive dechlorination without nitro reduction to achieve efficient cap detoxification and high electron utilization this study provides new perspectives on the optimized synthesis of s zvi and the selective degradation of

14971,crystalline iron sulfide fes x i e fes or fes2 minerals as sulfur sources were used to prepare the mechanochemically sulfidated microscale zero valent iron fes x zvi bm metastable fes and fes2 precursors were generated via aqueous coprecipitation and applied to fabricate fes x zvi samples fes x zvi bm and fes x zvi exhibited better chloramphenicol cap degradation than zvi due to the increase in specific surface areas the decrease of electrochemical impedance the formation of galvanic cells and sulfur induced pitting and local acidity fes x zvi bm had better cap removal capacity than fes x zvi under different s fe molar ratios initial ph and oxygen conditions at the same time fes x zvi showed better electron utilization under oxic conditions related to their fe0 and sulfur spatial distribution nitro reduction and dechlorination of cap by fes x zvi bm produced nitroso azoxy amine and monodechlorination products while dechlorination was not involved in the degradation process of cap by fes x zvi a new transformation pathway of nitroso cap to amine cap mediated by azoxy products is proposed via coupling a chain decay multispecies model and dft calculations the larger competitive reaction rates among o2 cap and its degradation products was determined by their lower lumo energy the contribution of direct electron transfer to nitro reduction was greater than that of atomic hydrogen but the opposite was true for dechlorination fes x zvi had a larger det contribution than fes x zvi bm and fes2 promoted the det contribution better than fes toxicity

application of antibiotics in the medical industry for more than seventy years has become a growing public health problem due to the generation of emerging antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes hao

group and two chlorine halogens and its nitro reduction and dehalogenation enable to eliminate the ecotoxicity liang et al 2013 liu et al 2018 min et al 2021 the reduction of cap yields nitroso aromatic amine and dechlorination products liang et al 2013 however the detailed transformation pathway of these products remains unclear o2 as an electron acceptor under oxic conditions may deplete the electron capacity of cap degradation and the cpa degradation products also consume electrons as a competitor however it is unknown what determines the extent of competitive reactions among cap its degradation products and o2 zero valent iron zvi can effectively remove heavy metals li et al 2022a metalloids azo dyes nitroaromatics and halogenated organics via adsorption and reduction guan et al

application liu et al 2015 recently sulfidated zvi s zvi has attracted widespread attention due to the significantly improved reactivity selectivity and long term performance xu et al 2019 2021 garcia et al 2021 microscale zvi is more readily available less expensive and environmentally friendly than nanoscale zvi nzvi there are two main methods for the sulfidation of microscale zvi mechanochemical ball milling and aqueous chemical coprecipitation gu et al 2017 li et al 2018 iron sulfide minerals including pyrrhotite mackinawite and pyrite are widely present in the crust or tailings and are more applicable as sulfur sources for ball milling than flammable sulfur powders li et al 2022b mechanochemical treatment can transform the crystalline natural sulfide minerals into metastable amorphous iron sulfides fes x li et al 2022b the chemical coprecipitation method using na2s as a sulfur source with or without supplementary extra iron salts transforms the amorphous fes x to the crystalline form dai et al 2022b compared with the stable crystalline phases their metastable amorphous counterparts have stronger reducibility as reductants but poorer stability as catalysts garibello et al 2022 previous studies demonstrated that fes and fes2 produced by sulfidation increase the hydrophobicity of s zvi and s zvi with fes2 as the dominant sulfur speciation is more hydrophobic and exhibits better reactivity to hydrophobic contaminants than fes dominated species xu et al 2020 2021 although sulfidation inhibits the hydrophilic denitration of cap by nzvi cao et al 2020 the sulfidation effects on the cap degradation by micron sized zvi especially the role of fes and fes2 in the reduction of hydrophilic no2 and hydrophobic cl groups remains unclear therefore it is necessary to systematically investigate cap s degradation pathway and mechanism by s zvi synthesized via stable natural fes x minerals and amorphous fes x precursors herein fes x zvi bm hybrid materials were prepared via ball milling micron zvi with crystalline iron ii sulfide or pyrite minerals and fes x zvi samples were fabricated via aqueous decoration of zvi by amorphous fes or fes2 precursors consequently this work aims to i compare the physicochemical properties and performance of fes x zvi bm and fes x zvi samples ii explore the role of sulfidation and sulfur speciation fes and fes2 in the degradation of cap by s zvi iii clarify the competitive reactions between cap and o2 under oxic conditions and iv elucidate the transformation pathway of cap and its degradation products and to quantify their competitive reaction rates under anoxic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals chemicals applied in this study are presented in the text s1 of the supplemental materials 2 2 preparation of fes x zvi bm and fes x zvi samples fes zvi bm and fes2 zvi bm were prepared by mechanically milling the powder mixtures of microscale zvi with milli sized iron ii sulfide and pyrite at desired s fe molar ratios 0 014 0 448 with a high energy planetary ball mill fritsch planetary micro mill pulverisette 7 premium line preparation details are available in text s1 zvi iron ii sulfide and pyrite were used to prepare zvibm fesbm and fes2 bm as the control experiments using the same milling method fesbm zvibm and fes2 bm zvibm were the physically mixed binary mixtures of zvibm with fesbm and fes2 bm respectively fes zvi and fes2 zvi were synthesized via the chemical coprecipitation of fe ii with monosulfide s2 and polysulfide mixture s x 2 in deoxygenated aqueous solutions as previously reported dai et al 2022a the polysulfide mixture was prepared via the anoxic reaction of na2s with s0 s2 s0 1 1 nano fes and fes2 particles nfes x were obtained by equimolar reactions of feso4 with s2 and polysulfide mixture respectively nano fes2 as a precursor transformed to pyrite after thermal treatment luther 1991 2 3 batch experiments unless otherwise specified s zvi samples with s fe 0 112 were selected for the following experiments the experiments containing 2 mm na2so4 as the electrolyte without ph adjustment were performed open to air at a constant temperature 25 c in 500 ml glass beakers cap degradation was initiated by adding 0 1 g of materials into a 40 mg l 1 cap solution and stirred mechanically at 300 rpm at specific intervals liquid samples were collected to further analysis and the chemical parameters including dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potentials eh and ph were recorded simultaneously diluted h2so4 and naoh solutions were applied to adjust the initial ph to investigate the influence of the initial ph 3 9 to explore the effect of o2 cap degradation was also conducted in an anaerobic glove box to investigate the competitive reactions between cap and its degradation products the experiment with 0 4 g l 1 materials and 10 mg l 1 cap was performed under anoxic conditions tba 1 m was added to elucidate the role of atomic hydrogen and direct electron transfer in cap degradation all experiments were conducted at least twice 2 4 analytical methods the cap quantification and the degradation products identification were performed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc thermo scientific ultimate 3000 and high resolution q tof mass spectrometry coupled with a liquid chromatography system hplc ms the possible degradation pathway of cap was simulated by chemical transformation simulator cts a web based software tool developed by the united states environmental protection agency do eh and ph were recorded using commercial combination electrodes inesa scientific instrument co ltd china eh was adjusted to the standard hydrogen electrode she scale by adding 193 5 mv the physicochemical properties of solid samples were comprehensively characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds x ray diffractometer xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscope xps specific surface areas were measured using brunauere emmette teller bet methods the open circuit potential ocp and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were analyzed with an electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua instrument china to evaluate the electrochemical behaviors the cap fe ii fe iii and sulfur species distribution as a function of ph was obtained using minteq software and the saturation indices of minerals were also calculated the redox potentials of fe ii and fe iii species redox couples were analyzed using the geochemist s workbench software gwb 2021 community edition 2 5 dft calculation density functional theory dft calculation was applied to optimize the geometry of cap and its degradation products obtaining their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo and the highest occupied molecular orbital homo dft study was performed using gaussian 09 w software with the dft b3lyp method and the 6 311 g d p basis set 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization results as shown in fig 1 a during the synthesis of fes x zvi bm fes x and zvi powders first experienced the breaking phase with shear and brittle fracture followed by the cold welding and ductile flattening to form the solid solution alloys fes x zvi samples fes zvi and fes2 zvi were prepared by the deposition and decoration of generated fes x aggregates fig 1b sem eds characterization figs 1c f exhibited that both fine fesbm and fes2 bm particles independently existed on zvi surface in their physical mixtures fes x bm zvibm while sulfur uniformly distributed on fes x zvi bm surface and fes2 zvi bm had the rougher surface than fes zvi bm many nfes x particles bound to zvi surface can be observed from figs 1g h confirming the proposed sulfidation mechanism of fes x zvi via aqueous coprecipitation xrd patterns fig 1i showed that only the diffraction peaks of fe0 were detected in fes x zvi bm and fes x zvi samples s fe 0 112 and the absence of iron sulfides peak might be due to its low content or poor crystallinity at a higher s fe ratio s fe 0 224 xrd detected clear fes2 signals in fes2 bm zvibm but only a limited signal in fes2 zvi bm fig s1 high energy cold plastic deformation might induce microstrains and lattice defects in fes x and zvi particles and sulfur was embedded in the fe fe lattice of fe0 resulting in less exposure of fes x crystal planes to be undetected the diffraction peak intensity of fes x zvi bm samples was significantly greater than that of fes x zvi perhaps because the deposited nfes x particles acted as a capping material on fe0 crystal planes of fes x zvi xps analysis exhibited that the surface of s zvi samples was composed of fe ii fe iii o and fe ii fe iii s compounds fig s2 and fes x zvi bm surface had less sulfur content than fes x zvi due to the incorporation of sulfur into the bulk of fes x zvi bm fig 1j besides fes zvi and fes2 zvi surface had more low valent sulfur species s2 s2 2 and s0 than fes x zvi bm samples 3 2 comparison of cap degradation by s zvi samples 3 2 1 effect of s fe molar ratio as shown in fig 2 a and fig s3 zvibm fesbm and fes2 bm were only able to remove 4 2 1 5 and 0 2 of cap under oxic conditions respectively fesbm zvibm and fes2 bm zvibm could remove 9 4 16 1 and 6 0 33 0 respectively with the increase of s fe molar ratio or fes x bm content fes2 bm zvibm performed better cap degradation except for s fe 0 224 while fesbm zvibm exhibited a limited increase and was inferior to fes2 bm zvibm both fes zvi bm and fes2 zvi bm demonstrated better cap degradation than zvibm and fes x bm zvibm samples due to the effective bulk co doping and surface activation via the interaction of fe0 and fes x with the increase in s fe molar ratio increasing fes had little effect on cap removal of fes zvi bm and increasing fes2 slightly improved the cap removal capabilities of fes2 zvi bm at s fe 0 224 theoretical fe0 wt 74 0 however as the s fe molar ratio further increased to 0 448 cap removal of fes x zvi bm decreased dramatically due to low fe0 content as the electron donor theoretical fe0 wt 58 7 as shown in figs s4 5 the kinetics of cap removal by fes x zvi bm was divided into rapid 0 30 min and slow 30 120 min stages ascribing to the accumulation of iron hydro oxides and a two stage pseudo first order kinetics model text s2 was used to describe the process and obtain the rate constant at the rapid stage the fes x zvi bm rate constant varied overall in a downward parabolic pattern with s fe molar ratios while rate constants decreased linearly with the increase of sulfur content at the slow stage fes and fes2 were not directly involved in cap degradation as electron donors but could be oxidized by oxygen to produce iron hydro oxides causing the rate retardation therefore more fes x was not conducive to sustainable cap degradation by fes x zvi bm under oxic conditions although the specific surface area of zvibm 1 55 m2 g 1 was much larger than that of zvi 0 90 m2 g 1 zvi alone degraded 8 4 cap and exhibited better performance than zvibm during zvibm preparation the exposed fe0 produced by high energy ball milling was oxidized by residual o2 to form oxides hindering electron transfer nano nfes and nfes2 particles prepared by aqueous precipitation could remove 2 5 and 1 9 of cap respectively slightly superior to fesbm and fes2 bm due to more reactive surfaces fes zvi and fes2 zvi prepared via the decoration of nfes or nfes2 exhibited better cap removal than zvi and nfes x samples fes zvi had better performance than fes2 zvi at different s fe molar ratios except for s fe 0 112 and the reactivity of fes x zvi was inferior to fes x zvi bm samples the entire degradation behavior of cap by fes x zvi could be well described with pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 97 with a rate constant significantly lower than that of fes x zvi bm at 0 30 min but larger at 30 120 min especially at s fe 0 56 therefore fes x zvi bm with low sulfur content and fes x zvi with high sulfur content were the optimal choices for the continuous degradation of cap 3 2 2 effect of initial ph as shown in fig 3 and fig s6 the cap degradation by fes x zvi bm was superior to fes x zvi samples under different initial ph ph0 and fes x zvi bm rapidly reached the equilibrium stage at low ph0 fes2 zvi bm had better cap degradation than fes zvi bm and the fes2 zvi performance was also better than fes zvi except at ph0 3 cap removal of fes prepared s zvi slightly decreased with the increase of ph0 while fes2 prepared s zvi showed a parabolic variation with ph0 and reached optimal degradation at ph0 5 6 the effect of ph on cap removal by s zvi was attributed to the following aspects i ph altered the cap species distribution and the s zvi surface charge controlling their attractive or repulsive electrostatic force it was documented that the isoelectric point of s zvi was around 6 tang et al 2016 wu et al 2018 liang et al 2020 as shown in fig s7 cap is the neutral microspecies at ph 7 and it is transformed into negatively charged molecules via amide deprotonation when ph is 7 9 increasing ph from 3 to 9 increases the negative charge of cap and the electrostatic attraction between cap species and zvi s zvi is transformed to electrostatic repulsion inhibiting their direct contact ii cap deprotonation increased the energy of lumo e lumo to decrease its oxidizability and altered the homo group to inhibit the acquisition of protons h by nitro table s1 iii low ph could provide more h for cap degradation iv ph altered s zvi surface activity and fe ii species distribution probably increasing the competitive depletion of active sites by o2 and thus promoting the accumulation of iron oxyhydr oxide films the do changed in line with the typical sag curves consisting of oxygen depletion and reaeration the variation of the measured redox potential was analogous to the change of do fig s6 during cap degradation ph increased first and then decreased to an equilibrium stage and the final ph in cap degradation by fes x zvi bm increased with ph0 the variation of do ph and eh parameters for fes x zvi bm samples was significantly greater than for fes zvi samples and their correlation analysis will be discussed in detail below 3 2 3 effect of o2 as shown in fig 4 a zvi and s zvi samples degraded cap sustainably without any equilibrium stage in the absence of o2 and exhibited better reactivity than under oxic conditions under o2 free conditions cap removal of s zvi samples was in the order of fes2 zvi bm fes zvi bm fes2 zvi fes zvi in agreement with the results in oxic conditions o2 inhibited cap degradation probably due to three aspects i o2 competed with cap to deplete fe0 and h reducing the available active sites for cap removal see section 3 3 ii o2 accelerated the rapid formation and accumulation of iron oxyhydr oxides on zvi and s zvi surfaces hindering electron transfer and resulting in the retarded cap degradation as shown in figs s8a d under oxic conditions fe0 was consumed severely to produce lepidocrocite magnetite and goethite while the peak intensity of fe0 slightly decreased and fe3o4 was mainly detected under anoxic conditions o2 accelerated the transformation of fe3o4 to Î³ feooh iii o2 oxidized low valent sulfur to so4 2 fig s9 resulting in the dissolution loss of sulfur fig 2j and the failure of sulfidation enhancement iv reductive species surface associated fe ii fe0 and fes x of s zvi might activate o2 to produce reactive oxidative species e g h2o2 and oh cheng et al 2020 xiu et al 2021 which could reoxidize the degradation products back to cap after adding h2o2 into the solution wherein cap was completely degraded by fes2 zvi bm under anoxic conditions 14 6 mg l of cap was regenerated under oxic conditions ph of fes x zvi bm samples increased from 5 to 10 followed by a rapid decrease to about 6 3 while their ph slightly decreased after increasing to 8 9 in anoxic conditions under anoxic conditions cap oxidized fe0 to produce fe ii and oh the accumulation of fe ii induced partial hydrolysis k sp fe oh 2 4 10 16 resulting in a slight ph decrease in the presence of o2 the generated fe ii was further oxidized by o2 to fe iii which underwent hydrolysis even at low concentrations k sp fe oh 3 4 10 38 to produce massive quantities of h at the starting points eh levels were lower in anoxic than in oxic conditions and gradually decreased and reached a lower equilibrium due to the continuous degradation of oxidative cap and the production of reductive fe ii hence cap degradation by zvi or s zvi was determined by their reducibility and the late slow rise of eh under oxic conditions was caused by reaeration 3 2 4 the role of sulfidation and sulfur species fes and fes2 as mentioned above under oxic and anoxic conditions fes x zvi bm and fes x zvi exhibited better cap removal efficiency than zvi and maintained excellent performance at different ph0 as shown in fig 5 a sulfidation increased the specific surface areas exposing more active sites for cap adsorption and degradation besides sulfidation reduced the electrochemical impedance of s zvi and accelerated the electron transfer fig 5b after normalization of rate constants by specific surface area fig s10a fes zvi exhibited better cap degradation than fes2 zvi probably due to its lower impedance although the fes x zvi bm samples impedance was larger than that of fes x zvi the former normalized rate constant remained superior to the latter attributed to the following reasons i fes x of fes x zvi samples were mainly decorated on the surface of fe0 while fes x of fes x zvi bm could form the alloy like substance with fe0 and increase the sulfur induced zones ii mechanical ball milling exposed more fe0 sites to react with cap in addition to increasing specific surface area and accelerating electron transfer fes x promoted the cap degradation by zvi ascribed to the following aspects i fes x bm had a larger potential than zvibm fig s10b thus their mixtures could form the micro galvanic cell with zvibm as the anode and fes x bm as the cathode to facilitate the anodic corrosion of fe0 erfanian et al 2022 ii fine fes x particles adhered to the zvi surface might cause acidification in local regions at the interface iii oxidative sulfur species could induce pitting corrosion and activate reductive zvi surface to generate fes x as shown in fig 5c zhang et al 2018 all possible roles of sulfidation are proposed in fig 5d fes2 bm exhibited better promotion on the degradation of cap by zvibm than fesbm fig 2a for the following reasons i the larger potential difference between fes2 bm and zvibm was beneficial to the formation of galvanic cells fig s10b ii surface species of fes2 bm including fe iii s i and sulfur vacancies produced by mechanical ball milling li et al 2022c could oxidize fe0 and be in favor of surface activation ling et al 2021 iii the oxidation dissolution of fes2 bm by oxygen could release more protons than fesbm for accelerating cap removal evangelou and zhang 1995 moreover fes2 was more resistant to h corrosion than fes figs 5c and s11 so s zvi with fes2 as the dominant sulfur species is more suitable for acidic conditions 3 3 the change of chemical parameters ph do eh and cap 3 3 1 correlation analysis of parameters as shown in figs s3 6 and fig 4 under oxic conditions changes in do eh and ph reflect the balance of depletion and replenishment processes and their maximum variations mainly occurred within the first 15 min the correlation of the maximum changes of parameters capmax domax phmax ehmax was analyzed figs s12 13 fes2 zvi bm removed more cap than fes zvi bm however the former domax phmax and ehmax were slightly lower than the latter domax was correlated with phmax due to o2 depletion accompanied by h consumption or oh production table s2 eh indicated the redox status of the working solution and eh decreased with the depletion of do and increased with reaeration capmax linearly correlated with domax fig 6 a as shown in fig 4a zvi and s zvi exhibited better cap degradation under anoxic than oxic conditions therefore o2 was mainly involved in cap removal as a competitor and domax indicated the reduction capacity of materials as illustrated in fig 6a the capmax domax molar ratio of fes zvi bm samples was 0 35 and was less than the fes2 zvi bm samples 0 58 revealing that more fes zvi bm electrons were consumed by o2 and fes zvi bm had the less electron utilization than fes2 zvi bm similarly the electron utilization efficiency of fes2 zvi was larger than that of fes zvi and both were superior to fes x zvi bm samples the domax of nfes and fesbm was larger than that of nfes2 and fes2 bm respectively confirming that fes was more reactive than fes2 for o2 depletion fig 6a therefore fes2 prepared s zvi was more resistant to oxygen oxidation than fes prepared s zvi resulting in better electron utilization the low electron utilization efficiency of fes x zvi bm probably stemmed from the fact that many fe0 sites exposed via ball milling participated in o2 reduction at the same time the fe0 core of fes x zvi samples was covered by the fes x layer which hindered the o2 diffusion to the fe0 core 3 3 2 competitive dynamics model between cap and o2 a competitive dynamics model between cap and aqueous o2 o2 aq for consuming active sites was constructed to assess the competitive reaction rates of cap and o2 the consumed o2 aq can be supplemented and reaerated by the equilibration process with atmospheric oxygen o2 atm schematically the competitive dynamics model is represented as 1 c a p s k c a p p r o d u c t s 2 o 2 a q s k o 2 p r o d u c t s 3 o 2 a t m k o 2 r a o 2 a q where s represents active surface sites reactions eq 1 2 depict the competitive reactions of cap and o2 aq with active sites and reaction eq 3 represents reaeration ordinary differential equations corresponding to eqs 1 3 are written as 4 d cap d t k cap cap s 5 d o 2 a q d t k o 2 o 2 a q s k o 2 r a o 2 a q s a t o 2 a q 6 d s d t k c a p c a p s k o 2 o 2 a q s where k c a p k o 2 and k o 2 r a are rate constants of cap degradation o2 aq depletion and reaeration respectively the brackets represent species concentration mmol l 1 and o 2 aq sat is the o2 aq saturation concentration considering all experiments were conducted in the same reactor with the same temperature and mixing rates we treated k o 2 ra as a global parameter and the remaining k cap k o 2 and initial active sites s0 were local parameters all parameters were obtained using global Ï2 minimization fitting 3 3 3 competitive reaction mechanism between cap and o2 as shown in fig 6b the o2 reduction rate by s zvi was 10 times faster compared to cap according to the frontier molecular orbital theory the lumo acts as an electron acceptor and its smaller e lumo indicates stronger oxidizability and electrophilicity lewis acid fassihi et al 2020 the homo acts as an electron donor and a larger e homo represents stronger reducibility and nucleophilicity lewis base dft calculations exhibited that the e lumo of o2 4 986 ev was less than cap 2 856 ev and its e homo 6 925 ev was larger than that of cap 7 535 ev resulting in the stronger oxidizability and protophilicity of o2 as shown in fig s12 and table s2 o2 was the main contributor species to ph and eh changes therefore o2 consumed more electrons and protons and its reaction rate was larger than the cap degradation rate under anoxic conditions fig s14a the competitive reaction rate of cap with o2 as a function of initial ph was also evaluated as shown in fig s15 the degradation rate of cap decreased with increasing ph which was consistent with a previous study that weak acidic conditions provided protons to favor cap degradation liu et al 2018 the o2 aq depletion rate changed parabolically with initial ph fig 6c with the fastest rate obtained under weakly acidic conditions ph 4 6 the o2 aq depletion rate normalized by specific surface areas of fes x zvi bm was larger than that of fes x zvi fig s14b because more fe0 was exposed as electron donors furthermore low valent sulfur and fe ii species were also used as electron donors for o2 consumption dissolved fe ii species were mainly present as fe2 and feso4 aq in na2so4 solution at ph 3 8 fig s16a and part of mackinawite was dissolved to produce fe2 fehs feso4 aq and h2s aq at ph 7 figs s16c d the distribution of dissolved fe iii generated from fe ii species oxidation is shown in figs s16b the redox potential of fe ii and fe iii species decreased linearly with ph increase and their reducing ability was in the order of fe2 feso4 aq feoh fe oh 2 aq fehs figs s17a d a previous study demonstrated that the apparent oxidation rate of fe oh 2 aq was larger than that of feoh and fe2 santana casiano et al 2005 reasonable speculation yielded that fehs was the most important fe ii contribution species to o2 aq depletion by s zvi at ph 5 6 under alkaline conditions the o2 reduction rate depended on the dissolved fe ii and sulfur species the surface activity of fe0 and fes solids and the o2 inward diffusion it is worth noting that the low valent sulfur in fehs and mackinawite was oxidized before fe ii oxidation in aqueous solutions due to the lower oxidation potential of fe ii so4 2 compared to fe iii so4 2 fig s17 also reported in the previous study rickard and luther 2007 the high o2 aq consumption rate and low cap degradation rate under alkaline conditions meant that electrons were not efficiently utilized and the electron utilization efficiency decreased with the ph increase except for fes2 zvi fig 6d 3 4 product analysis and mechanism of cap degradation 3 4 1 products distribution and degradation pathway the corresponding degradation products of cap by s zvi samples were determined by hplc ms figs s18a e the cap nitro reduction only produced nitroso products nitroso cap under oxic conditions under anoxic conditions the main products of nitro cap degradation by fes x zvi bm were identified as nitroso cap azoxy azoxy cap aromatic amine amine cap and monodechlorination amine cap cl products as shown in fig 7 a azoxy cap was first identified in the chemical reduction of cap and might be produced through a condensation reaction between the oxidized nitroso group of nitroso cap and the reduced hydroxylamine group of hydroxylamine intermediates hydroxylamine cap as exhibited in fig 7a fes x zvi reduced cap to produce nitroso cap azoxy cap and amine cap but no dechlorination in the absence of o2 in contrast the removal of cap by zvi only produced nitroso cap therefore fes x zvi bm degraded more cap and its intermediates than fes x zvi and zvi as exhibited in fig s19 with the degradation of cap by fes x zvi bm nitroso cap azoxy cap and amine cap rapidly accumulated first and then decreased azoxy cap could be successfully reduced to azo intermediates hydrazo intermediates and amine cap fig s18f similar to the reduction of azoxy benzenes nishiyama et al 2022 monodechlorination exhibited the slow and rapid accumulation stages and the fast increase of amine cap cl was along with the rapid decrease of amine cap therefore amine cap cl was mainly produced from the dechlorination of amine cap and its slow stage was determined by the slowly simultaneous dechlorination and hydroxylamine reduction of hydroxylamine cap because its lumo was located at chlorine groups as the electron acceptor although cts simulation showed that cap could be further completely dechlorinated by hydrogenolysis or nucleophilic substitutions and occurred amide hydrolysis fig 7a either the limitation of available electrons and protons or the short term reaction only caused cap monodechlorination by fes x zvi bm different reduction capacities of s zvi and zvi resulted in a different distribution of degradation products and iron sulfide species did not alter the proposed transformation pathways of cap fig 7a 3 4 2 chain decay multispecies model of cap degradation based on the assumption of the pseudo first order reaction and the fractionation into different degradation pathways previously reported arnold and roberts 2000 metzgen et al 2022 a modified chain decay multispecies model was used to describe the degradation of cap and its products eqs 7 11 7 d cap d t k cap cap 8 d nitroso d t k nitroso nitroso f cap to nitroso k cap cap d azoxy d t k azoxy azoxy 0 5 f cap to azoxy k cap cap 9 0 5 f nitroso to azoxy k nitroso nitroso 10 d amine d t k amine amine 1 f cap to nitroso f cap to azoxy k cap cap 1 f nitroso to azoxy k nitroso nitroso 2 k azoxy azoxy 11 d monodechlorination d t k amine amine where k cap k nitroso k azoxy and k amine are pseudo first order degradation rates of cap and its nitroso azoxy and amine products respectively and f cap to nitroso f cap to azoxy f nitroso to azoxy are molar transfer coefficients for the degradation steps of cap to nitroso cap cap to azoxy cap and nitroso cap to azoxy cap respectively the molar concentrations of nitroso cap azoxy cap amine cap and amine cap cl were estimated via the ratio of the hplc peak area to its hplc response coefficient roughly calculated as described in the text s3 to evaluate rate constants and molar transfer coefficients eqs 7 11 were solved in a consecutive fit algorithm starting with an unweighted fit of cap profiles k cap and then continuing with the fit of nitroso cap profiles k nitroso cap f cap to nitroso followed successively by fitting profiles of azoxy cap k nitroso cap f cap to azoxy f nitroso to azoxy and amine cap k amine cap as shown in fig s20a if all degraded cap was transformed to nitroso cap namely f cap to nitroso 1 the model computed nitroso cap was considerably more than the experimental data indicating that part of cap was degraded to other products if the production of azoxy cap was only from nitroso cap f cap to azoxy 0 the fitting results showed that although the degraded nitroso cap was all converted to azoxy cap the calculated nitroso cap was still significantly less than the experimental data fig s20b therefore the direct degradation of cap to generate azoxy cap cannot be neglected as exhibited in fig 8 a e the chain decay multispecies model well depicted the degradation of cap and its products the reduction rate of cap was better than that of nitroso cap and both were slightly lower than that of azoxy cap except for fes zvi bm which might be attributed to the stronger protophilicity of azoxy cap fig s21 the dechlorination rate of amine cap was an order of magnitude lower than the reduction rates of cap nitroso cap and azoxy cap probably because amine cap had a higher e lumo fig 7b resulting in the smaller oxidizability and degradation rate e lumo of amine cap cl was only 0 35 ev and its lumo as an electron acceptor was located on the benzene ring hindering further dechlorination of amine cap cl model calculations exhibited that f cap to nitroso f cap to azoxy f cap to amine and f nitroso to azoxy of fes x zvi bm samples were 45 2 12 5 27 5 8 7 27 3 3 8 and 100 fig 7a and fig s22 respectively indicating that the condensation routine with azoxy cap as vital intermediates was the main pathway for the nitroso reduction to the amine group besides f cap to azoxy of fes x zvi and zvi was 3 2 0 4 and 0 respectively and their corresponding f cap to amine were 45 3 11 3 and 25 4 1 7 fig s22 therefore multiple pathways lead to cap degradation to produce amine cap fig s23 without nitroso cap as an intermediate prerequisite nitroso cap could not be directly degraded to amine cap by hydrogenolysis of hydroxylamine cap possibly because lumo of hydroxylamine cap was located in chlorine rather than hydroxylamine group fig 7b fes x zvi bm exhibited a more rapid transformation of cap and its degradation products than fes x zvi and s zvi prepared by fes2 displayed superior performance to that fabricated by fes 3 4 3 the role of atomic hydrogen in nitro reduction and dechlorination there were two routes for cap to obtain electrons from s zvi one was the direct electron transfer det from s zvi to the electrophilic site of cap and the proton dissociated no bonds to produce water the other was that protons accepted electrons to form atomic hydrogen h then completed cap s nitro reduction and dechlorination via hydrogenolysis adequate tba was applied as the scavenger for h 1 0 11 5 105 m 1 s 1 lymar and schwarz 2012 to investigate the contribution of h and det to the reductive transformation of cap and its degradation products as shown in fig 8f s22 and s24 tba inhibited cap degradation and altered the molar transfer fraction of cap multipath degradation tba restrained nitro and nitroso reduction of cap but had little effect on azoxy cap and 38 of cap degraded by zvibm was attributed to h sulfidation promoted the det contribution to cap and nitroso cap degradation and fes x zvi bm promoted it less than fes x zvi probably due to the former fe0 exposure with more h production tba significantly inhibited the monodechlorination of amine cap by fes x zvi bm and h accounted for 57 65 thus amine cap was mainly dechlorinated by hydrogenolysis h contribution to the step to step nitro reduction and monodechlorination was in the order amine cap nitroso cap cap azoxy cap h contribution of fes2 prepared s zvi was lower than fes prepared because the more hydrophobic fes2 had a weaker h2o affinity and a lower h surface coverage than fes xu et al 2020 3 4 4 toxicity assessment of cap and its reduction products the ecotoxicity of cap and degradation intermediates was estimated via quantitative structure activity relationships using the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t and is exhibited in figs s25a d the acute toxicity obtained from 96 h fathead minnow showed a considerable increase from toxic cap to more toxic nitroso cap and azoxy cap after nitro reduction and dechlorination amine cap and amine cap cl became less toxic under ideal conditions the complete dechlorination of cap and its amide hydrolysis could produce less toxic terminal products furthermore nitro reduction of cap reduced the bioaccumulation capability while its dechlorination increased bioaccumulation fig s25b cap is a developmental toxicant that produces harmful effects on immature offspring but its degradation products developmental toxicity is low fig s25c fig s25d revealed that nitro cap amine cap and amine cap cl could be assessed as mutagenic positive the comprehensive evaluation suggests that the nitro reduction of cap produced bio toxic intermediates and the complete dechlorination of cap could effectively reduce the bio toxicity therefore to eliminate the potential risk of cap and its products in the ecosystem excessive zvi or s zvi particles should be applied to accelerate the transformation of toxic nitroso and azoxy products and decrease their retention time 4 conclusion this study systematically investigated the degradation pathway and mechanism of cap by s zvi synthesized via natural fes x minerals and s zvi prepared via amorphous fes or fes2 precursors surface morphology material composition physicochemical properties and cap degradation performance of fes x zvi bm and fes x zvi were comprehensively compared sulfidation promoted iron corrosion and accelerated electron transfer to enhance cap degradation via coupling multiple strategies fes x zvi bm exhibited better cap removal than fes x zvi due to larger specific surface areas and more sulfur enhanced zones under oxic conditions o2 had a faster electron consumption rate than cap ascribed to its lower e lumo and higher proton affinity and fes x zvi exhibited better electron utilization than fes x zvi bm due to less fe0 exposure dft calculation and output of the chain decay multispecies model indicated that fes x zvi bm degraded cap to produce nitroso cap amine cap azoxy cap and amine cap cl under anoxic conditions via multi pathways at the same time fes x zvi did not initiate the monodechlorination of cap a new transformation pathway was proposed that azoxy cap intermediates mediated the reduction of nitroso cap to amine cap and their e lumo determined the competitive reaction rate of cap and its degradation products sulfidation promoted the det contribution to cap and nitroso cap degradation and fes x zvi bm exhibited less improvement of det contribution but a more rapid transformation of cap and its products than fes x zvi there are two aspects to reducing the potential ecotoxicity during the reductive degradation of cap one is that excessive s zvi particles are applied to accelerate the rapid transformation of toxic nitroso and azoxy products to decrease their retention time the other is selectively reductive dechlorination without nitro reduction to achieve efficient cap detoxification and high electron utilization this study provides new perspectives on the optimized synthesis of s zvi and the selective degradation of

14972,reverse osmosis ro is an advanced technology used to produce potable water from a variety of water sources including surface water seawater and wastewater the yield of the product water from the ro systems is increased by the addition of antiscalants which prevent scaling from calcium and other ions removal of antiscalants from ro concentrate can induce the precipitation of oversaturated scale forming substances enable additional water recovery from ro concentrates and reduce the risk of eutrophication after concentrate disposal into the receiving water e g river water this study aims to provide a better insight into oxidation reactions of the n free phosphonate antiscalants 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp and 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid pbtc with ozone hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radicals so4 ozone barely reacts with hedp and pbtc at ph 7 k 10 m 1 s 1 while second order reaction rates of so4 and oh were determined to be in the range 107 108 m 1 s 1 sulfate silicate and chloride matrices increased hedp ozone degradation rate possibly due to metal complexation effect whereas carbonate and chloride hindered pbtc ozone degradation and natural organic matter nom inhibited both hedp and pbtc degradation through scavenging of oh the so4 radical based oxidation process of hedp and pbtc is mainly inhibited by carbonate and nom interestingly only hedp degradation is inhibited by chloride whereby the pbtc could not be fully degraded degradation 60 the oxidation of pbtc is in real ro concentrates in both processes limited to 10 degradation whereas hedp could be degraded up to 60 with ozone and uv persulfate application keywords organophosphonate antiscalant ozone hydroxyl radical sulfate radical reverse osmosis concentrate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro is a common treatment option to reduce hardness from ground water and to desalinate sea water or brackish water for drinking water production ro membranes reject up to 20 of the influent water flow on the concentrate side the concentrate contains the rejected salts micropollutants and chemical agents at concentrations of 4 7 fold higher than in the feed water malaeb and ayoub 2011 to prevent membrane scaling and biofouling antiscalants and biocides are commonly added to the feed water antiscalants are chelating agents that prevent salt precipitation on the membrane by complexation of multivalent metal cations e g calcium manganese magnesium iron and precipitation of salts e g carbonates sulphates silicates ghafour 2003 according to the german environmental agency umweltbundesamt 2019 the phosphonate antiscalants aminotris methylenephosphonic acid atmp ntmp diethylenetriaminepenta methylene phosphonic acid dtpmp 1 hydroxyethylidene 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp and phosphonobutanetricarboxylic acid pbtc are approved for application in drinking water production and according to the regulations maximal 2 5 mg l dry matter of the technical product can be added to the feed water besides water treatment antiscalants are commonly applied in textile and paper production household and industrial cleaners cooling water systems and oil production rott et al 2018 due to the wide range of uses these substances are widely distributed in the environment phosphonates were found in the wastewater influents in different municipal wastewater treatment plants at concentrations ranging from limit od detection lod 1 Âµg l to 579 Âµg l armbruster et al 2019 rott et al 2020 rott et al 2018 and in textile wastewater influents up to 7 2 mg l wang et al 2019a in surface waters phosphonates were observed at concentrations between 0 08 39 Î¼g l rott et al 2020 wang et al 2019a reported hedp concentrations up to 26 mg kg in the suspended matter of river water and rott et al 2020 reported 3 mg kg of total phosphorus load of river sediments in germany before and 32 mg kg after wastewater discharged hedp and pbtc accounted for the largest proportion of the total phosphonates in both wastewater influents and surface waters rott et al 2020 the presence of phosphonates in natural water can cause various adverse effects to aquatic systems phosphonates are subjected to natural degradation mechanisms such as chemical degradation or photodegradation which results in the release of orthophosphate o po4 3 lesueur et al 2005 nowack 2003 therefore if cooling water or membrane concentrate is directly discharged into the environment the phosphorus concentrations in water bodies would increase which in turn causes eutrophication rott et al 2018 moreover high concentrations of phosphonates in wastewater treatment plants also affects wastewater treatment processes by hindering phosphate precipitation and increasing phosphorus levels which potentially results in the discharge of phosphorus containing effluent to the environment rott et al 2018 due to excellent chelating effects remobilization of toxic metals such as copper cadmium and lead from polluted sediments by phosphonates was observed bordas and bourg 1998 a slight remobilization of zinc was also discovered with ntmp and hedp gledhill and feijtel 1992 in addition feiner et al 2015 also reported toxicity of ro concentrates containing phosphonate antiscalants to aquatic organisms toxicity was tested with amphipods and the results revealed a higher ecotoxicological relevance of antiscalants furthermore phosphonates could induce harmful algae blooms by the release of iron and phosphate ions wang et al 2020 due to the above mentioned impacts of phosphonates their removal from ro concentrates is of great importance in terms of both environmental relevance as well as wastewater treatment to prevent water pollution little research has been done on the application of treatment methods to the abatement of antiscalants in wastewater and concentrates conventional wastewater treatment with the use of flocculation was previously applied to remove phosphonates but was not successful for organically polluted waters rott et al 2017 also aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation seems to be uncapable for antiscalant treatment nowack 2003 ozonation and advanced oxidation processes including fenton process uv chlorine persulfate s2o8 2 based and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 based aops have recently been proven to effectively degrade phosphonates greenlee et al 2014 huang et al 2022 rott et al 2017 wang et al 2019b xu et al 2019 however most of the studies did not report the reaction kinetics of phosphonates and the oxidative species precisely to enable optimization of water treatment processes furthermore none of these studies provide a systematic investigation of the influences of matrix components and radical scavengers to the degradation efficiency in synthetic and real matrices hedp and pbtc account for the majority of the used antiscalants due to their diverse applications in the textile and detergent industries in this study their reaction kinetics and degradation in ozonation and uv persulfate were investigated furthermore second order rate constants of ozone oh and so4 with hedp and pbtc and their ca2 complexes were determined to examine the reactivity the impacts of water chemical parameters e g chloride carbonate sulfate and organic matter on n free organophosphonates degradation and the potential of ozonation and uv persulfate for their degradation in real ro concentrates were examined 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and equipment hedp was obtained from sigma aldrich taufkichen germany and pbtc 50 in water from the tokyo chemical industry co ltd tokyo japan the technical product of hedp was provided by zschirmmer schwarz lahnstein germany and the technical product of pbtc from kurita viersen germany all reagents were used directly as commercially available analytical grade and a complete list of used solvents and reagents can be found in the supplementary information si tab s1 the used instruments and equipment are listed in table s2 in si 2 2 determination of rate constants 2 2 1 determination of ozone reaction rate the reaction rate constants of hedp and pbtc with ozone were investigated under pseudo first order conditions with the substrates in excess to ozone the experiments were carried out at three different ph values 5 7 and 9 with 20 mm borate buffer sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid was used to adjust ph of the solution to the respective ph the use of borate buffer for oxidation experiments of phosphonates has previously been reported since it does not react with the dissolved ozone or affect the chemical equilibrium due to phosphate production as in the case of phosphate buffer greenlee et al 2014 xu et al 2019 tert butanol t buoh was used as oh scavenger fraction of oh reacting with t buoh 95 f 0 95 to monitor the ozone reaction rates with insignificant oh interference see si furthermore to observe the effect of calcium ca2 complexation on the compound oxidation the experiments were performed with the addition of ca2 prepared from cacl2 2 h2o with a concentration of 2 5 times of the compound concentration the ozone reaction rate of hedp with ca2 were determined by ozone depletion with excess of hedp ozone was determined by using the indigo method because direct ozone measurement was hindered by ca2 bader and hoignÃ© 1981 for details see si other reaction rates were measured by uv absorption of ozone at 258 nm bader and hoignÃ© 1981 2 2 2 determination of oh and so4 rate constants the rate constants of the reaction between oh and so4 with the antiscalants under study were determined by uv h2o2 or uv persulfate oxidation a low pressure mercury lamp was installed in a merry go round photoreactor for uv irradiation fluence rate was determined by uridine actinometry in pure water according to von sonntag and schuchmann 1992 so4 rate constants with hedp and pbtc were determined by competition kinetics with 4 chlorobenzoic acid pcba k so4 pcba 3 6 108 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 sodium persulfate was dosed at 1 mm to generate so4 upon uv radiation as oh are normally produced during so4 oxidation in presence of chloride t buoh was added to minimize the bias of oh to the competition experiments 3 mm of t buoh was added as it has been previously reported to scavenge more than 95 of oh while consuming only 3 8 of so4 at 1 10 3 m persulfate dose lutze et al 2015a the experiments were carried out with the addition of 200 Âµm hedp or pbtc and 100 Âµm pcba excess methanol 1 m was added during sampling and the time dependent concentrations of hedp pbtc and pcba were determined the data were evaluated based on eq 1 where k c and k m are the rate constants for the competitor c and target compound m respectively the irradiation time is represented by t 1 l n m t m 0 k o x m k o x c l n c t c 0 by plotting l n m t m 0 against l n c t c 0 the slope is equivalent to the ratio of k o x m k o x c as a result the rate constant k o x m can be calculated from the known reaction rate constant k o x c based on preliminary experiments the influence of direct photolysis could be neglected oh rate constant with pbtc was determined with the same approach only with the exception that benzaldehyde was chosen as competitor k oh ba 4 4 109 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 for oh rate constant with hedp a further competition kinetics approach was used by analyzing the product concentration of a competitor here orthophosphate o po4 3 which is the product of hedp was monitored as a result hedp was considered as the competitor and t buoh k oh t buoh 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 was chosen as the substrate the experiments were done with a constant hedp concentration and varying t buoh concentrations in different ratios according to dodd et al 2006 the irradiation time was set to 20 mins the oh rate constant was calculated by plotting the graph between o po4 3 absence o po4 3 presence 1 vs t buoh 0 hedp 0 the slope corresponds to k oh t buoh k oh hedp 2 3 determination of degradation efficiency hedp and pbtc were tested at total phosphorus concentration of 4 5 mg l 72 5 Âµm hedp and 145 Âµm pbtc the formation of orthophosphate which is a primary oxidation product of phosphonates together with the degradation of the compound was determined to evaluate the extent of hedp and pbtc oxidation and the elimination efficiency in different matrices all experiments were performed at ph 7 in 2 10 2 m borate buffer note that phosphate precipitates as capo4 apart from pure borate buffer the experiments were also carried out in different water matrices and in real concentrates to examine the effect of different ions or organic matter to the compound degradation the following ions were tested sulfate carbonate silicate chloride calcium and bromide in combination with organic matter whereby the applied concentration reflects the real concentration in concentrates furthermore a synthetic matrix containing all the tested ions and organic matter at ph 7 was prepared and tested in degradation experiments details about the applied concentrations are provided in table s6 si the oxidation efficiency of the ozonation and uv persulfate processes were compared as a basis for comparison the experiments with matrix components were carried out with ozone dosage in relation to the number of phosphonate groups of the respective organophosphonate therefore ozone was added in the ratios hedp to ozone of 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 5 1 10 1 15 and pbtc to ozone of 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 this equals ozone dosage up to 1 2 mm besides the addition of matrix substitutes experiments were performed with the addition of t buoh as oh scavenger for suppressing any reaction of oh with hedp and pbtc after addition of ozone the samples were left to react overnight to assure full ozone depletion so4 based degradation was performed as described above and samples were taken within 30 mins 1 m methanol was used to quench low steady state concentrations of so4 which may form upon thermolysis of persulfate during storage lutze et al 2015b subsequently all the samples were analyzed for hedp and pbtc with the use of hplc ms and for orthophosphate formation the applied fluence was calculated via the photon fluence rate determined by uridine actinometry see text s 5 at vanishing absorption by that means the uv radiation reaches all areas in the reactor the degradation of uridine can then be translated into an average fluence rate in the quartz tubes of the merry go round photo apparatus the absorption by the spectral interferences of the real sample was corrected by the morrowitz correction additionally the energy demand including production costs of persulfate has been calculated in analogy to lutze et al 2015b c f photochemical used calculations fluence rate morrowitz correction and energy costs see katsoyiannis et al 2011 2 4 antiscalant degradation in concentrates two concentrates of reverse osmosis treatment were obtained from german drinking water treatment plants dwtp both dwtp are located in central germany and use groundwater as raw water facility a deals with a high nitrate content and facility b deals with strongly sulfate containing waters in regions with very high calcium sulfate concentration the water quality parameters are summarized in table 1 the ro concentrates were spiked with 72 5 Âµm hedp or 145 Âµm pbtc the uv persulfate degradation experiments were performed as described before and the dilution of the concentrate state below 1 the ozonation of hedp and pbtc was evaluated over a dosage from 0 0 365 mm ozone this equals a max ratio of 1 5 a higher dosage of ozone was not possible without a dilution over 10 of the concentrate to ensure the same conditions within one experiment every concentrate sample was diluted by the same factor 10 additionally to the degradation experiments the ozone and hydroxyl radical exposure of the concentrates were obtained an ozone dose normalized to the total organic carbon concentration 0 5 g o3 g toc has often been reported to be used as an operating parameter to compare pollutant degradation with varying toc concentrations lee et al 2013 therefore 0 5 mg o3 mg toc as z specific dose was used to determine the exposures exposures were determined in concentrates with and without extra antiscalant dosage antiscalant are used in high concentration and therefore are not defined as micropollutants an addition of 72 5 Âµm hedp equals 1 73 mg l doc and 145 Âµm pbtc 12 3 mg l doc and their contribution to the total doc must be considered further explanations of the ozone exposure experiments are given in text s4 2 5 analytical methods analysis of hedp and pbtc was carried out with high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry hplc ms equipped with a hydrophilic interaction chromatography hilic column luna 3 Âµm hilic 200 Ã¥ lc column 150 2 mm the column was thermostatted at 35 c and the sample injection volume was 20 Âµl acetonitrile acn and water mixed with 2 5 mm ammonium acetate were used as the eluents for mobile phase with a flow rate of 0 2 ml min gradient mode with the starting conditions 20 water and 80 acn was used the analytes were ionized by an atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization api es in a negative mode with a fragmentor voltage of 70 ev and mass scan of m z 50 300 the drying gas was at 10 5 l min at 350 c with the nebulizer pressure of 35 psi the capillary voltage was 3200 v the retention time of hedp and pbtc was at about 2 1 and 1 9 mins respectively and m z of 205 for hedp and 269 for pbtc in a single ion mode was used for quantification the analysis of hedp and pbtc by hplc ms was performed only for the experiments in borate buffer because in the presence of the added matrix substituents the analysis was hampered hplc dad was used to analyze ba and pcba a c18 column kinetex 5 Âµm evo c18 100 Ã¥ lc column 100 3 mm was used for separation the temperature was set at 25 c and the injection volume was 25 Âµl isocratic mode of 60 methanol and 40 water ph 3 was applied with a flow rate of 0 5 ml min and a total run time of 10 mins ba retention time 2 2 min was monitored at the wavelength of 247 nm and pcba retention time 4 1 min at 234 nm the method to determine orthophosphate concentration previously reported by was armbruster et al 2019 used this method used the molybdenum blue reaction coupled with photometric detection in accordance with din en 1189 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of hedp and pbtc oxidation 3 1 1 reaction rate constants of ozone the reaction rate constants of hedp and pbtc increase with ph fig 1 this can be explained by deprotonation of the phosphonates which increases the electron density in the reaction center i e the alkyl groups see fig 2 thereby ozone may react with the alkyl groups via an h abstract reaction in analogy to formic acid sonntag and gunten 2012 for hedp at ph 5 and 7 the two phosphonate hydrogen atoms fig 2 are deprotonated and the rate constant increases slightly whereas at ph 9 one phosphonate group is completely deprotonated resulting in a further increase of the reaction rate constant pbtc shows a weaker ph dependency in the investigated ph range due to the lower pk a values see fig 2 with ca2 present the reaction rate constant of hedp increases at ph 7 and 9 which is less pronounced in case of pbtc the activating effect of ca2 has been previously reported to increase the reactivity of phosphonate antiscalants with ozone greenlee et al 2014 the reason for this could be the change in stereochemistry caused by cation coordination because ca2 is complexed by the phosphonate groups and as a result the ozone reactive moieties may be better accessible for ozone reactions generally phosphonates have a greater affinity for metal ions at higher ph values which is in agreement with the observed ph dependency of the reactivity gledhill and feijtel 1992 the determined k hedp o3 of 3 63 0 12 m 1 s 1 and k pbtc o3 of 9 16 0 26 10 1 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 are also comparable to the previously reported k hedp o3 of 5 8 10 1 m 1 s 1 huang et al 2022 and k pbtc o3 of 1 2 10 1 m 1 s 1 xu et al 2019 the observed k hedp o3 is also similar to the rate constant of malonic acid of 4 m 1s 1 sonntag and gunten 2012 which is a compound with a similar structure as hedp note that malonic acid has carboxylic acid groups instead of phosphate groups moreover comparable rate constants to hedp and pbtc are also observed for other phosphate containing compounds such as tris 2 chloro isopropyl phosphate tcpp tris 2 chloro ethyl phosphate tcep and tri n butyl phosphate tnbp with rate constants of 1 m 1 s 1 pocostales et al 2010 first of all it has to be mentioned that the amount of tert butanol added for scavenging intrinsic oh radicals can scavenge a fraction of 80 90 oh see si text si3 hence formed oh may have biased the results on ozone reaction kinetics resulting in a slight overestimation due to propagation reactions and accelerated ozone depletion however the strong dependency of reaction kinetics and ph indicates only a minor contribution of oh since their reaction kinetics is very ph dependent due to their low selectivity also the intrinsic formation of superoxide can be ruled out due to the large differences in reaction kinetics at ph 7 and 9 since superoxide has a pka of 4 5 and thus superoxide is nearly fully present as anion at both ph 7 and 9 3 1 2 reaction rate constants of oh and so4 the determined reaction rate constants of oh and so4 with hedp and pbtc are presented in table 2 the reaction rates determined in this study are in agreement with k hedp oh of 5 4 108 m 1 s 1 huang et al 2022 and k pbtc oh of 7 83 108 m 1 s 1 xu et al 2019 at ph 7 comparing k hedp oh and k pbtc oh with other phosphate containing compounds which are tcpp and tcep a similar rate constant was also discovered with k tcpp oh of 7 0 108 m 1 s 1 and k tcep oh of 7 4 108 m 1 s 1 pocostales et al 2010 the results of k hedp oh display a weak ph dependency since the reaction rate increases by a factor of two at ph 9 overall the effect of ph on the reaction kinetics is significant smaller compared to ozone this can be explained with the low selectivity of oh and has been observed for numerous other compounds with dissociation centres in contrast to hedp k pbtc oh does not substantially increase at ph 9 k 2 90 4 75 108 m 1 s 1 this can be explained with the larger alkyl group between the phosphonates of pbtc compared to hedp therefore the increase in electron density due to deprotonation might have only little to no effect to h abstraction reaction of oh at ch bond wang et al 2019b investigated oh reaction kinetics of ntmp another common phosphonate antiscalants and also reported that ph had little impact on oh reactivity toward ntmp despite the change in speciation which also is in line with the obtained pbtc oh reaction rate constants the apparent reaction rate constants of hedp and pbtc with so4 also indicated no ph dependency this was also observed for other antiscalants such as ntmp k ntmp so4 2 4 3 5 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 4 to 11 5 wang et al 2019b in addition the degradation of other simple phosphate containing compounds with similar structures compared to hedp and pbtc i e tcpp and tcep by uv persulfate also displayed no change in reaction kinetics in the ph range of 3 to 9 ou et al 2017 yu et al 2019 the reaction kinetics of so4 is about an order of magnitude below the reaction kinetics of oh which is in line with h abstraction reactions of other compounds such as aliphatic alcohols clifton and huie 1989 overall the oh reaction rates are quite low and comparable with other h abstractions of aliphatic compounds e g k oh plus tert butanol 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 which is similar to hedp and pbtc at ph 5 and 7 however the ozone reaction rates of tert butanol is 1 10 3 m 1 s 1 which is several orders of magnitude below the ozone reaction kinetics with hedp and pbtc table 2 this is surprising since the reaction mechanisms of ozone and oh reactions with hedp pbtc and tert butanol is probably the same i e h abstraction to this end an explanation for this observation is lacking 3 2 ozone and hydroxyl radical exposure ozone and oh exposures allow to predict micropollutant oxidation during ozonation whereby the ozone exposure and hydroxyl radical scavenging is mainly influenced by the nom and carbonate bicarbonate concentration of a natural water the rct value representing the ratio of the oh exposure to the o3 exposure is a useful tool to compare water bodies and is typically in the range of 10 9 10 8 for various water quality parameters elovitz and von gunten 1999 ozone and oh exposure were measured for the concentrates a and b within 2 days upon receipt note that concentrate a was diluted to arrive at a toc concentration of 15 mg toc mg l to enable application of ozone note that the ozone stock solution is limited to a maximal concentration of 1 7 mm ozone the rct of the concentrates a and b as well as for the synthetic matrix without antiscalants are shown in fig s2 si same matrices with hedp or pbtc are shown in fig s3 si the rct values 1 0 10 8 of both concentrates are within the range 10 8 10 9 of drinking water ozonation the synthetic matrix shows a higher ozone decomposition than the concentrates this can be explained as follows in analogy to carbonate and bicarbonate the antiscalants may have acted as oh radical scavengers and thus inhibiting radical chain reactions which can accelerate ozone decomposition von gunten 2003a this can be explained by used source of organic matter i e suwannee river nom which may contain electron rich moieties than natural organic matter of the concentrations from groundwater which is mainly electron poor non degradable organic left from excessive microbial degradation elovitz and von gunten 1999 note that the addition of hedp and pbtc increases the toc content and a higher ozone dosage was necessary for the same ozone dose z specific 0 5 mg o3 mg toc the two antiscalants hedp and pbtc can be considered to be ozone recalcitrant with moderate kinetics with oh and so4 according to lee et al 2013 these compounds would belong to group iv hedp and v pbtc thereby group iv requires 1 mg o3 mg doc for a significant pollutant degradation while compounds of group v can hardly be degraded at all this also agrees with the observation that at an ozone dose of 1 5 1 9 mg o3 mg doc hedp is degraded by only 50 at pbtc by only 10 see below however it has to be mentioned that the antiscalants may not be fully comparable with trace pollutants due to their significant higher concentration 3 3 degradation of hedp and pbtc with ozone hedp and pbtc ozone degradation were investigated in the presence of different real matrix components to examine the effects of different ions or organic matter on the compound degradation in ozonation the degradation was determined by measuring the formation of orthophosphate where the percentage formation of orthophosphate corresponds to the maximum possible release based on the initial phosphonate concentration the results have shown that hedp is degraded to a larger extent than pbtc for example at the highest ozone dosages 1 1 mm ozone approximately 90 of orthophosphate was formed for hedp equals 90 hedp degradation fig 3 compared with 60 for pbtc fig 4 this also is in line with the higher rate constants of hedp than pbtc for both the reactions with ozone and oh in addition for pbtc yields of orthophosphate were substantially smaller ca 60 fig 4 and at an ozone dose of 0 2 mm ratio 1 2 complexing agent ozone the p formation did not further increase this indicates that at this ozone dose p containing products are oxidized which seems to be a secondary orthophosphate source this could be corroborated by higher ozone doses 1 2 mm ratio 1 8 complexing agent ozone which might give rise to further orthophosphate even though pbtc is already degraded the transformation of pbtc phosphorus in another organic p containing form and the high demand of ozone to achieve a partial removal were also reported in previous studies xu et al 2019 addition of t buoh as oh scavenger fraction of oh scavenging 95 significantly inhibited both hedp and pbtc degradation to only around 20 of hedp fig 5 a and 5 of pbtc degradation fig 5b this corroborates that oh is most important for the degradation of the n free phosphonates hedp and pbtc and is in accordance with the very low reaction kinetics of the complexing compounds with ozone to assess the influence of oh scavenging matrix components on the degradation of antiscalants experiments were conducted with bicarbonate 11 mm and nom 2 5 mg l 7 5 mg l the presence of nom clearly reduced ozone oxidation efficiency of both hedp and pbtc nom is composed of organic material such as humic substances polysaccharides proteins and lipids generally ozone reactions with the complexing agents are largely reduced as these moieties of nom compete with the desired removal of the target compound with a higher reactivity and greatly consume ozone gardoni et al 2012 furthermore oh was scavenged by nom resulting in the decrease in degradation of hedp and pbtc fig 5 to evaluate the potential formation of the cancerogenic bromate experiments were performed with low level nom 2 5 mg l and the addition of bromide 1 mg l fig s4 and s5 in si the formation of 6 bromate 100 Âµg l for 70 hedp degradation and 7 bromate 120 Âµg l for 30 pbtc degradation from the available bromide concentration was observed this indicates that these complexing agents cannot be degraded without exceeding bromate standards applied in drinking water ozonation and recommended for wastewater ozonation 10 Âµgl 1 furthermore with both substances there is a 10 reduction in o po4 formation in the presence of bromide compared to the experiments with the same low nom concentration this can be explained by oxidant scavenging by the high bromide levels however it has to be noted that the bromate standard may not apply for the treatment of concentrates by ozone at the moment in case of treated bromate containing concentrates are discharged into natural waters elevated bromate levels may become a problem in drinking water treatment of the receiving water the bicarbonate carbonate system is the main inorganic reactant of oh in a natural water k oh hco3 8 6 106 m 1s 1 k oh co3 2 3 109 m 1s 1 lian et al 2017 and is proposed to have the highest influence on the ozonation efficiency interestingly only pbtc degradation is slightly limited by bicarbonate 11 mm 671 mg l 12 whereas hedp showed no differences at all this may indicate that also formed carbonate radicals may be able to degrade the complexing agents except for calcium none of the investigated inorganic matrix components showed a positive or negative effect on the organophosphonate degradation interestingly calcium complexation resulted in a reduced degradation of hedp and no effect on pbtc but in the presence of high chloride anions and calcium an inhibition of 10 pbtc degradation was observed which was according the results on reaction kinetics see above and the current literature not expected greenlee et al 2014 3 4 degradation of hedp and pbtc with sulfate radicals in uv persulfate processes both so4 and oh contribute to the degradation of hedp and pbtc as in the process of ozonation a higher degradation of hedp fig 6 a than pbtc fig 6b was achieved at a fluence of about 20 kj m 2 hedp is completely mineralized to orthophosphate in the uv persulfate process silicate 2 mm and sulfate 17 mm 1633 mg l ions had no influence on antiscalant degradation whereby the addition of bicarbonate carbonate 11 mm 671 mg l reduced the degradation to only 87 and 16 orthophosphate formation from hedp and pbtc of about 75 kj m 2 as mentioned before bicarbonate and carbonate scavenge oh furthermore they scavenge so4 k so4 hco3 2 8 106 m 1 s 1 k so4 co3 2 6 1 106 m 1 s 1 canonica et al 2005 and an intrinsic formation of carbonate radicals is possible however carbonate radicals are less reactive towards organic compounds than other radicals li et al 2017 overall this results in the highest influence by bicarbonate carbonate on a reduced degradation rate the highest inhibitory effect of bicarbonate on an aop process was also reported for hedp degradation by uv chlorine huang et al 2019 the sensitivity of the uv persulfate towards chloride mainly depends on the chloride concentration all tested cl concentrations 2 52 mm 70 1843 mg l had only minor effects on the pbtc degradation see fig 6b and s7 a cl concentration of up to 2 mm has no impact on the degradation of hedp but the degradation decreased by increased cl concentration from 90 at 10 mm cl to 65 hedp degradation at 52 mm cl due to the scavenging effect of cl compare fig s6 in si so4 and oh reacts with chloride ion with rate constants of 2 7 108 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 and 4 3 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 respectively whereby oh react with cl into hocl and due to various equilibria the oxidation of cl by oh at ph 7 is calculated by von gunten 2003b to be 103 m 1s 1 and can be neglected so4 mainly reacts with cl to cl at the given cl concentrations cl can react with cl under the formation of cl2 this intermediate may react with water to h2ocl and hocl while the latter intermediate forms oh and cl at ph 5 lutze et al 2015b as the final ph of so4 degradation experiment was monitored to be 3 3 this favours the generation of cl and partly suppresses the formation of oh from hocl since cl is rapidly scavenged by cl to form cl2 which has a lower oxidation potential cl cl 2600 mv and cl2 2 cl 2300 mv wardman 1989 or turned over into oh formation of cl may be less important for antiscalant degradation consequently so4 oxidation in chloride matrix resulted in lower degradation efficiency huang et al 2019 investigated the degradation of hedp in uv chlorine processes and their results agree that chloride concentration above 5 mm inhibited phosphorus transformation interestingly the degradation of hedp present as ca2 complex is reduced about 20 whereas the ca2 pbtc degradation is slightly increased degradation of hedp and pbtc by so4 was suppressed in nom 2 5 mg l matrix which can be explained by radical scavenging by nom nom reacts with oh with 3 3 108 mc 1s 1 while k so4 nom was reported to be 4 6 106 mc 1s 1 for suwannee river nom ahn et al 2017 therefore nom compete with hedp and pbtc to react with so4 and oh according to the fraction calculation see lutze et al 2015b for further information s 70 of so4 and 50 of the formed oh is scavenged by nom which causes a reduction in the concentration of both radicals as well as the compound degradation 3 5 degradation in real concentrate hedp and pbtc degradation in real ro concentrates with ozone and uv persulfate was investigated and the generation of orthophosphate during this process was quantified a decrease in organophosphonate degradation was observed for both oxidative processes in concentrates compared to buffered medium whereas the degradation increases in comparison to the synthetic matrix except for the pbtc degradation by uv persulfate all experiments in the synthetic matrix ozonation and uv persulfate treatment showed less than 10 degradation for both compounds fig 7 as mentioned before the used suwannee river nom is highly ozone and oh consumptive and not well comparable to the nom of groundwater pbtc degradation with uv persulfate showed in both concentrates less than 10 o po4 formation whereas hedp showed 60 in concentrate a and 70 in concentrate b at a fluence of about 62 kj m 2 both concentrates have a similar composition see table 1 but concentrate a had a higher bicarbonate concentration which leads to slightly higher scavenger capacity the difference between both organophosphonates at first sight looks conspicuous both have similar second order reactions rate constants with oh and so4 but the degradation of pbtc in real matrix is much lower than that of hedp an explanation is given by the single matrix experiment the uv persulfate degradation of pbtc is stronger hindered by bicarbonate than hedp degradation due to scavenging of oh and so4 whereas the pbtc degradation is less hindered by the presence of chloride than hedp see fig 6 as mentioned before in the uv persulfate process the so4 react with cl yielding cl the effect of bicarbonate on the degradation of pbtc and hedp can also be explained by direct reaction of so4 an oh and by scavenging cl which inhibits the transformation of so4 to oh lutze et al 2015b the ozone and uv persulfate based treatment of hedp and pbtc in real concentrates showed similar trends and the degradation was significantly reduced in both concentrates compared to buffered medium see fig 7 the highest tested ozone dose of 0 365 mm corresponds to an z spec ozone dosage of 1 3 mg o3 mg doc in concentrate a and in concentrate b 1 9 mg o3 mg doc in concentrate b neglecting the doc from antiscalant addition resulting in maximal 50 hedp degradation and 10 pbtc degradation this is similar to the ozone dose per doc concentration in wastewater and drinking water ozonation where ca 1 mg o3 mg doc is required for degradation of ozone recalcitrant pollutants however even though the dose of o3 for treatment of ro concentrates is high its low mass flow may make the ozone based treatment of ro concentrate more cost effective e g lower capital costs etc lee et al 2013 lutze et al 2015b furthermore concentrate a and b showed no significant difference which can be explained by a similar oh scavenging rate hedp degradation was still much better compared with pbtc which can be explained by the lower reactivity of pbtc towards all investigate oxidants table 2 comparing ozonation and uv persulfate under the aspect of bromate formation the formation potential of bromate during ozonation is higher than in the process of uv persulfate whereby due to the formation of oh in the uv persulfate process the oxidation of bromide to bromate is theoretically possible but hindered by scavenging of reactive bromine species especially with nom lutze et al 2014 even though the level of bromide in concentrate b br 1 1 mg l is 10 fold higher than in concentrate a br 0 14 mg l in both tested concentrates an excessive bromate formation rate could be observed see table 1 and table s7 this is an important hint for future planning of treatment steps of ro concentrates since considering an enrichment factor of 5 7 in ro processes the outgoing bromide concentration in the raw water is quite low at which bromate formation would not be directly in focus during ozonation at present there is no environmental limit value regulating the discharge of bromate containing wastewater into the aquatic environment however a limit value of 50 Âµg l is currently discussed in germany following swiss guidelines and should be considered when assessing the ozonation of concentrates mikroschadstoffe nrw 2018 taking economical aspects into account ozonation is the favoured oxidation processes to reduce both organophosphonates the energy demand to degrade 10 pbtc in the concentrates with ozonation is with 0 26 kwh m3 is significantly lower than the energy demand for the same degradation rate with uv persulfate 5 9 kwh m3 in the concentrates however both processes are not efficient to reduce pbtc under economical aspects in case of hedp the energy demands for uv persulfate 3 0 kwh m3 is ten times higher to reduce 60 of the substance in comparison to ozonation 0 26 kwh m3 in general the energy demand for micropollutant degradation during ozonation and aops depend on the ozone consuming matrix components such as nom one tool to compare the energy consumption of treatment processes is the values electric energy per order eeo which is strongly influenced of the reactivity of the micropollutants miklos et al 2018 did a data evaluation of numerous aops and their eeo for ozonation they reported a median eeo of 0 15 kwh m3 order and for uv persulfate an eeo of 0 67 kwh m3 order the higher energy demand of ozonation and uv persulfate observed in the present study may be explained by the high concentration of antiscalants in comparison to micropollutants 4 conclusion hedp and pbtc as n free phosphonate antiscalants can be eliminated from ro concentrate by oh radicals and sulfate radicals while ozone barely reacts with the sulfonates we evaluate the influence of several water matrix substituents on the level of degradation the bicarbonate amount of a water body is the main limiting factor of antiscalant degradation by scavenging of oh silicate sulfate and chloride have negligible effects but the potential of chlorinated by product formation has to be considered in the overall evaluation of the oxidative processes careful consideration is needed when choosing a suitable oxidation process to eliminate hedp and pbtc by considering not only oxidation efficiency but also cost efficiency and formation of possible transformation by products in addition investigation of hedp and pbtc oxidation in the presence of other cations that are commonly found in water such as manganese iron and magnesium would be useful to observe their complexation effect to the compound reaction kinetics and degradation rate in real concentrates only hedp can be degraded in ozonation and uv persulfate while pbtc degradation is not possible a typical ozone dose normally applied in wastewater treatment plants was reported to be 0 5 mg ozone mg doc altmann et al 2014 at this concentration only up to 20 hedp and 10 pbtc were degraded in ro concentrate as described by orthophosphate formation hedp may be degraded to a larger extent at higher ozone doses however this will be accompanied by excessive bromate formation uv persulfate may degrade up to 40 hedp at a fluence of 20 kj m 2 considering both energy consumption and by product formation uv based processes such as uv persulfate but also uv h2o2 may be the better choice the energy demand is still reasonable and formation of cancerogenous bromate can be prevented basically when assessing the effectiveness of elimination it must be decided which criterion is the goal of oxidation if it is the removal of the initial substance it is effectively possible with both investigated processes even in the case of pbtc with a low ozone dose however if mineralization or full conversion to orthophosphate is considered as a criterion the processes of ozonation and uv persulfate are not an economical solution for n free phosphonate antiscalants removal since no cost effective alternative treatment methods exist and ro concentrates comprise small water volumes treatment by oxidation is a possible solution to reduce the release of antiscalants in the aquatic environment thereby formed phosphate can be eliminated by addition of iron salts or calcium and then physically separated from water thus preventing phosphate emissions into the environment however phosphate containing organic products may still enter the aquatic environment with unknown effects this issue has to be addressed in future studies

14972,reverse osmosis ro is an advanced technology used to produce potable water from a variety of water sources including surface water seawater and wastewater the yield of the product water from the ro systems is increased by the addition of antiscalants which prevent scaling from calcium and other ions removal of antiscalants from ro concentrate can induce the precipitation of oversaturated scale forming substances enable additional water recovery from ro concentrates and reduce the risk of eutrophication after concentrate disposal into the receiving water e g river water this study aims to provide a better insight into oxidation reactions of the n free phosphonate antiscalants 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp and 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid pbtc with ozone hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radicals so4 ozone barely reacts with hedp and pbtc at ph 7 k 10 m 1 s 1 while second order reaction rates of so4 and oh were determined to be in the range 107 108 m 1 s 1 sulfate silicate and chloride matrices increased hedp ozone degradation rate possibly due to metal complexation effect whereas carbonate and chloride hindered pbtc ozone degradation and natural organic matter nom inhibited both hedp and pbtc degradation through scavenging of oh the so4 radical based oxidation process of hedp and pbtc is mainly inhibited by carbonate and nom interestingly only hedp degradation is inhibited by chloride whereby the pbtc could not be fully degraded degradation 60 the oxidation of pbtc is in real ro concentrates in both processes limited to 10 degradation whereas hedp could be degraded up to 60 with ozone and uv persulfate application keywords organophosphonate antiscalant ozone hydroxyl radical sulfate radical reverse osmosis concentrate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro is a common treatment option to reduce hardness from ground water and to desalinate sea water or brackish water for drinking water production ro membranes reject up to 20 of the influent water flow on the concentrate side the concentrate contains the rejected salts micropollutants and chemical agents at concentrations of 4 7 fold higher than in the feed water malaeb and ayoub 2011 to prevent membrane scaling and biofouling antiscalants and biocides are commonly added to the feed water antiscalants are chelating agents that prevent salt precipitation on the membrane by complexation of multivalent metal cations e g calcium manganese magnesium iron and precipitation of salts e g carbonates sulphates silicates ghafour 2003 according to the german environmental agency umweltbundesamt 2019 the phosphonate antiscalants aminotris methylenephosphonic acid atmp ntmp diethylenetriaminepenta methylene phosphonic acid dtpmp 1 hydroxyethylidene 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp and phosphonobutanetricarboxylic acid pbtc are approved for application in drinking water production and according to the regulations maximal 2 5 mg l dry matter of the technical product can be added to the feed water besides water treatment antiscalants are commonly applied in textile and paper production household and industrial cleaners cooling water systems and oil production rott et al 2018 due to the wide range of uses these substances are widely distributed in the environment phosphonates were found in the wastewater influents in different municipal wastewater treatment plants at concentrations ranging from limit od detection lod 1 Âµg l to 579 Âµg l armbruster et al 2019 rott et al 2020 rott et al 2018 and in textile wastewater influents up to 7 2 mg l wang et al 2019a in surface waters phosphonates were observed at concentrations between 0 08 39 Î¼g l rott et al 2020 wang et al 2019a reported hedp concentrations up to 26 mg kg in the suspended matter of river water and rott et al 2020 reported 3 mg kg of total phosphorus load of river sediments in germany before and 32 mg kg after wastewater discharged hedp and pbtc accounted for the largest proportion of the total phosphonates in both wastewater influents and surface waters rott et al 2020 the presence of phosphonates in natural water can cause various adverse effects to aquatic systems phosphonates are subjected to natural degradation mechanisms such as chemical degradation or photodegradation which results in the release of orthophosphate o po4 3 lesueur et al 2005 nowack 2003 therefore if cooling water or membrane concentrate is directly discharged into the environment the phosphorus concentrations in water bodies would increase which in turn causes eutrophication rott et al 2018 moreover high concentrations of phosphonates in wastewater treatment plants also affects wastewater treatment processes by hindering phosphate precipitation and increasing phosphorus levels which potentially results in the discharge of phosphorus containing effluent to the environment rott et al 2018 due to excellent chelating effects remobilization of toxic metals such as copper cadmium and lead from polluted sediments by phosphonates was observed bordas and bourg 1998 a slight remobilization of zinc was also discovered with ntmp and hedp gledhill and feijtel 1992 in addition feiner et al 2015 also reported toxicity of ro concentrates containing phosphonate antiscalants to aquatic organisms toxicity was tested with amphipods and the results revealed a higher ecotoxicological relevance of antiscalants furthermore phosphonates could induce harmful algae blooms by the release of iron and phosphate ions wang et al 2020 due to the above mentioned impacts of phosphonates their removal from ro concentrates is of great importance in terms of both environmental relevance as well as wastewater treatment to prevent water pollution little research has been done on the application of treatment methods to the abatement of antiscalants in wastewater and concentrates conventional wastewater treatment with the use of flocculation was previously applied to remove phosphonates but was not successful for organically polluted waters rott et al 2017 also aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation seems to be uncapable for antiscalant treatment nowack 2003 ozonation and advanced oxidation processes including fenton process uv chlorine persulfate s2o8 2 based and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 based aops have recently been proven to effectively degrade phosphonates greenlee et al 2014 huang et al 2022 rott et al 2017 wang et al 2019b xu et al 2019 however most of the studies did not report the reaction kinetics of phosphonates and the oxidative species precisely to enable optimization of water treatment processes furthermore none of these studies provide a systematic investigation of the influences of matrix components and radical scavengers to the degradation efficiency in synthetic and real matrices hedp and pbtc account for the majority of the used antiscalants due to their diverse applications in the textile and detergent industries in this study their reaction kinetics and degradation in ozonation and uv persulfate were investigated furthermore second order rate constants of ozone oh and so4 with hedp and pbtc and their ca2 complexes were determined to examine the reactivity the impacts of water chemical parameters e g chloride carbonate sulfate and organic matter on n free organophosphonates degradation and the potential of ozonation and uv persulfate for their degradation in real ro concentrates were examined 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and equipment hedp was obtained from sigma aldrich taufkichen germany and pbtc 50 in water from the tokyo chemical industry co ltd tokyo japan the technical product of hedp was provided by zschirmmer schwarz lahnstein germany and the technical product of pbtc from kurita viersen germany all reagents were used directly as commercially available analytical grade and a complete list of used solvents and reagents can be found in the supplementary information si tab s1 the used instruments and equipment are listed in table s2 in si 2 2 determination of rate constants 2 2 1 determination of ozone reaction rate the reaction rate constants of hedp and pbtc with ozone were investigated under pseudo first order conditions with the substrates in excess to ozone the experiments were carried out at three different ph values 5 7 and 9 with 20 mm borate buffer sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid was used to adjust ph of the solution to the respective ph the use of borate buffer for oxidation experiments of phosphonates has previously been reported since it does not react with the dissolved ozone or affect the chemical equilibrium due to phosphate production as in the case of phosphate buffer greenlee et al 2014 xu et al 2019 tert butanol t buoh was used as oh scavenger fraction of oh reacting with t buoh 95 f 0 95 to monitor the ozone reaction rates with insignificant oh interference see si furthermore to observe the effect of calcium ca2 complexation on the compound oxidation the experiments were performed with the addition of ca2 prepared from cacl2 2 h2o with a concentration of 2 5 times of the compound concentration the ozone reaction rate of hedp with ca2 were determined by ozone depletion with excess of hedp ozone was determined by using the indigo method because direct ozone measurement was hindered by ca2 bader and hoignÃ© 1981 for details see si other reaction rates were measured by uv absorption of ozone at 258 nm bader and hoignÃ© 1981 2 2 2 determination of oh and so4 rate constants the rate constants of the reaction between oh and so4 with the antiscalants under study were determined by uv h2o2 or uv persulfate oxidation a low pressure mercury lamp was installed in a merry go round photoreactor for uv irradiation fluence rate was determined by uridine actinometry in pure water according to von sonntag and schuchmann 1992 so4 rate constants with hedp and pbtc were determined by competition kinetics with 4 chlorobenzoic acid pcba k so4 pcba 3 6 108 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 sodium persulfate was dosed at 1 mm to generate so4 upon uv radiation as oh are normally produced during so4 oxidation in presence of chloride t buoh was added to minimize the bias of oh to the competition experiments 3 mm of t buoh was added as it has been previously reported to scavenge more than 95 of oh while consuming only 3 8 of so4 at 1 10 3 m persulfate dose lutze et al 2015a the experiments were carried out with the addition of 200 Âµm hedp or pbtc and 100 Âµm pcba excess methanol 1 m was added during sampling and the time dependent concentrations of hedp pbtc and pcba were determined the data were evaluated based on eq 1 where k c and k m are the rate constants for the competitor c and target compound m respectively the irradiation time is represented by t 1 l n m t m 0 k o x m k o x c l n c t c 0 by plotting l n m t m 0 against l n c t c 0 the slope is equivalent to the ratio of k o x m k o x c as a result the rate constant k o x m can be calculated from the known reaction rate constant k o x c based on preliminary experiments the influence of direct photolysis could be neglected oh rate constant with pbtc was determined with the same approach only with the exception that benzaldehyde was chosen as competitor k oh ba 4 4 109 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 for oh rate constant with hedp a further competition kinetics approach was used by analyzing the product concentration of a competitor here orthophosphate o po4 3 which is the product of hedp was monitored as a result hedp was considered as the competitor and t buoh k oh t buoh 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 was chosen as the substrate the experiments were done with a constant hedp concentration and varying t buoh concentrations in different ratios according to dodd et al 2006 the irradiation time was set to 20 mins the oh rate constant was calculated by plotting the graph between o po4 3 absence o po4 3 presence 1 vs t buoh 0 hedp 0 the slope corresponds to k oh t buoh k oh hedp 2 3 determination of degradation efficiency hedp and pbtc were tested at total phosphorus concentration of 4 5 mg l 72 5 Âµm hedp and 145 Âµm pbtc the formation of orthophosphate which is a primary oxidation product of phosphonates together with the degradation of the compound was determined to evaluate the extent of hedp and pbtc oxidation and the elimination efficiency in different matrices all experiments were performed at ph 7 in 2 10 2 m borate buffer note that phosphate precipitates as capo4 apart from pure borate buffer the experiments were also carried out in different water matrices and in real concentrates to examine the effect of different ions or organic matter to the compound degradation the following ions were tested sulfate carbonate silicate chloride calcium and bromide in combination with organic matter whereby the applied concentration reflects the real concentration in concentrates furthermore a synthetic matrix containing all the tested ions and organic matter at ph 7 was prepared and tested in degradation experiments details about the applied concentrations are provided in table s6 si the oxidation efficiency of the ozonation and uv persulfate processes were compared as a basis for comparison the experiments with matrix components were carried out with ozone dosage in relation to the number of phosphonate groups of the respective organophosphonate therefore ozone was added in the ratios hedp to ozone of 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 5 1 10 1 15 and pbtc to ozone of 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 this equals ozone dosage up to 1 2 mm besides the addition of matrix substitutes experiments were performed with the addition of t buoh as oh scavenger for suppressing any reaction of oh with hedp and pbtc after addition of ozone the samples were left to react overnight to assure full ozone depletion so4 based degradation was performed as described above and samples were taken within 30 mins 1 m methanol was used to quench low steady state concentrations of so4 which may form upon thermolysis of persulfate during storage lutze et al 2015b subsequently all the samples were analyzed for hedp and pbtc with the use of hplc ms and for orthophosphate formation the applied fluence was calculated via the photon fluence rate determined by uridine actinometry see text s 5 at vanishing absorption by that means the uv radiation reaches all areas in the reactor the degradation of uridine can then be translated into an average fluence rate in the quartz tubes of the merry go round photo apparatus the absorption by the spectral interferences of the real sample was corrected by the morrowitz correction additionally the energy demand including production costs of persulfate has been calculated in analogy to lutze et al 2015b c f photochemical used calculations fluence rate morrowitz correction and energy costs see katsoyiannis et al 2011 2 4 antiscalant degradation in concentrates two concentrates of reverse osmosis treatment were obtained from german drinking water treatment plants dwtp both dwtp are located in central germany and use groundwater as raw water facility a deals with a high nitrate content and facility b deals with strongly sulfate containing waters in regions with very high calcium sulfate concentration the water quality parameters are summarized in table 1 the ro concentrates were spiked with 72 5 Âµm hedp or 145 Âµm pbtc the uv persulfate degradation experiments were performed as described before and the dilution of the concentrate state below 1 the ozonation of hedp and pbtc was evaluated over a dosage from 0 0 365 mm ozone this equals a max ratio of 1 5 a higher dosage of ozone was not possible without a dilution over 10 of the concentrate to ensure the same conditions within one experiment every concentrate sample was diluted by the same factor 10 additionally to the degradation experiments the ozone and hydroxyl radical exposure of the concentrates were obtained an ozone dose normalized to the total organic carbon concentration 0 5 g o3 g toc has often been reported to be used as an operating parameter to compare pollutant degradation with varying toc concentrations lee et al 2013 therefore 0 5 mg o3 mg toc as z specific dose was used to determine the exposures exposures were determined in concentrates with and without extra antiscalant dosage antiscalant are used in high concentration and therefore are not defined as micropollutants an addition of 72 5 Âµm hedp equals 1 73 mg l doc and 145 Âµm pbtc 12 3 mg l doc and their contribution to the total doc must be considered further explanations of the ozone exposure experiments are given in text s4 2 5 analytical methods analysis of hedp and pbtc was carried out with high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry hplc ms equipped with a hydrophilic interaction chromatography hilic column luna 3 Âµm hilic 200 Ã¥ lc column 150 2 mm the column was thermostatted at 35 c and the sample injection volume was 20 Âµl acetonitrile acn and water mixed with 2 5 mm ammonium acetate were used as the eluents for mobile phase with a flow rate of 0 2 ml min gradient mode with the starting conditions 20 water and 80 acn was used the analytes were ionized by an atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization api es in a negative mode with a fragmentor voltage of 70 ev and mass scan of m z 50 300 the drying gas was at 10 5 l min at 350 c with the nebulizer pressure of 35 psi the capillary voltage was 3200 v the retention time of hedp and pbtc was at about 2 1 and 1 9 mins respectively and m z of 205 for hedp and 269 for pbtc in a single ion mode was used for quantification the analysis of hedp and pbtc by hplc ms was performed only for the experiments in borate buffer because in the presence of the added matrix substituents the analysis was hampered hplc dad was used to analyze ba and pcba a c18 column kinetex 5 Âµm evo c18 100 Ã¥ lc column 100 3 mm was used for separation the temperature was set at 25 c and the injection volume was 25 Âµl isocratic mode of 60 methanol and 40 water ph 3 was applied with a flow rate of 0 5 ml min and a total run time of 10 mins ba retention time 2 2 min was monitored at the wavelength of 247 nm and pcba retention time 4 1 min at 234 nm the method to determine orthophosphate concentration previously reported by was armbruster et al 2019 used this method used the molybdenum blue reaction coupled with photometric detection in accordance with din en 1189 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of hedp and pbtc oxidation 3 1 1 reaction rate constants of ozone the reaction rate constants of hedp and pbtc increase with ph fig 1 this can be explained by deprotonation of the phosphonates which increases the electron density in the reaction center i e the alkyl groups see fig 2 thereby ozone may react with the alkyl groups via an h abstract reaction in analogy to formic acid sonntag and gunten 2012 for hedp at ph 5 and 7 the two phosphonate hydrogen atoms fig 2 are deprotonated and the rate constant increases slightly whereas at ph 9 one phosphonate group is completely deprotonated resulting in a further increase of the reaction rate constant pbtc shows a weaker ph dependency in the investigated ph range due to the lower pk a values see fig 2 with ca2 present the reaction rate constant of hedp increases at ph 7 and 9 which is less pronounced in case of pbtc the activating effect of ca2 has been previously reported to increase the reactivity of phosphonate antiscalants with ozone greenlee et al 2014 the reason for this could be the change in stereochemistry caused by cation coordination because ca2 is complexed by the phosphonate groups and as a result the ozone reactive moieties may be better accessible for ozone reactions generally phosphonates have a greater affinity for metal ions at higher ph values which is in agreement with the observed ph dependency of the reactivity gledhill and feijtel 1992 the determined k hedp o3 of 3 63 0 12 m 1 s 1 and k pbtc o3 of 9 16 0 26 10 1 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 are also comparable to the previously reported k hedp o3 of 5 8 10 1 m 1 s 1 huang et al 2022 and k pbtc o3 of 1 2 10 1 m 1 s 1 xu et al 2019 the observed k hedp o3 is also similar to the rate constant of malonic acid of 4 m 1s 1 sonntag and gunten 2012 which is a compound with a similar structure as hedp note that malonic acid has carboxylic acid groups instead of phosphate groups moreover comparable rate constants to hedp and pbtc are also observed for other phosphate containing compounds such as tris 2 chloro isopropyl phosphate tcpp tris 2 chloro ethyl phosphate tcep and tri n butyl phosphate tnbp with rate constants of 1 m 1 s 1 pocostales et al 2010 first of all it has to be mentioned that the amount of tert butanol added for scavenging intrinsic oh radicals can scavenge a fraction of 80 90 oh see si text si3 hence formed oh may have biased the results on ozone reaction kinetics resulting in a slight overestimation due to propagation reactions and accelerated ozone depletion however the strong dependency of reaction kinetics and ph indicates only a minor contribution of oh since their reaction kinetics is very ph dependent due to their low selectivity also the intrinsic formation of superoxide can be ruled out due to the large differences in reaction kinetics at ph 7 and 9 since superoxide has a pka of 4 5 and thus superoxide is nearly fully present as anion at both ph 7 and 9 3 1 2 reaction rate constants of oh and so4 the determined reaction rate constants of oh and so4 with hedp and pbtc are presented in table 2 the reaction rates determined in this study are in agreement with k hedp oh of 5 4 108 m 1 s 1 huang et al 2022 and k pbtc oh of 7 83 108 m 1 s 1 xu et al 2019 at ph 7 comparing k hedp oh and k pbtc oh with other phosphate containing compounds which are tcpp and tcep a similar rate constant was also discovered with k tcpp oh of 7 0 108 m 1 s 1 and k tcep oh of 7 4 108 m 1 s 1 pocostales et al 2010 the results of k hedp oh display a weak ph dependency since the reaction rate increases by a factor of two at ph 9 overall the effect of ph on the reaction kinetics is significant smaller compared to ozone this can be explained with the low selectivity of oh and has been observed for numerous other compounds with dissociation centres in contrast to hedp k pbtc oh does not substantially increase at ph 9 k 2 90 4 75 108 m 1 s 1 this can be explained with the larger alkyl group between the phosphonates of pbtc compared to hedp therefore the increase in electron density due to deprotonation might have only little to no effect to h abstraction reaction of oh at ch bond wang et al 2019b investigated oh reaction kinetics of ntmp another common phosphonate antiscalants and also reported that ph had little impact on oh reactivity toward ntmp despite the change in speciation which also is in line with the obtained pbtc oh reaction rate constants the apparent reaction rate constants of hedp and pbtc with so4 also indicated no ph dependency this was also observed for other antiscalants such as ntmp k ntmp so4 2 4 3 5 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 4 to 11 5 wang et al 2019b in addition the degradation of other simple phosphate containing compounds with similar structures compared to hedp and pbtc i e tcpp and tcep by uv persulfate also displayed no change in reaction kinetics in the ph range of 3 to 9 ou et al 2017 yu et al 2019 the reaction kinetics of so4 is about an order of magnitude below the reaction kinetics of oh which is in line with h abstraction reactions of other compounds such as aliphatic alcohols clifton and huie 1989 overall the oh reaction rates are quite low and comparable with other h abstractions of aliphatic compounds e g k oh plus tert butanol 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 which is similar to hedp and pbtc at ph 5 and 7 however the ozone reaction rates of tert butanol is 1 10 3 m 1 s 1 which is several orders of magnitude below the ozone reaction kinetics with hedp and pbtc table 2 this is surprising since the reaction mechanisms of ozone and oh reactions with hedp pbtc and tert butanol is probably the same i e h abstraction to this end an explanation for this observation is lacking 3 2 ozone and hydroxyl radical exposure ozone and oh exposures allow to predict micropollutant oxidation during ozonation whereby the ozone exposure and hydroxyl radical scavenging is mainly influenced by the nom and carbonate bicarbonate concentration of a natural water the rct value representing the ratio of the oh exposure to the o3 exposure is a useful tool to compare water bodies and is typically in the range of 10 9 10 8 for various water quality parameters elovitz and von gunten 1999 ozone and oh exposure were measured for the concentrates a and b within 2 days upon receipt note that concentrate a was diluted to arrive at a toc concentration of 15 mg toc mg l to enable application of ozone note that the ozone stock solution is limited to a maximal concentration of 1 7 mm ozone the rct of the concentrates a and b as well as for the synthetic matrix without antiscalants are shown in fig s2 si same matrices with hedp or pbtc are shown in fig s3 si the rct values 1 0 10 8 of both concentrates are within the range 10 8 10 9 of drinking water ozonation the synthetic matrix shows a higher ozone decomposition than the concentrates this can be explained as follows in analogy to carbonate and bicarbonate the antiscalants may have acted as oh radical scavengers and thus inhibiting radical chain reactions which can accelerate ozone decomposition von gunten 2003a this can be explained by used source of organic matter i e suwannee river nom which may contain electron rich moieties than natural organic matter of the concentrations from groundwater which is mainly electron poor non degradable organic left from excessive microbial degradation elovitz and von gunten 1999 note that the addition of hedp and pbtc increases the toc content and a higher ozone dosage was necessary for the same ozone dose z specific 0 5 mg o3 mg toc the two antiscalants hedp and pbtc can be considered to be ozone recalcitrant with moderate kinetics with oh and so4 according to lee et al 2013 these compounds would belong to group iv hedp and v pbtc thereby group iv requires 1 mg o3 mg doc for a significant pollutant degradation while compounds of group v can hardly be degraded at all this also agrees with the observation that at an ozone dose of 1 5 1 9 mg o3 mg doc hedp is degraded by only 50 at pbtc by only 10 see below however it has to be mentioned that the antiscalants may not be fully comparable with trace pollutants due to their significant higher concentration 3 3 degradation of hedp and pbtc with ozone hedp and pbtc ozone degradation were investigated in the presence of different real matrix components to examine the effects of different ions or organic matter on the compound degradation in ozonation the degradation was determined by measuring the formation of orthophosphate where the percentage formation of orthophosphate corresponds to the maximum possible release based on the initial phosphonate concentration the results have shown that hedp is degraded to a larger extent than pbtc for example at the highest ozone dosages 1 1 mm ozone approximately 90 of orthophosphate was formed for hedp equals 90 hedp degradation fig 3 compared with 60 for pbtc fig 4 this also is in line with the higher rate constants of hedp than pbtc for both the reactions with ozone and oh in addition for pbtc yields of orthophosphate were substantially smaller ca 60 fig 4 and at an ozone dose of 0 2 mm ratio 1 2 complexing agent ozone the p formation did not further increase this indicates that at this ozone dose p containing products are oxidized which seems to be a secondary orthophosphate source this could be corroborated by higher ozone doses 1 2 mm ratio 1 8 complexing agent ozone which might give rise to further orthophosphate even though pbtc is already degraded the transformation of pbtc phosphorus in another organic p containing form and the high demand of ozone to achieve a partial removal were also reported in previous studies xu et al 2019 addition of t buoh as oh scavenger fraction of oh scavenging 95 significantly inhibited both hedp and pbtc degradation to only around 20 of hedp fig 5 a and 5 of pbtc degradation fig 5b this corroborates that oh is most important for the degradation of the n free phosphonates hedp and pbtc and is in accordance with the very low reaction kinetics of the complexing compounds with ozone to assess the influence of oh scavenging matrix components on the degradation of antiscalants experiments were conducted with bicarbonate 11 mm and nom 2 5 mg l 7 5 mg l the presence of nom clearly reduced ozone oxidation efficiency of both hedp and pbtc nom is composed of organic material such as humic substances polysaccharides proteins and lipids generally ozone reactions with the complexing agents are largely reduced as these moieties of nom compete with the desired removal of the target compound with a higher reactivity and greatly consume ozone gardoni et al 2012 furthermore oh was scavenged by nom resulting in the decrease in degradation of hedp and pbtc fig 5 to evaluate the potential formation of the cancerogenic bromate experiments were performed with low level nom 2 5 mg l and the addition of bromide 1 mg l fig s4 and s5 in si the formation of 6 bromate 100 Âµg l for 70 hedp degradation and 7 bromate 120 Âµg l for 30 pbtc degradation from the available bromide concentration was observed this indicates that these complexing agents cannot be degraded without exceeding bromate standards applied in drinking water ozonation and recommended for wastewater ozonation 10 Âµgl 1 furthermore with both substances there is a 10 reduction in o po4 formation in the presence of bromide compared to the experiments with the same low nom concentration this can be explained by oxidant scavenging by the high bromide levels however it has to be noted that the bromate standard may not apply for the treatment of concentrates by ozone at the moment in case of treated bromate containing concentrates are discharged into natural waters elevated bromate levels may become a problem in drinking water treatment of the receiving water the bicarbonate carbonate system is the main inorganic reactant of oh in a natural water k oh hco3 8 6 106 m 1s 1 k oh co3 2 3 109 m 1s 1 lian et al 2017 and is proposed to have the highest influence on the ozonation efficiency interestingly only pbtc degradation is slightly limited by bicarbonate 11 mm 671 mg l 12 whereas hedp showed no differences at all this may indicate that also formed carbonate radicals may be able to degrade the complexing agents except for calcium none of the investigated inorganic matrix components showed a positive or negative effect on the organophosphonate degradation interestingly calcium complexation resulted in a reduced degradation of hedp and no effect on pbtc but in the presence of high chloride anions and calcium an inhibition of 10 pbtc degradation was observed which was according the results on reaction kinetics see above and the current literature not expected greenlee et al 2014 3 4 degradation of hedp and pbtc with sulfate radicals in uv persulfate processes both so4 and oh contribute to the degradation of hedp and pbtc as in the process of ozonation a higher degradation of hedp fig 6 a than pbtc fig 6b was achieved at a fluence of about 20 kj m 2 hedp is completely mineralized to orthophosphate in the uv persulfate process silicate 2 mm and sulfate 17 mm 1633 mg l ions had no influence on antiscalant degradation whereby the addition of bicarbonate carbonate 11 mm 671 mg l reduced the degradation to only 87 and 16 orthophosphate formation from hedp and pbtc of about 75 kj m 2 as mentioned before bicarbonate and carbonate scavenge oh furthermore they scavenge so4 k so4 hco3 2 8 106 m 1 s 1 k so4 co3 2 6 1 106 m 1 s 1 canonica et al 2005 and an intrinsic formation of carbonate radicals is possible however carbonate radicals are less reactive towards organic compounds than other radicals li et al 2017 overall this results in the highest influence by bicarbonate carbonate on a reduced degradation rate the highest inhibitory effect of bicarbonate on an aop process was also reported for hedp degradation by uv chlorine huang et al 2019 the sensitivity of the uv persulfate towards chloride mainly depends on the chloride concentration all tested cl concentrations 2 52 mm 70 1843 mg l had only minor effects on the pbtc degradation see fig 6b and s7 a cl concentration of up to 2 mm has no impact on the degradation of hedp but the degradation decreased by increased cl concentration from 90 at 10 mm cl to 65 hedp degradation at 52 mm cl due to the scavenging effect of cl compare fig s6 in si so4 and oh reacts with chloride ion with rate constants of 2 7 108 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 and 4 3 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 respectively whereby oh react with cl into hocl and due to various equilibria the oxidation of cl by oh at ph 7 is calculated by von gunten 2003b to be 103 m 1s 1 and can be neglected so4 mainly reacts with cl to cl at the given cl concentrations cl can react with cl under the formation of cl2 this intermediate may react with water to h2ocl and hocl while the latter intermediate forms oh and cl at ph 5 lutze et al 2015b as the final ph of so4 degradation experiment was monitored to be 3 3 this favours the generation of cl and partly suppresses the formation of oh from hocl since cl is rapidly scavenged by cl to form cl2 which has a lower oxidation potential cl cl 2600 mv and cl2 2 cl 2300 mv wardman 1989 or turned over into oh formation of cl may be less important for antiscalant degradation consequently so4 oxidation in chloride matrix resulted in lower degradation efficiency huang et al 2019 investigated the degradation of hedp in uv chlorine processes and their results agree that chloride concentration above 5 mm inhibited phosphorus transformation interestingly the degradation of hedp present as ca2 complex is reduced about 20 whereas the ca2 pbtc degradation is slightly increased degradation of hedp and pbtc by so4 was suppressed in nom 2 5 mg l matrix which can be explained by radical scavenging by nom nom reacts with oh with 3 3 108 mc 1s 1 while k so4 nom was reported to be 4 6 106 mc 1s 1 for suwannee river nom ahn et al 2017 therefore nom compete with hedp and pbtc to react with so4 and oh according to the fraction calculation see lutze et al 2015b for further information s 70 of so4 and 50 of the formed oh is scavenged by nom which causes a reduction in the concentration of both radicals as well as the compound degradation 3 5 degradation in real concentrate hedp and pbtc degradation in real ro concentrates with ozone and uv persulfate was investigated and the generation of orthophosphate during this process was quantified a decrease in organophosphonate degradation was observed for both oxidative processes in concentrates compared to buffered medium whereas the degradation increases in comparison to the synthetic matrix except for the pbtc degradation by uv persulfate all experiments in the synthetic matrix ozonation and uv persulfate treatment showed less than 10 degradation for both compounds fig 7 as mentioned before the used suwannee river nom is highly ozone and oh consumptive and not well comparable to the nom of groundwater pbtc degradation with uv persulfate showed in both concentrates less than 10 o po4 formation whereas hedp showed 60 in concentrate a and 70 in concentrate b at a fluence of about 62 kj m 2 both concentrates have a similar composition see table 1 but concentrate a had a higher bicarbonate concentration which leads to slightly higher scavenger capacity the difference between both organophosphonates at first sight looks conspicuous both have similar second order reactions rate constants with oh and so4 but the degradation of pbtc in real matrix is much lower than that of hedp an explanation is given by the single matrix experiment the uv persulfate degradation of pbtc is stronger hindered by bicarbonate than hedp degradation due to scavenging of oh and so4 whereas the pbtc degradation is less hindered by the presence of chloride than hedp see fig 6 as mentioned before in the uv persulfate process the so4 react with cl yielding cl the effect of bicarbonate on the degradation of pbtc and hedp can also be explained by direct reaction of so4 an oh and by scavenging cl which inhibits the transformation of so4 to oh lutze et al 2015b the ozone and uv persulfate based treatment of hedp and pbtc in real concentrates showed similar trends and the degradation was significantly reduced in both concentrates compared to buffered medium see fig 7 the highest tested ozone dose of 0 365 mm corresponds to an z spec ozone dosage of 1 3 mg o3 mg doc in concentrate a and in concentrate b 1 9 mg o3 mg doc in concentrate b neglecting the doc from antiscalant addition resulting in maximal 50 hedp degradation and 10 pbtc degradation this is similar to the ozone dose per doc concentration in wastewater and drinking water ozonation where ca 1 mg o3 mg doc is required for degradation of ozone recalcitrant pollutants however even though the dose of o3 for treatment of ro concentrates is high its low mass flow may make the ozone based treatment of ro concentrate more cost effective e g lower capital costs etc lee et al 2013 lutze et al 2015b furthermore concentrate a and b showed no significant difference which can be explained by a similar oh scavenging rate hedp degradation was still much better compared with pbtc which can be explained by the lower reactivity of pbtc towards all investigate oxidants table 2 comparing ozonation and uv persulfate under the aspect of bromate formation the formation potential of bromate during ozonation is higher than in the process of uv persulfate whereby due to the formation of oh in the uv persulfate process the oxidation of bromide to bromate is theoretically possible but hindered by scavenging of reactive bromine species especially with nom lutze et al 2014 even though the level of bromide in concentrate b br 1 1 mg l is 10 fold higher than in concentrate a br 0 14 mg l in both tested concentrates an excessive bromate formation rate could be observed see table 1 and table s7 this is an important hint for future planning of treatment steps of ro concentrates since considering an enrichment factor of 5 7 in ro processes the outgoing bromide concentration in the raw water is quite low at which bromate formation would not be directly in focus during ozonation at present there is no environmental limit value regulating the discharge of bromate containing wastewater into the aquatic environment however a limit value of 50 Âµg l is currently discussed in germany following swiss guidelines and should be considered when assessing the ozonation of concentrates mikroschadstoffe nrw 2018 taking economical aspects into account ozonation is the favoured oxidation processes to reduce both organophosphonates the energy demand to degrade 10 pbtc in the concentrates with ozonation is with 0 26 kwh m3 is significantly lower than the energy demand for the same degradation rate with uv persulfate 5 9 kwh m3 in the concentrates however both processes are not efficient to reduce pbtc under economical aspects in case of hedp the energy demands for uv persulfate 3 0 kwh m3 is ten times higher to reduce 60 of the substance in comparison to ozonation 0 26 kwh m3 in general the energy demand for micropollutant degradation during ozonation and aops depend on the ozone consuming matrix components such as nom one tool to compare the energy consumption of treatment processes is the values electric energy per order eeo which is strongly influenced of the reactivity of the micropollutants miklos et al 2018 did a data evaluation of numerous aops and their eeo for ozonation they reported a median eeo of 0 15 kwh m3 order and for uv persulfate an eeo of 0 67 kwh m3 order the higher energy demand of ozonation and uv persulfate observed in the present study may be explained by the high concentration of antiscalants in comparison to micropollutants 4 conclusion hedp and pbtc as n free phosphonate antiscalants can be eliminated from ro concentrate by oh radicals and sulfate radicals while ozone barely reacts with the sulfonates we evaluate the influence of several water matrix substituents on the level of degradation the bicarbonate amount of a water body is the main limiting factor of antiscalant degradation by scavenging of oh silicate sulfate and chloride have negligible effects but the potential of chlorinated by product formation has to be considered in the overall evaluation of the oxidative processes careful consideration is needed when choosing a suitable oxidation process to eliminate hedp and pbtc by considering not only oxidation efficiency but also cost efficiency and formation of possible transformation by products in addition investigation of hedp and pbtc oxidation in the presence of other cations that are commonly found in water such as manganese iron and magnesium would be useful to observe their complexation effect to the compound reaction kinetics and degradation rate in real concentrates only hedp can be degraded in ozonation and uv persulfate while pbtc degradation is not possible a typical ozone dose normally applied in wastewater treatment plants was reported to be 0 5 mg ozone mg doc altmann et al 2014 at this concentration only up to 20 hedp and 10 pbtc were degraded in ro concentrate as described by orthophosphate formation hedp may be degraded to a larger extent at higher ozone doses however this will be accompanied by excessive bromate formation uv persulfate may degrade up to 40 hedp at a fluence of 20 kj m 2 considering both energy consumption and by product formation uv based processes such as uv persulfate but also uv h2o2 may be the better choice the energy demand is still reasonable and formation of cancerogenous bromate can be prevented basically when assessing the effectiveness of elimination it must be decided which criterion is the goal of oxidation if it is the removal of the initial substance it is effectively possible with both investigated processes even in the case of pbtc with a low ozone dose however if mineralization or full conversion to orthophosphate is considered as a criterion the processes of ozonation and uv persulfate are not an economical solution for n free phosphonate antiscalants removal since no cost effective alternative treatment methods exist and ro concentrates comprise small water volumes treatment by oxidation is a possible solution to reduce the release of antiscalants in the aquatic environment thereby formed phosphate can be eliminated by addition of iron salts or calcium and then physically separated from water thus preventing phosphate emissions into the environment however phosphate containing organic products may still enter the aquatic environment with unknown effects this issue has to be addressed in future studies

14973,the mainstream application of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox for sustainable n removal remains a challenge similarly with recent additional stringent regulations for p discharges it is imperative to integrate n with p removal this research studied integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas technology to simultaneously remove n and p in real municipal wastewater by combining biofilm anammox with flocculent activated sludge for enhanced biological p removal ebpr this technology was assessed in a sequencing batch reactor sbr operated as a conventional a2o anaerobic anoxic oxic process with a hydraulic retention time of 8 8 h after a steady state operation was reached robust reactor performance was obtained with average tin and p removal efficiencies of 91 3 4 1 and 98 4 2 4 respectively the average tin removal rate recorded over the last 100 d of reactor operation was 118 mg l d which is a reasonable number for mainstream applications the activity of denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms dpaos accounted for nearly 15 9 of p uptake during the anoxic phase dpaos and canonical denitrifiers removed approximately 5 9 mg tin l in the anoxic phase batch activity assays which showed that nearly 44 5 of tin were removed by the biofilms during the aerobic phase the functional gene expression data also confirmed anammox activities the ifas configuration of the sbr allowed operation at a low solid retention time srt of 5 d without washing out biofilm ammonium oxidizing and anammox bacteria the low srt combined with low dissolved oxygen and intermittent aeration provided a selective pressure to washout nitrite oxidizing bacteria and glycogen accumulating organisms as relative abundances of graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox biofilm ebpr a2o ifas nutrient nitrogen phosphorus mainstream data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox has been identified as a sustainable bioprocess for nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater agrawal et al 2018 arora et al 2021 fernÃ¡ndez et al 2016 gonzalez martinez et al 2018 lackner et al 2014 j j li et al 2018 ma et al 2016 qiu et al 2020 ren et al 2022 the main advantages of anammox include lower energy and no external organic carbon requirements as well as lower sludge production and no greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional nitrification denitrification wen et al 2020 however despite the tremendous success of coupling partial nitritation pn and anammox collectively known as pna systems to treat ammonium rich waste streams in sidestream applications mostly for high strength anaerobic digester centrate or filtrate the full scale implementation of mainstream pna remains a challenge le et al 2019 low ammonium concentrations and fluctuating temperatures in mainstream conditions pose a challenge for suppressing the growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nobs unsuppressed nob growth leads to unstable pn and is the main obstacle to the adoption of mainstream pna lotti et al 2015 the presence of canonical heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria poses serious challenge to anammox bacteria for the available nitrate or nitrite moreover effluents from pna systems still contain considerable amounts of total inorganic nitrogen tin in the form of residual nh4 n up to 5 mg l and nearly nitrate equivalent to11 to 16 of each mg nh4 n removed is produced from anammox anabolism cao et al 2017 strous et al 1998 as a result the successful integration of anammox into the mainstream remains an unresolved challenge due to inherent operational challenges and the presence of unreacted nitrogen species e g residual ammonium and in situ produced nitrate in the anammox effluents the later becomes even more troublesome if the treatment plants are regulated tin limits in order to overcome these bottlenecks different solutions have been proposed one of these solutions is the integration of the partial denitrification pdn with anammox pdn utilizes canonical heterotrophic denitrifiers to anoxically reduce nitrate partially to nitrite under controlled conditions the in situ generated nitrite through pdn could be used by anammox to further reduce it to nitrogen gas ahmad et al 2021 ahn et al 2004 cao et al 2019 cui et al 2020 du et al 2020 gao et al 2021 ji et al 2020a ma et al 2020 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 zhuang et al 2022 however pdn still requires organic carbon which could be made available in the main stream waste treatment train theoretically systems operating with pdn and anammox would reduce the cost of external carbon and aeration by 80 and 50 respectiviely another nutrient of concern is phosphorus p the biological removal pathway of p is accomplished through enhanced biological p removal ebpr with increasingly stringent regulations for p discharges into receiving waters more and more utilities are focusing on ebpr hence it becomes imperative to integrate any innovative n removal process with ebpr for a holistic treatment of n and p in municipal wastewater a novel idea would be to pair ebpr driven denitrification with anammox yin et al 2021 to cut the organic carbon requirement further while concurrently removing p denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms dpaos are capable of endogenously reducing no3 and no2 hence potentially serving as an effective denitrification pathway without the need for external organic carbon dosage dissolved oxygen do demand is also reduced for the subsequence aerobic p uptake as po4 3 is partially taken up in the anoxic zone by dpaos another major challenge that hinders anammox processes in mainstream applications is the retention of the slow growing anammox bacteria however this issue could be mitigated by having anammox bacteria grow on carriers as biofilms attached growth biofilms have been found to be more effective in retaining anammox biomass than granular biofilms gao et al 2022 moreover biofilms provide exclusive space for anammox bacteria to grow in addition anammox based biofilms are more tolerant to high do concentrations jiang et al 2020 low temperatures gilbert et al 2014 lackner et al 2015 persson et al 2014 and chemical inhibition zheng et al 2017 thus making attached growth anammox an attractive candidate for mainstream applications attached growth biofilms can also be combined with flocculent activated sludge in a technology known as integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas for process intensification ifas technologies have been proven successful in increasing reactor stability and output for nitrification and anammox processes bai et al 2016 kim et al 2011 regmi et al 2011 veuillet et al 2014 waqas et al 2020 this study applied ifas technology by combining attached growth biofilms with suspended growth flocs in a sequencing batch reactor sbr to remove p and n simultaneously the reactor was fed with real primary effluent collected from a local treatment plant and operated in an a2o anaerobic anoxic oxic configuration the biofilm biomass mainly consisted of ammonium oxidizing aobs and anammox bacteria for pna while the floc biomass mainly consisted of dpaos paos and other groups of bacteria for ebpr denitrification and aerobic c removal the main goal of this project was to assess the feasibility of combining ebpr denitrification nitritation and anammox to simultaneously remove p n and c in real municipal wastewater without organic carbon dosage the specific objectives of this study were 1 to determine the removal efficiency of p n and c 2 to study the interactions between the different functional microorganisms at the substrate and molecular levels 16s rrna gene based microbial community analysis and functional gene expressions and 3 to examine optimum conditions for the synergistic coexistence of these microorganisms for high and stable reactor performance this study s engineering and gene expression data can inform the optimization of integrated ebpr based denitrification and anammox processes to remove p n and c in wastewater treatment findings from this study will contribute to the ongoing efforts in advancing anammox technologies for mainstream energy and carbon efficient nutrient removal applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation a 5 l sbr with an ifas process was investigated in this study the sbr was operated in a sequence of anaerobic anoxic aerobic phases as found in traditional a2o processes with a cycle length of 6 h 4 cycles d each cycle consisted of a 50 min anaerobic phase which included 10 min of feeding a 40 min anoxic phase a 4 h aerobic phase and a 30 min settling decanting phase at the beginning of the anoxic phase exogenous sodium nitrate nano3 was fed to the reactor at a total loading of 19 mg n for each cycle equivalent to 10 mg n l in the feed of 1 9 l to simulate the internal nitrified recycling of the aerobic effluent to the anoxic zone in the conventional continuous flow a2o process the reactor was seeded with suspended biomass from an ongoing lab scale ebpr reactor 20 and activated sludge from central valley water reclamation facility cvwrf salt lake city utah to reach an initial total suspended solids tss concentration of 3 g l mature anammox aob ammonium oxidizing bacteria biofilms grown on carriers anoxk 5 from a pna reactor supplementary information si text s1 were added to the reactor stepwise to make up to 5 of the mixed liquor volume on day 10 10 on day 50 and finally 15 on day 75 during the startup from day 1 to 10 the working volume was 3 l with an exchange volume of 1 l resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 18 h from day 11 to 75 the working

working volume of the reactor was increased to 3 2 l 2 78 l mixed liquor volume and the exchange volume was increased to 1 9 l hrt of 8 8 h total solids retention time srt for the flocs was maintained at 5 d tss and volatile suspended solids vss concentrations of the flocs after steady state were approximately 1 3 and 1 0 g l respectively the reactor was fed with real primary effluent collected weekly and stored at 4 c from cvwrf the characteristics of the primary effluent are listed in table 1 ph was not controlled but regularly monitored and fluctuated between 7 3 8 3 within a cycle n2 was continuously purged at 0 25 0 35 l min during the anaerobic and anoxic phases intermittent aeration 7 min on off was adopted during the aerobic phase air was purged at 0 2 0 4 l min to achieve a do setpoint of 0 4 0 1 mg l during each aeration cycle the reactor was operated at room temperature 22 3 c 2 2 p uptake activity batch test batch experiments were conducted to assess the activities of paos and dpaos for po4 3 uptake with different electron acceptors o2 air no2 and no3 effluent from the reactor was filter sterilized by passing through 0 22 Âµm membrane filters the filtrate was adjusted to a ph of 7 5 by adding 1 n hcl suspended biomass was collected from the reactor at the end of the anaerobic phase and washed twice with the ph adjusted filtrate 10 ml of the washed settled flocs were transferred to 125 ml serum bottles followed by 40 ml of the ph adjusted filtrate to obtain the final volume of 50 ml a well mixed solution 5 ml was then collected for tss and vss analyses for aerobic experiments the bottles were left open to the atmosphere on a shaker at 200 rpm to maintain well mixed conditions for the no2 and no3 assays the bottles were sealed and purged with n2 for 10 min to establish anoxic and well mixed conditions po4 3 was then directly injected into the bottles of each of the respective assays targeting an initial concentration of 20 mg po4 3 p l in the aerobic assays air was purged through needles vigorously and continuously in the bottles from an aquarium pump the experiments were carried out for 120 min for chemical analysis a 5 ml aliquot was withdrawn from each bottle at times 0 15 30 60 90 and 120 min all tests were done in duplicate 2 3 anammox activity assays towards the end of the study two batch assays were performed on days 219 and 226 to confirm the activity of anammox bacteria and to quantify their contributions to the overall tin removal during the micro aerobic phase as feed real primary effluent was collected weekly different batches of feed may have had different effects on anammox activities for this reason the assays were conducted a week apart for two different batches of feed approximately 250 ml of the mixed liquor containing only flocs were withdrawn from the reactor into a flask at the end of the anoxic phase just before the aerobic phase started and ran in parallel to the reactor containing both flocs and aob anammox biofilms till the end of the aerobic phase air purging was provided in the flask flocs only from the same air pump used for the reactor for intermittent aeration synchronization do in the flask was manually controlled samples were withdrawn from both vessels for chemical analysis at the beginning and the end of the tests 2 4 complete cycle analysis and gene expression on day 230 of reactor operation a gene expression study was conducted samples for chemical analyses were taken at 0 feed 10 after feeding 25 mid anaerobic 50 end of anaerobic start of anoxic 70 mid anoxic 90 end of anoxic start of aerobic 110 160 220 280 330 end of aerobic and 360 min effluent end of cycle sludge samples were also collected at the same time intervals except at 0 and 360 min for the gene expression analysis at each sampling point two aliquots of approximately 2 ml of mixed liquor containing flocs were collected and centrifuged immediately at 7000 g for 30 s the supernatants were collected for chemical analysis while the pellet from one aliquot was transferred to a lysis matrix e tube containing glass beads from mp medicals for rna extraction while the other was processed for pha analysis for the biofilm biomass about 1 8 of a carrier was cut and collected in a lysis matrix e tube then 800 Âµl of the rna lysis buffer section 2 7 was added to the lysis tube the mixture was mechanically homogenized using a bead mill bead ruptor 12 omni international at 6 m s for 3 cycles of 1 min running and 5 min resting the lysates were stored at 4 c and rna was then extracted from the lysate on the next day n2o concentrations in the off gas were measured at the beginning of the anoxic phase until the end of the aerobic phase 2 5 dna and rna extraction and two step rt qpcr dna from collected sludge samples was extracted using qiagen powersoil pro qiagen germany kits per the manufacturer s protocols total rna was extracted using quick rna kits zymo research usa genomic dna gdna was removed by an on column dnase kit included in the kits the isolated rna was treated with turbo dnase thermofisher usa to remove trace dna contamination further after the treatment rna was purified

transcription kit thermofisher usa by adding 1000 ng rna for each sample quantitative real time pcr qpcr was done to quantify anammox 16s rrna accumulibacter dpaos paos 16s rrna hzsb amoa and ppk1 ia ppk1 iic ppk1 iid phac narg nirk nirs and rpon rna polymerase sigma 54 factor reference gene genes using primer sets listed in table s1 for both 16s rrna genes the synthetic cdna samples were diluted 100 times before adding to the qpcr reaction mixtures each reaction mixture 20 Âµl contained 10 Âµl of powerup sybr green master mix thermofisher usa 1 Âµl of each primer forward and reverse 10 Âµm 2 Âµl of template and the remainder 6 Âµl was nuclease free water the qpcr conditions for each reaction were applied according to the references listed in table s1 the expressed abundances of the target genes were calculated based on the comparative ct threshold cycle method also known as Î´Î´ct the ct value of the gene of interest at a specific time was subtracted with the corresponding ct value of its reference gene rpon then the difference values were subtracted again with the difference value of the first sample to obtain the Î´Î´ct of each sample gene expression as fold change was expressed as 2 Î´Î´ct qpcr analyses were carried out in triplicate on quantstudio3 thermofisher usa all rna samples had a 260 280 value of 2 09 or higher while their 230 260 values were also high and averaged 2

evaluated by running qpcr on negative reverse transcription control nrtc rna sample without reverse transcription for anammox 16s rrna and accumulibacter 16s rrna in rna samples from biofilms and flocs respectively the average difference in ct value between cdna and nrtc was about 18 5 cycles in the biofilm rna samples while nrtcs for the floc rna samples did not amplify after 40 cycles suggesting that gdna contaminations were negligible 2 6 analytical methods for the lab scale reactor no2 no3 and po4 3 were analyzed using an ion chromatographic method 930 compact ic flex metrohm

bolyen et al 2019 kozich et al 2013 3 results 3 1 reactor performance reactor performance was subdivided into 4 stages based on the amount of the aob anammox biofilms added stage i days 1 9 was the startup period without biofilm media in stage ii days 10 49 the reactor was operated with 5 by volume biofilms in stage iii days 50 74 the reactor operated with 10 biofilms and in stage iv days 75 236 the reactor was operated with 15 biofilm media in stage i the reactor was started only with flocs seeded from a stable ebpr reactor operational in the pi s lab and aerobic activated sludge from a wwtp cvwrf to test the ability of the reactor to perform ebpr during this stage consistent ebpr performance was obtained as effluent po4 3 p was below the detection limit of 0 03 mg p l fig 1 a during this startup period in stage i nitritation also gradually improved as the effluent nh4 n kept decreasing while the effluent no2 n kept increasing fig 1bc no3 n as nano3 was added to the reactor at the beginning of the anoxic phase of each cycle to simulate internal recycling of no3 n from the aerobic cycle zone no3 n loading was gradually increased from about 5 6 to 10 mg n l from the beginning towards the end of stage i fig 1d influent nitrate concentrations were calculated by dividing the mass of no3 n loading in the anoxic phase by the volume of the feed fed to the reactor effluent no3 n was also low during this startup period in stage i leading to high tin removal of about 85 on day 7 fig 1e this high tin removal efficiency could be partly due to denitrification by endogenous decay induced by the high mlss concentration seeded to the reactor and the relatively long hrt 18 h it could also partly due to a high amount of intracellular carbon in the seed sludge in the form of phas which the cells could have used to denitrify due to the high removals of po4 3 p nh4 n and no3 n and improved no2 n accumulation in the effluent the exchange volume was increased from 1 l to 1 5 l per cycle 6 l day on day 7 however on day 9 the po4 3 p removal decreased as the effluent concentration of po4 3 p kept increasing from below the detection limit on day 8 to 4 2 mg p l on day 10 this is partly due to the increasing effluent no2 n concentrations which carried over to the subsequent cycle with the remaining volume causing organic carbon limitation in the next sbr cycle s anaerobic phase to minimize no2 n carry over the working volume of the reactor was dropped from 3 l to 2 5 l on day 10 as a result the hrt also decreased to 10 h anammox biofilms were introduced in the reactor on day 10 by adding aob anammox biofilms grown on anox k5 carriers from the pi s lab at 5 of the mixed liquor volume from day 11 effluent po4 3 p gradually decreased to below the detection limit on day 16 suggesting a full recovery of the ebpr process after no2 n carry over was minimized in stage ii the average effluent nh4 n and no2 n were 6 9 and 6 1 mg n l respectively while no3 n in the final effluent remained low at 0 55 mg n l on average suggesting that the activities of nob were under control stage ii saw the lowest tin removal efficiency at about 70 6 on average due to the high effluent nh4 and no2 on day 50 stage iii aob anammox biofilms were increased to 10 of the mixed liquor volume stage iii days 50 74 saw a significant improvement in nh4 and no2 removal with an average effluent concentration of 2 4 and 2 5 mg n l respectively while average effluent no3 increased to 1 6 mg n l these data indicate towards an increase in anammox activities as more biofilms were added as a result tin removal in stage iii also improved with an average removal efficiency of 85 3 in stage iv days 75 236 aob anammox biofilms were finally increased to 15 on day 75 as a result a higher average tin removal efficiency of 91 1 was obtained ebpr performance remained consistently high during stages iii iv with this stable and desirable tin removal biofilm loading was no longer increased however the rate of biofilm loading to archive stable anammox activities also depends on the characteristics of the inoculum itself which should be further investigated the removal of scod fig 1f was consistent and not affected by the operational changes a summary of the reactor performance for the last 100 days is provided in table 2 during this period the average tin loading rate was 128 9 mg n l d while the average removal rate was recorded at 117 7 mg n l d which is within typical values 100 200 mg n l d of mainstream applications metcalf and eddy inc et al 2013 3 2 microbial ecology dna samples of the flocs and biofilms were extracted on day 213 of reactor operation the microbial community composition of the flocs and biofilms are displayed in fig 2 a b respectively in the flocs the most abundant genotype was aerobic heterotrophic bacteria accounting for at least 32 7 of the total population among them the most abundant group was hydrolyzers in the family of saprospiraceae accounting for about 16 5 of the relative abundance members in this family can hydrolyze and utilize complex organic carbon sources and are typically found in high abundances in activated sludge mcilroy and nielsen 2014 well identified canonical denitrifiers in the genus thauera rhodobacter denitratisoma and zoogloea collectively accounted for 3 7 of the relative abundance in the flocs the most abundant pao dpao related bacteria belonged to the genus candidatus accumulibacter hereafter referred to as accumulibacter accounting for 5 of the relative abundance results from the qpcr analysis showed that clade ia iic and iid 15 1 16 5 43 2 respectively compared to pao 16s rrna were the most abundant accumulibacter in the reactor a similar distribution of accumulibacter clades was found in other studies when real primary effluent was used as the feed camejo et al 2016 roots et al 2020 tetrasphaera another potential pao dpao group which could use complex carbons other than vfas for p release was found in small abundance at 0 3 suggesting its potential involvement in the ebpr process of the reactor kristiansen et al 2012 glycogen accumulated organisms gaos are the main competitors for paos as they also can anaerobically assimilate vfas without contributing to the p removal of the reactor candidatus competibacter was the only group of gaos found in the flocs where their population in the reactor was low 0 16 and would have not significantly affected the performance of the reactor aobs in the genus nitrosomonas and anammox bacteria in the genus candidatus brocadia were found in both flocs and biofilms the aob population in the flocs was 1 5 and 1 1 in the biofilms anammox bacteria population in the flocs was meager at only 0 7 whereas their presence in the biofilms was 29 nobs in the genus nitrospira were only found in the flocs at 0 6 abundance the microbial ecology of the flocs was comparable to that of a full scale ebpr plant albertsen et al 2012 3 3 p and n removal during the anoxic and aerobic phases samples were also collected regularly at the start and end of the anoxic phase in addition to the final effluent to check the activities of dpaos fig 3 a b show the contributions of po4 3 p uptake removal during the anoxic and aerobic phases consistent p uptake during the anoxic phase 15 9 of the total p uptake on average suggests the activity of dpaos the remaining po4 3 p was taken up almost completely during the subsequent aerobic phase fig 3c d show both the removal and removal efficiency of tin in the anoxic and aerobic phases respectively tin removal in the anoxic phase was 5 9 mg l on average contributing to about 22 5 of the overall tin removal in the aerobic phase about 17 5 mg l or 66 7 of tin was removed on average increasing the overall tin removal efficiency to 89 2 on average from fig 3e nox n was removed during the anoxic phase at the expense of scod and po4 3 p these results demonstrate the removal of nox n via denitrification through canonical denitrifiers which used cod and dpaos which used po4 3 p however whether the dpaos used no2 n or no3 n for anoxic p uptake remains unclear a batch experiment was then conducted to test the p uptake activities of dpaos paos by o2 air no2 n and no3 n results fig 3f show that the enriched dpaos could use both no2 n and no3 n in addition to o2 albeit the rate was about 7 times higher in the case of o2 these findings agree with previous studies that found that accumulibacter clade ia could use no3 n and no2 n for p uptake flowers et al 2009 nh4 n removal in the anoxic phase at 0 66 mg n l on average can be used as a surrogate for anammox activities however since the feed primary effluent also contained organic n part of tn in table 1 the activities of the canonical denitrifiers could produce nh4 n as a byproduct of organic carbon degradation as suggested by the observed scod removal at the same time canonical denitrifiers and dpaos could also assimilate nh4 n for cell synthesis making the slight nh4 removal alone inconclusive for the anammox activities in the anoxic phase 3 4 anammox activities in the micro aerobic phase in order to prove and estimate the anammox activities for tin removal during the micro aerobic phase about 250 ml of mixed liquor containing only flocs were withdrawn and run in parallel to the reactor containing both flocs and biofilms at the beginning of the aerobic phase the microbial community analysis in section 3 2 showed that the anammox bacteria population in the flocs 0 7 was negligible compared to the anammox bacterial population in biofilms two tests were conducted on days 219 and 226 during stage iv the results are shown in fig 4 a b po4 3 p was undetected at the end of the tests for both flocs only and flocs with biofilms these results agree with the microbial community data where the majority of the paos were found in the flocs however nh4 n and no2 n in the effluents from the flocs only assays on average were 4 2 and 5 9 mg n l respectively higher than those of the flocs with biofilms assays indicating a higher anammox activity in the biofilm faction the difference between tin removal in the flocs only and in the flocs and biofilms can be used to distinguish tin removal by flocs and biofilms on average the biofilms contributed to about 44 5 of tin removal on an average in the aerobic phase while the flocs accounted for about 37 9 the tin removal from the biofilm fraction could not be attributed to anammox activities alone but rather to the cumulative action of anammox and heterotrophic denitrification nevertheless the lower effluent nh4 n and no2 n and tin concentrations in the mixed liquor containing both flocs and anammox biofilm carriers proved the anammox activities and their contributions to the tin removal in the reactor during the aerobic phase 3 5 cycle analysis with biochemical transformations and gene expression patterns 3 5 1 cyclic biochemical transformations intra and extracellular chemical transformations and gene expression data during a typical cycle were conducted on day 230 fig 5 a shows the changes of n p and c concentrations during the cycle during the anaerobic phase po4 3 p concentration increased at a linear rate 33 8 mg p l h r2 0 997 in the first 25 min and accounted for about 86 of the total po4 3 p released the other 14 was released during remainder of the anaerobic time period this p release coincided with the removal of scod from 137 in the feed to 45 mg l after 50 min and the accumulation of intracellular phas indicating the activities of dpaos paos the anoxic phase was introduced by adding no3 n as nano3 to simulate the internal nitrified recycling of the conventional a2o process after the nitrate feeding the concentration of no3 n in the reactor was 6 1 mg n l at the end of the anoxic phase no3 n was almost completely removed 95 4 along with further scod removal 12 mg l and anoxic p uptake 2 61 mg l by dpaos no2 n accumulation at the end of the anoxic phase was 0 98 mg n l and nh4 n removal was 1 25 mg n l making the overall tin removal in the anoxic phase 6 37 mg n l which was more than the externally provided of no3 n these anoxic chemical transformation patterns were similar to the findings observed in routine reactor sampling described in section 3 3 again the removal of nox n at the expense of scod and po4 3 p was due to both denitrification by canonical denitrifiers and dpaos about 86 5 of po4 3 p was taken up in the first 70 min of the aerobic phase 160 min of the cycle as opposed to about 13 taken up in the anoxic phase the aerobic uptake rate was 14 33 mg p l h compared to 4 03 mg p l h for the anoxic uptake rate po4 3 p concentrations were below the detection limit at 220 min and remained there until the end of the cycle pha content was also quickly utilized with about 63 drop in the first 70 min of the aerobic phase and slowly depleted from about 4 at 160 min to 1 62 mg g tss at 360 min at a constant rate of 0 69 mg g tss h nh4 n was removed at a linear rate of 6 72 mg n l h r2 0 999 throughout the 190 min of the aerobic phase despite the decreasing concentration of nearly 13 folds the aerobic removal rate of tin was also linear until the end of the aerobic phase 330 min of the cycle though at a slightly lower rate of 5 51 mg n l h r2 0 998 this difference resulted from the slight accumulation of no2 n throughout the aerobic phase during which it increased from 0 98 to 4 28 mg n l at 330 min 240 min of the aerobic phase nh4 n was further removed to below the detection limit while no2 n concentration decreased to 2 304 mg n l no3 n concentration stayed below 0 279 mg n l throughout the aerobic phase 90 330 min of the cycle and was below the detection limit in the effluent at the end of the cycle only no2 n was detected as tin with a concentration of 2 18 mg n l the tin removal efficiency for the whole process from the feed and no3 addition in the anoxic phase was 96 whereas po4 3 removal efficiency was nearly 100 3 5 2 gene expressions during a complete reactor cycle the function gene expressions of key genes were also examined to study the responses of the microbial communities in the flocs and biofilms to support our data related to the dynamics of different chemical species measured in the reactor rpon rna polymerase sigma 54 factor was chosen as a reference gene in biofilm and floc samples as it is a constitutive gene with a stable expression level across all time point samples rpon was also used as a reference gene for qpcr normalization for accumulibacter and other bacteria camejo et al 2019 chang et al 2009 fig 5b shows the expression profiles of genes related to dpaos paos in flocs dpaos paos possess ppk1 and phac genes that catalyze reversible reactions of the synthesis and degradation of polyphosphate and pha respectively in general the expression of phac and ppk1 all clades exhibited similar patterns muted in the anaerobic phase except for ppk1 ia which slightly increased by 1 6 folds at the end of the phase their expression levels rose at the end of anoxic phase and kept increasing to the highest at 20 min of the aerobic phase 110 min of the cycle after that their expression levels dropped until the end of the aerobic phase to about the same levels as that of the first sample 10 min of the anaerobic phase the expression level of the accumulibacter 16s rrna gene kept decreasing throughout the anaerobic phase until the middle of the anoxic phase and only increased towards the end of the anoxic phase the gene transcription level kept increasing further into the aerobic phase compared to those of ppk1 and phac with the highest at 70 min of the phase 160 min of the cycle accumulibacter 16s rrna expression level remained high for another hour before declining gradually bacterial cells maintain their ribosome and rrna contents corresponding to their growth bremer and dennis 2008 nomura et al 1984 otto et al 2019 the increase in 16s rrna expression at the end of anoxic and throughout the aerobic phase suggests that dpaos paos accumulibacter were preparing for cell growth in these periods these findings agree with the ebpr metabolic models that suggest pao growth only occurs in the anoxic and aerobic phases due to the low energy requirements when external electron acceptors are available he and mcmahon 2011 fig 5c shows the changes in transcription levels of genes associated with anammox hzsb and anammox 16s rrna in the biofilms and aobs amoa in the flocs and biofilms similar patterns of amoa expression in the flocs and biofilms were observed the presence of trace do in the feed at the beginning of the anaerobic phase could have triggered the upregulation of the gene seen in the middle of the anaerobic phase however despite the absence of do 0 04 mg l after feeding 10 min throughout the anaerobic phase the expression of amoa from both floc and biofilm communities kept increasing aobs have been found to overexpress amoa in response to stress such as low temperatures and chemical inhibition park and ely 2009 radniecki et al 2009 wu et al 2016 however this overexpression has been observed in aerobic conditions and a probable explanation given by the researchers was that aobs may have tried to compensate for the loss of the enzyme activities on the other hand the increased expression of amoa in the anaerobic phase in this present study is interesting and warrants further investigation during the anoxic phase the expression of amoa in both communities decreased the expression of amoa gradually increased throughout the aerobic zone except at the end of the phase the increase in transcription levels of amoa coincided with the removal of nh4 n in the aerobic phase likewise the transcription levels also dropped when nh4 n was exhausted at the end of the aerobic phase the expression of the anammox functional genes can further confirm their activities in the aerobic phase and more importantly in the anoxic phase when substrate data alone could not provide a definitive answer section 3 3 the anammox hzsb gene was also upregulated in the middle of the anaerobic phase like amoa it may have been due to the in situ no2 n production within the biofilms results show that the expression of hzsb increased in the middle of the anoxic phase and further increased to the highest level recorded 12 8 folds higher than in the first sample at 10 min 20 min into the aerobic phase 110 min of the cycle after that surge the expression level of hzsb dropped but remained higher than in the first sample throughout the aerobic phase anammox bacteria consistently expressed hzsb in the aerobic phase even when the aeration was on especially at 20 min 110 min of the cycle proving that they were active in deeper anaerobic layers of the biofilms throughout the aerobic phase veuillet et al 2014 due to the biofilm structure anoxic conditions were likely to be maintained inside the biofilms even when the aeration was on protecting anammox bacteria from exposure to do 0 4 0 1 mg l in the bulk liquid the increased expression of anammox 16s rrna in the anoxic and aerobic phases indicates that anammox bacteria were active and preparing for cell growth providing further evidence for their contributions to tin removal in both phases as anticipated nitrate reductase narg and nitrite reductase nirs and nirk genes in floc and biofilm communities were very active in the anoxic phase as shown in fig 5d in the aerobic phase the expression levels of these genes were higher in the biofilm community than their flocculent counterparts partly due to anoxic conditions which could have been maintained in inner layers of the biofilms the higher expressions of the narg nirs and nirk in the biofilms helps explain the absence of nitrate accumulation from the proven anammox activities in the aerobic phase a previous study also found that heterotrophs inside anammox granules depended on organic secretions from anammox bacteria to denitrify lawson et al 2017 it is worth noting the expression of hzsb and denitrifying genes dropped significantly into the aerobic phase despite the proven tin removal through the anammox pathway and sndn section 3 4 in the biofilm and floc sludges during the aerobic zone the supply of substrates no2 for anammox and no2 no3 for denitrification was stable but low as they were consumed once produced it is postulated that this low supply may have slowed down the production of the corresponding enzymes resulting in the observed drop in the expression levels of hzsb and the denitrifying genes 4 discussion 4 1 ifas configuration with low do for mainstream anammox and ebpr this study applied mainstream conditions such as using conventional a2o configuration and real primary effluent as feed challenges for mainstream anammox applications include retention of anammox bacteria high c n ratio and suppression of nob growth cao et al 2017 x x li et al 2018 trinh et al 2021 traditionally srts in activated sludge processes are governed by nitrification rates which in turn also depend on temperature and do setpoint it has been found that maintaining high srt 10 d for complete nitrification may negatively impact ebpr performance onnis hayden et al 2020 the ifas configuration of this reactor decoupled the autotrophic deammonification pna process from other processes including ebpr denitrification aerobic organic oxidation and nitratation oxidation of no2 to no3 by nobs this decoupling allowed operation at a low flocculent srt 5 d without washing out slow growing aobs and anammox bacteria as they were retained in the reactor through carriers also with the proven anammox activities only a portion of influent nh4 needed to be removed through nitritation by aobs the c n ratio in the primary effluent in this study was 6 3 7 tcod nh4 n which was higher than the optimal range of 0 5 2 for anammox processes daigger 2014 lackner et al 2008 high c n ratios allow ordinary heterotrophs to outcompete anammox bacteria for space and nutrients chamchoi et al 2008 gÃ¼ven et al 2005 however due to the attached growth anammox bacteria were protected in the biofilms for space and from do stresses furthermore the pre anaerobic phase and enrichment of paos dpaos competed out ordinary heterotrophic bacteria which also favored anammox bacteria enrichment after at least 138 days of inoculation in the reactor the relative abundance of anammox bacteria remained high in the biofilms at about 29 fig 2b compared to about 34 5 in the original seed si figs s5 and s6 this slight drop could be from decreased nh4 loading in the seed reactor s filtrate to the present reactor s primary effluent the suppression of nob growth in the aerobic zone has been proven difficult under mainstream conditions agrawal et al 2018 cao et al 2017 han et al 2016 lotti et al 2015 ma et al 2020 in this study with a combination of low flocculent srt 5 d low do setpoint 0 4 0 1 mg l room temperature operation 22 3 c and intermittent aeration nob growth was kept under control indicated by their low abundance in the flocs 0 6 absence in the biofilms and low no3 n concentrations in the effluent laureni et al 2019 also found that nob growth can be controlled under mainstream conditions by segregating anammox bacteria in biofilms from aobs and nobs in flocs pdn has been proven as an alternative pathway to consistently supply no2 n for anammox when there are no effective measures for nob suppression in addition endogenous denitrification has become increasingly popular in implementing pdn due to its high no2 accumulation rates in previous studies however endogenous denitrification mainly relied on gaos by starting up with gaos or ending up shifting from a dpao dominant to a gao dominant population ji et al 2020b li et al 2022 wang et al 2019 2015 yin et al 2021 using gaos for endogenous denitrification would require more organic carbon dosage for ebpr where its performance could also be destabilized in the long run it may eventually make carbon neutral nutrient removal one of the main purposes for bringing anammox to the mainstream in the first place unrealized however in this study the need for partial denitrification was significantly reduced due to the effective strategies for nob washout moreover with efficient implementation of endogenous denitrification through dpaos rather than gaos the reactor was not just able to remove most of the in situ n and p found in the feed but was also able to remove extra n added externally as nano3 in the anoxic phase without external carbon dosage there were several factors employed in this study that led to the suppression of gao growth including room temperature 19 26 c operation presence of a mixture of acetate and propionate in the feed primary effluent low do 0 4 0 1 mg l short floc srt 5 d and ph 7 3 8 3 carvalheira et al 2014 chan et al 2017 lopez vazquez et al 2009 onnis hayden et al 2020 winkler et al 2011 there are some drawbacks to low do operation such as sludge bulking due to the proliferation of filamentous bacteria high dissolved organic nitrogen don formation and high n2o emissions kampschreur et al 2008 liao et al 2022 martins et al 2003 peng et al 2014 however filamentous bacteria were found at low abundance and the sludge volume index svi of the flocs during stage iv of reactor operation ranged from 102 128 ml g these values were within svi values for good settling biomass in the activated sludge process which is below 150 ml g metcalf and eddy inc et al 2013 effluent don table 2 was found at a similar value to typical activated sludge processes zheng et al 2021 these results suggest that do at 0 4 0 1 mg l was not too low to cause bulking problems and don formation it may also have been partly due to the relatively low concentration of tss about 1 3 g l maintained in the reactor that balanced f m food to microorganism ratio and srt thus reducing endogenous decay during the cycle analysis section 2 6 and 3 5 n2o emissions were also monitored the average n2o emission factor in the anoxic and aerobic phases was 0 19 and 3 85 respectively of the tin removed as such the total emission factor was estimated to be 3 02 the aerobic n2o emission factor is similar to that of pna and pao based processes reported in the literature cavanaugh et al 2022 li et al 2020 it has been found that biofilm aob anammox required a relatively high do setpoint in the bulk liquid at 0 5 1 mg l due to resistance in mass transfer christensson et al 2013 in this study despite a lower do setpoint at 0 4 0 1 mg l ammonium removal remained consistently high aobs were found in substantial abundance while also active in both floc and biofilm communities as revealed from the microbial ecology and gene expression data the presence of aobs in the flocs could be one of the reasons for the observed stable nitritation as aobs in the flocs required a lower do setpoint veuillet et al 2014 observed that in the ifas reactor for sidestream pna most aobs grew in the flocs while anammox bacteria predominantly occupied the biofilms for this reason the researchers found that the ifas reactor required a lower do setpoint 0 1 0 25 mg l than the biofilm only reactor 0 6 mg l where aobs and anammox bacteria were comingled in the biofilms 4 2 coexistence of anammox bacteria with dpaos and other groups of microorganisms due to their ability to denitrify dpaos can potentially compete for no2 n with anammox bacteria especially in the anoxic phase when no2 n was limiting from gene expression data fig 5c anammox bacteria were active during the anoxic phase however based on the average nh4 n removal their contributions to tin removal in the anoxic phase was little fig 3e on the other hand the enriched dpaos paos preferred o2 over nox n as an electron acceptor for their p uptake fig 5abf camejo et al 2016 found that no2 n was a poor electron acceptor for dpaos while p uptake through no3 n respiration was incomplete and no3 n removal also ceased when po4 3 p was exhausted hence just after 70 min into the aerobic phase when 99 55 of po4 3 p was already taken up dpaos ability to denitrify was limited making most of no2 n from aob respiration available for anammox bacteria organic carbon was utilized efficiently in each phase of the cycle batch experiments showed that the enriched dpaos paos could only use vfas acetate and propionate for anaerobic p release si text s6 and table s2 p release c uptake for acetate and propionate was 0 59 and 0 45 pmol cmol respectively these values were similar to the values reported in the literature for highly enriched paos with low populated gao sludges diaz et al 2022 hence during the anaerobic phase most vfas were consumed by dpaos paos and by the end of the anoxic phase scod was almost exhausted suggesting that readily biodegradable carbon was already consumed hence the only available organic carbon in the aerobic phase was mostly particulate which also was supported by the high abundance of hydrolyzers in the family of saprospiraceae in the flocs fig 2a tin removal through sndn in the aerobic phase 37 9 in the floc fraction may be partly due to the breakdown of complex organic compounds by the hydrolyzers to simpler forms during aeration making them available for the denitrifiers when the aeration ceased particulate cod has also been found to improve tin removal through sndn klaus et al 2020 dpaos could also have contributed to the sndn in the aerobic phase after p depletion in the aerobic phase dpaos could use their stored pha to denitrify to gain maintenance energy lu et al 2007 pha content was found to consistently drop after p depletion occurred 160 min into the cycle fig 5a in the cycle analysis test the nh4 removal rate in the aerobic phase fig 5a was constant during the initial stage of the aeration phase oxygen was consumed by several functional groups such as pao aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and aob once organic c was consumed from the bulk liquid more o2 became available to aob which is reflected by a sharp increase in ammonium oxidizing capacity as the aerobic phase progressed also as more nitrite accumulated in the aerobic phase anammox activities should have increased hence providing another sink to nh4 and compensating for the removal rate loss by aobs with decreasing nh4 concentration high and stable removal of c p and n suggests the harmonious coexistence of autotrophic aobs anammox bacteria with heterotrophic dpaos paos denitrifiers and aerobes 5 conclusions the integration of ebpr and pna processes was proven successful in removing p and n without external carbon dosage sustained aob and anammox growth was enabled through attached growth on ifas system while ebpr was predominantly occurring in the suspended sludge fraction the following conclusions can be made from this study decoupling ebpr and nitritation anammox into two sludges flocs and biofilms allowed the reactor to be operated at a low srt without washing out slow growing aobs and anammox for reliable ebpr performance while maintaining high tin removal efficiency with a low do setpoint 0 4 0 1 mg l and intermittent aeration this low srt operation provided selective pressure against nobs and gaos under mainstream wastewater conditions low do setpoint also maintained anammox activities and sndn throughout the aerobic phase anammox activities and their contributions to tin removal were well proven from the evidence at the substrate and genetics levels dpaos were enriched and their activities for p uptake in the anoxic phase helped remove the majority of tin in the anoxic phase without organic carbon dosage increasing the reactor s capability to remove tin in a carbon neutral manner incorporating anammox into aerobic zones would significantly reduce the internal recycle flow rates typically required by the traditional a2o process as a considerable amount of tin was already removed by anammox activities low internal recycle flow rates result in small anoxic and aerobic reactor footprints thus reducing capital and operational costs further microbial community

14973,the mainstream application of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox for sustainable n removal remains a challenge similarly with recent additional stringent regulations for p discharges it is imperative to integrate n with p removal this research studied integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas technology to simultaneously remove n and p in real municipal wastewater by combining biofilm anammox with flocculent activated sludge for enhanced biological p removal ebpr this technology was assessed in a sequencing batch reactor sbr operated as a conventional a2o anaerobic anoxic oxic process with a hydraulic retention time of 8 8 h after a steady state operation was reached robust reactor performance was obtained with average tin and p removal efficiencies of 91 3 4 1 and 98 4 2 4 respectively the average tin removal rate recorded over the last 100 d of reactor operation was 118 mg l d which is a reasonable number for mainstream applications the activity of denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms dpaos accounted for nearly 15 9 of p uptake during the anoxic phase dpaos and canonical denitrifiers removed approximately 5 9 mg tin l in the anoxic phase batch activity assays which showed that nearly 44 5 of tin were removed by the biofilms during the aerobic phase the functional gene expression data also confirmed anammox activities the ifas configuration of the sbr allowed operation at a low solid retention time srt of 5 d without washing out biofilm ammonium oxidizing and anammox bacteria the low srt combined with low dissolved oxygen and intermittent aeration provided a selective pressure to washout nitrite oxidizing bacteria and glycogen accumulating organisms as relative abundances of graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox biofilm ebpr a2o ifas nutrient nitrogen phosphorus mainstream data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox has been identified as a sustainable bioprocess for nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater agrawal et al 2018 arora et al 2021 fernÃ¡ndez et al 2016 gonzalez martinez et al 2018 lackner et al 2014 j j li et al 2018 ma et al 2016 qiu et al 2020 ren et al 2022 the main advantages of anammox include lower energy and no external organic carbon requirements as well as lower sludge production and no greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional nitrification denitrification wen et al 2020 however despite the tremendous success of coupling partial nitritation pn and anammox collectively known as pna systems to treat ammonium rich waste streams in sidestream applications mostly for high strength anaerobic digester centrate or filtrate the full scale implementation of mainstream pna remains a challenge le et al 2019 low ammonium concentrations and fluctuating temperatures in mainstream conditions pose a challenge for suppressing the growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nobs unsuppressed nob growth leads to unstable pn and is the main obstacle to the adoption of mainstream pna lotti et al 2015 the presence of canonical heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria poses serious challenge to anammox bacteria for the available nitrate or nitrite moreover effluents from pna systems still contain considerable amounts of total inorganic nitrogen tin in the form of residual nh4 n up to 5 mg l and nearly nitrate equivalent to11 to 16 of each mg nh4 n removed is produced from anammox anabolism cao et al 2017 strous et al 1998 as a result the successful integration of anammox into the mainstream remains an unresolved challenge due to inherent operational challenges and the presence of unreacted nitrogen species e g residual ammonium and in situ produced nitrate in the anammox effluents the later becomes even more troublesome if the treatment plants are regulated tin limits in order to overcome these bottlenecks different solutions have been proposed one of these solutions is the integration of the partial denitrification pdn with anammox pdn utilizes canonical heterotrophic denitrifiers to anoxically reduce nitrate partially to nitrite under controlled conditions the in situ generated nitrite through pdn could be used by anammox to further reduce it to nitrogen gas ahmad et al 2021 ahn et al 2004 cao et al 2019 cui et al 2020 du et al 2020 gao et al 2021 ji et al 2020a ma et al 2020 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 zhuang et al 2022 however pdn still requires organic carbon which could be made available in the main stream waste treatment train theoretically systems operating with pdn and anammox would reduce the cost of external carbon and aeration by 80 and 50 respectiviely another nutrient of concern is phosphorus p the biological removal pathway of p is accomplished through enhanced biological p removal ebpr with increasingly stringent regulations for p discharges into receiving waters more and more utilities are focusing on ebpr hence it becomes imperative to integrate any innovative n removal process with ebpr for a holistic treatment of n and p in municipal wastewater a novel idea would be to pair ebpr driven denitrification with anammox yin et al 2021 to cut the organic carbon requirement further while concurrently removing p denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms dpaos are capable of endogenously reducing no3 and no2 hence potentially serving as an effective denitrification pathway without the need for external organic carbon dosage dissolved oxygen do demand is also reduced for the subsequence aerobic p uptake as po4 3 is partially taken up in the anoxic zone by dpaos another major challenge that hinders anammox processes in mainstream applications is the retention of the slow growing anammox bacteria however this issue could be mitigated by having anammox bacteria grow on carriers as biofilms attached growth biofilms have been found to be more effective in retaining anammox biomass than granular biofilms gao et al 2022 moreover biofilms provide exclusive space for anammox bacteria to grow in addition anammox based biofilms are more tolerant to high do concentrations jiang et al 2020 low temperatures gilbert et al 2014 lackner et al 2015 persson et al 2014 and chemical inhibition zheng et al 2017 thus making attached growth anammox an attractive candidate for mainstream applications attached growth biofilms can also be combined with flocculent activated sludge in a technology known as integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas for process intensification ifas technologies have been proven successful in increasing reactor stability and output for nitrification and anammox processes bai et al 2016 kim et al 2011 regmi et al 2011 veuillet et al 2014 waqas et al 2020 this study applied ifas technology by combining attached growth biofilms with suspended growth flocs in a sequencing batch reactor sbr to remove p and n simultaneously the reactor was fed with real primary effluent collected from a local treatment plant and operated in an a2o anaerobic anoxic oxic configuration the biofilm biomass mainly consisted of ammonium oxidizing aobs and anammox bacteria for pna while the floc biomass mainly consisted of dpaos paos and other groups of bacteria for ebpr denitrification and aerobic c removal the main goal of this project was to assess the feasibility of combining ebpr denitrification nitritation and anammox to simultaneously remove p n and c in real municipal wastewater without organic carbon dosage the specific objectives of this study were 1 to determine the removal efficiency of p n and c 2 to study the interactions between the different functional microorganisms at the substrate and molecular levels 16s rrna gene based microbial community analysis and functional gene expressions and 3 to examine optimum conditions for the synergistic coexistence of these microorganisms for high and stable reactor performance this study s engineering and gene expression data can inform the optimization of integrated ebpr based denitrification and anammox processes to remove p n and c in wastewater treatment findings from this study will contribute to the ongoing efforts in advancing anammox technologies for mainstream energy and carbon efficient nutrient removal applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation a 5 l sbr with an ifas process was investigated in this study the sbr was operated in a sequence of anaerobic anoxic aerobic phases as found in traditional a2o processes with a cycle length of 6 h 4 cycles d each cycle consisted of a 50 min anaerobic phase which included 10 min of feeding a 40 min anoxic phase a 4 h aerobic phase and a 30 min settling decanting phase at the beginning of the anoxic phase exogenous sodium nitrate nano3 was fed to the reactor at a total loading of 19 mg n for each cycle equivalent to 10 mg n l in the feed of 1 9 l to simulate the internal nitrified recycling of the aerobic effluent to the anoxic zone in the conventional continuous flow a2o process the reactor was seeded with suspended biomass from an ongoing lab scale ebpr reactor 20 and activated sludge from central valley water reclamation facility cvwrf salt lake city utah to reach an initial total suspended solids tss concentration of 3 g l mature anammox aob ammonium oxidizing bacteria biofilms grown on carriers anoxk 5 from a pna reactor supplementary information si text s1 were added to the reactor stepwise to make up to 5 of the mixed liquor volume on day 10 10 on day 50 and finally 15 on day 75 during the startup from day 1 to 10 the working volume was 3 l with an exchange volume of 1 l resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 18 h from day 11 to 75 the working volume was decreased to 2 63 2 75 l increased as the biofilms were added while the mixed liquor volume remained 2 5 l with an exchange volume of 1 5 l overall hrt of 10 h from day 75 onward the working volume of the reactor was increased to 3 2 l 2 78 l mixed liquor volume and the exchange volume was increased to 1 9 l hrt of 8 8 h total solids retention time srt for the flocs was maintained at 5 d tss and volatile suspended solids vss concentrations of the flocs after steady state were approximately 1 3 and 1 0 g l respectively the reactor was fed with real primary effluent collected weekly and stored at 4 c from cvwrf the characteristics of the primary effluent are listed in table 1 ph was not controlled but regularly monitored and fluctuated between 7 3 8 3 within a cycle n2 was continuously purged at 0 25 0 35 l min during the anaerobic and anoxic phases intermittent aeration 7 min on off was adopted during the aerobic phase air was purged at 0 2 0 4 l min to achieve a do setpoint of 0 4 0 1 mg l during each aeration cycle the reactor was operated at room temperature 22 3 c 2 2 p uptake activity batch test batch experiments were conducted to assess the activities of paos and dpaos for po4 3 uptake with different electron acceptors o2 air no2 and no3 effluent from the reactor was filter sterilized by passing through 0 22 Âµm membrane filters the filtrate was adjusted to a ph of 7 5 by adding 1 n hcl suspended biomass was collected from the reactor at the end of the anaerobic phase and washed twice with the ph adjusted filtrate 10 ml of the washed settled flocs were transferred to 125 ml serum bottles followed by 40 ml of the ph adjusted filtrate to obtain the final volume of 50 ml a well mixed solution 5 ml was then collected for tss and vss analyses for aerobic experiments the bottles were left open to the atmosphere on a shaker at 200 rpm to maintain well mixed conditions for the no2 and no3 assays the bottles were sealed and purged with n2 for 10 min to establish anoxic and well mixed conditions po4 3 was then directly injected into the bottles of each of the respective assays targeting an initial concentration of 20 mg po4 3 p l in the aerobic assays air was purged through needles vigorously and continuously in the bottles from an aquarium pump the experiments were carried out for 120 min for chemical analysis a 5 ml aliquot was withdrawn from each bottle at times 0 15 30 60 90 and 120 min all tests were done in duplicate 2 3 anammox activity assays towards the end of the study two batch assays were performed on days 219 and 226 to confirm the activity of anammox bacteria and to quantify their contributions to the overall tin removal during the micro aerobic phase as feed real primary effluent was collected weekly different batches of feed may have had different effects on anammox activities for this reason the assays were conducted a week apart for two different batches of feed approximately 250 ml of the mixed liquor containing only flocs were withdrawn from the reactor into a flask at the end of the anoxic phase just before the aerobic phase started and ran in parallel to the reactor containing both flocs and aob anammox biofilms till the end of the aerobic phase air purging was provided in the flask flocs only from the same air pump used for the reactor for intermittent aeration synchronization do in the flask was manually controlled samples were withdrawn from both vessels for chemical analysis at the beginning and the end of the tests 2 4 complete cycle analysis and gene expression on day 230 of reactor operation a gene expression study was conducted samples for chemical analyses were taken at 0 feed 10 after feeding 25 mid anaerobic 50 end of anaerobic start of anoxic 70 mid anoxic 90 end of anoxic start of aerobic 110 160 220 280 330 end of aerobic and 360 min effluent end of cycle sludge samples were also collected at the same time intervals except at 0 and 360 min for the gene expression analysis at each sampling point two aliquots of approximately 2 ml of mixed liquor containing flocs were collected and centrifuged immediately at 7000 g for 30 s the supernatants were collected for chemical analysis while the pellet from one aliquot was transferred to a lysis matrix e tube containing glass beads from mp medicals for rna extraction while the other was processed for pha analysis for the biofilm biomass about 1 8 of a carrier was cut and collected in a lysis matrix e tube then 800 Âµl of the rna lysis buffer section 2 7 was added to the lysis tube the mixture was mechanically homogenized using a bead mill bead ruptor 12 omni international at 6 m s for 3 cycles of 1 min running and 5 min resting the lysates were stored at 4 c and rna was then extracted from the lysate on the next day n2o concentrations in the off gas were measured at the beginning of the anoxic phase until the end of the aerobic phase 2 5 dna and rna extraction and two step rt qpcr dna from collected sludge samples was extracted using qiagen powersoil pro qiagen germany kits per the manufacturer s protocols total rna was extracted using quick rna kits zymo research usa genomic dna gdna

transcription kit thermofisher usa by adding 1000 ng rna for each sample quantitative real time pcr qpcr was done to quantify anammox 16s rrna accumulibacter dpaos paos 16s rrna hzsb amoa and ppk1 ia ppk1 iic ppk1 iid phac narg nirk nirs and rpon rna polymerase sigma 54 factor reference gene genes using primer sets listed in table s1 for both 16s rrna genes the synthetic cdna samples were diluted 100 times before adding to the qpcr reaction mixtures each reaction mixture 20 Âµl contained 10 Âµl of powerup sybr green master mix thermofisher usa 1 Âµl of each primer forward and reverse 10 Âµm 2 Âµl of template and the remainder 6 Âµl was nuclease free water the qpcr conditions for each reaction were applied according to the references listed in table s1 the expressed abundances of the target genes were calculated based on the comparative ct threshold cycle method also known as Î´Î´ct the ct value of the gene of interest at a specific time was subtracted with the corresponding ct value of its reference gene rpon then the difference values were subtracted again with the difference value of the first sample to obtain the Î´Î´ct of each sample gene expression as fold change was expressed as 2 Î´Î´ct qpcr analyses were carried out in triplicate on quantstudio3 thermofisher usa all rna samples had a 260 280 value of 2 09 or higher while their 230 260 values were also high and averaged 2 1 according to the manufacturer s manual a high quality rna sample typically has a 260 280 ratio of 2 0 or higher and 230 260 ranging from 1 8 to 2 2 trace gdna contamination in the rna samples was evaluated by running qpcr on negative reverse transcription control nrtc rna sample without reverse transcription for anammox 16s rrna and accumulibacter 16s rrna in rna samples from biofilms and flocs respectively the average difference in ct value between cdna and nrtc was about 18 5 cycles in the biofilm rna samples while nrtcs for the floc rna samples did not amplify after 40 cycles suggesting that gdna contaminations were negligible 2 6 analytical methods for the lab scale reactor no2 no3 and po4 3 were analyzed using an ion chromatographic method 930 compact ic flex metrohm

bolyen et al 2019 kozich et al 2013 3 results 3 1 reactor performance reactor performance was subdivided into 4 stages based on the amount of the aob anammox biofilms added stage i days 1 9 was the startup period without biofilm media in stage ii days 10 49 the reactor was operated with 5 by volume biofilms in stage iii days 50 74 the reactor operated with 10 biofilms and in stage iv days 75 236 the reactor was operated with 15 biofilm media in stage i the reactor was started only with flocs seeded from a stable ebpr reactor operational in the pi s lab and aerobic activated sludge from a wwtp cvwrf to test the ability of the reactor to perform ebpr during this stage consistent ebpr performance was obtained as effluent po4 3 p was below the detection limit of 0 03 mg p l fig 1 a during this startup period in stage i nitritation also gradually improved as the effluent nh4 n kept decreasing while the effluent no2 n kept increasing fig 1bc no3 n as nano3 was added to the reactor at the beginning of the anoxic phase of each cycle to simulate internal recycling of no3 n from the aerobic cycle zone no3 n loading was gradually increased from about 5 6 to 10 mg n l from the beginning towards the end of stage i fig 1d influent nitrate concentrations were calculated by dividing the mass of no3 n loading in the anoxic phase by the volume of the feed fed to the reactor effluent no3 n was also low during this startup period in stage i leading to high tin removal of about 85 on day 7 fig 1e this high tin removal efficiency could be partly due to denitrification by endogenous decay induced by the high mlss concentration seeded to the reactor and the relatively long hrt 18 h it could also partly due to a high amount of intracellular carbon in the seed sludge in the form of phas which the cells could have used to denitrify due to the high removals of po4 3 p nh4 n and no3 n and improved no2 n accumulation in the effluent the exchange volume was increased from 1 l to 1 5 l per cycle 6 l day on day 7 however on day 9 the po4 3 p removal decreased as the effluent concentration of po4 3 p kept increasing from below the detection limit on day 8 to 4 2 mg p l on day 10 this is partly due to the increasing effluent no2 n concentrations which carried over to the subsequent cycle with the remaining volume causing organic carbon limitation in the next sbr cycle s anaerobic phase to minimize no2 n carry over the working volume of the reactor was dropped from 3 l to 2 5 l on day 10 as a result the hrt also decreased to 10 h anammox biofilms were introduced in the reactor on day 10 by adding aob anammox biofilms grown on anox k5 carriers from the pi s lab at 5 of the mixed liquor volume from day 11 effluent po4 3 p gradually decreased to below the detection limit on day 16 suggesting a full recovery of the ebpr process after no2 n carry over was minimized in stage ii the average effluent nh4 n and no2 n were 6 9 and 6 1 mg n l respectively while no3 n in the final effluent remained low at 0 55 mg n l on average suggesting that the activities of nob were under control stage ii saw the lowest tin removal efficiency at about 70 6 on average due to the high effluent nh4 and no2 on day 50 stage iii aob anammox biofilms were increased to 10 of the mixed liquor volume stage iii days 50 74 saw a significant improvement in nh4 and no2 removal with an average effluent concentration of 2 4 and 2 5 mg n l respectively while average effluent no3 increased to 1 6 mg n l these data indicate towards an increase in anammox activities as more biofilms were added as a result tin removal in stage iii also improved with an average removal efficiency of 85 3 in stage iv days 75 236 aob anammox biofilms were finally increased to 15 on day 75 as a result a higher average tin removal efficiency of 91 1 was obtained ebpr performance remained consistently high during stages iii iv with this stable and desirable tin removal biofilm loading was no longer increased however the rate of biofilm loading to archive stable anammox activities also depends on the characteristics of the inoculum itself which should be further investigated the removal of scod fig 1f was consistent and not affected by the operational changes a summary of the reactor performance for the last 100 days is provided in table 2 during this period the average tin loading rate was 128 9 mg n l d while the average removal rate was recorded at 117 7 mg n l d which is within typical values 100 200 mg n l d of mainstream applications metcalf and eddy inc et al 2013 3 2 microbial ecology dna samples of the flocs and biofilms were extracted on day 213 of reactor operation the microbial community composition of the flocs and biofilms are displayed in fig 2 a b respectively in the flocs the most abundant genotype was aerobic heterotrophic bacteria accounting for at least 32 7 of the total population among them the most abundant group was hydrolyzers in the family of saprospiraceae accounting for about 16 5 of the relative abundance members in this family can hydrolyze and utilize complex organic carbon sources and are typically found in high abundances in activated sludge mcilroy and nielsen 2014 well identified canonical denitrifiers in the genus thauera rhodobacter denitratisoma and zoogloea collectively accounted for 3 7 of the relative abundance in the flocs the most abundant pao dpao related bacteria belonged to the genus candidatus accumulibacter hereafter referred to as accumulibacter accounting for 5 of the relative abundance results from the qpcr analysis showed that clade ia iic and iid 15 1 16 5 43 2 respectively compared to pao 16s rrna were the most abundant accumulibacter in the reactor a similar distribution of accumulibacter clades was found in other studies when real primary effluent was used as the feed camejo et al 2016 roots et al 2020 tetrasphaera another potential pao dpao group which could use complex carbons other than vfas for p release was found in small abundance at 0 3 suggesting its potential involvement in the ebpr process of the reactor kristiansen et al 2012 glycogen accumulated organisms gaos are the main competitors for paos as they also can anaerobically assimilate vfas without contributing to the p removal of the reactor candidatus competibacter was the only group of gaos found in the flocs where their population in the reactor was low 0 16 and would have not significantly affected the performance of the reactor aobs in the genus nitrosomonas and anammox bacteria in the genus candidatus brocadia were found in both flocs and biofilms the aob population in the flocs was 1 5 and 1 1 in the biofilms anammox bacteria population in the flocs was meager at only 0 7 whereas their presence in the biofilms was 29 nobs in the genus nitrospira were only found in the flocs at 0 6 abundance the microbial ecology of the flocs was comparable to that of a full scale ebpr plant albertsen et al 2012 3 3 p and n removal during the anoxic and aerobic phases samples were also collected regularly at the start and end of the anoxic phase in addition to the final effluent to check the activities of dpaos fig 3 a b show the contributions of po4 3 p uptake removal during the anoxic and aerobic phases consistent p uptake during the anoxic phase 15 9 of the total p uptake on average suggests the activity of dpaos the remaining po4 3 p was taken up almost completely during the subsequent aerobic phase fig 3c d show both the removal and removal efficiency of tin in the anoxic and aerobic phases respectively tin removal in the anoxic phase was 5 9 mg l on average contributing to about 22 5 of the overall tin removal in the aerobic phase about 17 5 mg l or 66 7 of tin was removed on average increasing the overall tin removal efficiency to 89 2 on average from fig 3e nox n was removed during the anoxic phase at the expense of scod and po4 3 p these results demonstrate the removal of nox n via denitrification through canonical denitrifiers which used cod and dpaos which used po4 3 p however whether the dpaos used no2 n or no3 n for anoxic p uptake remains unclear a batch experiment was then conducted to test the p uptake activities of dpaos paos by o2 air no2 n and no3 n results fig 3f show that the enriched dpaos could use both no2 n and no3 n in addition to o2 albeit the rate was about 7 times higher in the case of o2 these findings agree with previous studies that found that accumulibacter clade ia could use no3 n and no2 n for p uptake flowers et al 2009 nh4 n removal in the anoxic phase at 0 66 mg n l on average can be used as a surrogate for anammox activities however since the feed primary effluent also contained organic n part of tn in table 1 the activities of the canonical denitrifiers could produce nh4 n as a byproduct of organic carbon degradation as suggested by the observed scod removal at the same time canonical denitrifiers and dpaos could also assimilate nh4 n for cell synthesis making the slight nh4 removal alone inconclusive for the anammox activities in the anoxic phase 3 4 anammox activities in the micro aerobic phase in order to prove and estimate the anammox activities for tin removal during the micro aerobic phase about 250 ml of mixed liquor containing only flocs were withdrawn and run in parallel to the reactor containing both flocs and biofilms at the beginning of the aerobic phase the microbial community analysis in section 3 2 showed that the anammox bacteria population in the flocs 0 7 was negligible compared to the anammox bacterial population in biofilms two tests were conducted on days 219 and 226 during stage iv the results are shown in fig 4 a b po4 3 p was undetected at the end of the tests for both flocs only and flocs with biofilms these results agree with the microbial community data where the majority of the paos were found in the flocs however nh4 n and no2 n in the effluents from the flocs only assays on average were 4 2 and 5 9 mg n l respectively higher than those of the flocs with biofilms assays indicating a higher anammox activity in the biofilm faction the difference between tin removal in the flocs only and in the flocs and biofilms can be used to distinguish tin removal by flocs and biofilms on average the biofilms contributed to about 44 5 of tin removal on an average in the aerobic phase while the flocs accounted for about 37 9 the tin removal from the biofilm fraction could not be attributed to anammox activities alone but rather to the cumulative action of anammox and heterotrophic denitrification nevertheless the lower effluent nh4 n and no2 n and tin concentrations in the mixed liquor containing both flocs and anammox biofilm carriers proved the anammox activities and their contributions to the tin removal in the reactor during the aerobic phase 3 5 cycle analysis with biochemical transformations and gene expression patterns 3 5 1 cyclic biochemical transformations intra and extracellular chemical transformations and gene expression data during a typical cycle were conducted on day 230 fig 5 a shows the changes of n p and c concentrations during the cycle during the anaerobic phase po4 3 p concentration increased at a linear rate 33 8 mg p l h r2 0 997 in the first 25 min and accounted for about 86 of the total po4 3 p released the other 14 was released during remainder of the anaerobic time period this p release coincided with the removal of scod from 137 in the feed to 45 mg l after 50 min and the accumulation of intracellular phas indicating the activities of dpaos paos the anoxic phase was introduced by adding no3 n as nano3 to simulate the internal nitrified recycling of the conventional a2o process after the nitrate feeding the concentration of no3 n in the reactor was 6 1 mg n l at the end of the anoxic phase no3 n was almost completely removed 95 4 along with further scod removal 12 mg l and anoxic p uptake 2 61 mg l by dpaos no2 n accumulation at the end of the anoxic phase was 0 98 mg n l and nh4 n removal was 1 25 mg n l making the overall tin removal in the anoxic phase 6 37 mg n l which was more than the externally provided of no3 n these anoxic chemical transformation patterns were similar to the findings observed in routine reactor sampling described in section 3 3 again the removal of nox n at the expense of scod and po4 3 p was due to both denitrification by canonical denitrifiers and dpaos about 86 5 of po4 3 p was taken up in the first 70 min of the aerobic phase 160 min of the cycle as opposed to about 13 taken up in the anoxic phase the aerobic uptake rate was 14 33 mg p l h compared to 4 03 mg p l h for the anoxic uptake rate po4 3 p concentrations were below the detection limit at 220 min and remained there until the end of the cycle pha content was also quickly utilized with about 63 drop in the first 70 min of the aerobic phase and slowly depleted from about 4 at 160 min to 1 62 mg g tss at 360 min at a constant rate of 0 69 mg g tss h nh4 n was removed at a linear rate of 6 72 mg n l h r2 0 999 throughout the 190 min of the aerobic phase despite the decreasing concentration of nearly 13 folds the aerobic removal rate of tin was also linear until the end of the aerobic phase 330 min of the cycle though at a slightly lower rate of 5 51 mg n l h r2 0 998 this difference resulted from the slight accumulation of no2 n throughout the aerobic phase during which it increased from 0 98 to 4 28 mg n l at 330 min 240 min of the aerobic phase nh4 n was further removed to below the detection limit while no2 n concentration decreased to 2 304 mg n l no3 n concentration stayed below 0 279 mg n l throughout the aerobic phase 90 330 min of the cycle and was below the detection limit in the effluent at the end of the cycle only no2 n was detected as tin with a concentration of 2 18 mg n l the tin removal efficiency for the whole process from the feed and no3 addition in the anoxic phase was 96 whereas po4 3 removal efficiency was nearly 100 3 5 2 gene expressions during a complete reactor cycle the function gene expressions of key genes were also examined to study the responses of the microbial communities in the flocs and biofilms to support our data related to the dynamics of different chemical species measured in the reactor rpon rna polymerase sigma 54 factor was chosen as a reference gene in biofilm and floc samples as it is a constitutive gene with a stable expression level across all time point samples rpon was also used as a reference gene for qpcr normalization for accumulibacter and other bacteria camejo et al 2019 chang et al 2009 fig 5b shows the expression profiles of genes related to dpaos paos in flocs dpaos paos possess ppk1 and phac genes that catalyze reversible reactions of the synthesis and degradation of polyphosphate and pha respectively in general the expression of phac and ppk1 all clades exhibited similar patterns muted in the anaerobic phase except for ppk1 ia which slightly increased by 1 6 folds at the end of the phase their expression levels rose at the end of anoxic phase and kept increasing to the highest at 20 min of the aerobic phase 110 min of the cycle after that their expression levels dropped until the end of the aerobic phase to about the same levels as that of the first sample 10 min of the anaerobic phase the expression level of the accumulibacter 16s rrna gene kept decreasing throughout the anaerobic phase until the middle of the anoxic phase and only increased towards the end of the anoxic phase the gene transcription level kept increasing further into the aerobic phase compared to those of ppk1 and phac with the highest at 70 min of the phase 160 min of the cycle accumulibacter 16s rrna expression level remained high for another hour before declining gradually bacterial cells maintain their ribosome and rrna contents corresponding to their growth bremer and dennis 2008 nomura et al 1984 otto et al 2019 the increase in 16s rrna expression at the end of anoxic and throughout the aerobic phase suggests that dpaos paos accumulibacter were preparing for cell growth in these periods these findings agree with the ebpr metabolic models that suggest pao growth only occurs in the anoxic and aerobic phases due to the low energy requirements when external electron acceptors are available he and mcmahon 2011 fig 5c shows the changes in transcription levels of genes associated with anammox hzsb and anammox 16s rrna in the biofilms and aobs amoa in the flocs and biofilms similar patterns of amoa expression in the flocs and biofilms were observed the presence of trace do in the feed at the beginning of the anaerobic phase could have triggered the upregulation of the gene seen in the middle of the anaerobic phase however despite the absence of do 0 04 mg l after feeding 10 min throughout the anaerobic phase the expression of amoa from both floc and biofilm communities kept increasing aobs have been found to overexpress amoa in response to stress such as low temperatures and chemical inhibition park and ely 2009 radniecki et al 2009 wu et al 2016 however this overexpression has been observed in aerobic conditions and a probable explanation given by the researchers was that aobs may have tried to compensate for the loss of the enzyme activities on the other hand the increased expression of amoa in the anaerobic phase in this present study is interesting and warrants further investigation during the anoxic phase the expression of amoa in both communities decreased the expression of amoa gradually increased throughout the aerobic zone except at the end of the phase the increase in transcription levels of amoa coincided with the removal of nh4 n in the aerobic phase likewise the transcription levels also dropped when nh4 n was exhausted at the end of the aerobic phase the expression of the anammox functional genes can further confirm their activities in the aerobic phase and more importantly in the anoxic phase when substrate data alone could not provide a definitive answer section 3 3 the anammox hzsb gene was also upregulated in the middle of the anaerobic phase like amoa it may have been due to the in situ no2 n production within the biofilms results show that the expression of hzsb increased in the middle of the anoxic phase and further increased to the highest level recorded 12 8 folds higher than in the first sample at 10 min 20 min into the aerobic phase 110 min of the cycle after that surge the expression level of hzsb dropped but remained higher than in the first sample throughout the aerobic phase anammox bacteria consistently expressed hzsb in the aerobic phase even when the aeration was on especially at 20 min 110 min of the cycle proving that they were active in deeper anaerobic layers of the biofilms throughout the aerobic phase veuillet et al 2014 due to the biofilm structure anoxic conditions were likely to be maintained inside the biofilms even when the aeration was on protecting anammox bacteria from exposure to do 0 4 0 1 mg l in the bulk liquid the increased expression of anammox 16s rrna in the anoxic and aerobic phases indicates that anammox bacteria were active and preparing for cell growth providing further evidence for their contributions to tin removal in both phases as anticipated nitrate reductase narg and nitrite reductase nirs and nirk genes in floc and biofilm communities were very active in the anoxic phase as shown in fig 5d in the aerobic phase the expression levels of these genes were higher in the biofilm community than their flocculent counterparts partly due to anoxic conditions which could have been maintained in inner layers of the biofilms the higher expressions of the narg nirs and nirk in the biofilms helps explain the absence of nitrate accumulation from the proven anammox activities in the aerobic phase a previous study also found that heterotrophs inside anammox granules depended on organic secretions from anammox bacteria to denitrify lawson et al 2017 it is worth noting the expression of hzsb and denitrifying genes dropped significantly into the aerobic phase despite the proven tin removal through the anammox pathway and sndn section 3 4 in the biofilm and floc sludges during the aerobic zone the supply of substrates no2 for anammox and no2 no3 for denitrification was stable but low as they were consumed once produced it is postulated that this low supply may have slowed down the production of the corresponding enzymes resulting in the observed drop in the expression levels of hzsb and the denitrifying genes 4 discussion 4 1 ifas configuration with low do for mainstream anammox and ebpr this study applied mainstream conditions such as using conventional a2o configuration and real primary effluent as feed challenges for mainstream anammox applications include retention of anammox bacteria high c n ratio and suppression of nob growth cao et al 2017 x x li et al 2018 trinh et al 2021 traditionally srts in activated sludge processes are governed by nitrification rates which in turn also depend on temperature and do setpoint it has been found that maintaining high srt 10 d for complete nitrification may negatively impact ebpr performance onnis hayden et al 2020 the ifas configuration of this reactor decoupled the autotrophic deammonification pna process from other processes including ebpr denitrification aerobic organic oxidation and nitratation oxidation of no2 to no3 by nobs this decoupling allowed operation at a low flocculent srt 5 d without washing out slow growing aobs and anammox bacteria as they were retained in the reactor through carriers also with the proven anammox activities only a portion of influent nh4 needed to be removed through nitritation by aobs the c n ratio in the primary effluent in this study was 6 3 7 tcod nh4 n which was higher than the optimal range of 0 5 2 for anammox processes daigger 2014 lackner et al 2008 high c n ratios allow ordinary heterotrophs to outcompete anammox bacteria for space and nutrients chamchoi et al 2008 gÃ¼ven et al 2005 however due to the attached growth anammox bacteria were protected in the biofilms for space and from do stresses furthermore the pre anaerobic phase and enrichment of paos dpaos competed out ordinary heterotrophic bacteria which also favored anammox bacteria enrichment after at least 138 days of inoculation in the reactor the relative abundance of anammox bacteria remained high in the biofilms at about 29 fig 2b compared to about 34 5 in the original seed si figs s5 and s6 this slight drop could be from decreased nh4 loading in the seed reactor s filtrate to the present reactor s primary effluent the suppression of nob growth in the aerobic zone has been proven difficult under mainstream conditions agrawal et al 2018 cao et al 2017 han et al 2016 lotti et al 2015 ma et al 2020 in this study with a combination of low flocculent srt 5 d low do setpoint 0 4 0 1 mg l room temperature operation 22 3 c and intermittent aeration nob growth was kept under control indicated by their low abundance in the flocs 0 6 absence in the biofilms and low no3 n concentrations in the effluent laureni et al 2019 also found that nob growth can be controlled under mainstream conditions by segregating anammox bacteria in biofilms from aobs and nobs in flocs pdn has been proven as an alternative pathway to consistently supply no2 n for anammox when there are no effective measures for nob suppression in addition endogenous denitrification has become increasingly popular in implementing pdn due to its high no2 accumulation rates in previous studies however endogenous denitrification mainly relied on gaos by starting up with gaos or ending up shifting from a dpao dominant to a gao dominant population ji et al 2020b li et al 2022 wang et al 2019 2015 yin et al 2021 using gaos for endogenous denitrification would require more organic carbon dosage for ebpr where its performance could also be destabilized in the long run it may eventually make carbon neutral nutrient removal one of the main purposes for bringing anammox to the mainstream in the first place unrealized however in this study the need for partial denitrification was significantly reduced due to the effective strategies for nob washout moreover with efficient implementation of endogenous denitrification through dpaos rather than gaos the reactor was not just able to remove most of the in situ n and p found in the feed but was also able to remove extra n added externally as nano3 in the anoxic phase without external carbon dosage there were several factors employed in this study that led to the suppression of gao growth including room temperature 19 26 c operation presence of a mixture of acetate and propionate in the feed primary effluent low do 0 4 0 1 mg l short floc srt 5 d and ph 7 3 8 3 carvalheira et al 2014 chan et al 2017 lopez vazquez et al 2009 onnis hayden et al 2020 winkler et al 2011 there are some drawbacks to low do operation such as sludge bulking due to the proliferation of filamentous bacteria high dissolved organic nitrogen don formation and high n2o emissions kampschreur et al 2008 liao et al 2022 martins et al 2003 peng et al 2014 however filamentous bacteria were found at low abundance and the sludge volume index svi of the flocs during stage iv of reactor operation ranged from 102 128 ml g these values were within svi values for good settling biomass in the activated sludge process which is below 150 ml g metcalf and eddy inc et al 2013 effluent don table 2 was found at a similar value to typical activated sludge processes zheng et al 2021 these results suggest that do at 0 4 0 1 mg l was not too low to cause bulking problems and don formation it may also have been partly due to the relatively low concentration of tss about 1 3 g l maintained in the reactor that balanced f m food to microorganism ratio and srt thus reducing endogenous decay during the cycle analysis section 2 6 and 3 5 n2o emissions were also monitored the average n2o emission factor in the anoxic and aerobic phases was 0 19 and 3 85 respectively of the tin removed as such the total emission factor was estimated to be 3 02 the aerobic n2o emission factor is similar to that of pna and pao based processes reported in the literature cavanaugh et al 2022 li et al 2020 it has been found that biofilm aob anammox required a relatively high do setpoint in the bulk liquid at 0 5 1 mg l due to resistance in mass transfer christensson et al 2013 in this study despite a lower do setpoint at 0 4 0 1 mg l ammonium removal remained consistently high aobs were found in substantial abundance while also active in both floc and biofilm communities as revealed from the microbial ecology and gene expression data the presence of aobs in the flocs could be one of the reasons for the observed stable nitritation as aobs in the flocs required a lower do setpoint veuillet et al 2014 observed that in the ifas reactor for sidestream pna most aobs grew in the flocs while anammox bacteria predominantly occupied the biofilms for this reason the researchers found that the ifas reactor required a lower do setpoint 0 1 0 25 mg l than the biofilm only reactor 0 6 mg l where aobs and anammox bacteria were comingled in the biofilms 4 2 coexistence of anammox bacteria with dpaos and other groups of microorganisms due to their ability to denitrify dpaos can potentially compete for no2 n with anammox bacteria especially in the anoxic phase when no2 n was limiting from gene expression data fig 5c anammox bacteria were active during the anoxic phase however based on the average nh4 n removal their contributions to tin removal in the anoxic phase was little fig 3e on the other hand the enriched dpaos paos preferred o2 over nox n as an electron acceptor for their p uptake fig 5abf camejo et al 2016 found that no2 n was a poor electron acceptor for dpaos while p uptake through no3 n respiration was incomplete and no3 n removal also ceased when po4 3 p was exhausted hence just after 70 min into the aerobic phase when 99 55 of po4 3 p was already taken up dpaos ability to denitrify was limited making most of no2 n from aob respiration available for anammox bacteria organic carbon was utilized efficiently in each phase of the cycle batch experiments showed that the enriched dpaos paos could only use vfas acetate and propionate for anaerobic p release si text s6 and table s2 p release c uptake for acetate and propionate was 0 59 and 0 45 pmol cmol respectively these values were similar to the values reported in the literature for highly enriched paos with low populated gao sludges diaz et al 2022 hence during the anaerobic phase most vfas were consumed by dpaos paos and by the end of the anoxic phase scod was almost exhausted suggesting that readily biodegradable carbon was already consumed hence the only available organic carbon in the aerobic phase was mostly particulate which also was supported by the high abundance of hydrolyzers in the family of saprospiraceae in the flocs fig 2a tin removal through sndn in the aerobic phase 37 9 in the floc fraction may be partly due to the breakdown of complex organic compounds by the hydrolyzers to simpler forms during aeration making them available for the denitrifiers when the aeration ceased particulate cod has also been found to improve tin removal through sndn klaus et al 2020 dpaos could also have contributed to the sndn in the aerobic phase after p depletion in the aerobic phase dpaos could use their stored pha to denitrify to gain maintenance energy lu et al 2007 pha content was found to consistently drop after p depletion occurred 160 min into the cycle fig 5a in the cycle analysis test the nh4 removal rate in the aerobic phase fig 5a was constant during the initial stage of the aeration phase oxygen was consumed by several functional groups such as pao aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and aob once organic c was consumed from the bulk liquid more o2 became available to aob which is reflected by a sharp increase in ammonium oxidizing capacity as the aerobic phase progressed also as more nitrite accumulated in the aerobic phase anammox activities should have increased hence providing another sink to nh4 and compensating for the removal rate loss by aobs with decreasing nh4 concentration high and stable removal of c p and n suggests the harmonious coexistence of autotrophic aobs anammox bacteria with heterotrophic dpaos paos denitrifiers and aerobes 5 conclusions the integration of ebpr and pna processes was proven successful in removing p and n without external carbon dosage sustained aob and anammox growth was enabled through attached growth on ifas system while ebpr was predominantly occurring in the suspended sludge fraction the following conclusions can be made from this study decoupling ebpr and nitritation anammox into two sludges flocs and biofilms allowed the reactor to be operated at a low srt without washing out slow growing aobs and anammox for reliable ebpr performance while maintaining high tin removal efficiency with a low do setpoint 0 4 0 1 mg l and intermittent aeration this low srt operation provided selective pressure against nobs and gaos under mainstream wastewater conditions low do setpoint also maintained anammox activities and sndn throughout the aerobic phase anammox activities and their contributions to tin removal were well proven from the evidence at the substrate and genetics levels dpaos were enriched and their activities for p uptake in the anoxic phase helped remove the majority of tin in the anoxic phase without organic carbon dosage increasing the reactor s capability to remove tin in a carbon neutral manner incorporating anammox into aerobic zones would significantly reduce the internal recycle flow rates typically required by the traditional a2o process as a considerable amount of tin was already removed by anammox activities low internal recycle flow rates result in small anoxic and aerobic reactor footprints thus reducing capital and operational costs further microbial community

14974,water toxicity detection as a valuable supplement to conventional water quality measurement is an important method for evaluating water environmental quality standards however the toxicity of composite pollutants is more complicated due to their mixture effects this study developed a novel rapid and interference resistant detection method for water toxicity based on an electrochemical biosensor using peak current from nitrite oxidation as a signal toxicants could weaken the characteristic peak current of nitrite to indicate the magnitude of toxicity the proof of concept study was first conducted using a synthetic water sample containing trichloroacetic acid tcaa and then the results were compared with those of the traditional toxicity colorimetric method cck 8 kit and laser confocal microscopy clsm the accuracy of the biosensor was further verified with water samples containing individual pollutants such as cd2 50 150 Î¼g l cr6 20 80 Î¼g l mixture triclosan tcs 0 1 1 0 Î¼g l and tcaa 10 80 Î¼g l or a mixture of the above the viability of the sensor was further validated with the actual water sample from the tuojiang river the results demonstrated that although the concentration of a single conventional pollutant in water did not exceed the discharge standard for surface water the comprehensive toxicity of natural water should not be ignored this method could be a beneficial supplement to conventional water quality detection to understand the characteristics of the water and thus contribute to the next stage of water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords toxicity detection combined pollutants biosensor cyclic voltammetry basin comprehensive water toxicity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years water pollution in china has developed from general pollutants to toxic and harmful pollutants which present potential risks to human health and the ecological environment li et al 2018 when there are several known or unknown pollutants in water mixture effects may occur making an accurate correlation of actual toxicity difficult to establish only by detecting pollutant concentration cedergreen 2014 acute toxicity detection as a useful supplement to conventional water quality indicators chemical oxygen demand or dissolved organic matter content for example is important for evaluating water environmental quality standards he et al 2020 kirsanov et al 2013 aquatic creatures such as fish and algae have already been utilized as biological sensors to detect acute toxicity in water but these methods are typically characterized by time consuming and difficult manipulations pujol vila et al 2015 turemis et al 2018 wang et al 2013 furthermore faster and simpler in vitro bioassays using mammalian cell lines have also been used for water quality monitoring according to different cellular toxicity pathways brack et al 2019 however it is difficult to find an ideal bioassay for water quality assessment that covers a wide range of cellular toxicity pathways escher et al 2014 neale et al 2017 in particular pollutants are widely diffused in water with substances like heavy metals disinfection by products dbps or methylbenzene only present at extremely low concentrations dann and hontela 2011 kabir et al 2015 even if some indicators have reached level a of the integrated wastewater discharge standard in china table s1 there are great risks to the ecology which require highly sensitive toxicity detection techniques microbial based acute toxicity detection has attracted extensive attention from researchers cui et al 2018 eltzov et al 2015 hassan et al 2019 yu et al 2017 among which the technology based on luminescent bacteria is the most widely used elad et al 2011 parvez et al 2006 shi et al 2013 however luminous bacteria are not suitable for colorful and high turbidity samples which might result in false positive results farrÃ© and barcelÃ³ 2003 for all these reasons rapid accurate sensitive and at the same time cost effective analytical methods are necessary the detecting principle of an electrochemical biosensor is to transform the effect of pollutants on microorganisms into measurable electrical signals jin et al 2017 kim et al 2007 prevoteau and rabaey 2017 qi et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 this is because the toxicity of pollutants inhibits the activity of enzymes and respiratory and metabolic processes in microorganisms as well as the generation and transfer of electrons resulting in changes in current intensity yang et al 2020 whole cell sensors compared to enzyme biosensors have the capacity for regeneration and long term availability and have gradually demonstrated substantial benefits in detecting water quality biotoxicity erable et al 2010 for example wang et al designed a highly sensitive and durable electrochemical sensor based on geobacter dominated biofilms for heavy metal toxicity detection wang et al 2022b wu et al constructed a novel clostridium based toxicity sensor for cu2 in situ monitoring wu et al 2018 a bio electrochemical sensor based on suspended shewanella oneidensis mr 1 also exhibited high sensitivity for toxicity detection of a single heavy metal zang et al 2021 however there are inevitably multiple pollutants in the actual waters simultaneously which are often combined with different contaminants including nitrogen and phosphorus pollution heavy metals disinfection by products antibacterial agents etc compared to a single toxic pollutant the toxicity of composite pollutants is more complicated due to their mixture effects therefore it is urgent to construct a comprehensive toxicity detection method that would be rapid accurate and sensitive for monitoring actual water samples although amperometry is very common for signal output in microbial electrochemical sensor equipped with the sensing element of a bioanode or biocathode the high false negative and false positive largely limit the practical application which are caused by shocks of concomitant and condition in the anode and cathode units respectively chu et al 2021 moreover the response process of organic matter need a long time of 12 22 hours via amperometry to monitor the output current resulting in no timely warning naradasu et al 2020 the cyclic voltammetry cv method can reduce disturbance because of the difference in redox potential between substances which presents different frontal positions in our previous study cv was constructed by a nitrifying biofilm to detect nitrite timely and sensitively showing the specific recognition by the presence of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and nitrite oxidase enzyme nxr on the electrode biofilm wang et al 2022c therefore a indicator with nitrite for toxicity detection of combined pollution was proposed and the proof of concept study was first conducted using a synthetic water sample containing trichloroacetic acid tcaa this biosensor s working principle was to use the peak produced by 10 mg l nitrite as the biosensor s characteristic background peak and the toxic pollutant would detect toxicity by inhibiting microbial activity and decreasing the output current of the characteristic peak toxic heavy metals cd2 and cr6 triclosan tcs and tcaa were selected to test the detection performance of the biosensors for toxicity in water we then evaluate the toxicity of the above pollutants in different combinations of composite pollutants furthermore the interference of substances organic substances with the biosensor was investigated to verify its stability the electrochemical toxicity detection method we established was also confirmed by mutual validation of the traditional toxicity colorimetric method cck 8 kit and laser confocal microscopy toxicity characterization demonstrating this method s reliability in assessing the comprehensive toxicity of the water finally the established complete acute toxicity detection method for water was first applied to the upper tributary of the yangtze river tuojiang river to evaluate the environmental safety of the basin this study will provide a rapid analysis method for more systematically detecting the basin s water quality in order to contribute to the next stage of water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculation construction and operation of biosensor the electroactive biosensor based on a nitrite biosensor developed by our team in the previous study wang et al 2022c a pre treated carbon felt wang et al 2020 with a thickness of 0 3 cm and a diameter of 2 cm was used as the working electrode a piece of platinum plate with a 0 1 cm and a diameter of 1 cm was used as the counter electrode the reference electrode was an ag agcl electrode 0 197 v vs she and was placed in the working electrode chamber the biosensor worked under a potential of 0 3 v vs ag agcl control for initiation with inoculated nitrifying bacteria 3 ml from our lab the medium was 50 mm pbs 7 8 g l nah2po4 0 1 g l nahco3 containing 1 mg l vitamin balch et al 1979 and 10 mg l nh4 n solution after 14 days of acclimation at 26 c the biosensor successfully reached a stable state and the output electrical signal did not fluctuate 2 2 toxicity testing methods for mutual verification for testing contaminant toxicity the cck 8 kit a traditional colorimetric method was used for comparative validation the cck 8 kit is a rapid and highly sensitive assay kit based on wst 8 for the detection of cell proliferation and cytotoxicity the washed cell suspension was shocked with tcaa 10 to 80 Î¼g l treated for 12 h and incubated with the cck 8 reagent the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader synergy htx usa after further incubation for 1 hour in the cell incubator cck 8 and biosensor methods were performed under the same environmental conditions detect time and temperature and these experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three times the toxicity degree of pollutants to biofilms was also compared and verified by the live dead baclighttm bacterial viability kit thermo fisher after shock with toxic pollutants electrode biofilms were rinsed with 0 8 sterile saline and immersed in the bacterial viability kit for 20 min a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm leica tcs sp8 germany was used to observe the biofilm activity and 6 8 images were collected at random for each sample to avoid experimental error 2 3 methods for toxicity testing and calculation of inhibition rate to establish a method for acute toxicity detection of water quality tcaa tcs cd2 cdcl2 5h2o and cr6 k2cr2o7 were used separately the concentration of pollutants was set regarding the environmental river during the covid 19 epidemic the concentration of tcaa in water was higher than before wang et al 2022a ye et al 2011 so the final concentration of tcaa was set at 10 20 40 60 80 Î¼g l at the working electrode based on future predictions for global river exports of triclosan the final concentration of tcs was 0 1 1 0 Î¼g l at intervals of 0 1 Î¼g van wijnen et al 2018 the concentration of cd2 was set to 50 75 100 125 and 150 Î¼g l and the concentration of cr6 was 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 Î¼g l respectively asim and rao 2021 islam et al 2015 kumar et al 2020 the toxicity of pollutants decreased the output current by inhibiting the metabolic activity of microorganisms resulting in fewer electrons produced the inhibition ratio ir was defined as the percentage of peak current inhibition after the addition of poison compared to that without poison the ir of the biosensor can be calculated by the equation i r i p e a k i x i p e a k 100 where ipeak and ix refer to the peak current of redox peaks during cv scanning with 10 mg l nitrite as substrate when non poisoned and poisoned respectively ipeak can be used as the background peak current while ix is the response peak current after the addition of poison x these experiments were performed in triplicate and were repeated three times ic50 is defined as the half maximal inhibitory concentration and ic20 is the 20 inhibitory concentration 2 4 physicochemical indexes determination and data analysis our established biosensor toxicity detection method has been carried out in the sichuan branch of the upper reaches of the yangtze river tuojiang river water samples were collected from jintang county in chengdu along the tuojiang river through jianyang city ziyang city zizhong county neijiang city zigong city fushun county and other cities and then joined the yangtze river in luzhou city with a total of 57 sampling points on november 2 to 5 2022 fig s1 in the field sampling the ph dissolved oxygen do and temperature were measured in real time using a portable meter after the field measurement the samples were transferred to the laboratory in a portable refrigerator 4 c and the remaining parameters were examined within 48 hours the concentrations of ammonia nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n total phosphorus tp and the chemical oxygen demand cod were measured with standard methods gilcreas 1966 the cr hg cu zn cd as and pb in the water samples were analyzed by coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7900 usa to guarantee the robustness of the analytical quality in our experiment we adopted the following methods 1 blank samples were measured during sample analysis 2 we analyzed three parallel samples for each sample 3 the calibration curve was checked 4 we analyzed the certified reference materials during the analytical testing due to the nonnormal distributions of the data we used the inverse distance weighting idw method to construct geographic distribution maps of the water quality data during kriging analysis three types of semi variance models gaussian exponential and spherical were used to represent the relationship between semi variance and lag distance for both periods gaussian exponential and spherical the parameters from the best fit semi variance model highest coefficient of determination and lowest residual sum of squares were used to generate the spatial distribution map in arcgis using the ordinary kriging method 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality toxicity detection with nitrite as indicator substrate we have successfully constructed a biosensor based on nitrite oxidoreductase nxr which can accurately detect nitrite in the range of 0 3 100 mg l wang et al 2022c due to the catalytic action of nxr the characteristic peak of nitrite appeared at 0 62 v after the addition of nitrite fig s2 nob oxidized nitrite to nitrate via nxr improving the performance of specific responses and increasing sensitivity the thin biofilm 3 5 Î¼m high activity in random regions and dominant abundance of nob fig s3 ensure the sensitivity and reliability of this biosensor driven characteristic peak based on this principle we further derived the impact response of external pollutants to nitrite oxidation catalyzed by nob to establish a toxicity monitoring method of water quality based on nitrite sensor we chose the peak generated by 10 mg l nitrite as the biosensor s characteristic background peak and toxic pollutants decreased the current of the characteristic peak by inhibiting microbial activity 10 mg l of nitrite could cause significant peak currents and the amount of nitrite in conventional water does not exceed 10 mg l he et al 2017 then to explore the reaction kinetics of nitrite at the electrode the cv curves of nitrite at different scanning rates 0 5 10 mv s were investigated nitrite oxidation peak current has a linear relationship with the power of half the scanning rate fig 1 a the relationship between peak current and scanning rate in fig 1b was analyzed according to the randles sevcik equation elgrishi et al 2018 indicating that the reaction process was controlled by diffusion in the electrochemical system bharath et al 2015 finally a scanning rate of 5 mv s was adopted and indicator a 10 mg l nitrites was added as the detection parameter of the biosensor based on this method the anti interference ability of biosensors is crucial we have demonstrated that the biosensor s nitrite peak had anti interference capabilities for common anionic cations wang et al 2022c additionally because of the unavoidable existence of varying levels of organic matter in surface water sodium acetate and glucose were used to simulate different concentrations of cod to shock the biofilm in fig 1c and fig 1d it can be observed that concentrations ranging from 20 to 320 mg l of cod did not generate interference including the position and current of the characteristic peak fig 1 in fact the challenge that the water background value itself includes nitrite and impacts the base value must be solved based on the way of using peak current from nitrite oxidation as the background line of the characteristic peak the flow chart of the procedure and method for detecting the toxicity of water according to the different nitrite contents in water is summarized in fig 2 to begin detecting the initial nitrite concentration in the water sample is required to ensure the stability of subsequent detection this stage takes no more than 20 min and enables you to select from a choice of detecting methods abbas and mostafa 2000 murray et al 2019 wang et al 2022c 0 3 mg l was the lowest concentration of nitrite detected by the biosensor below which no characteristic peaks would appear when nitrite is not present in the water or is below 0 3 mg l indicator solution a will be directly added and detected by the biosensor when a certain amount of nitrite is present in the water sample the amount of indicator solution a added is the difference between 10 mg l and the actual value before assessing the water s toxicity as mentioned in the previous step dilute the water s nitrite concentration to make it less than 10 mg l in cases where it is more than 10 mg l however nitrites were rarely higher than 10 mg l in almost all natural waters he et al 2017 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 so this is an important reason why we chose 10 mg l as the baseline furthermore the influence of ph on stability was examined in fig s4 the results demonstrated that changing the ph from 6 8 to 7 9 had no effect on the characteristic peak form which is the ph range for most surface water in general the biosensor had the ability to resist the effects of anions cations organic matter and the presence of nitrite itself 3 2 comparison of toxicity test performance via cck 8 and electrical signals response after establishing the biosensor detection method the potential of the biosensor to detect the toxicity of acute pollutants was evaluated excessive disinfectant use during covid 19 resulted in a large number of dbps entering natural waters which might have a negative effect on the freshwater eco environment hong et al 2013 tcaa is a typical non volatile by product of drinking water chlorination disinfection esclapez et al 2012 as shown in fig 3 the toxicity of tcaa was detected using both cck 8 based on colorimetric detection and an electrochemical method the cck 8 assay fig 3b was used to detect tcaa toxicity at concentrations ranging from 10 to 80 Î¼g l however differences in cell viability at concentrations less than 20 Î¼g l were not detectable in the cck 8 assay moreover the r2 was only 0 675 and had low sensitivity ic20 42 80 Î¼g l when fitting the connection between tcaa concentration and ir of cell viability within the range of 20 80 Î¼g l although the cck 8 method is commonly used in other places its detection range is general medium and high concentration and its detection error is rather large for very low level detection in comparison the cv method demonstrated high sensitivity ic20 7 40Î¼g l in the same concentration range fig 3d and the tcaa concentration presented a linear connection with the ir with a correlation of 0 967 fig 3f according to the results shown above the biosensor based on characteristic peaks through cv exhibited a high sensitivity for detecting pollutant toxicity as compared to the conventional colorimetric method in addition the single detection time of the cv method was within 5 min which was more than ten times shorter than that of cck 8 it is worth noting that there are few reports on the toxicity detection of tcaa an acutely toxic emerging pollutant similarly wu et al also used electrochemical biocathode sensors to successfully detect the response of biofilms to tcaa by an amperometric method wu et al 2022 however the study included no mention of whether the baseline current could be disturbed by other substances in the water such as organics or nitrates which could affect the accuracy of the toxicity assessment actually because the redox potentials of different compounds have distinct redox peak locations the cv technique can avoid this impact 3 3 electrochemical toxicity detection of other acute toxic pollutants having confirmed the response of the biosensor to the acute toxic pollutant tcaa we next attempted to detect the toxicity of other pollutants including toxic heavy metals cd2 and cr6 and tcs fig 4 shows that the biosensor s minimum detection concentrations for toxic pollutants was 50 Î¼g l for cd2 30 Î¼g l for cr6 and 0 2 Î¼g l for tcs respectively the linear relationship between toxicity concentration and peak current change values was widely used to evaluate the relationship between the inhibition rate of electrical signals and toxicity the ir values increased with increasing concentrations of cd2 cr6 and tcs and exhibited a significant relationship with the following concentrations of cd2 50 150Î¼g l cr6 20 80Î¼g l and tcs 0 2 1 0Î¼g l fig 4b fig 4d and fig 4f r2 0 98 0 99 the results indicated that the biosensor could detect these toxic pollutants at lower concentrations than in most studies table 1 this great performance was achieved for the following reasons first during catalytic nitrification nob oxidized nitrite to nitrate via nxr improving the performance of specific responses and increasing sensitivity secondly most nob bacteria are autotrophic bacteria and the thickness of autotrophic biofilm is generally lower than that of heterotrophic biofilm this thin biofilm facilitated high electron transfer rates and thus exhibited high sensitivity finally the cv characteristic peak method can reduce the interference of other substances in the traditional i t recognition process improving sensitivity and accuracy for the toxicity detection of heavy metals cd2 and cr6 amperometric method is adopted in most studies in previous studies the amperometric method was mostly based on biological anodization which required the consumption of organic matter to provide current the detection time in this way was often greater than 30 minutes while our detection time only required less than 5 minutes the detection time was considerably reduced which aided in early warning moreover fig 4e shows the electrochemical response of tcs the relationship between tcs concentration and inhibition rate was also successfully detected by the cv method at present there are few reports on the detection of tcs and nano semiconductor materials such as metal oxides and metal oxide nanocomposite were mainly used for the detection of tcs sri et al 2022 which was costly and difficult to reflect the toxicity of water to sum up successful toxicity detection for these acute toxic pollutants can be used as a method to detect the concentration of water known to be contaminated or as water quality toxicity detection for different pollutants 3 4 toxicity detection for the compound pollutants a single pollutant does not always exist alone in real water combining several pollutants may have mixture effects resulting in water s comprehensive toxicity the three contaminants selected in the previous section were used to mix at different concentrations to detect combined toxicity using the established biosensor method fig 5 a indicates combined pollution of cd2 and cr6 interestingly the toxicity of cd2 and cr6 combined was lower than that of cr6 alone by electrochemical and clsm analysis which might be because the addition of cd2 reduced the original toxicity of cr6 and showed antagonistic effects this result was consistent with what previous researchers have found due to the interaction between chromium and cadmium kungolos and aoyama 1993 similarly tcs at 0 4 or 0 7 mg l combined with cr6 was much less toxic than cr6 or tcs alone fig 5b consistent with the clsm results for the mixed condition which showed a greater number of viable cells when tcs and tcaa were combined the toxicity was higher than tcs alone but lower than tcaa alone fig 5c according to the results presented after mixing the pollutants as described above when a variety of pollutants were mixed in water it was difficult to reflect the true toxicity of water solely by the concentration detection of pollutants this is because there were multi component mixture effects even though each chemical was present at levels well below its noec which is in accordance with previous findings bexfield et al 2021 faust et al 2001 silva et al 2002 in addition since there was a lack of detailed toxicological data on many emerging pollutants or compounds when they were combined the potential health impacts were unclear fenner et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to use water toxicity as a supplementary indicator for water quality assessment especially for emerging pollutants and compound pollutants 3 5 toxicity detection of real water in tuojiang river basin the tuojiang river fig 6 is the most densely populated area in sichuan province which makes it an essential work area for water pollution prevention and management separate measurements were taken of the physicochemical characteristics and amounts of conventional pollutants nh4 n no2 n no3 n cod tp do ph and heavy metals in natural water the ph of the water ranged from 6 9 to 7 8 and the dissolved oxygen ranged from 6 4 to 9 1 the results fig 7 indicated that the average nitrogen content of the water ranged from class iii to iv according to the environmental quality standards for water in china table s2 tp average concentrations in the tuojiang river were 0 07 mg l and the cod average concentrations were 13 8 mg l which did not exceed the class iv threshold except for a few sites where mercury concentrations were inferior to class v 1 5 2 1 Î¼g l none of the other conventional heavy metal contents exceeded class iii fig s5 table s2 furthermore the water toxicity was detected by biosensors and the results showed that the average toxicity inhibition rate was 5 9 and the inhibition rate ranged from 0 5 to 15 8 we repeated three trials and measured the relative standard deviation rsd and discovered that the biosensor was stable except at some sites where the rsd was 10 while the ir was less than 2 fig s6 which was caused by extremely low pollutant concentrations as a result only when ir is greater than 2 can it be considered a valid result based on our method compared with the single heavy metal we evaluated fig 5a the maximum value of toxicity inhibition in the tuojiang river basin did not exceed the inhibition rate of 50 Î¼g l cd2 16 0 but was close to the water quality toxicity caused by 10 Î¼g l tcaa these data showed that although the concentration of a single conventional pollutant in water did not exceed the discharge standard for surface water the comprehensive toxicity of natural water should not be ignored even if the toxicity suppression rate in the sampling area was less than 16 0 these few higher levels of toxicity inhibition were attributed to increased concentrations of the heavy metal mercury as well as we speculate the fact that lower concentrations of pollutants may have mixture effects when combined resulting in water toxicity as a result the biosensor based method proposed in this study can be used as a supplementary indicator to analyze water quality toxicity in natural water rivers and lakes providing a rapid analysis method to monitor the basin s water quality characteristics more comprehensively to contribute to the next step of water treatment 4 conclusion a rapid and interference resistant detection method for water toxicity based on a biosensor was developed the biosensor s accuracy was verified by a comparison of toxicity test performance via cck 8 and clsm the accuracy of the biosensor for the detection of toxicity in water was tested with toxic heavy metals cd2 and cr6 tcs and tcaa both individually and in combination using the tuojiang river as a natural water test target the comprehensive water quality toxicity detection in the tuojiang river was based for the first time on the biosensor method and showed that even if a single pollutant did not exceed the discharge standard the toxicity of the water quality could not be ignored this method will be a beneficial supplement to conventional water quality detection to understand the characteristics of the water as a result this study provided a rapid analysis method for more systematically detecting the basin s water quality in order to contribute to the next stage of water treatment in the following study the threshold between water quality toxicity and actual harm to humans is unclear and more research is needed to establish an accurate correlation between water quality toxicity and ecological environmental risk credit authorship contribution statement jingting

14974,water toxicity detection as a valuable supplement to conventional water quality measurement is an important method for evaluating water environmental quality standards however the toxicity of composite pollutants is more complicated due to their mixture effects this study developed a novel rapid and interference resistant detection method for water toxicity based on an electrochemical biosensor using peak current from nitrite oxidation as a signal toxicants could weaken the characteristic peak current of nitrite to indicate the magnitude of toxicity the proof of concept study was first conducted using a synthetic water sample containing trichloroacetic acid tcaa and then the results were compared with those of the traditional toxicity colorimetric method cck 8 kit and laser confocal microscopy clsm the accuracy of the biosensor was further verified with water samples containing individual pollutants such as cd2 50 150 Î¼g l cr6 20 80 Î¼g l mixture triclosan tcs 0 1 1 0 Î¼g l and tcaa 10 80 Î¼g l or a mixture of the above the viability of the sensor was further validated with the actual water sample from the tuojiang river the results demonstrated that although the concentration of a single conventional pollutant in water did not exceed the discharge standard for surface water the comprehensive toxicity of natural water should not be ignored this method could be a beneficial supplement to conventional water quality detection to understand the characteristics of the water and thus contribute to the next stage of water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords toxicity detection combined pollutants biosensor cyclic voltammetry basin comprehensive water toxicity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years water pollution in china has developed from general pollutants to toxic and harmful pollutants which present potential risks to human health and the ecological environment li et al 2018 when there are several known or unknown pollutants in water mixture effects may occur making an accurate correlation of actual toxicity difficult to establish only by detecting pollutant concentration cedergreen 2014 acute toxicity detection as a useful supplement to conventional water quality indicators chemical oxygen demand or dissolved organic matter content for example is important for evaluating water environmental quality standards he et al 2020 kirsanov et al 2013 aquatic creatures such as fish and algae have already been utilized as biological sensors to detect acute toxicity in water but these methods are typically characterized by time consuming and difficult manipulations pujol vila et al 2015 turemis et al 2018 wang et al 2013 furthermore faster and simpler in vitro bioassays using mammalian cell lines have also been used for water quality monitoring according to different cellular toxicity pathways brack et al 2019 however it is difficult to find an ideal bioassay for water quality assessment that covers a wide range of cellular toxicity pathways escher et al 2014 neale et al 2017 in particular pollutants are widely diffused in water with substances like heavy metals disinfection by products dbps or methylbenzene only present at extremely low concentrations dann and hontela 2011 kabir et al 2015 even if some indicators have reached level a of the integrated wastewater discharge standard in china table s1 there are great risks to the ecology which require highly sensitive toxicity detection techniques microbial based acute toxicity detection has attracted extensive attention from researchers cui et al 2018 eltzov et al 2015 hassan et al 2019 yu et al 2017 among which the technology based on luminescent bacteria is the most widely used elad et al 2011 parvez et al 2006 shi et al 2013 however luminous bacteria are not suitable for colorful and high turbidity samples which might result in false positive results farrÃ© and barcelÃ³ 2003 for all these reasons rapid accurate sensitive and at the same time cost effective analytical methods are necessary the detecting principle of an electrochemical biosensor is to transform the effect of pollutants on microorganisms into measurable electrical signals jin et al 2017 kim et al 2007 prevoteau and rabaey 2017 qi et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 this is because the toxicity of pollutants inhibits the activity of enzymes and respiratory and metabolic processes in microorganisms as well as the generation and transfer of electrons resulting in changes in current intensity yang et al 2020 whole cell sensors compared to enzyme biosensors have the capacity for regeneration and long term availability and have gradually demonstrated substantial benefits in detecting water quality biotoxicity erable et al 2010 for example wang et al designed a highly sensitive and durable electrochemical sensor based on geobacter dominated biofilms for heavy metal toxicity detection wang et al 2022b wu et al constructed a novel clostridium based toxicity sensor for cu2 in situ monitoring wu et al 2018 a bio electrochemical sensor based on suspended shewanella oneidensis mr 1 also exhibited high sensitivity for toxicity detection of a single heavy metal zang et al 2021 however there are inevitably multiple pollutants in the actual waters simultaneously which are often combined with different contaminants including nitrogen and phosphorus pollution heavy metals disinfection by products antibacterial agents etc compared to a single toxic pollutant the toxicity of composite pollutants is more complicated due to their mixture effects therefore it is urgent to construct a comprehensive toxicity detection method that would be rapid accurate and sensitive for monitoring actual water samples although amperometry is very common for signal output in microbial electrochemical sensor equipped with the sensing element of a bioanode or biocathode the high false negative and false positive largely limit the practical application which are caused by shocks of concomitant and condition in the anode and cathode units respectively chu et al 2021 moreover the response process of organic matter need a long time of 12 22 hours via amperometry to monitor the output current resulting in no timely warning naradasu et al 2020 the cyclic voltammetry cv method can reduce disturbance because of the difference in redox potential between substances which presents different frontal positions in our previous study cv was constructed by a nitrifying biofilm to detect nitrite timely and sensitively showing the specific recognition by the presence of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and nitrite oxidase enzyme nxr on the electrode biofilm wang et al 2022c therefore a indicator with nitrite for toxicity detection of combined pollution was proposed and the proof of concept study was first conducted using a synthetic water sample containing trichloroacetic acid tcaa this biosensor s working principle was to use the peak produced by 10 mg l nitrite as the biosensor s characteristic background peak and the toxic pollutant would detect toxicity by inhibiting microbial activity and decreasing the output current of the characteristic peak toxic heavy metals cd2 and cr6 triclosan tcs and tcaa were selected to test the detection performance of the biosensors for toxicity in water we then evaluate the toxicity of the above pollutants in different combinations of composite pollutants furthermore the interference of substances organic substances with the biosensor was investigated to verify its stability the electrochemical toxicity detection method we established was also confirmed by mutual validation of the traditional toxicity colorimetric method cck 8 kit and laser confocal microscopy toxicity characterization demonstrating this method s reliability in assessing the comprehensive toxicity of the water finally the established complete acute toxicity detection method for water was first applied to the upper tributary of the yangtze river tuojiang river to evaluate the environmental safety of the basin this study will provide a rapid analysis method for more systematically detecting the basin s water quality in order to contribute to the next stage of water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculation construction and operation of biosensor the electroactive biosensor based on a nitrite biosensor developed by our team in the previous study wang et al 2022c a pre treated carbon felt wang et al 2020 with a thickness of 0 3 cm and a diameter of 2 cm was used as the working electrode a piece of platinum plate with a 0 1 cm and a diameter of 1 cm was used as the counter electrode the reference electrode was an ag agcl electrode 0 197 v vs she and was placed in the working electrode chamber the biosensor worked under a potential of 0 3 v vs ag agcl control for initiation with inoculated nitrifying bacteria 3 ml from our lab the medium was 50 mm pbs 7 8 g l nah2po4 0 1 g l nahco3 containing 1 mg l vitamin balch et al 1979 and 10 mg l nh4 n solution after 14 days of acclimation at 26 c the biosensor successfully reached a stable state and the output electrical signal did not fluctuate 2 2 toxicity testing methods for mutual verification for testing contaminant toxicity the cck 8 kit a traditional colorimetric method was used for comparative validation the cck 8 kit is a rapid and highly sensitive assay kit based on wst 8 for the detection of cell proliferation and cytotoxicity the washed cell suspension was shocked with tcaa 10 to 80 Î¼g l treated for 12 h and incubated with the cck 8 reagent the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader synergy htx usa after further incubation for 1 hour in the cell incubator cck 8 and biosensor methods were performed under the same environmental conditions detect time and temperature and these experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three times the toxicity degree of pollutants to biofilms was also compared and verified by the live dead baclighttm bacterial viability kit thermo fisher after shock with toxic pollutants electrode biofilms were rinsed with 0 8 sterile saline and immersed in the bacterial viability kit for 20 min a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm leica tcs sp8 germany was used to observe the biofilm activity and 6 8 images were collected at random for each sample to avoid experimental error 2 3 methods for toxicity testing and calculation of inhibition rate to establish a method for acute toxicity detection of water quality tcaa tcs cd2 cdcl2 5h2o and cr6 k2cr2o7 were used separately the concentration of pollutants was set regarding the environmental river during the covid 19 epidemic the concentration of tcaa in water was higher than before wang et al 2022a ye et al 2011 so the final concentration of tcaa was set at 10 20 40 60 80 Î¼g l at the working electrode based on future predictions for global river exports of triclosan the final concentration of tcs was 0 1 1 0 Î¼g l at intervals of 0 1 Î¼g van wijnen et al 2018 the concentration of cd2 was set to 50 75 100 125 and 150 Î¼g l and the concentration of cr6 was 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 Î¼g l respectively asim and rao 2021 islam et al 2015 kumar et al 2020 the toxicity of pollutants decreased the output current by inhibiting the metabolic activity of microorganisms resulting in fewer electrons produced the inhibition ratio ir was defined as the percentage of peak current inhibition after the addition of poison compared to that without poison the ir of the biosensor can be calculated by the equation i r i p e a k i x i p e a k 100 where ipeak and ix refer to the peak current of redox peaks during cv scanning with 10 mg l nitrite as substrate when non poisoned and poisoned respectively ipeak can be used as the background peak current while ix is the response peak current after the addition of poison x these experiments were performed in triplicate and were repeated three times ic50 is defined as the half maximal inhibitory concentration and ic20 is the 20 inhibitory concentration 2 4 physicochemical indexes determination and data analysis our established biosensor toxicity detection method has been carried out in the sichuan branch of the upper reaches of the yangtze river tuojiang river water samples were collected from jintang county in chengdu along the tuojiang river through jianyang city ziyang city zizhong county neijiang city zigong city fushun county and other cities and then joined the yangtze river in luzhou city with a total of 57 sampling points on november 2 to 5 2022 fig s1 in the field sampling the ph dissolved oxygen do and temperature were measured in real time using a portable meter after the field measurement the samples were transferred to the laboratory in a portable refrigerator 4 c and the remaining parameters were examined within 48 hours the concentrations of ammonia nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n total phosphorus tp and the chemical oxygen demand cod were measured with standard methods gilcreas 1966 the cr hg cu zn cd as and pb in the water samples were analyzed by coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7900 usa to guarantee the robustness of the analytical quality in our experiment we adopted the following methods 1 blank samples were measured during sample analysis 2 we analyzed three parallel samples for each sample 3 the calibration curve was checked 4 we analyzed the certified reference materials during the analytical testing due to the nonnormal distributions of the data we used the inverse distance weighting idw method to construct geographic distribution maps of the water quality data during kriging analysis three types of semi variance models gaussian exponential and spherical were used to represent the relationship between semi variance and lag distance for both periods gaussian exponential and spherical the parameters from the best fit semi variance model highest coefficient of determination and lowest residual sum of squares were used to generate the spatial distribution map in arcgis using the ordinary kriging method 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality toxicity detection with nitrite as indicator substrate we have successfully constructed a biosensor based on nitrite oxidoreductase nxr which can accurately detect nitrite in the range of 0 3 100 mg l wang et al 2022c due to the catalytic action of nxr the characteristic peak of nitrite

using both cck 8 based on colorimetric detection and an electrochemical method the cck 8 assay fig 3b was used to detect tcaa toxicity at concentrations ranging from 10 to 80 Î¼g l however differences

significant relationship with the following concentrations of cd2 50 150Î¼g l cr6 20 80Î¼g l and tcs 0 2 1 0Î¼g l fig 4b fig 4d and fig 4f r2 0 98 0 99 the results indicated that the biosensor could detect these toxic pollutants at lower concentrations than in most studies table 1 this great performance was achieved for the following reasons first during catalytic nitrification nob oxidized nitrite to nitrate via nxr improving the performance of specific responses and increasing sensitivity secondly most nob bacteria are autotrophic bacteria and the thickness of autotrophic biofilm is generally lower than that of heterotrophic biofilm this thin biofilm facilitated high electron transfer rates and thus exhibited high sensitivity finally the cv characteristic peak method can reduce the interference of other substances in the traditional i t recognition process improving sensitivity and accuracy for the toxicity detection of heavy metals cd2 and cr6 amperometric method is adopted in most studies in previous studies the amperometric method was mostly based on biological anodization which required the consumption of organic matter to provide current the detection time in this way was often greater than 30 minutes while our detection time only required less than 5 minutes the detection time was considerably reduced which aided in early warning moreover fig 4e shows the electrochemical response of tcs the relationship between tcs concentration and inhibition rate was also successfully detected by the cv method at present there are few reports on the detection of tcs and nano semiconductor materials such as metal oxides and metal oxide nanocomposite were mainly used for the detection of tcs sri et al 2022 which was costly and difficult to reflect the toxicity of water to sum up successful toxicity detection for these acute toxic pollutants can be used as a method to detect the concentration of water known to be contaminated or as water quality toxicity detection for different pollutants 3 4 toxicity detection for the compound pollutants a single pollutant does not always exist alone in real water combining several pollutants may have mixture effects resulting in water s comprehensive toxicity the three contaminants selected in the previous section were used to mix at different concentrations to detect combined toxicity using the established biosensor method fig 5 a indicates combined pollution of cd2 and cr6 interestingly the toxicity of cd2 and cr6 combined was lower than that of cr6 alone by electrochemical and clsm analysis which might be because the addition of cd2 reduced the original toxicity of cr6 and showed antagonistic effects this result was consistent with what previous researchers have found due to the interaction between chromium and cadmium kungolos and aoyama 1993 similarly tcs at 0 4 or 0 7 mg l combined with cr6 was much less toxic than cr6 or tcs alone fig 5b consistent with the clsm results for the mixed condition which showed a greater number of viable cells when tcs and tcaa were combined the toxicity was higher than tcs alone but lower than tcaa alone fig 5c according to the results presented after mixing the pollutants as described above when a variety of pollutants were mixed in water it was difficult to reflect the true toxicity of water solely by the concentration detection of pollutants this is because there were multi component mixture effects even though each chemical was present at levels well below its noec which is in accordance with previous findings bexfield et al 2021 faust et al 2001 silva et al 2002 in addition since there was a lack of detailed toxicological data on many emerging pollutants or compounds when they were combined the potential health impacts were unclear fenner et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to use water toxicity as a supplementary indicator for water quality assessment especially for emerging pollutants and compound pollutants 3 5 toxicity detection of real water in tuojiang river basin the tuojiang river fig 6 is the most densely populated area in sichuan province which makes it an essential work area for water pollution prevention and management separate measurements were taken of the physicochemical characteristics and amounts of conventional pollutants nh4 n no2 n no3 n cod tp do ph and heavy metals in natural water the ph of the water ranged from 6 9 to 7 8 and the dissolved oxygen ranged from 6 4 to 9 1 the results fig 7 indicated that the average nitrogen content of the water ranged from class iii to iv according to the environmental quality standards for water in china table s2 tp average concentrations in the tuojiang river were 0 07 mg l and the cod average concentrations were 13 8 mg l which did not exceed the class iv threshold except for a few sites where mercury concentrations were inferior to class v 1 5 2 1 Î¼g l none of the other conventional heavy metal contents exceeded class iii fig s5 table s2 furthermore the water toxicity was detected by biosensors and the results showed that the average toxicity inhibition rate was 5 9 and the inhibition rate ranged from 0 5 to 15 8 we repeated three trials and measured the relative standard deviation rsd and discovered that the biosensor was stable except at some sites where the rsd was 10 while the ir was less than 2 fig s6 which was caused by extremely low pollutant concentrations as a result only when ir is greater than 2 can it be considered a valid result based on our method compared with the single heavy metal we evaluated fig 5a the maximum value of toxicity inhibition in the tuojiang river basin did not exceed the inhibition rate of 50 Î¼g l cd2 16 0 but was close to the water quality toxicity caused by 10 Î¼g l tcaa these data showed that although the concentration of a single conventional pollutant in water did not exceed the discharge standard for surface water the comprehensive toxicity of natural water should not be ignored even if the toxicity suppression rate in the sampling area was less than 16 0 these few higher levels of toxicity inhibition were attributed to increased concentrations of the heavy metal mercury as well as we speculate the fact that lower concentrations of pollutants may have mixture effects when combined resulting in water toxicity as a result the biosensor based method proposed in this study can be used as a supplementary indicator to analyze water quality toxicity in natural water rivers and lakes providing a rapid analysis method to monitor the basin s water quality characteristics more comprehensively to contribute to the next step of water treatment 4 conclusion a rapid and interference resistant detection method for water toxicity based on a biosensor was developed the biosensor s accuracy was verified by a comparison of toxicity test performance via cck 8 and clsm the accuracy of the biosensor for the detection of toxicity in water was tested with toxic heavy metals cd2 and cr6 tcs and tcaa both individually and in combination using the tuojiang river as a natural water test target the comprehensive water quality toxicity detection in the tuojiang river was based for the first time on the biosensor method and showed that even if a single pollutant did not exceed the discharge standard the toxicity of the water quality could not be ignored this method will be a beneficial supplement to conventional water quality detection to understand the characteristics of the water as a result this study provided a rapid analysis method for more systematically detecting the basin s water quality in order to contribute to the next stage of water treatment in the following study the threshold between water quality toxicity and actual harm to humans is unclear and more research is needed to establish an accurate correlation between water quality toxicity and ecological environmental risk credit authorship contribution statement jingting
