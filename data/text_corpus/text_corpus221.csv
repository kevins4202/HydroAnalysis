1105,the hydraulic properties of the soil surface strongly depend on the physical attributes of the soil and understanding such hydro physical soil dynamics is both economically e g recharging of the water table and ecologically e g maintenance of available moisture for the vegetation important the objective of this work was therefore to characterize the hydro physical characteristics of the soil in an area dominated by acuri palms in the northern brazilian pantanal transects of 50m was delimited and two treatments with six replicates were demarcated in one treatment soil litter accumulated on the soil was collected monthly during a period of two years in the other treatment soil litter was left under natural conditions data were collected on soil density particle density total porosity volumetric humidity texture hydraulic conductivity saturated and unsaturated and infiltration soil density was higher when soil litter was absent and had deeper layers greater volumetric moisture and higher total porosity when soil litter was present infiltration rate was significantly higher in the absence of litter probably due to the lower matrix potential when the soil is drier significantly saturated hydraulic conductivity was higher in the litter treatment and had a positive correlation with volumetric moisture 0 5cm depth indicating that soil water fluxes are enhanced by natural vegetation cover in contrast unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was significantly higher in the absence of litter these results clearly demonstrate that soil litter exerts a strong influence on the hydro physical characteristics of the soil improving physical quality leading to greater water flow keywords leaf litter phytophysiology soil water flux wetland 1 introduction the hydraulic properties of the soil surface are extremely important to understand regional water balance since they strongly influence water exchange at the soil atmosphere interface gonzalez sosa et al 2010 robust modelling of water flows in natural systems therefore depends on accurate characterization of soil hydrological processes alagna et al 2016 such a characterization requires the knowledge of the hydraulic properties of the soil especially hydraulic conductivity the soil s ability to transmit water hendrayanto et al 2000 maximum hydraulic conductivity is reached when the soil is saturated and is therefore termed saturated hydraulic conductivity ks reichardt 1990 this variable is particularly important because it strongly influences other hydrological processes in the soil such as infiltration alagna et al 2016 typically measured in terms of water flux across a surface per unit time mesquita and moraes 2004 hydrological properties are directly influenced by the soil s physical properties such as density alves et al 2007 panachuki et al 2011 texture mesquita and moraes 2004 silva et al 2005 soil humidity andrade et al 1987 porosity nicoloso et al 2008 sales et al 1999 vegetation cover tucci and clarke 1997 and the conversion of rainfall to soil water zhu et al 2014 beyond this the litter that naturally accumulates on the surface of the soil also strongly influences the hydro physical properties of the soil acting as a physical barrier that reduces water loss to the atmosphere while simultaneously protecting against soil erosion sedimentation excessive nutrient leaching and elevated water temperature fajardo et al 2010 nevertheless despite the fundamental importance of soil hydro physical characteristics for understanding key ecosystem processes knowledge is very limited for the majority of natural ecosystems in brazil surprisingly this knowledge shortfall extends to the pantanal of mato grosso the largest seasonally floodplain in the world which plays a key role in regional water atmosphere dynamics to our knowledge there are very few studies that deal with soil properties and hydro physical processes that occur in this unique ecosystem or how these soil properties are related to ecosystem functioning the pantanal composed of a mosaic of relief forms that differ in vegetative agglomerations and flood dynamics johnson et al 2013 it is characterized by several phytophysiognomies including the acurizal a region dominated by the palm scheelea phalerata mart ex spreng known locally as acuri each phytophysiognomic region has a characteristic type of soil and vegetation and therefore different dynamics of soil litter production accumulation and decomposition here we analyze the hydro physical variables of the soils of the acurizal and investigate how they respond to the presence absence of soil litter by manipulating this variable we are able to characterize an important link between the soil and the ecosystem dynamics as well as better understand the interactions between local hydrological meteorological conditions and the hydro physical properties of the soil 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the north of the south america pantanal in the baía das pedras park part of the ecological station of the comercial social service sesc pantanal em poconé mato grosso state brazil the region is largely unaffected by human influence and is located at 16 30 15 s 56 24 15 e 466m above sea level fig 1 the climate of this region is characterized by two rainy seasons and one dry season usually between may and september cunha and junk 2004 the average annual rainfall of the floodplain varies between 1000 and 1400mm with a maximum typically in january and a minimum typically in july the mean air temperature in summer december to february is 32 c decreasing to approximately 21 c in the winter hofmann et al 2010 the study area is classified as semi deciduous forest hofmann et al 2010 and is referred to locally as acurizal due to the dominance of the palm scheelea phalerata mart ex spreng popularly known as acuri although this palm is the dominant species in the acurizal 362 4individuals ha 23 other tree species from 19 families have been recorded among which the highest densities individual per hectare are found in combretum leprosum mart 81 83ind ha anadenanthera falcata benth speg 58 45ind ha and rheedia brasiliensis planch triana 46 76ind ha sanches et al 2015 the soil of the acurizal is acidic ph 6 4 with low organic matter content 2 and average annual carbon of 27 55 g kg and is classified as a haplic eutrophic planosol carvalho 2013 2 2 collection period and experimental design data collection was carried out between april 6 and 8 2016 april is a transition period between the dry season and the rainy season so the soil is not fully saturated this period was chosen because it allows a better analysis of the influence of litter on soil moisture and consequently on infiltration and hydraulic conductivity we used two treatments each with six replicates arranged in randomized blocks and distributed along a 50m transect in the first treatment termed removal soil litter was collected once a month for a period of approximately two years in the second treatment termed control the litter was left under natural conditions 2 3 field measurements 2 3 1 soil litter soil litter production was measured from february 2014 to december 2016 using twelve 1m2 circular metallic collectors located close to the replicates of the control treatment the collectors had a similar height to those used for monitoring flooded areas haase 1999 accumulated litter samples were taken using collectors of 0 05m2 arranged randomly on the ground as close as possible to the litter production collectors see above 2 3 2 soil physical attributes soil samples were collected at 0 5cm 10 15cm and 25 30cm depth in each replicate for a total of 36 samples the soil samples were collected in volumetric stainless steel cylinders with a volume of 100cm3 using a sampler for undisturbed samples the following physical attributes of the soil were assessed i texture by the pipette method ii volumetric humidity iii apparent density iv particle density and v total porosity all measurements followed recommendations from the manual of soil analysis methods embrapa 2011 dry samples were kept in a forced ventilation greenhouse dismantled and passed in a 2mm mesh sieve additionally root density was analyzed using the methodologies described by cunha et al 2010 and the pedology technical manual ibge 2015 2 3 3 infiltration infiltration was measured with a double ring infiltrator composed of two rings 50 25cm in diameter and 30cm in height which are concentrically inserted into the soil infiltration measurements were made using the inner ring since the outer ring only functions to prevent horizontal infiltration the rings have a graduated ruler on the inner wall to measure water slide variation infiltration was calculated as a rate based on variations of the blade at set time intervals 2 3 4 saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured with the dual head infiltrometer decagon usa a pressure infiltrometer that stores water at the top of the ground and uses air pressure to create two different pressure loads the infiltrator automatically maintains correct water levels and measures infiltration rates through two complete pressure cycles each of the cycles consists of two periods of the same duration one with the pressure maintained at a high load and the other with pressure maintained at a low load unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil was measured with a mini disk infiltrometer macro decagon usa a voltage infiltrometer that measures the unsaturated conductivity at different voltages 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal analysis of soil litter production and accumulation mean litter production varied seasonally in the acurizal the mean minimum depositions were 5 8 3 8g m2 and 19 11 8g m2 in february 2014 and may 2015 respectively mean maximum depositions were 113 5 41g m2 and 91 4 17 7g m2 in july 2014 and august 2015 respectively fig 2 the highest average litter production was observed in august 2014 and 2015 these peaks occurred during the dry season when there is abundant leaf fall in response to increased water stress alves et al 2006 accumulation of soil litter also showed a well defined seasonality in 2014 with a minimum of 373 2 140 1g m2 in may and a maximum of 2510 3 929 4g m2 in october however the amplitude was considerably lower in 2015 with a mean minimum of 402 6 116 9g m2 and a mean maximum of 1284 1 329 9g m2 the second half of 2014 had a notably higher average accumulated litter than the same period in 2015 possibly in response to water stress due to excess water indeed the second half of 2014 had markedly higher monthly rainfall than the second half of 2015 fig 2 this result has parallels with a recent study of the contribution of litter and nutrients in restored forest in seropédica rio de janeiro state which demonstrated that the contribution of litter in the rainy season can be similar to the dry season villa et al 2016 the authors attributed this to waterlogged soil causing a lack of oxygenation of the roots and consequently a greater fall of leaves due to metabolic adjustments the average litter yield was less than 20g m2 monthly in the first quarter of 2016 while the average accumulated litter gradually increased from 536 1 148 8g m2 in january 2016 to 643 9 231 4g m2 to march 2016 3 2 characterization and analysis of soil physical attributes in control and removal treatments the particle size distribution was similar between treatments this was expected because soil use and management are known to have little effect on soil texture which is more related to source material and weathering processes reinert and reichert 2006 fernandes et al 2007 coringa et al 2012 the texture of the soil surface in the study area varied from sandy loam to sandy clay loam and was classified as sandy clay loam in both treatments average soil composition consisted of 9 8 silt 21 69 clay and 68 47 sand fig 3 soil density was higher in the removal treatment in 0 5cm and 10 15cm soil layers in comparison to the control treatment in the 25 30cm deep layer the density was similar in both treatments probably because the influence of litter is greater in the superficial layers because these are in direct contact with the organic material deposited on the soil mean soil density was 1 25kg dm3 control treatment and 1 32kg dm3 removal treatment in the 0 5cm layer 1 18kg dm3 control treatment and 1 51kg dm3 removal treatment in the 10 15cm layer and 1 54kg dm3 control treatment and 1 56kg dm3 removal treatment in the 25 30cm layer fig 4 the lower soil density in the control treatment may be related to the greater amount of organic matter deposited on the soil soils with high organic matter usually have lower densities when compared to soils with lower organic content due to the higher mass of inorganic particles fageria and stone 2006 soil density also varied between soil layers with a significant increase in the lowest layer 25 30cm such lower density in surface layers may also be related to the litter since it is more predominant on the surface moreover soil density also tends to increase and porosity decreases with depth because of the physical pressure exerted by the upper layers on the lower ones a process known as densification santana 2009 the particle density was homogeneous between both layers and treatments this homogeneity is mainly due to particle density being expressed as soil bulk density per unit volume which depends primarily on soil mineralogy and is unaffected management changes reinert and reichert 2006 fig 4 within depth layers total porosity was higher in the control treatment than the removal treatment in general the highest porosity was observed at the soil surface with a mean of 0 49m3 m 3 in the control treatment and 0 45m3 m 3 in the removal treatment in the 0 5cm depth layer fig 4 total porosity is inversely proportional to soil density reinert and reichert 2006 therefore the higher total porosity observed in the control is associated with the lower soil density in this treatment due to its higher content of organic matter volumetric humidity was also higher in the control treatment than the removal treatment when compared in the same depth layer however unlike porosity it was lower at the soil surface the volumetric moisture content was 0 073m3 m 3 in the control treatment and 0 069m3 m 3 in the removal treatment in the 0 5cm layer 0 11m3 m 3 control and 0 13m3 m 3 removal in the 10 15cm depth layer and 0 10m3 m 3 control and 0 09m3 m 3 removal in the 25 30cm depth layer fig 4 the consistently lower humidity in the removal treatment may be the result of the higher exposure of this treatment to radiation facilitating evaporation from the soil s surface in the control treatment the soil litter acts as a physical barrier both for atmospheric radiation and for loss of water from the soil to the atmosphere fig 4 lower soil humidity may also be related to greater exposure to the climatic agents responsible for generating a vapor pressure gradient of the air and consequently to demand water from the soil by the evaporation process rios et al 2013 it may also be a reflection of the downward movement of water to deeper layers as a function of gravitational potential reichardt and timm 2004 root dry matter density was generally higher in the 0 5cm soil layer ranging from 0 001 to approximately 0 01kgdm 3 with predominance of fine and coarse roots fig 5 fine root density is typically higher in surface layers due to the lower density of the soil and consequently lower mechanical resistance allowing easy penetration for small roots higher soil density necessarily requires plants to adapt with roots of greater diameter that are able to penetrate these deeper layers misra et al 1986 3 3 infiltration the mean infiltration rate was initially raised in both treatments in the fifth minute of the test the mean infiltration rate was 210mmh 1 in the control treatment and 193 3mmh 1 in the removal treatment fig 6 such a high infiltration rate at the start of the test is due to a high frequency of air filled the pores brandão 2003 as the soil saturates infiltration decreases since most of the pores are already filled with water and the matrix potential becomes less negative collischonn and dornelles 2015 although the mean infiltration curve was similar in both treatments it was significantly lower in the control probably as a result of the greater humidity of the soil in this treatment this causes the water to infiltrate more slowly than the removal treatment where the matrix potential is initially more negative however there were no statistically significant differences between infiltration rates of both treatments this finding supports confirms observations that humid soil initially has lower infiltration rates due to a lower hydraulic gradient smaller difference in soil matrix potential and consequently the rate of infiltration quickly becomes constant 3 4 hydraulic conductivity mean ks was significantly higher in the control treatment 69 90 38 52mmh 1 than the removal treatment 24 61 13 70mmh 1 in other words ks decreased approximately 65 when soil litter was removed however there were no statistically significant differences between treatments fig 7 hydraulic conductivity is highly dependent on water content of the soil and its value decreases markedly with a decrease of humidity thus the higher values of ks in the control treatment may be related to the moisture difference as well as the other soil attributes bernardes 2005 ks is correlated with volumetric humidity in the soil surface layer 0 5cm in both treatments with total porosity between 10 and 15cm depth in the removal treatment it is inversely correlated with soil density in the 10 15cm depth layer in the removal treatment withdrawn the highest correlation coefficients 0 87 and 0 91 were observed between ks and volumetric humidity in the 0 5cm depth layer in the removal and control treatments respectively table 1 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ was statistically similar in both treatments 18 99 10 20mmh 1 control and 20 38 9 20mmh 1 removal fig 7 however despite the high variability mean k θ was significantly higher in the removal treatment even though porosity and soil density were more favourable for water conduction in the control treatment fig 4 this may occur because unsaturated hydraulic conductivity increases when matrix potential becomes more negative and may therefore be caused by higher soil moisture however there was no significant correlation between the soil s physical attributes and k θ in the removal treatment in contrast in the control treatment there were strong positive correlations 0 86 and 0 98 respectively between k θ and volumetric moisture in the first two layers of the soil 0 5cm and 10 15cm soil density also had a positive correlation with k θ while total porosity was inversely correlated table 2 this supports observations that the mini disk infiltrator does not perform well in soils with high levels of superficial organic material underestimating the data marchini et al 2015 therefore the positive correlation between volumetric moisture and k θ and the absence of correlation between soil attributes and k θ in the control treatment may reflect limitations of the experimental equipment for soils with organic material rather than any changes in hydro physical processes 4 conclusions we can draw the following conclusions from the above study i there is clear seasonality in the production and accumulation of litter in the acuri palm forests of the brazilian pantanal biome ii the soil underneath naturally accumulated soil litter has greater porosity and retains more moisture than soil where the litter has been removed iii infiltration of water is significantly lower in soils with intact soil litter iv saturated hydraulic conductivity has great variability is strongly correlated with volumetric humidity and is higher in soil with intact litter v unsaturated hydraulic conductivity also has great variability positively correlates with the volumetric moisture and soil density but is not influenced by the presence or absence of soil litter conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards funding body none acknowledgements

initially more negative however there were no statistically significant differences between infiltration rates of both treatments this finding supports confirms observations that humid soil initially has lower infiltration rates due to a lower hydraulic gradient smaller difference in soil matrix potential and consequently the rate of infiltration quickly becomes constant 3 4 hydraulic conductivity mean ks was significantly higher in the control treatment 69 90 38 52mmh 1 than the removal treatment 24 61 13 70mmh 1 in other words ks decreased approximately 65 when soil litter was removed however there were no statistically significant differences between treatments fig 7 hydraulic conductivity is highly dependent on water content of the soil and its value decreases markedly with a decrease of humidity thus the higher values of ks in the control treatment may be related to the moisture difference as well as the other soil attributes bernardes 2005 ks is correlated with volumetric humidity in the soil surface layer 0 5cm in both treatments with total porosity between 10 and 15cm depth in the removal treatment it is inversely correlated with soil density in the 10 15cm depth layer in the removal treatment withdrawn the highest correlation coefficients 0 87 and 0 91 were observed between ks and volumetric humidity in the 0 5cm depth layer in the removal and control treatments respectively table 1 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ was statistically similar in both treatments 18 99 10 20mmh 1 control and 20 38 9 20mmh 1 removal fig 7 however despite the high variability mean k θ was significantly higher in the removal treatment even though porosity and soil density were more favourable for water conduction in the control treatment fig 4 this may occur because unsaturated hydraulic conductivity increases when matrix potential becomes more negative and may therefore be caused by higher soil moisture however there was no significant correlation between the soil s physical attributes and k θ in the removal treatment in contrast in the control treatment there were strong positive correlations 0 86 and 0 98 respectively between k θ and volumetric moisture in the first two layers of the soil 0 5cm and 10 15cm soil density also had a positive correlation with k θ while total porosity was inversely correlated table 2 this supports observations that the mini disk infiltrator does not perform well in soils with high levels of superficial organic material underestimating the data marchini et al 2015 therefore the positive correlation between volumetric moisture and k θ and the absence of correlation between soil attributes and k θ in the control treatment may reflect limitations of the experimental equipment for soils with organic material rather than any changes in hydro physical processes 4 conclusions we can draw the following conclusions from the above study i there is clear seasonality in the production and accumulation of litter in the acuri palm forests of the brazilian pantanal biome ii the soil underneath naturally accumulated soil litter has greater porosity and retains more moisture than soil where the litter has been removed iii infiltration of water is significantly lower in soils with intact soil litter iv saturated hydraulic conductivity has great variability is strongly correlated with volumetric humidity and is higher in soil with intact litter v unsaturated hydraulic conductivity also has great variability positively correlates with the volumetric moisture and soil density but is not influenced by the presence or absence of soil litter conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards funding body none acknowledgements

1106,the aim of this study was to monitor the water quality of three rivers of the sinos river basin srb southern brazil five sites were selected to evaluate physicochemical and microbiological parameters and genotoxic and histopathological effects in the fish species astyanax jacuhiensis eight water samples were collected from march 2012 to may 2013 at sites located in the upper middle and lower sections of the srb after collection 35 water quality parameters were analyzed and fish were exposed to water samples under laboratory conditions five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 thermotolerant coliforms ammoniacal nitrogen dissolved oxygen aluminum iron and manganese values exceeded the permissible limits in some samples of the three sections and the cluster analysis showed three distinct groups composed by sites located in the same section of srb the micronuclei mn and other nuclear abnormalities na frequencies did not differ from the control group in any sample higher frequencies of lamellae with alterations such as hypertrophy and hyperplasia of epithelial cells epithelial lifting aneurysm edema and necrosis were observed in fish exposed to some water samples of the five sites the most frequent histopathological alteration was hypertrophy of epithelial cells therefore in this study the analysis of gill histopathological alterations showed higher sensitivity

important tributaries of sinos river moreover some regions of srb need to be systematically monitored with respect to water toxic effects therefore the present study aimed to monitor the water quality of five sites located in the three sections of the srb assessing water physicochemical and microbiological parameters as well as genotoxic and histopathological effects in the fish species a jacuhiensis 2 materials and methods five sampling sites were selected in the three sections of the srb and located using a global positioning system gps the sampling sites are identified by the name

january march and may 2013 approximately 10l of water were collected at each sampling site stored in plastic bottles and transported to the laboratory where the bioassays with fish were performed water samples from the five sites were collected on the same day of every sampling campaign additionally water samples were also collected and transported to the sanitation company of rio grande do

carried out the static procedure was performed for the fish exposure water samples were not replaced after exposure period animals were sacrificed by medullar section and blood samples were collected from the caudal vein the blood smears were performed and dried in room temperature fixed in absolute methanol for 10min and stained with 10 giemsa for 10min slides were then washed with distilled water dried in room temperature and stored for posterior analysis al sabti and metcalfe 1995 one slide per fish was prepared and 2 000 erythrocytes were examined using an olympus bx41 light microscope at 1000 magnification a blind analysis was performed and the occurrence of mn as well as other nuclear abnormalities na such as invaginations buds and binucleated cells was recorded according to carrasco et al 1990 after blood collection the first arch of gills from the left operculum was removed from each animal fixed in bouin solution for 24h washed and stored in 70 alcohol until samples processing samples were embedded in paraffin sectioned 5μm of thickness in a rotatory microtome leica and stained with hematoxilin and eosin garcia santos et al 2007 the analyses were conducted using an olympus bx41 light microscope at 400 magnification for the histopathological evaluation 8 10 fields per animal were analyzed each field containing one primary lamella with eight secondary lamellae the frequencies of seven types of lamellar alterations as well as the total frequency of lamellae with alterations were recorded moreover lamellar alterations were classified in three stages based on the degree of the possibility of the recovery from lesions poleksic and mitrovic tutundzic 1994 cerqueira and fernandes 2002 stage i changes that do not damage the gill tissue to such an extent that the normal gill structure cannot repair itself hypertrophy and hyperplasia of epithelial cells lamellar fusion and epithelial lifting stage ii changes that are more severe and affect the associated tissue function aneurysm and edema state iii changes that preclude the recovery of the gill structure necrosis water physicochemical and microbiological values were compared with limits established by the brazilian national environment council conama resolution 357 2005 for class 1 and 2 waters brasil 2005 in order to determine the dissimilarity among sites for physicochemical and microbiological parameters the cluster analysis was applied hierarchical agglomerative based on a matrix of dissimilarity squared euclidean distance according to kazi et al 2009 the mn and other na frequencies estimated by the mn test as well as histopathological alterations frequencies were analyzed using the kruskal wallis test followed by the dunn s multiple comparisons test differences were considered significant when p 0 05 all analyses were conducted using the software statistical package for social sciences spss version 22 3 results among 35 water quality parameters 10 were not detected in the samples phenols arsenic lead copper total chromium hexavalent chromium cadmium mercury nickel and selenium the parameters detected are presented in table 1 the limits of only 13 parameters are presented in the brazilian legislation and 7 parameters analyzed in the present study were above these limits in at least one sample bod5 thermotolerant coliforms ammoniacal nitrogen dissolved oxygen aluminum iron and manganese values of aluminum and iron were detected above the limits in all sites the highest means were found in campo bom and esteio lower section of the srb for manganese the mean values were below the limits nonetheless some samples from santo antônio da patrulha and esteio presented values above the limits values of ammoniacal nitrogen above the limits were detected in campo bom and esteio 3 0 and 5 0mg l respectively however mean values were within the limits between 0 5 and 3 7mg l mean values of bod5 were above the limits 5mg l in campo bom and esteio a value of 5 2mg l of bod5 was detected in parobé however mean values for this parameter were within the limits esteio presented means below the allowed limits for dissolved oxygen 5mg l and values of 4 0 and 2 9mg l were found in samples from santo antônio da patrulha and campo bom respectively mean values of thermotolerant coliforms exceeded the limits established by the brazilian legislation 1000mpn 100ml in sites located in the middle and lower sections the highest mean of thermotolerant coliforms was found in parobé considering the sites located in the upper section values of this parameter exceeded the limits in one sample from rolante whereas the values of all samples collected in santo antônio da patrulha were within the limits established by conama the cluster analysis applied to the mean values of the 25 parameters detected in eight sampling campaigns resulted in a dendrogram fig 2 which grouped all the five sampling sites into three clusters cluster 1 was composed by sites located in the upper section santo antônio da patrulha and rolante the second included sites located in the lower section campo bom and esteio whereas the site located in the middle section parobé composed the third cluster mn and other na buds invaginations and binucleated cells frequencies in 1000 erythrocytes of a jacuehiensis are showed in table 2 mn frequencies ranged from 0 to 0 4 whereas na frequencies ranged from 0 83 to 5 44 however no significant differences were found for both endpoints between the sites and the control group mean frequencies minimum and maximum values of lamellar alterations observed in the gills of a jacuhiensis are presented in table 3 fish from all sites collected in mar 12 and from esteio in may 12 were not analyzed the exposure to water samples induced an increase in the mean frequency of lamellae with alterations in the five sampling sites in comparison to the control group in some periods fig 3 the stage i alteration hypertrophy of epithelial cells was the most frequent alteration in all sites sampling sites presenting significant difference in comparison to the control group in each sampling period are shown in table 4 among the seven types of alterations analyzed no significant difference was observed for lamellar fusion considering stage i alteration higher frequencies of hyperplasia were found in one sample from santo antônio da patrulha and in two samples from campo bom higher frequencies of hypertrophy were observed in two samples from campo bom three samples from santo antônio da patrulha four samples from rolante five samples from parobé and in three samples from esteio higher frequencies of epithelial lifting were found in one sample from parobé considering stage ii alterations higher frequencies of edema were observed in two samples from campo bom and aneurysm in one sample from esteio and campo bom for stage iii alterations the frequency of necrosis was higher in comparison to the control group in samples from santo antônio da patrulha and rolante collected in may 2012 considering the frequency of lamellae with alteration mean values were significantly higher in comparison to the control group in 85 7 of samples 6 7 samples from rolante and parobé conversely esteio presented the lowest number of samples different from the control group only 33 3 2 6 samples 4 discussion according to reports from the state environmental protection agency fepam fundação estadual de proteção ambiental henrique luis roessler parameters with values above the limits established by the conama resolution 357 2005 result from a combination of factors related to pollutant loads and lack of control in the sources of pollution in the srb specific to each local fepam 2012 in this scenario high values of bod5 and thermotolerant coliforms were found in the lower section of the basin these parameters are associated to the low rates of domestic sewage treatment in the srb which is approximately of 5 contributing to the pollution of aquatic ecosystems in the present study high values of bod5 ammoniacal nitrogen and thermotolerant coliforms and low dissolved oxygen were found in at least one sampling site located in the three sections of the srb in general these parameters exceeded the limits of the brazilian legislation especially in sites located in the lower section of the basin indicating organic pollution mainly by domestic sewage discharges fepam 2012 values of thermotolerant coliforms indicative of domestic contamination were above the limits in the three sections of the basin corroborating data from other studies blume et al 2010 fepam 2012 scalon et al 2013 dalzochio et al 2018 and confirming the lack of basic sanitation as one of the main problems of the basin which leads to the poor water quality nonetheless this water resource is still used for public supply recreation and fishing these results confirm the need of urban planning in the region targeting sewage collection and treatment systems blume et al 2010 as established in regional and municipal plans of basic sanitation from municipalities belonging to the srb consórcio pró sinos 2015 and in accordance with the principles of the federal politics of basic sanitation law n 11 445 07 brasil 2007 one important aspect to the maintenance of aquatic life is the proper concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water the minimum value established by the conama resolution is 5 0mg l however despite the variation in the tolerance among different species values below 2 0mg l can lead to hypoxia and death fepam 2012 thus the low values of dissolved oxygen found in esteio and some samples from campo bom both located in the lower section are of concern scalon et al 2013 have also reported low concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the lower section of the srb indicating anoxia conditions for more sensitive species although the water quality tends to decrease in the lower section of the basin santo antônio da patrulha upper section also presented one sample with values of dissolved oxygen below the limits suggesting the water quality from the upper section may also pose a risk to the aquatic biota aluminum and iron concentrations exceeded the limits in the three sections however manganese exceeded the limits only in santo antônio da patrulha and esteio scalon et al 2010 2013 have attributed the presence of these metals to metallurgical industries and domestic wastes additionally surface runoff of agricultural practices could contribute to high levels of these metals in the sites studied conversely vargas et al 2001 have concluded which both water and sediment of the srb naturally contain iron manganese and copper in relation to aluminum exposure duarte 2012 has carried out a monitoring study on the water quality of the jacuném lagoon espírito santo brazil exposing the fish species oreochromis niloticus for 72h to water samples the authors attributed the high frequencies of mn observed to aluminum and cadmium maximum values of 0 3 and 0 002mg l respectively nonetheless in the present study similar or higher concentrations of aluminum were found but no mutagenic effect was observed in a jacuhiensis possibly due to differences of sensitivity between species dalzochio et al 2016b investigated the effects of acute exposure of fish of the species a jacuhiensis at different concentrations of al for 72h 0 3 and 30mg l and no mutagenic effect was observed likewise dalzochio et al 2018 collected water at three sampling sites located in the middle section of srb and detected total phosphorus thermotolerant coliforms aluminum iron and lead above brazilian legislation however the general mean of the mn and na frequencies was low data from the present study are in accordance with findings from blume et al 2010 and scalon et al 2010 2013 the authors have reported the water contamination in the srb initiates in the upper section in caraá municipality near the source of the sinos river and gradually increases until parabé novo hamburgo and sapucaia do sul municipalities steffens et al 2015 and zimmermann et al 2016 have also observed a decline of water quality in the middle and lower sections due to high loads of domestic and industrial effluents the cluster analysis resulted in three groups which presented differences in water quality influenced by different factors in each section of the basin sites located in the upper section santo antônio da patrulha and rolante were grouped in cluster 1 possibly due to similar characteristics as low population density and industry presence of riparian vegetation and wetlands fepam 2012 sites located in the lower section of the basin campo bom and esteio were grouped in cluster 2 these sites present a poor water quality as a consequence of water influx from polluted streams high concentration of industries and high population density blume et al 2010 nunes et al 2011 scalon et al 2013 cluster 3 was composed by parobé middle section where an intermediate water quality is found due to the presence of medium sized industries and higher population density in comparison to the upper section the cluster analysis implies in a rapid assessment of water quality where only one site in each section of the basin may be representative of the contamination index of the whole section similarly kazi et al 2009 have assumed the grouping analysis offers a reliable classification of surface water quality the mean mn frequencies observed in different fish species from clean areas ranged from 0 to 1 in 1000 erythrocytes bolognesi and hayashi 2011 the native fish species a jacuhiensis is widely distributed in aquatic environments in southern brazil and tolerates water physicochemical parameters oscillations bemvenuti and moresco 2005 thus this specie has been used as bioindicator to assess water genotoxicity lemos et al 2008 have proposed a mean of 0 20 0 33 as baseline values for the species a jacuhiensis in the present study mn frequencies found in the animals exposed to water samples are in accordance with this range and did not differ from the control group this suggests the contaminants present in the sampling sites induced no mn formation above the basal frequency of this species and under the study conditions likewise grisolia and starling 2001 have also reported no significant difference in mn frequencies in fish captured in an area under the influence of two sewage treatment plants and compared to a less impacted area in the paranoá lake distrito federal brazil some aspects should be considered in future genotoxicity studies using fish under laboratory conditions in the srb such as the influence of water samples dilution tissue analyzed and fish species moreover the present study reports data of a long term monitoring eight sampling campaigns using the mn test in fish whereas previous studies have conducted four or less samplings in the basin scalon et al 2010 2013 have found genotoxic effect in the three sections of the basin using the comet assay in hyphessobrycon luetkenii possibly because of the higher sensitivity of the comet assay in comparison to the mn test gill histopathological evaluation has been used successfully to monitor the quality of aquatic environments stentiford et al 2003 fernandes et al 2007 santos et al 2019 or to determine under laboratory conditions the toxicity of heavy metals garcia santos et al 2007 santos 2012 diesel oil hesni et al 2011 and organochlorine pesticides moitra et al 2012 in the present study a significant higher frequency of histopathological alterations in gills of a jacuhiensis exposed to water samples from five sites of the srb was found and the most frequent alteration observed at all sites was epithelial cell hypertrophy considered stage i lesions the experimental conditions of the present study were used in a previous study dalzochio et al 2016b and similar results were observed in which the control group showed lower frequency of histological alterations in the fish gills than the treatments tested in static tests in which test solutions remain unchanged throughout the duration of the test changes in the fish gills might occur due to contaminants from the river water as well as metabolic fish waste e g ammonia in this context the control group was used as a baseline to assess the effect of exposure to the river water and according to bernet et al 2004 is important to realize that a healthy control condition is not characterized by the complete absence of any histopathological traits dalzochio et al 2018 also observed histological alterations in the gills of b iheringii collected at srb the alterations of hypertrophy and hyperplasia of epithelial cells were the most frequent observed the alterations hyperplasia and hypertrophy of epithelial cells epithelial lifting and lamellar fusion are classified as stages i and ii are repairable with water quality improvement but they may progress to stage iii if the level of contamination is maintained or increased stages i and ii are considered as defense mechanisms that help to prevent the uptake of contaminants from water mallatt 1985 poleksic and mitrovic tutundzic 1994 cerqueira and fernandes 2002 nimet et al 2018 the heavy metals pesticides and untreated domestic sewage exposure may stress fish and induce compensatory responses and gill alterations mallatt 1985 alberto et al 2005 albinati et al 2009 camargo et al 2009 dalzochio et al 2016b necrosis rarely found in this study is classified as a stage iii lesion non repairable in case the water quality improves cerqueira and fernandes 2002 and therefore its occurrence indicates exposure to highly toxic agents takashima and hibiya 1995 the frequency of necrosis differed from the control group in animals exposed to water samples collected in santo antônio da patrulha and rolante in may 2012 according to the cluster analysis these sites were grouped in the same cluster as a result of similarities in the parameters analyzed which pointed to a better water quality in comparison to sites located in other sections of the basin nonetheless the histopathological evaluation revealed these sites are occasionally contaminated by substances capable of inducing severe and non repairable lesions from agricultural practices present in the upper section of the sinos river evidencing the importance of analyzing multibiomarkers in fish for assessing aquatic ecosystems the alterations observed in the present study seemed to occur as a consequence of general defense response against several irritant agents instead of against one specific pollutant mallatt 1985 5 conclusion in the present study the mn and nuclear abnormalities analysis evidenced no mutagenic effect however the gill histopathological analysis was more sensitive to investigate toxic effects of pollutants in comparison to the mn test the cluster analysis of water quality parameters enabled to design a better sampling strategy which could reduce costs and the number of samplings per section of the srb the integrated approach using different biomarkers may help in the comprehension of toxicological effects of environmental samples considered as a mixture of pollutants although it is difficult to identify the causing agent of alteration in aquatic biota

state southern brazil presenting an area of approximately 3800km2 including 32 municipalities and one of the most important industrial centers of the country fepam 2012 the sinos river is the main river of the basin and is the fourth most polluted river in brazil national water agency 2013 nonetheless the river supplies water for approximately 1 6 million inhabitants ibge 2010 for hydrological classifications the srb is divided in upper section characterized by low population density rice cultivation small properties of animal breeding and fruticulture middle section where a higher population density and the existence of industries are observed and lower section characterized by a high population density and industrial concentration mainly leather and footwear metallurgical and petrochemical fepam 2012 in general water quality of sinos river decreases in a downstream direction blume et al 2010 scalon et al 2013 previous studies on the srb have reported the relation of toxic effects in different organisms with the presence of contaminants from domestic agricultural and industrial activities vargas et al 2001 lemos et al 2009 rechenmacher et al 2010 scalon et al 2010 2013 nunes et al 2011 oliveira et al 2012 bianchi et al 2015 bianchi et al 2017 dalzochio et al 2018 however there are still sites little investigated in the srb such as areia river and paranhana river two important tributaries of sinos river moreover some regions of srb need to be systematically monitored with respect to water toxic effects therefore the present study aimed to monitor the water quality of five sites located in the three sections of the srb assessing water physicochemical and microbiological parameters as well as genotoxic and histopathological effects in the fish species a jacuhiensis 2 materials and methods five sampling sites were selected in the three sections of the srb and located using a global positioning system gps the sampling sites are identified by the name of the municipality where they are located and are shown in fig 1 upper section santo antônio da patrulha 29 48 59 08 s 50 30 49 97 w located in the sinos river and rolante 29 39 3 27 s 50 30 49 97 w

w located in the sinos river sampling sites are located where the water is collected to public supply eight sampling campaigns were conducted in march may july september and october 2012 and in january march and may 2013 approximately 10l of water were collected at each sampling site stored in plastic bottles and transported to the laboratory where the bioassays with fish were performed water samples from the five sites were collected on the same day of every sampling campaign additionally water samples were also collected and transported to the sanitation company of rio grande do

preservation transportation and analysis of samples were conducted according to the recommendations of the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater apha 2005 specimens of a jacuhiensis measuring 3 4cm in length were obtained from a local fish farm they were then acclimated in glass aquaria containing dechlorinated water under constant aeration and controlled temperature 22 c 2 c after at least 48h of acclimation 10 animals were distributed in two glass aquaria each containing 5 animals and exposed to a volume of 5l of water collected at different sites for 72h under constant aeration and controlled temperature duarte 2012 goldoni and da silva 2012 a control group was maintained in dechlorinated tap water under the same experimental conditions physicochemical parameters of

carried out the static procedure was performed for the fish exposure water samples were not replaced after exposure period animals were sacrificed by medullar section and blood samples were collected from the caudal vein the blood smears were performed and dried in room temperature fixed in absolute methanol for 10min and stained with 10 giemsa for 10min slides were then washed with distilled water dried in room temperature and stored for posterior analysis al sabti and metcalfe 1995 one slide per fish was prepared and 2 000 erythrocytes were examined using an olympus bx41 light microscope at 1000 magnification a blind analysis was performed and the occurrence of mn as well as other nuclear abnormalities na such as invaginations buds and binucleated cells was recorded according to carrasco et al 1990 after blood collection the first arch of gills from the left operculum was removed from each animal fixed in bouin solution for 24h washed and stored in 70 alcohol until samples processing samples were embedded in paraffin sectioned 5μm of thickness in a rotatory microtome leica and stained with hematoxilin and eosin garcia santos et al 2007 the analyses were conducted using an olympus bx41 light microscope at 400 magnification for the histopathological evaluation 8 10 fields per animal were analyzed each field containing one primary lamella with eight secondary lamellae the frequencies of seven types of lamellar alterations as well as the total frequency of lamellae with alterations were recorded moreover lamellar alterations were classified in three stages based on the degree of the possibility of the recovery from lesions poleksic and mitrovic tutundzic 1994 cerqueira and fernandes 2002 stage i changes that do not damage the gill tissue to such an extent that the normal gill structure cannot repair itself hypertrophy and hyperplasia of epithelial cells lamellar fusion and epithelial lifting stage ii changes that are more severe and affect the associated tissue function aneurysm and edema state iii changes that preclude the recovery of the gill structure necrosis water physicochemical and microbiological values were compared with limits established by the brazilian national environment council conama resolution 357 2005 for class 1 and 2 waters brasil 2005 in order to determine the dissimilarity among sites for physicochemical and microbiological parameters the cluster analysis was applied hierarchical agglomerative based on a matrix of dissimilarity squared euclidean distance according to kazi et al 2009 the mn and other na frequencies estimated by the mn test as well as histopathological alterations frequencies were analyzed using the kruskal wallis test followed by the dunn s multiple comparisons test differences were considered significant when p 0 05 all analyses were conducted using the software statistical package for social sciences spss version 22 3 results among 35 water quality parameters 10 were not detected in the samples phenols arsenic lead copper total chromium hexavalent chromium cadmium mercury nickel and selenium the parameters detected are presented in table 1 the limits of only 13 parameters are presented in the brazilian legislation and 7 parameters analyzed in the present study were above these limits in at least one sample bod5 thermotolerant coliforms ammoniacal nitrogen dissolved oxygen aluminum iron and manganese values of aluminum and iron were detected above the limits in all sites the highest means were found in campo bom and esteio lower section of the srb for manganese the mean values were below the limits nonetheless some samples from santo antônio da patrulha and esteio presented values above the limits values of ammoniacal nitrogen above the limits were detected in campo bom and esteio 3 0 and 5 0mg l respectively however mean values were within the limits between 0 5 and 3 7mg l mean values of bod5 were above the limits 5mg l in campo bom and esteio a value of 5 2mg l of bod5 was detected in parobé however mean values for this parameter were within the limits esteio presented means below the allowed limits for dissolved oxygen 5mg l and values of 4 0 and 2 9mg l were found in samples from santo antônio da patrulha and campo bom respectively mean values of thermotolerant coliforms exceeded the limits established by the brazilian legislation 1000mpn 100ml in sites located in the middle and lower sections the highest mean of thermotolerant coliforms was found in parobé considering the sites located in the upper section values of this parameter exceeded the limits in one sample from rolante whereas the values of all samples collected in santo antônio da patrulha were within the limits established by conama the cluster analysis applied to the mean values of the 25 parameters detected in eight sampling campaigns resulted in a dendrogram fig 2 which grouped all the five sampling sites into three clusters cluster 1 was composed by sites located in the upper section santo antônio da patrulha and rolante the second included sites located in the lower section campo bom and esteio whereas the site located in the middle section parobé composed the third cluster mn and other na buds invaginations and binucleated cells frequencies in 1000 erythrocytes of a jacuehiensis are showed in table 2 mn frequencies ranged from 0 to 0 4 whereas na frequencies ranged from 0 83 to 5 44 however no significant differences were found for both endpoints between the sites and the control group mean frequencies minimum and maximum values of lamellar alterations observed in the gills of a jacuhiensis are presented in table 3 fish from all sites collected in mar 12 and from esteio in may 12 were not analyzed the exposure to water samples induced an increase in the mean frequency of lamellae with alterations in the five sampling sites in comparison to the control group in some periods fig 3 the stage i alteration hypertrophy of epithelial cells was the most frequent alteration in all sites sampling sites presenting significant difference in comparison to the control group in each sampling period are shown in table 4 among the seven types of alterations analyzed no significant difference was observed for lamellar fusion considering stage i alteration higher frequencies of hyperplasia were found in one sample from santo antônio da patrulha and in two samples from campo bom higher frequencies of hypertrophy were observed in two samples from campo bom three samples from santo antônio da patrulha four samples from rolante five samples from parobé and in three samples from esteio higher frequencies of epithelial lifting were found in one sample from parobé considering stage ii alterations higher frequencies of edema were observed in two samples from campo bom and aneurysm in one sample from esteio and campo bom for stage iii alterations the frequency of necrosis was higher in comparison to the control group in samples from santo antônio da patrulha and rolante collected in may 2012 considering the frequency of lamellae with alteration mean values were significantly higher in comparison to the control group in 85 7 of samples 6 7 samples from rolante and parobé conversely esteio presented the lowest number of samples different from the control group only 33 3 2 6 samples 4 discussion according to reports from the state environmental protection agency fepam fundação estadual de proteção ambiental henrique luis roessler parameters with values above the limits established by the conama resolution 357 2005 result from a combination of factors related to pollutant loads and lack of control in the sources of pollution in the srb specific to each local fepam 2012 in this scenario high values of bod5 and thermotolerant coliforms were found in the lower section of the basin these parameters are associated to the low rates of domestic sewage treatment in the srb which is approximately of 5 contributing to the pollution of aquatic ecosystems in the present study high values of bod5 ammoniacal nitrogen and thermotolerant coliforms and low dissolved oxygen were found in at least one sampling site located in the three sections of the srb in general these parameters exceeded the limits of the brazilian legislation especially in sites located in the lower section of the basin indicating organic pollution mainly by domestic sewage discharges fepam 2012 values of thermotolerant coliforms indicative of domestic contamination were above the limits in the three sections of the basin corroborating data from other studies blume et al 2010 fepam 2012 scalon et al 2013 dalzochio et al 2018 and confirming the lack of basic sanitation as one of the main problems of the basin which leads to the poor water quality nonetheless this water resource is still used for public supply recreation and fishing these results confirm the need of urban planning in the region targeting sewage collection and treatment systems blume et al 2010 as established in regional and municipal plans of basic sanitation from municipalities belonging to the srb consórcio pró sinos 2015 and in accordance with the principles of the federal politics of basic sanitation law n 11 445 07 brasil 2007 one important aspect to the maintenance of aquatic life is the proper concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water the minimum value established by the conama resolution is 5 0mg l however despite the variation in the tolerance among different species values below 2 0mg l can lead to hypoxia and death fepam 2012 thus the low values of dissolved oxygen found in esteio and some samples from campo bom both located in the lower section are of concern scalon et al 2013 have also reported low concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the lower section of the srb indicating anoxia conditions for more sensitive species although the water quality tends to decrease in the lower section of the basin santo antônio da patrulha upper section also presented one sample with values of dissolved oxygen below the limits suggesting the water quality from the upper section may also pose a risk to the aquatic biota aluminum and iron concentrations exceeded the limits in the three sections however manganese exceeded the limits only in santo antônio da patrulha and esteio scalon et al 2010 2013 have attributed the presence of these metals to metallurgical industries and domestic wastes additionally surface runoff of agricultural practices could contribute to high levels of these metals in the sites studied conversely vargas et al 2001 have concluded which both water and sediment of the srb naturally contain iron manganese and copper in relation to aluminum exposure duarte 2012 has carried out a monitoring study on the water quality of the jacuném lagoon espírito santo brazil exposing the fish species oreochromis niloticus for 72h to water samples the authors attributed the high frequencies of mn observed to aluminum and cadmium maximum values of 0 3 and 0 002mg l respectively nonetheless in the present study similar or higher concentrations of aluminum were found but no mutagenic effect was observed in a jacuhiensis possibly due to differences of sensitivity between species dalzochio et al 2016b investigated the effects of acute exposure of fish of the species a jacuhiensis at different concentrations of al for 72h 0 3 and 30mg l and no mutagenic effect was observed likewise dalzochio et al 2018 collected water at three sampling sites located in the middle section of srb and detected total phosphorus thermotolerant coliforms aluminum iron and lead above brazilian legislation however the general mean of the mn and na frequencies was low data from the present study are in accordance with findings from blume et al 2010 and scalon et al 2010 2013 the authors have reported the water contamination in the srb initiates in the upper section in caraá municipality near the source of the sinos river and gradually increases until parabé novo hamburgo and sapucaia do sul municipalities steffens et al 2015 and zimmermann et al 2016 have also observed a decline of water quality in the middle and lower sections due to high loads of domestic and industrial effluents the cluster analysis resulted in three groups which presented differences in water quality influenced by different factors in each section of the basin sites located in the upper section santo antônio da patrulha and rolante were grouped in cluster 1 possibly due to similar characteristics as low population density and industry presence of riparian vegetation and wetlands fepam 2012 sites located in the lower section of the basin campo bom and esteio were grouped in cluster 2 these sites present a poor water quality as a consequence of water influx from polluted streams high concentration of industries and high population density blume et al 2010 nunes et al 2011 scalon et al 2013 cluster 3 was composed by parobé middle section where an intermediate water quality is found due to the presence of medium sized industries and higher population density in comparison to the upper section the cluster analysis implies in a rapid assessment of water quality where only one site in each section of the basin may be representative of the contamination index of the whole section similarly kazi et al 2009 have assumed the grouping analysis offers a reliable classification of surface water quality the mean mn frequencies observed in different fish species from clean areas ranged from 0 to 1 in 1000 erythrocytes bolognesi and hayashi 2011 the native fish species a jacuhiensis is widely distributed in aquatic environments in southern brazil and tolerates water physicochemical parameters oscillations bemvenuti and moresco 2005 thus this specie has been used as bioindicator to assess water genotoxicity lemos et al 2008 have proposed a mean of 0 20 0 33 as baseline values for the species a jacuhiensis in the present study mn frequencies found in the animals exposed to water samples are in accordance with this range and did not differ from the control group this suggests the contaminants present in the sampling sites induced no mn formation above the basal frequency of this species and under the study conditions likewise grisolia and starling 2001 have also reported no significant difference in mn frequencies in fish captured in an area under the influence of two sewage treatment plants and compared to a less impacted area in the paranoá lake distrito federal brazil some aspects should be considered in future genotoxicity studies using fish under laboratory conditions in the srb such as the influence of water samples dilution tissue analyzed and fish species moreover the present study reports data of a long term monitoring eight sampling campaigns using the mn test in fish whereas previous studies have conducted four or less samplings in the basin scalon et al 2010 2013 have found genotoxic effect in the three sections of the basin using the comet assay in hyphessobrycon luetkenii possibly because of the higher sensitivity of the comet assay in comparison to the mn test gill histopathological evaluation has been used successfully to monitor the quality of aquatic environments stentiford et al 2003 fernandes et al 2007 santos et al 2019 or to determine under laboratory conditions the toxicity of heavy metals garcia santos et al 2007 santos 2012 diesel oil hesni et al 2011 and organochlorine pesticides moitra et al 2012 in the present study a significant higher frequency of histopathological alterations in gills of a jacuhiensis exposed to water samples from five sites of the srb was found and the most frequent alteration observed at all sites was epithelial cell hypertrophy considered stage i lesions the experimental conditions of the present study were used in a previous study dalzochio et al 2016b and similar results were observed in which the control group showed lower frequency of histological alterations in the fish gills than the treatments tested in static tests in which test solutions remain unchanged throughout the duration of the test changes in the fish gills might occur due to contaminants from the river water as well as metabolic fish waste e g ammonia in this context the control group was used as a baseline to assess the effect of exposure to the river water and according to bernet et al 2004 is important to realize that a healthy control condition is not characterized by the complete absence of any histopathological traits dalzochio et al 2018 also observed histological alterations in the gills of b iheringii collected at srb the alterations of hypertrophy and hyperplasia of epithelial cells were the most frequent observed the alterations hyperplasia and hypertrophy of epithelial cells epithelial lifting and lamellar fusion are classified as stages i and ii are repairable with water quality improvement but they may progress to stage iii if the level of contamination is maintained or increased stages i and ii are considered as defense mechanisms that help to prevent the uptake of contaminants from water mallatt 1985 poleksic and mitrovic tutundzic 1994 cerqueira and fernandes 2002 nimet et al 2018 the heavy metals pesticides and untreated domestic sewage exposure may stress fish and induce compensatory responses and gill alterations mallatt 1985 alberto et al 2005 albinati et al 2009 camargo et al 2009 dalzochio et al 2016b necrosis rarely found in this study is classified as a stage iii lesion non repairable in case the water quality improves cerqueira and fernandes 2002 and therefore its occurrence indicates exposure to highly toxic agents takashima and hibiya 1995 the frequency of necrosis differed from the control group in animals exposed to water samples collected in santo antônio da patrulha and rolante in may 2012 according to the cluster analysis these sites were grouped in the same cluster as a result of similarities in the parameters analyzed which pointed to a better water quality in comparison to sites located in other sections of the basin nonetheless the histopathological evaluation revealed these sites are occasionally contaminated by substances capable of inducing severe and non repairable lesions from agricultural practices present in the upper section of the sinos river evidencing the importance of analyzing multibiomarkers in fish for assessing aquatic ecosystems the alterations observed in the present study seemed to occur as a consequence of general defense response against several irritant agents instead of against one specific pollutant mallatt 1985 5 conclusion in the present study the mn and nuclear abnormalities analysis evidenced no mutagenic effect however the gill histopathological analysis was more sensitive to investigate toxic effects of pollutants in comparison to the mn test the cluster analysis of water quality parameters enabled to design a better sampling strategy which could reduce costs and the number of samplings per section of the srb the integrated approach using different biomarkers may help in the comprehension of toxicological effects of environmental samples considered as a mixture of pollutants although it is difficult to identify the causing agent of alteration in aquatic biota

1107,the influences of habitat structure and hydraulics on tropical macroinvertebrate communities were investigated in two foothill rivers of the udzungwa mountains united republic of tanzania to assist future environmental flow assessments efas macroinvertebrate samples hydraulic variables and habitat structure were collected at the microhabitat scale n 90 macroinvertebrate communities were first delineated i e clustered through poisson and negative binomial mixture models for count data in a semi supervised mode by taking into account the sampled river then genetically optimised multi layer perceptrons mlps were used to identify the relationship of the most relevant variables with the delineated communities between the three delineated communities exclusively one community was shared between both rivers the first and third communities presented similar values of richness i e number of families and diversity but the first was characterised by high abundance and was dominated by baetidae 43 2 while hydropsychidae 36 3 dominated the third community the second community was dominated by baetidae 33 4 but it involved low abundance richness and diversity samples and encompassed the microhabitats where no macroinvertebrates were found the performance of the mlp acknowledged the quality of the delineation and it indicated that the first community shows a clear affinity for microhabitats with aquatic vegetation and woody debris and the third for unshaded fast flowing and shallow microhabitats on intermediate sized substrate conversely the second community occurred in deep and shaded microhabitats with low flow velocity and coarse substrate we demonstrated that habitat structure and hydraulics are able to properly discriminate the macroinvertebrate communities which in turn underlines their importance as drivers of community composition and abundance aquatic vegetation woody debris velocity and substrate index followed by depth and shade emerged as the most discriminant variables to understand macroinvertebrate communities in these tropical running waters these results should enhance the implementation of ongoing and future efa studies keywords africa artificial neural network community ecology count data environmental flow assessment semi supervised clustering 1 introduction the recognition of deleterious human activities on freshwater ecosystems is well recognised zalewski 2008 for instance the construction of infrastructure to guarantee water supply for humans has led to anthropogenic effects through flow alteration and regulation kundzewicz 2007 these negative impacts spreading rapidly in developing tropical and sub tropical countries where the urgent need to use water for economic development overrides the implementation of initiatives promoting environmental protection msuya and lalika 2017 environmental protection can be accomplished through specific actions on living organisms and habitat conservation concerning riverine habitats the core importance of habitat structure and hydraulics are well recognised clifford et al 2006 and references therein and hydrology has been considered as a key variable affecting the dynamics and distribution patterns of freshwater species populations see e g schiemer 2016 in this context environmental flow assessment efa has emerged as a fundamental tool to determine the quantities quality and patterns of water flows i e environmental flows or e flows to balance the protection of the natural environment with out of stream uses mcclain et al 2013 between the different approaches to efa the scientific community currently advocates holistic approaches which consider the different components e g riparian vegetation macroinvertebrate communities and fish assemblages and processes e g matter fluxes of riverine and riparian ecosystems and account also for human needs among these components benthic macroinvertebrates are considered as one of the most relevant taxa to assess the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems e g park et al 2003 macroinvertebrates are ubiquitous largely dependent on the aquatic environment and are especially sensitive to flow and stream temperature changes white et al 2017 and references therein therefore understanding how communities can change with respect to environmental variables i e flow and eco hydraulic relationships is a fundamental basis for ecosystem management and efa belmar et al 2013 in this regard clustering techniques can be useful to delineate communities to serve as targets to develop the necessary eco hydraulic relationships adriaenssens et al 2007 in accordance these relationships have been typically addressed following two step approaches first communities are delineated i e clustered and then relationships are inferred park et al 2003 unfortunately the former task is not easy because over dispersion and nonlinear complex interactions occur in datasets consisting of many species and sampling areas adriaenssens et al 2007 park et al 2003 the aforementioned interactions and nonlinearity triggered the popularity of several sophisticated statistical and machine learning approaches for instance a common technique employed to delineate macroinvertebrate communities is self organizing maps soms kohonen 1982 which is a kind of artificial neural network adriaenssens et al 2007 park et al 2003 song et al 2006 however soms and many other technics require data standardisation because they are sensitive to data over dispersion e g song et al 2006 adriaenssens et al 2007 which may ultimately determine the taxa included within each delineated community thorne et al 1999 in this regard novel clustering approaches particularly designed to handle count data and over dispersion such as poisson or negative binomial mixture models si et al 2014 should be particularly well suited to delineate macroinvertebrates communities despite the aforementioned advances in the analysis of macroinvertebrate communities studies in tropical rivers especially on african streams and rivers have followed more traditional approaches such as non metric multi dimensional scaling e g baker et al 2016 dallas 2004 niba and mafereka 2015 or several variants related to correspondence and redundancy analysis e g kasangaki et al 2006 chakona et al 2009 additionally the majority of these studies characterising several macroinvertebrate environment relationships have mainly focused on water quality e g chakona et al 2009 shimba and jonah 2016 and land use changes i e natural forested vs altered agricultural e g kasangaki et al 2008 chakona et al 2009 whereas hydrologic and hydraulic variables have been used less often and exclusively in combination with other environmental predictors e g kasangaki et al 2006 watson and dallas 2013 small scale differences in hydraulic conditions characterised by water velocity depth and substrate roughness are useful to predict the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages brooks et al 2005 in accordance eco hydraulic relationships based on macroinvertebrate communities collected at small spatial scales can be fundamental for efa song et al 2006 regrettably the majority of studies that differentiated spatial scales have focused on comparing reach scale and basin scale features e g minaya et al 2013 thus specific studies focusing on these small spatial scales have not been addressed in most territories although some have incidentally found relevant differences at sub reach scales mathooko 2001 niba and mafereka 2015 highlighting the importance of the patch scale to detect macroinvertebrate variation boyero and bosch 2004 that said we still lack a comprehensive understanding of methods to study efas and animal communities at small i e microhabitat scales in order to improve our knowledge and provide guidelines for adequate efas this study investigated the role of habitat structure and hydraulics at the microhabitat scale on tropical macroinvertebrate communities in two tributaries of the kilombero river located in the foothills of the udzungwa mountains united republic of tanzania to achieve this aim i the communities were delineated i e clustered by means of poisson and negative binomial mixture models in a semi supervised mode by taking into account the sampled river and ii the most relevant variables and the relationship of these variables with the delineated communities were sought with genetically optimised artificial neural networks finally the community preferences and the implications for efa were discussed for application in further studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kilombero river basin is characterised by a sub humid tropical climate with relative humidity ranging from 70 to 80 with an annual rainfall of about 1200 to 1400 mm and two rainy seasons a long rainy season from march to may and a shorter one between october and december mombo et al 2011 temperatures normally vary from 20 to 30 c mombo et al 2011 human related activities such as overgrazing by livestock agriculture and human settlement are threatening the kilombero basin elisa et al 2010 the data were collected to evaluate lower flows i e after water abstraction in accordance the survey was undertaken during one week in the end of january 2015 i e short dry season preceding the long rainy season during that and the preceding weeks no higher flows occurred the sampled rivers were the udagaji and mgugwe which are two small unregulated rivers that flow southwards from the udzungwa mountains national park fig 1 the udagaji catchment is densely forested whereas the mgugwe catchment is covered by forest and shrubs in similar proportions although the udagaji river has been identified as possible water source for a large irrigation scheme in the kilombero valley see o keeffe et al 2017 the basin area of the mgugwe river is larger 213 vs 25 km2 in accordance the mean annual flow of the mgugwe river corresponds to 2 83 m3 s 1957 1991 whereas that of the udagaji river corresponds to 0 81 m3 s 1957 1991 the maximum and minimum elevation of both sampled rivers did not differ significantly 300 325 and 1637 1802 m a s l respectively but the mean slope of the udagaji river is more pronounced 20 2 vs 16 3 in the mgugwe river causing a flashier flow regime 2 2 data collection macroinvertebrate samples were collected at the microhabitat scale a subset of a mesohabitat e g pool or riffle defining the

cycle sensu bovee et al 1998 using the kicking method with a wildco 500 μm kick net yulee fl usa the surveyors quietly moved zigzagging from downstream to upstream sampling systematically the different microhabitats from shore to shore the distance between microhabitats ranged between 10 and 15 m in accordance with the developing plans the microhabitat preference models were originally intended to evaluate different management scenarios for the udagaji river therefore the total number of microhabitat replicates sampled n 90 in the udagaji river outnumbered those in the mgugwe river n udagaji 69 and n mgugwe 21 in each replicate three sub replicates were sampled kicking the substrate for periods of 60 s for each replicate madikizela and dye 2003 after collection samples were preserved using 70 ethanol and later in the laboratory benthic invertebrates were sorted and identified to the family level no macroinvertebrates were found in 20 microhabitat replicates 13 in the udagaji river and 7 in the mgugwe river the macroinvertebrate community of each microhabitat replicate thereafter microhabitat was characterised based on abundance richness and diversity macroinvertebrate abundance was calculated as the total number of individuals per microhabitat i e summing the number of individuals collected in the three replicates in addition rarefaction was used to estimate sample richness i e number of families present per microhabitat and the shannon weiner and simpson diversity indices which were calculated using the r r core team 2017 package inext hsieh et al 2016 these parameters were used to characterise the delineated i e clustered communities concomitantly to the macroinvertebrate sampling three hydraulic variables depth mean flow velocity and substrate composition and four factors characterising the structure of the microhabitat i e presence and abundance of reeds aquatic vegetation log jams and small woody debris and shade were measured and scored at three points where each replicate was collected later these values were averaged to define the environmental conditions of each microhabitat depth m was measured with a wading rod to the nearest cm and the mean flow velocity of the water column hereafter velocity m s was measured with a propeller current meter ott at 40 of the measured depth the percentage of each substrate class was visually estimated around the sampling point following a simplification of the american geophysical union size scale namely silt ø 62 µm sand 62 µm ø 2 mm fine gravel 2 ø 8 mm gravel 8 ø 64 mm cobbles 64 ø 256 mm boulders ø 256 mm and bedrock muñoz mas et al 2012 later these percentages were aggregated into a single value through the dimensionless substrate index mouton et al 2011 this index is calculated by summing the weighted percentages of each substrate class as follows s u b s t r a t e i n d e x 0 03 s a n d 0 04 f i n e g r a v e l 0 05 g r a v e l 0 06 c o b b l e 0 07 b o u l d e r 0 08 b e d r o c k finally the four factors characterising the structure of the microhabitat were scored as absent scarce normal or abundant i e from 0 to 3 muñoz mas et al 2016b the microhabitats sampled in the mgugwe river were deeper and coarser fig 2 in addition aquatic vegetation was only present in the mgugwe river the force directed graph fruchterman and reingold 1991 based on the correlation obtained with the r package polycor fox 2010 which is specially designed to handle continuous and categorical data indicated that the hydraulic variables i e depth velocity and substrate index were significantly related fig 3 velocity was positively correlated with substrate which was negatively correlated with depth the factors characterising the structure of the microhabitats were not related and neither were with the hydraulic variables although aquatic vegetation was slightly and positively correlated to velocity 2 3 macroinvertebrate community delineation data clustering the macroinvertebrate communities present in the foothill rivers of the udzungwa mountains were delineated based on the abundance of each family i e number of individuals per family following the process described in the r package optcluster sekula et al 2017 this package allows finding the optimal clustering algorithm along with the optimal number of clusters i e communities in accordance a number of different approaches with the potential number of communities i e number of clusters are tested and for each combination up to nine validity indices are calculated there is not a single validity index that outperforms in every situation arbelaitz et al 2013 therefore the different combinations are subsequently ranked on the basis of the selected validity indices to obtain the optimal clustering approach and number of clusters sekula et al 2017 the model based family of algorithms designed to count data and over dispersion i e poisson and negative binomial mixture models were tested to delineate between 2 and 9 macroinvertebrate communities standard model based clustering algorithms assume that data are generated by a mixture of normal i e gaussian probability distributions where each component corresponds to one cluster si et al 2014 however the macroinvertebrate counts typically involve large numerical differences i e over dispersion which compelled scientists to recommend data transformation before clustering e g adriaenssens et al 2007 to avoid this step the tested clustering algorithms originally included within the r package mbcluster seq si 2012 employ mixtures of poisson or negative binomial distributions si et al 2014 the package mbcluster seq includes six different variants three poisson and three negative binomial alternatives differing exclusively in the training algorithm used to determine the internal parameters the first pair is trained with the expectation maximization em algorithm dempster et al 1977 which is the most popular method for approximating maximum likelihood estimate si 2012 however a well known problem associated with em is that it can be trapped at local maxima and consequently fails to reach global maxima si 2012 to overcome this limitation the package mbcluster seq includes two alternative algorithms the simulated annealing sa celeux and govaert 1992 and deterministic annealing da rose 1998 although previous studies indicated that differences among environmental conditions e g different depth substrate composition or water quality are the real drivers of macroinvertebrate communities baker et al 2016 costa and melo 2008 macroinvertebrate surveys usually collect a limited number of variables which may limit the predictive capacity of the incomplete variable set in such a situation a variable describing the origins of the sample e g sampled river may be a better predictor because it implicitly encompasses the variables that have not been accounted for especially when the sampled habitats present evident differences i e depth substrate and particularly the absence of aquatic vegetation in the udagaji river therefore although the environmental conditions were not involved in the community delineation we ranked the different combinations of clustering techniques and number of clusters based on two biological validation indices the biological homogeneity index bhi and the biological stability index bsi datta and datta 2006 which take into account the origins of each sample i e the river where the sample was collected this semi supervised approach measures whether on average genes i e macroinvertebrate communities sampled in each microhabitat belonging to the same cluster also belong to the same functional class i e river visconti et al 2014 but unlike other semi supervised methods it does not enforce or prevent any particular aggregation jain 2010 the bhi evaluates how similar defined clusters are by calculating the average proportion of paired genes i e pair of sampled communities that are clustered together have the same functional class i e were collected in the same river conversely the bsi examines the consistency of clustering similar biologically functioning genes together i e belonging to the same river observations i e macroinvertebrate families are removed from the dataset one at a time and the cluster assignments of genes i e sampled communities with the same functional class i e belonging to the same river are compared to the cluster assignments based on the full dataset the function reprankaggreg originally included within the r package rankaggreg pihur et al 2009 was used to infer the optimal clustering algorithm along with the optimal number of clusters this function performed a weighted rank aggregation of the 6 8 tested combinations following a monte carlo cross entropy approach to render the optimal number of clusters accounting simultaneously and equally for the two validity indices pihur et al 2007 finally the abundance richness and shannon weiner and simpson diversity indices of the communities delineated by the optimal clustering approach and number of clusters determined with reprankaggreg were compared with the bayesian test implemented within the r package best kruschke 2013 which provides credible values of the mean median and standard deviation to infer their differences the member and counts of each delineated community were inspected and the resulting clusters were used in subsequent analyses 2 4 eco hydraulic relationships inference neural networks based classification the most relevant variables and the relationship of these variables with the delineated communities i e clusters were sought with genetically optimised multi layer perceptrons mlps mcculloch and pitts 1943 rumelhart et al 1986 mlps are a kind of feedforward artificial neural network inspired by the structure of the nervous system with three or more layers of fully connected neuron nodes olden et al 2004 three layered input layer hidden layer output layer mlps were developed with the r package nnet venables and ripley 2002 the same number of output neurons as the number of delineated communities i e clusters was used walczak and cerpa 1999 and the outputs of the linear functions were standardised employing the softmax function this permitted to infer the suitability between zero and one of a given microhabitat to each delineated community in a comprehensible manner to prevent overfitting we simultaneously sought the optimal weights for each community number of neuron nodes and microhabitat variable subset goethals et al 2007 we used a wrapper approach involving cross validation and the genetic algorithm ga holland 1992 implemented within the r package rgenoud mebane and sekhon 2011 which is an approach that proved markedly proficient see muñoz mas et al 2016a and therein references to search them the optimisation was performed following a repeated k fold scheme 10 10 c r o s s v a l i d a t i o n with every fold presenting a similar proportion of samples per community i e samples per cluster to the original dataset and the performance criterium was the balanced accuracy i e the number of correctly predicted cases weighted by the rarity of the community which ranges between 0 and 1 muñoz mas et al 2016c the nine different operators that govern the optimisation performed by the ga mebane and sekhon 2011 were selected to avoid premature convergence as previously suggested muñoz mas et al 2017 in this study the population size was set after n population 10 n clusters 1 n predictors and the optimisation halted after a similar number of generations without improvement whereas the maximum number of generations was set to 10 n population the variable importance was examined following the olden approach olden et al 2004 which calculates the importance as the product of the raw input hidden and hidden output connection weights between each input and output neuron and sums the product across all hidden neurons beck 2016 the method was implemented using the r package neuralnettools beck 2016 and it was calculated for the 100 mlps that presented the best generalisation to calculate confidence intervals finally the modelled relationship between the selected variable subset and the probability of presence of each delineated community was graphically characterised with partial dependence plots friedman 2001 partial dependence plots depict the average of the response variable vs the inspected variable and account for the effects of the remaining variables within the model by averaging their effects the partial dependence plots were calculated adapting the code appearing in the r package randomforests liaw and wiener 2002 and they were likewise calculated for the 100 mlps that presented the better generalisation to calculate confidence intervals 3 results 3 1 macroinvertebrate communities a total of 1443 macroinvertebrates were identified the most abundant order was ephemeroptera 49 40 followed by trichoptera 21 57 and lepidoptera 6 39 whereas the least abundant order was hemiptera 1 48 the most abundant families were baetidae 28 69 hydropsychidae 20 51 and leptophlebiidae 14 21 whereas the least abundant were tricorythidae 0 07 helodidae 0 07 and atyidae 0 07 three macroinvertebrate communities were identified i e the optimal number of clusters was three using the poisson mixture model trained with da community 1 encompassed 12 samples collected exclusively in the mgugwe river and the community 3 included 30 samples collected in the udagaji river community 2 was the only cluster encompassing samples collected in both rivers although most of them were collected in the udagaji river 39 9 table 1 community 1 presented higher abundance although richness and the diversity indices were similar to those of community 3 fig 4 conversely community 2 presented the lowest values of abundance richness and the diversity indices the analysis per order and family corroborated the aforementioned general pattern in abundance although the total number of individuals delineated within community 3 was higher fig 5 therefore the abundance of the samples included within community 1 454 in 12 samples was higher than in community 3 595 in 30 samples whereas community 2 encompassed the least abundant samples 374 in 48 samples between communities the most abundant families in community 1 were baetidae 43 17 pyralidae 20 04 and hydropsychidae 10 79 whereas hydropsychidae 36 30 leptophlebiidae 15 63 baetidae 15 63 and potamonautidae 12 27 were the most abundant in community 3 conversely community 2 was dominated by baetidae 33 42 leptophlebiidae 29 95 and perlidae 10 43 the empty microhabitats i e the 20 microhabitats without macroinvertebrates were aggregated to community 2 3 2 eco hydraulic relationships the mlp structure that generalised most over the validation datasets was obtained with three neuron nodes in the hidden layer and overweighing community 2 57 07 compared to the other two communities community 1 21 33 and community 3 21 60 the better performance was obtained with six variables namely depth velocity substrate index shade aquatic vegetation and woody debris and the mean balanced accuracy per community achieved very high values i e community 1 0 84 0 21 community 2 0 77 0 12 and community 3 0 84 0 11 the partial dependence plots indicated that community 1 had a clear affinity for microhabitats with aquatic vegetation and woody debris and to a lesser extent for finer substrates i e sands fig 6 community 2 occurred in deep and shaded microhabitats with low flow velocity and the coarsest substrates including bedrock conversely community 3 occurred in unshaded shallow fast flowing microhabitats with intermediate substrate i e gravel and fine gravel the variable importance analysis corroborated the trends observed in the partial dependence plots with aquatic vegetation and woody debris followed by velocity as the most discriminant variables for community 1 fig 7 these three variables were likewise the most important for community 2 although they presented the opposite effect i e sign finally the most important variables for community 3 were velocity depth and substrate 4 discussion a central challenge in community ecology is to understand the mechanisms that shape animal assemblages our study corroborated that habitat structure and hydraulics also play a fundamental role in shaping the macroinvertebrate communities in the foothill rivers of the udzungwa mountains baker et al 2016 costa and melo 2008 we demonstrated that habitat structure and hydraulics are able to properly discriminate the macroinvertebrate communities which in turn underlines their importance as drivers of community composition and abundance aquatic vegetation woody debris velocity and substrate index followed by depth and shade emerged as the most discriminant variables to understand macroinvertebrate communities in these tropical running waters 4 1 macroinvertebrate communities we demonstrated that the optimal number of communities and clustering algorithm can be found with the functionalities implemented within the optcluster sekula et al 2017 which allowed us to determine three types of macroinvertebrate communities in a semi supervised mode by taking into account the sampled river we indicated that exclusively one community was shared between both rivers the quality of the aggregation is acknowledged by the results obtained with the mlp which achieved very high performance mean balanced accuracy 0 80 compared to previous studies e g park et al 2003 edia et al 2010 the mlp presented in this study performed well with three neuron nodes and six variables although former studies did not apply exactly the same approach followed here furthermore the number of delineated communities i e three was in line with other studies that used som in a similar manner e g park et al 2003 edia et al 2010 in accordance the use of model based clustering algorithms assuming that data were generated by a mixture of poisson or negative binomial probability distributions following semi supervised mode approaches should be taken into account as a general framework in further studies pooling data from different river segments si et al 2014 concerning to the macroinvertebrate composition the most abundant family was baetidae which is globally distributed dallas 2004 mathooko and mavuti 1992 and thus it cannot be considered particularly indicative although its low abundance has been stated to be indicative of impoverished ecological status elias et al 2014 shimba and jonah 2016 zhang et al 2018 another widely distributed taxa diptera was not abundant compared to the reference sites sampled in other studies focused on african systems dallas and mosepele 2007 kasangaki et al 2006 mathooko and mavuti 1992 therefore the largest differences between the macroinvertebrate communities of the udzungwa mountains and those sampled in other studies were found for river stretches sampled in the vicinity of large populations where the water quality led to markedly different communities dominated by individuals of the order diptera elias et al 2014 shimba and jonah 2016 although the composition of the macroinvertebrate communities may remain markedly constant dallas 2004 mcclain et al 2014 care must be taken in interpreting these results in terms of abundance because changes in composition may be governed by small and temporary changes mcclain et al 2014 4 2 eco hydraulic relationships we identified aquatic vegetation woody debris velocity substrate index and to a lesser extent depth and shade as the most discriminant variables to understand macroinvertebrate communities in the studied tropical rivers in the past the use of depth and velocity and not the combined effect in the form of shear stress or froude number has been criticised mérigoux et al 2009 however the best mlp was obtained employing simultaneously velocity substrate index and depth and considering fully interacting variables which has been suggested to increase predictive capacity mérigoux et al 2009 with this variable set the mlp achieved very high performance and led us to consider the use of these derived variables potentially redundant former studies faced difficulties to distinguish macroinvertebrate communities adriaenssens et al 2007 while our results found a clear separation for the three delineated communities according to key environmental variables here aquatic vegetation and substrate index nevertheless the relative narrow spectrum of sampled conditions may have favoured a better discrimination than other studies that encompassed a larger variability and worked at a lower taxonomic level i e species level e g adriaenssens et al 2007 mérigoux et al 2009 especially taking into account that in our case several families appeared spread over different communities interestingly the most relevant variables and their impact on macroinvertebrate abundance and composition fit well with a priori classifications performed in other studies where the available habitats were classified as stones vegetation or sand accounting for the type bedrock rapid vs cobble riffle and quality deposition of silt on stones of the underlying substrate dallas 2007 these differences between vegetated vs non vegetated and sandy vs coarse substrate have been reported in other african streams most likely because some of them compared to others are complex habitats that provide i refuge from current and fish predation ii food supply for herbivores and detritivores iii attachment for filter feeding taxa and iv exit points for emerging aquatic insects chakona et al 2008 in particular macrophytes enhance the physical and chemical heterogeneity in aquatic ecosystems phiri et al 2011 and density increases of vegetation have been related with changes in invertebrate body size distribution with large bodied individuals and taxa generally being more abundant in dense vegetation owing to the reduction in predation efficiency and foraging success of fish phiri et al 2011 thus our outcomes are in agreement with these considerations highlighting the key importance of aquatic vegetation in the structure of macroinvertebrate communities similar reasoning can be applied to woody debris because ephemeroptera and trichoptera often feed on leaf litter and or hide in woody debris cummins and klug 1979 usually the presence of woody debris is particularly relevant at least for some trichoptera because it provides the necessary material to build their characteristic cases de moor and ivanov 2008 however this might not be the case in this study as the identified trichoptera hydropsychidae and ecnomidae are caseless de moor 2005 still small woody debris can be of importance to aquatic invertebrates as for instance a food source for many species e g cummins and klug 1979 although it may be not exempt from controversy aguiar et al 2017 lau et al 2008 it has been stated that in african rivers deforestation and bank cultivation and the consequent reduction in the income material are a main cause of their absence chakona et al 2009 the importance of velocity substrate and depth which presented the most significant correlations fig 3 has been highlighted in a number of studies performed in tropical rivers either on the african continent chakona et al 2009 dallas 2007 or in other tropical regions baker et al 2016 boyero and bosch 2004 nonetheless habitats with the same substrate composition but different flow velocity or depth often harbour different macroinvertebrate communities bauernfeind and moog 2000 setting aside the results obtained for microhabitats with aquatic vegetation which may mask the effect of the hydraulic variables the correlation between velocity and substrate observed in this study support the view of former studies suggesting that ephemeroptera and trichoptera prefer to inhabit riffle type habitats with coarse substrate bauernfeind and moog 2000 chakona et al 2009 mathooko 2001 because these two orders were abundant in community 3 however they were also significantly abundant especially baetidae ephemeroptera in community 1 which was related to sandy substrate sandy substrates are usually unstable and disfavour macroinvertebrate settlement duan et al 2009 therefore we hypothesise that microhabitats dominated by sandy substrate which presented communities that usually occur in riffles duan et al 2009 were in general near the banks and subject to lower stresses therefore this spatial distribution may have favoured the establishment of aquatic vegetation where they feed and find protection from predators permitting their proliferation masese et al 2014 and thus substrate was in this case of minor relevance in contrast the result obtained for the coarsest substrate i e bedrock does not pose any doubt because this substrate usually renders little space for the macroinvertebrate refuge e g holes or crevices which justifies the impoverished communities found over there baker et al 2016 perhaps the most contradicting pattern was that related to water depth because previous studies performed in other african streams found a positive effect on macroinvertebrate abundance particularly on the ephemeroptera and trichoptera orders e g chakona et al 2009 masese et al 2014 nevertheless our results accept the view that pools host impoverished macroinvertebrate communities compared to shallower mesohabitats e g riffles as observed in other tropical streams baker et al 2016 we posit that this discrepancy may be caused by the different scales employed in these studies compared to our study which was performed at the microhabitat scale and encompassed relatively short river segments whereas the discrepant studies were performed at the mesohabitat scale encompassing long river segments that lead to a gradient of depth of different nature unlike temperate rivers in tropical rivers there is certain controversy about the origin of the primary resources with several authors claiming autochthonous e g periphytic algae and or cyanobacteria prevailing over allochthonous origins e g leaf litter e g lau et al 2008 and others claiming the opposite e g aguiar et al 2017 the results obtained for shade may indicate that the udagaji and mgugwe rivers rely on autochthonous production although this cannot be considered a general pattern unequivocally transferable to other african rivers see e g masese et al 2014 nonetheless in other tropical streams density and richness were higher when canopy cover was more variable boyero and bosch 2004 in accordance specific research should be performed to elucidate the real causes of such macroinvertebrate distribution patterns in relation to shade 4 3 potential implications of altered hydraulics and flow regimes a common practise worldwide is the construction of infrastructure to guarantee irrigation schemes and water supply for humans with concomitant significant reductions and alterations in river flows the studied rivers represent systems with natural flow conditions in which no regulatory facilities are planned but the alteration of hydraulics through irrigation schemes would drive deleterious changes in macroinvertebrate communities and linked components of river food webs invertebrate abundance may vary in response to decreased flow whereas invertebrate richness commonly decreases along with habitat diversity boyero and bosch 2004 masese et al 2013 in this regard and based exclusively in our results reductions in river flows and depth that favour the proliferation of macrophytes schoelynck et al 2018 are likely to increase the areas suitable for the community delineated in community 1 although it may not occur in the udagaji river however the consequent reduction in flow velocity in the downstream reach may negatively impact community 3 which also presented high richness and diversity consequently although the ultimate impact of water abstraction is rather uncertain we consider that reductions of river flows caused by water diversion are likely to reduce the overall abundance of macroinvertebrates as has been demonstrated in other streams of south eastern africa that suffered significant reductions in flows chakona et al 2008 mathooko and mavuti 1992 that said large irrigation schemes would modify the geomorphology of the streams and the input of woody material into the river system which is likely to impact directly shredder species and indirectly other macroinvertebrates or trophic levels through cascading effects chakona et al 2009 kasangaki et al 2006 however the mechanism triggering cascading effects might change among rivers as our results also indicated that shade may be linked to autochthonous primary production through grazing i e scrapers small impoundments can withhold sediments organic debris and nutrients mbaka and wanjiru mwaniki 2015 which will expose downstream river segments to a sediment deficit fine sediment is likely to flow preferentially trough the irrigation canal with coarser sediment trapped at the point of water diversion taniwaki et al 2017 the upstream river segments will be on the contrary negatively impacted by the increased depth caused by the impoundment which is likely to lead to the impoverished macroinvertebrate communities delineated in community 2 although it is difficult to predict how most species will respond to new environmental conditions we conclude that water abstraction is unlikely to have neutral effect over the macroinvertebrate communities of the udagaji and mgugwe rivers and therefore these practices are not recommended from an ecological conservation perspective this study has not been exhaustive and has neglected some physical and chemical variables in accordance the ultimate type and magnitude of impacts corresponds to complex interactions that would be observed in the long term mbaka and wanjiru mwaniki 2015 despite increasing concern about how climate and land use change and river regulation will affect freshwater ecosystems comparatively a few studies have focused on small tropical streams taniwaki et al 2017 therefore the herein presented results provide valuable information on macroinvertebrate communities and eco hydrological relationships in tropical streams of east africa which should adequately guide further ecological studies and assist efas conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was

1107,the influences of habitat structure and hydraulics on tropical macroinvertebrate communities were investigated in two foothill rivers of the udzungwa mountains united republic of tanzania to assist future environmental flow assessments efas macroinvertebrate samples hydraulic variables and habitat structure were collected at the microhabitat scale n 90 macroinvertebrate communities were first delineated i e clustered through poisson and negative binomial mixture models for count data in a semi supervised mode by taking into account the sampled river then genetically optimised multi layer perceptrons mlps were used to identify the relationship of the most relevant variables with the delineated communities between the three delineated communities exclusively one community was shared between both rivers the first and third communities presented similar values of richness i e number of families and diversity but the first was characterised by high abundance and was dominated by baetidae 43 2 while hydropsychidae 36 3 dominated the third community the second community was dominated by baetidae 33 4 but it involved low abundance richness and diversity samples and encompassed the microhabitats where no macroinvertebrates were found the performance of the mlp acknowledged the quality of the delineation and it indicated that the first community shows a clear affinity for microhabitats with aquatic vegetation and woody debris and the third for unshaded fast flowing and shallow microhabitats on intermediate sized substrate conversely the second community occurred in deep and shaded microhabitats with low flow velocity and coarse substrate we demonstrated that habitat structure and hydraulics are able to properly discriminate the macroinvertebrate communities which in turn underlines their importance as drivers of community composition and abundance aquatic vegetation woody debris velocity and substrate index followed by depth and shade emerged as the most discriminant variables to understand macroinvertebrate communities in these tropical running waters these results should enhance the implementation of ongoing and future efa studies keywords africa artificial neural network community ecology count data environmental flow assessment semi supervised clustering 1 introduction the recognition of deleterious human activities on freshwater ecosystems is well recognised zalewski 2008 for instance the construction of infrastructure to guarantee water supply for humans has led to anthropogenic effects through flow alteration and regulation kundzewicz 2007 these negative impacts spreading rapidly in developing tropical and sub tropical countries where the urgent need to use water for economic development overrides the implementation of initiatives promoting environmental protection msuya and lalika 2017 environmental protection can be accomplished through specific actions on living organisms and habitat conservation concerning riverine habitats the core importance of habitat structure and hydraulics are well recognised clifford et al 2006 and references therein and hydrology has been considered as a key variable affecting the dynamics and distribution patterns of freshwater species populations see e g schiemer 2016 in this context environmental flow assessment efa has emerged as a fundamental tool to determine the quantities quality and patterns of water flows i e environmental flows or e flows to balance the protection of the natural environment with out of stream uses mcclain et al 2013 between the different approaches to efa the scientific community currently advocates holistic approaches which consider the different components e g riparian vegetation macroinvertebrate communities and fish assemblages and processes e g matter fluxes of riverine and riparian ecosystems and account also for human needs among these components benthic macroinvertebrates are considered as one of the most relevant taxa to assess the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems e g park et al 2003 macroinvertebrates are ubiquitous largely dependent on the aquatic environment and are especially sensitive to flow and stream temperature changes white et al 2017 and references therein therefore understanding how communities can change with respect to environmental variables i e flow and eco hydraulic relationships is a fundamental basis for ecosystem management and efa belmar et al 2013 in this regard clustering techniques can be useful to delineate communities to serve as targets to develop the necessary eco hydraulic relationships adriaenssens et al 2007 in accordance these relationships have been typically addressed following two step approaches first communities are delineated i e clustered and then relationships are inferred park et al 2003 unfortunately the former task is not easy because over dispersion and nonlinear complex interactions occur in datasets consisting of many species and sampling areas adriaenssens et al 2007 park et al 2003 the aforementioned interactions and nonlinearity triggered the popularity of several sophisticated statistical and machine learning approaches for instance a common technique employed to delineate macroinvertebrate communities is self organizing maps soms kohonen 1982 which is a kind of artificial neural network adriaenssens et al 2007 park et al 2003 song et al 2006 however soms and many other technics require data standardisation because they are sensitive to data over dispersion e g song et al 2006 adriaenssens et al 2007 which may ultimately determine the taxa included within each delineated community thorne et al 1999 in this regard novel clustering approaches particularly designed to handle count data and over dispersion such as poisson or negative binomial mixture models si et al 2014 should be particularly well suited to delineate macroinvertebrates communities despite the aforementioned advances in the analysis of macroinvertebrate communities studies in tropical rivers especially on african streams and rivers have followed more traditional approaches such as non

combination with other environmental predictors e g kasangaki et al 2006 watson and dallas 2013 small scale differences in hydraulic conditions characterised by water velocity depth and substrate roughness are useful to predict the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages brooks et al 2005 in accordance eco hydraulic relationships based on macroinvertebrate communities collected at small spatial scales can be fundamental for efa song et al 2006 regrettably the majority of studies that differentiated spatial scales have focused on comparing reach scale and basin scale features e g minaya et al 2013 thus specific studies focusing on these small spatial scales have not been addressed in most territories although some have incidentally found relevant differences at sub reach scales mathooko 2001 niba and mafereka 2015 highlighting the importance of the patch scale to detect macroinvertebrate variation boyero and bosch 2004 that said we still lack a comprehensive understanding of methods to study efas and animal communities at small i e microhabitat scales in order to improve our knowledge and provide guidelines for adequate efas this study investigated the role of habitat structure and hydraulics at the microhabitat scale on tropical macroinvertebrate communities in two tributaries of the kilombero river located in the foothills of the udzungwa mountains united republic of tanzania to achieve this aim i the communities were delineated i e clustered by means of poisson and negative binomial mixture models in a semi supervised mode by taking into account the sampled river and ii the most relevant variables and the relationship of these variables with the delineated communities were sought with genetically optimised artificial neural networks finally the community preferences and the implications for efa were discussed for application in further studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kilombero river basin is characterised by a sub humid tropical climate with relative humidity ranging from 70 to 80 with an annual rainfall of about 1200 to 1400 mm and two rainy seasons a long rainy season from march to may and a shorter one between october and december mombo et al 2011 temperatures normally vary from 20 to 30 c mombo et al 2011 human related activities such as overgrazing by livestock agriculture and human settlement are threatening the kilombero basin elisa et al 2010 the data were collected to evaluate lower flows i e after water abstraction in accordance the survey was undertaken during one week in the end of january 2015 i e short dry season preceding the long rainy season during that and the preceding weeks no higher flows occurred the sampled rivers were the udagaji and mgugwe which are two small unregulated rivers that flow southwards from the udzungwa mountains national park fig 1 the udagaji catchment is densely forested whereas the mgugwe catchment is covered by forest and shrubs in similar proportions although the udagaji river has been identified as possible water source for a large irrigation scheme in the kilombero valley see o keeffe et al 2017 the basin area of the mgugwe river is larger 213 vs 25 km2 in accordance the mean annual flow of the mgugwe river corresponds to 2 83 m3 s 1957 1991 whereas that of the udagaji river corresponds to 0 81 m3 s 1957 1991 the maximum and minimum elevation of both sampled rivers did not differ significantly 300 325 and 1637 1802 m a s l respectively but the mean slope of the udagaji river is more pronounced 20 2 vs 16 3 in the mgugwe river causing a flashier flow regime 2 2 data collection macroinvertebrate samples were collected at the microhabitat scale a subset of a mesohabitat e g pool or riffle defining the homogeneous spatial attributes e g depth mean column velocity cover type and substrate of physical locations occupied or used by a life stage of a target species or community sometime during its life cycle sensu bovee et al 1998 using the kicking method with a wildco 500 μm kick net yulee fl usa the surveyors quietly moved zigzagging from downstream to upstream sampling systematically the different microhabitats from shore to shore the distance between microhabitats ranged between 10 and 15 m in accordance with the developing plans the microhabitat preference models were originally intended to evaluate different management scenarios for the udagaji river therefore the total number of microhabitat replicates sampled n 90 in the udagaji river outnumbered those in the mgugwe river n udagaji 69 and n mgugwe 21 in each replicate three sub replicates were sampled kicking the substrate for periods of 60 s for each replicate madikizela and dye 2003 after collection samples were preserved using 70 ethanol and later in the laboratory benthic invertebrates were sorted and identified to the family level no macroinvertebrates were found in 20 microhabitat replicates 13 in the udagaji river and 7 in the mgugwe river the macroinvertebrate community of each microhabitat replicate thereafter microhabitat was characterised based on abundance richness and diversity macroinvertebrate abundance was calculated as the total number of individuals per microhabitat i e summing the number of individuals collected in the three replicates in addition rarefaction was used to estimate sample richness i e number of families present per microhabitat and the shannon weiner and simpson diversity indices which were calculated using the r r core team 2017 package inext hsieh et al 2016 these parameters were used to characterise the delineated i e clustered communities concomitantly to the macroinvertebrate sampling three hydraulic variables depth mean flow velocity and substrate composition and four factors characterising the structure of the microhabitat i e presence and abundance of reeds aquatic vegetation log jams and small woody debris and shade were measured and scored at three points where each replicate was collected later these values were averaged to define the environmental conditions of each microhabitat depth m was measured with a wading rod to the nearest cm and the mean flow velocity of the water column hereafter velocity m s was measured with a propeller current meter ott at 40 of the measured depth the percentage of each substrate class was visually estimated around the sampling point following a simplification of the american geophysical union size scale namely silt ø 62 µm sand 62 µm ø 2 mm fine gravel 2 ø 8 mm gravel 8 ø 64 mm cobbles 64 ø 256 mm boulders ø 256 mm and bedrock muñoz mas et al 2012 later these percentages were aggregated into a single value through the dimensionless substrate index mouton et al 2011 this index is calculated by summing the weighted percentages of each substrate class as follows s u b s t r a t e i n d e x 0 03 s a n d 0 04 f i n e g r a v e l 0 05 g r a v e l 0 06 c o b b l e 0 07 b o u l d e r 0 08 b e d r o c k finally the four factors characterising the structure of the microhabitat were scored as absent scarce normal or abundant i e from 0 to 3 muñoz mas et al 2016b the microhabitats sampled in the mgugwe river were deeper and coarser fig 2 in addition aquatic vegetation was only present in the mgugwe river the force directed graph fruchterman and reingold 1991 based on the correlation obtained with the r package polycor fox 2010 which is specially designed to handle continuous and categorical data indicated that the hydraulic variables i e depth velocity and substrate index were significantly related fig 3 velocity was positively correlated with substrate which was negatively correlated with depth the factors characterising the structure of the microhabitats were not related and neither were with the hydraulic variables although aquatic vegetation was slightly and positively correlated to velocity 2 3 macroinvertebrate community delineation data clustering the macroinvertebrate communities present in the foothill rivers of the udzungwa mountains were delineated based on the abundance of each family i e number of individuals per family following the process described in the r package optcluster sekula et al 2017 this package allows finding the optimal clustering algorithm along with the optimal number of clusters i e communities in accordance a number of different approaches with the potential number of communities i e number of clusters are tested and for each combination up to nine validity indices are calculated there is not a single validity index that outperforms in every situation arbelaitz et al 2013 therefore the different combinations are subsequently ranked on the basis of the selected validity indices to obtain the optimal clustering approach and number of clusters sekula et al 2017 the model based family of algorithms designed to count data and over dispersion i e poisson and negative binomial mixture models were tested to delineate between 2 and 9 macroinvertebrate communities standard model based clustering algorithms assume that data are generated by a mixture of normal i e gaussian probability distributions where each component corresponds to one cluster si et al 2014 however the macroinvertebrate counts typically involve large numerical differences i e over dispersion which compelled scientists to recommend data transformation before clustering e g adriaenssens et al 2007 to avoid this step the tested clustering algorithms originally included within the r package mbcluster seq si 2012 employ mixtures of poisson or negative binomial distributions si et al 2014 the package mbcluster seq includes six different variants three poisson and three negative binomial alternatives differing exclusively in the training algorithm used to determine the internal parameters the first pair is trained with the expectation maximization em algorithm dempster et al 1977 which is the most popular method for approximating maximum likelihood estimate si 2012 however a well known problem associated with em is that it can be trapped at local maxima and consequently fails to reach global maxima si 2012 to overcome this limitation the package mbcluster seq includes two alternative algorithms the simulated annealing sa celeux and govaert 1992 and deterministic annealing da rose 1998 although previous studies indicated that differences among environmental conditions e g different depth substrate composition or water quality are the real drivers of macroinvertebrate communities baker et al 2016 costa and melo 2008 macroinvertebrate surveys usually collect a limited number of variables which may limit the predictive capacity of the incomplete variable set in such a situation a variable describing the origins of the sample e g sampled river may be a better predictor because it implicitly encompasses the variables that have not been accounted for especially when the sampled habitats present evident differences i e depth substrate and particularly the absence of aquatic vegetation in the udagaji river therefore although the environmental conditions were not involved in the community delineation we ranked the different combinations of clustering techniques and number of clusters based on two biological validation indices the biological homogeneity index bhi and the biological stability index bsi datta and datta 2006 which take into account the origins of each sample i e the river where the sample was collected this semi supervised approach measures whether on average genes i e macroinvertebrate communities sampled in each microhabitat belonging to the same cluster also belong to the same functional class i e river visconti et al 2014 but unlike other semi supervised methods it does not enforce or prevent any particular aggregation jain 2010 the bhi evaluates how similar defined clusters are by calculating the average proportion of paired genes i e pair of sampled communities that are clustered together have the same functional class i e were collected in the same river conversely the bsi examines the consistency of clustering similar biologically functioning genes together i e belonging to the same river observations i e macroinvertebrate families are removed from the dataset one at a time and the cluster assignments of genes i e sampled communities with the same functional class i e belonging to the same river are compared to the cluster assignments based on the full dataset the function reprankaggreg originally included within the r package rankaggreg pihur et al 2009 was used to infer the optimal clustering algorithm along with the optimal number of clusters this function performed a weighted rank aggregation of the 6 8 tested combinations following a monte carlo cross entropy approach to render the optimal number of clusters accounting simultaneously and equally for the two validity indices pihur et al 2007 finally the abundance richness and shannon weiner and simpson diversity indices of the communities delineated by the optimal clustering approach and number of clusters determined with reprankaggreg were compared with the bayesian test implemented within the r package best kruschke 2013 which provides credible values of the mean median and standard deviation to infer their differences the member and counts of each delineated community were inspected and the resulting clusters were used in subsequent analyses 2 4 eco hydraulic relationships inference neural networks based classification the most relevant variables and the relationship of these variables with the delineated communities i e clusters were sought with genetically optimised multi layer perceptrons mlps mcculloch and pitts 1943 rumelhart et al 1986 mlps are a kind of feedforward artificial neural network inspired by the structure of the nervous system with three or more layers of fully connected neuron nodes olden et al 2004 three layered input layer hidden layer output layer mlps were developed with the r package nnet venables and ripley 2002 the same number of output neurons as the number of delineated communities i e clusters was used walczak and cerpa 1999 and the outputs of the linear functions were standardised employing the softmax function this permitted to infer the suitability between zero and one of a given microhabitat to each delineated community in a comprehensible manner to prevent overfitting we simultaneously sought the optimal weights for each community number of neuron nodes and microhabitat variable subset goethals et al 2007 we used a wrapper approach involving cross validation and the genetic algorithm ga holland 1992 implemented within the r package rgenoud mebane and sekhon 2011 which is an approach that proved markedly proficient see muñoz mas et al 2016a and therein references to search them the optimisation was performed following a repeated k fold scheme 10 10 c r o s s v a l i d a t i o n with every fold presenting a similar proportion of samples per community i e samples per cluster to the original dataset and the performance criterium was the balanced accuracy i e the number of correctly predicted cases weighted by the rarity of the community which ranges between 0 and 1 muñoz mas et al 2016c the nine different operators that govern the optimisation performed by the ga mebane and sekhon 2011 were selected to avoid premature convergence as previously suggested muñoz mas et al 2017 in this study the population size was set after n population 10 n clusters 1 n predictors and the optimisation halted after a similar number of generations without improvement whereas the maximum number of generations was set to 10 n population the variable importance was examined following the olden approach olden et al 2004 which calculates the importance as the product of the raw input hidden and hidden output connection weights between each input and output neuron and sums the product across all hidden neurons beck 2016 the method was implemented using the r package neuralnettools beck 2016 and it was calculated for the 100 mlps that presented the best generalisation to calculate confidence intervals finally the modelled relationship between the selected variable subset and the probability of presence of each delineated community was graphically characterised with partial dependence plots friedman 2001 partial dependence plots depict the average of the response variable vs the inspected variable and account for the effects of the remaining variables within the model by averaging their effects the partial dependence plots were calculated adapting the code appearing in the r package randomforests liaw and wiener 2002 and they were likewise calculated for the 100 mlps that presented the better generalisation to calculate confidence intervals 3 results 3 1 macroinvertebrate communities a total of 1443 macroinvertebrates were identified the most abundant order was ephemeroptera 49 40 followed by trichoptera 21 57 and lepidoptera 6 39 whereas the least abundant order was hemiptera 1 48 the most abundant families were baetidae 28 69 hydropsychidae 20 51 and leptophlebiidae 14 21 whereas the least abundant were tricorythidae 0 07 helodidae 0 07 and atyidae 0 07 three macroinvertebrate communities were identified i e the optimal number of clusters was three using the poisson mixture model trained with da community 1 encompassed 12 samples collected exclusively in the mgugwe river and the community 3 included 30 samples collected in the udagaji river community 2 was the only cluster encompassing samples collected in both rivers although most of them were collected in the udagaji river 39 9 table 1 community 1 presented higher abundance although richness and the diversity indices were similar to those of community 3 fig 4 conversely community 2 presented the lowest values of abundance richness and the diversity indices the analysis per order and family corroborated the aforementioned general pattern in abundance although the total number of individuals delineated within community 3 was higher fig 5 therefore the abundance of the samples included within community 1 454 in 12 samples was higher than in community 3 595 in 30 samples whereas community 2 encompassed the least abundant samples 374 in 48 samples between communities the most abundant families in community 1 were baetidae 43 17 pyralidae 20 04 and hydropsychidae 10 79 whereas hydropsychidae 36 30 leptophlebiidae 15 63 baetidae 15 63 and potamonautidae 12 27 were the most abundant in community 3 conversely community 2 was dominated by baetidae 33 42 leptophlebiidae 29 95 and perlidae 10 43 the empty microhabitats i e the 20 microhabitats without macroinvertebrates were aggregated to community 2 3 2 eco hydraulic relationships the mlp structure that generalised most over the validation datasets was obtained with three neuron nodes in the hidden layer and overweighing community 2 57 07 compared to the other two communities community 1 21 33 and community 3 21 60 the better performance was obtained with six variables namely depth velocity substrate index shade aquatic vegetation and woody debris and the mean balanced accuracy per community achieved very high values i e community 1 0 84 0 21 community 2 0 77 0 12 and community 3 0 84 0 11 the partial dependence plots indicated that community 1 had a clear affinity for microhabitats with aquatic vegetation and woody debris and to a lesser extent for finer substrates i e sands fig 6 community 2 occurred in deep and shaded microhabitats with low flow velocity and the coarsest substrates including bedrock conversely community 3 occurred in unshaded shallow fast flowing microhabitats with intermediate substrate i e gravel and fine gravel the variable importance analysis corroborated the trends observed in the partial dependence plots with aquatic vegetation and woody debris followed by velocity as the most discriminant variables for community 1 fig 7 these three variables were likewise the most important for community 2 although they presented the opposite effect i e sign finally the most important variables for community 3 were velocity depth and substrate 4 discussion a central challenge in community ecology is to understand the mechanisms that shape animal assemblages our study corroborated that habitat structure and hydraulics also play a fundamental role in shaping the macroinvertebrate communities in the foothill rivers of the udzungwa mountains baker et al 2016 costa and melo 2008 we demonstrated that habitat structure and hydraulics are able to properly discriminate the macroinvertebrate communities which in turn underlines their importance as drivers of community composition and abundance aquatic vegetation woody debris velocity and substrate index followed by depth and shade emerged as the most discriminant variables to understand macroinvertebrate communities in these tropical running waters 4 1 macroinvertebrate communities we demonstrated that the optimal number of communities and clustering algorithm can be found with the functionalities implemented within the optcluster sekula et al 2017 which allowed us to determine three types of macroinvertebrate communities in a semi supervised mode by taking into account the sampled river we indicated that exclusively one community was shared between both rivers the quality of the aggregation is acknowledged by the results obtained with the mlp which achieved very high performance mean balanced accuracy 0 80 compared to previous studies e g park et al 2003 edia et al 2010 the mlp presented in this study performed well with three neuron nodes and six variables although former studies did not apply exactly the same approach followed here furthermore the number of delineated communities i e three was in line with other studies that used som in a similar manner e g park et al 2003 edia et al 2010 in accordance the use of model based clustering algorithms assuming that data were generated by a mixture of poisson or negative binomial probability distributions following semi supervised mode approaches should be taken into account as a general framework in further studies pooling data from different river segments si et al 2014 concerning to the macroinvertebrate composition the most abundant family was baetidae which is globally distributed dallas 2004 mathooko and mavuti 1992 and thus it cannot be considered particularly indicative although its low abundance has been stated to be indicative of impoverished ecological status elias et al 2014 shimba and jonah 2016 zhang et al 2018 another widely distributed taxa diptera was not abundant compared to the reference sites sampled in other studies focused on african systems dallas and mosepele 2007 kasangaki et al 2006 mathooko and mavuti 1992 therefore the largest differences between the macroinvertebrate communities of the udzungwa mountains and those sampled in other studies were found for river stretches sampled in the vicinity of large populations where the water quality led to markedly different communities dominated by individuals of the order diptera elias et al 2014 shimba and jonah 2016 although the composition of the macroinvertebrate communities may remain markedly constant dallas 2004 mcclain et al 2014 care must be taken in interpreting these results in terms of abundance because changes in composition may be governed by small and temporary changes mcclain et al 2014 4 2 eco hydraulic relationships we identified aquatic vegetation woody debris velocity substrate index and to a lesser extent depth and shade as the most discriminant variables to understand macroinvertebrate communities in the studied tropical rivers in the past the use of depth and velocity and not the combined effect in the form of shear stress or froude number has been criticised mérigoux et al 2009 however the best mlp was obtained employing simultaneously velocity substrate index and depth and considering fully interacting variables which has been suggested to increase predictive capacity mérigoux et al 2009 with this variable set the mlp achieved very high performance and led us to consider the use of these derived variables potentially redundant former studies faced difficulties to distinguish macroinvertebrate communities adriaenssens et al 2007 while our results found a clear separation for the three delineated communities according to key environmental variables here aquatic vegetation and substrate index nevertheless the relative narrow spectrum of sampled conditions may have favoured a better discrimination than other studies that encompassed a larger variability and worked at a lower taxonomic level i e species level e g adriaenssens et al 2007 mérigoux et al 2009 especially taking into account that in our case several families appeared spread over different communities interestingly the most relevant variables and their impact on macroinvertebrate abundance and composition fit well with a priori classifications performed in other studies where the available habitats were classified as stones vegetation or sand accounting for the type bedrock rapid vs cobble riffle and quality deposition of silt on stones of the underlying substrate dallas 2007 these differences between vegetated vs non vegetated and sandy vs coarse substrate have been reported in other african streams most likely because some of them compared to others are complex habitats that provide i refuge from current and fish predation ii food supply for herbivores and detritivores iii attachment for filter feeding taxa and iv exit points for emerging aquatic insects chakona et al 2008 in particular macrophytes enhance the physical and chemical heterogeneity in aquatic ecosystems phiri et al 2011 and density increases of vegetation have been related with changes in invertebrate body size distribution with large bodied individuals and taxa generally being more abundant in dense vegetation owing to the reduction in predation efficiency and foraging success of fish phiri et al 2011 thus our outcomes are in agreement with these considerations highlighting the key importance of aquatic vegetation in the structure of macroinvertebrate communities similar reasoning can be applied to woody debris because ephemeroptera and trichoptera often feed on leaf litter and or hide in woody debris cummins and klug 1979 usually the presence of woody debris is particularly relevant at least for some trichoptera because it provides the necessary material to build their characteristic cases de moor and ivanov 2008 however this might not be the case in this study as the identified trichoptera hydropsychidae and ecnomidae are caseless de moor 2005 still small woody debris can be of importance to aquatic invertebrates as for instance a food source for many species e g cummins and klug 1979 although it may be not exempt from controversy aguiar et al 2017 lau et al 2008 it has been stated that in african rivers deforestation and bank cultivation and the consequent reduction in the income material are a main cause of their absence chakona et al 2009 the importance of velocity substrate and depth which presented the most significant correlations fig 3 has been highlighted in a number of studies performed in tropical rivers either on the african continent chakona et al 2009 dallas 2007 or in other tropical regions baker et al 2016 boyero and bosch 2004 nonetheless habitats with the same substrate composition but different flow velocity or depth often harbour different macroinvertebrate communities bauernfeind and moog 2000 setting aside the results obtained for microhabitats with aquatic vegetation which may mask the effect of the hydraulic variables the correlation between velocity and substrate observed in this study support the view of former studies suggesting that ephemeroptera and trichoptera prefer to inhabit riffle type habitats with coarse substrate bauernfeind and moog 2000 chakona et al 2009 mathooko 2001 because these two orders were abundant in community 3 however they were also significantly abundant especially baetidae ephemeroptera in community 1 which was related to sandy substrate sandy substrates are usually unstable and disfavour macroinvertebrate settlement duan et al 2009 therefore we hypothesise that microhabitats dominated by sandy substrate which presented communities that usually occur in riffles duan et al 2009 were in general near the banks and subject to lower stresses therefore this spatial distribution may have favoured the establishment of aquatic vegetation where they feed and find protection from predators permitting their proliferation masese et al 2014 and thus substrate was in this case of minor relevance in contrast the result obtained for the coarsest substrate i e bedrock does not pose any doubt because this substrate usually renders little space for the macroinvertebrate refuge e g holes or crevices which justifies the impoverished communities found over there baker et al 2016 perhaps the most contradicting pattern was that related to water depth because previous studies performed in other african streams found a positive effect on macroinvertebrate abundance particularly on the ephemeroptera and trichoptera orders e g chakona et al 2009 masese et al 2014 nevertheless our results accept the view that pools host impoverished macroinvertebrate communities compared to shallower mesohabitats e g riffles as observed in other tropical streams baker et al 2016 we posit that this discrepancy may be caused by the different scales employed in these studies compared to our study which was performed at the microhabitat scale and encompassed relatively short river segments whereas the discrepant studies were performed at the mesohabitat scale encompassing long river segments that lead to a gradient of depth of different nature unlike temperate rivers in tropical rivers there is certain controversy about the origin of the primary resources with several authors claiming autochthonous e g periphytic algae and or cyanobacteria prevailing over allochthonous origins e g leaf litter e g lau et al 2008 and others claiming the opposite e g aguiar et al 2017 the results obtained for shade may indicate that the udagaji and mgugwe rivers rely on autochthonous production although this cannot be considered a general pattern unequivocally transferable to other african rivers see e g masese et al 2014 nonetheless in other tropical streams density and richness were higher when canopy cover was more variable boyero and bosch 2004 in accordance specific research should be performed to elucidate the real causes of such macroinvertebrate distribution patterns in relation to shade 4 3 potential implications of altered hydraulics and flow regimes a common practise worldwide is the construction of infrastructure to guarantee irrigation schemes and water supply for humans with concomitant significant reductions and alterations in river flows the studied rivers represent systems with natural flow conditions in which no regulatory facilities are planned but the alteration of hydraulics through irrigation schemes would drive deleterious changes in macroinvertebrate communities and linked components of river food webs invertebrate abundance may vary in response to decreased flow whereas invertebrate richness commonly decreases along with habitat diversity boyero and bosch 2004 masese et al 2013 in this regard and based exclusively in our results reductions in river flows and depth that favour the proliferation of macrophytes schoelynck et al 2018 are likely to increase the areas suitable for the community delineated in community 1 although it may not occur in the udagaji river however the consequent reduction in flow velocity in the downstream reach may negatively impact community 3 which also presented high richness and diversity consequently although the ultimate impact of water abstraction is rather uncertain we consider that reductions of river flows caused by water diversion are likely to reduce the overall abundance of macroinvertebrates as has been demonstrated in other streams of south eastern africa that suffered significant reductions in flows chakona et al 2008 mathooko and mavuti 1992 that said large irrigation schemes would modify the geomorphology of the streams and the input of woody material into the river system which is likely to impact directly shredder species and indirectly other macroinvertebrates or trophic levels through cascading effects chakona et al 2009 kasangaki et al 2006 however the mechanism triggering cascading effects might change among rivers as our results also indicated that shade may be linked to autochthonous primary production through grazing i e scrapers small impoundments can withhold sediments organic debris and nutrients mbaka and wanjiru mwaniki 2015 which will expose downstream river segments to a sediment deficit fine sediment is likely to flow preferentially trough the irrigation canal with coarser sediment trapped at the point of water diversion taniwaki et al 2017 the upstream river segments will be on the contrary negatively impacted by the increased depth caused by the impoundment which is likely to lead to the impoverished macroinvertebrate communities delineated in community 2 although it is difficult to predict how most species will respond to new environmental conditions we conclude that water abstraction is unlikely to have neutral effect over the macroinvertebrate communities of the udagaji and mgugwe rivers and therefore these practices are not recommended from an ecological conservation perspective this study has not been exhaustive and has neglected some physical and chemical variables in accordance the ultimate type and magnitude of impacts corresponds to complex interactions that would be observed in the long term mbaka and wanjiru mwaniki 2015 despite increasing concern about how climate and land use change and river regulation will affect freshwater ecosystems comparatively a few studies have focused on small tropical streams taniwaki et al 2017 therefore the herein presented results provide valuable information on macroinvertebrate communities and eco hydrological relationships in tropical streams of east africa which should adequately guide further ecological studies and assist efas conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was

1108,in this study pressure driven ceramic membranes for microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf were used to improve the quality of waters in lakes four urban lakes located in the city of olsztyn and belong to the masurian lake district track 53 47 21 n 20 32 24 e podkówka 53 47 2 n 20 27 1 e tyrsko 53 48 18 n 20 25 21 e and redykajny 53 48 55 n 20 25 4 e were examined the effects of the composition of lake water from different photic zones and of the type of membrane on the efficiency of removal of total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were investigated the average efficiencies of rejection were 71 6 5 8 toc 16 0 5 7 tp and 19 6 9 3 tn independently of the composition of the feed and the type of membrane due to the similar average permeate fluxes of 2 2 0 1l m2 min and water recoveries of above 85 in mf and uf the use of mf is suggested because it has lower operational costs than uf because membrane filtration of waters from the zones with the highest chlorophyll contents was very effective both in terms of efficiency of pollutant rejection and hydraulic parameters of membranes this technology can be used for selective treatment of parts of water with the highest phytoplankton abundance keywords microfiltration ultrafiltration water treatment organic carbon nitrogen phosphorus 1 introduction global water demand will increase by about 20 30 5 500 6 000km3 y by 2050 3 6 billion people worldwide are already living in areas that suffer from water scarcity at least one month per year and this could increase to 4 8 5 7 billion in 2050 additionally the deterioration of water quality is expected to escalate and this will increase threats to human health the environment and sustainable development wwdr 2018 one of the main threats especially in reservoirs for drinking water is the uncontrolled increase in harmful and toxic cyanobacterial blooms cayelan et al 2012 harke et al 2016 paerl et al 2016 the occurrence of blooms and scums affects eco goods and services derived from lakes such as potable water supplies fisheries or recreation aylward et al 2005 hamilton et al 2014 napiórkowska krzebietke and dunalska 2015 there are many restoration techniques used to improve the water quality in lakes for example oxygenation destratification or mixing with propellers phosphorus inactivation or flocculation dredging or capping of bottom sediments hypolimnetic withdrawal and inflow diversion dunalska 2002 2003 søndergaard et al 2007 hamilton and dada 2016 bartoszek et al 2017 however more sensitive and precise methods are needed to control cyanobacterial blooms due to increasing human population and climate change efforts to achieve effective lake management should combine nature based solutions with engineering and biotechnology tools boryczko et al 2018 membrane filtration can be an alternative to the above mentioned treatments and it has high potential to be employed for the treatment of lake water the advantages of membrane technology include a small operational area high treatment efficiency direct operational control and no addition of chemicals to water rana et al 2005 so far membrane technology has been used to increase the quality of fresh water for various domestic and industrial purposes in water treatment plants mainly nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes are used to remove color and natural organic matter nom before chlorination to avoid formation of chlorinated disinfection byproducts as well as to remove ammonia patterson et al 2012 teow et al 2017 low pressure membrane techniques such as microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf yield a high flux of permeate at low transmembrane pressure luo et al 2011 which means that these techniques have lower energy costs than nf or ro however mf and uf are not effective for the removal of nom so they are used in combined systems with pre treatment by coagulation adsorption or floatation li and visvanathan 2017 dong et al 2018 mf and uf remove microorganisms from water uf is effective for turbidity removal and can be used alone when untreated water is not high in toc when it is high in toc pre treatment is necessary laine et al 2000 for example in the process of adsorption kaleta et al 2017 the present study tested the use of low pressure membranes for increasing the quality of waters in urban lakes that differ trophically and morphometrically without the use of chemical pre treatment the literature data on the treatment of natural waters collected from different depths are scarce therefore in this study the efficiency of removal of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus from lake water was tested at different depths in the photic zone and with different water compositions to conclude if the whole volume of water should be treated for mf and uf ceramic membranes were tested because of their good thermal and chemical stability and their high resistance to corrosion abrasion and fouling baker 2000 lee et al 2013 even with ceramic membranes however fouling remains a problem therefore the effect of the feed composition on the hydraulic parameters of the membranes was evaluated based on

fluorescence chlf profiles the analyses have shown the relative changes in chlf over depth as well as among the lakes the lowest chlf was in tyrsko lake 3 13rfu the highest in track lake 40 62rfu fig

2m track 1m fig 1 the physical stratification and mixing processes have a great influence on the vertical distribution of physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton composition grabowska and mazur marzec 2014 reynolds et al 2002 in polymictic and very eutrophic lakes like track and podkówka the most favorable conditions for phytoplankton were at 1 and 2m depth in contrast in the clear and stable water column of tyrsko lake maximal densities of phytoplankton were at 6m depth the knowledge about the vertical distribution of chlf can be very important for the treatment of the most productive layer of water with potentially toxic cyanobacteria 3 2 efficiency of removal of toc tp and tn by membrane filtration the lowest toc concentration in layer 1 was in tyrsko lake 8 5mg l the highest in track lake 18 4mg l table 2 the concentrations of toc in the permeate from mf ranged from 2 4mg l tyrsko lake to 6 6mg l track lake and in the permeate from uf they ranged from 2 1mg l tyrsko lake to 4 5mg l track lake the percentage rejections ranged from 64 0 to 71 8 for mf and from 66 9 to 75 5 for uf table 3 in the next investigated layers the toc concentration in the collected water was also the lowest in tyrsko lake and the highest in track lake in layer 2 which had the highest chlf toc removal by mf ranged from 62 6 to 68 5 and removal by uf from 67 0 to 77 6 the toc concentrations did not exceed 7 1mg l in mf permeate and 5 2mg l in uf permeate although water collected from layer 3 had the highest toc concentration these values were still rather low ranging from 3 0 to 6 2mg l in mf permeate and from 2 9 to 6 0mg l in uf permeate removal efficiency reached 81 3 for mf and 81 9 for uf of water from track lake for all investigated lakes the differences in the toc concentrations in the permeates from mf and uf were not statistically significant in low pressure membrane techniques such as mf and uf retention of particles on the membrane surface sieve retention is the main mechanism for removal of organic matter guo et al 2009 due to much smaller membrane pores in the uf membrane higher toc removal could be expected with the use of this membrane rather than the mf membrane however because of similar rejection of toc by mf and uf it can be supposed that suspended organic matter mainly contributed to the toc concentration thus the mf membrane pores were not too large to retain these particles in addition the rejection of organic compounds can be caused by membrane fouling in particular by a cake layer formed on the membrane smith et al 2012 ye et al 2016 furthermore waeger et al 2010 observed that feed particles blocked the pore entrances of the mf membranes to a high extent whereas the smaller pores of the uf membrane did not get blocked this ratio between particle size and membrane pore diameter may affect the efficiency of pollutant rejection the concentrations of tp were the lowest in tyrsko and redykajny lakes from 0 068 to 0 091mg l and the highest in track and podkówka lakes from 0 095 to 0 189mg l table 2 in each lake there were no differences in the tp concentrations between the investigated water layers independently of the tp concentration in the feed its concentrations in the permeates ranged from 0 056 to 0 156mg l the efficiency of tp rejection by mf was from 4 5 track lake layer 2 to 21 1 podkówka lake layer 1 table 3 although the differences were not statistically significant the use of uf increased tp removal with uf these values ranged from 8 8 tyrsko lake layer 2 to 30 2 track lake layer 1 the concentrations of tn in water collected from all investigated layers were lowest in tyrsko and redykajny lakes from 0 72 to 0 91mg l and highest in track and podkówka lakes from 0 85 to 2 42mg l table 2 in track and podkówka lakes the concentration of tn was the lowest in the surface layer and highest in water collected from the maximum depth to which photosynthetic radiation reaches the concentrations of tn in the permeates were from 0 59 to 2 12mg l the percentage of tn rejection by mf ranged from 8 2 podkówka lake layer 1 to 38 6 track lake layer 3 and rejection by uf ranged from 10 4 tyrsko lake layer 3 to 42 9 track lake layer 3 table 3 after mf and uf the differences in permeate quality in terms of tn were not statistically significant the irrigation guidelines given by the fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations include mainly the concentrations of nitrate salinity and ph there is no restriction on use of waters for irrigation when these parameters are 5mg no3 n l 0 7ds m and 6 5 8 4 ph respectively in all the permeates nitrate concentrations were below 2 2mg no3 n l salinity was 0 103 0 451ds m and ph was 7 4 8 4 therefore the final effluents reached the standards for waters used for irrigations however the possibility of using the permeates for irrigation should be controlled for each case because the above parameters are strongly determined by e g lake productivity in addition the presence of harmful toxins and other possible pollutants should be controlled when the use of waters for irrigations is being considered 3 3 concentrations of pollutants in retentates in general the concentrations of the analyzed compounds were higher in retentates than in the feed table 2 for example the concentrations of toc ranged from 11 5 to 42 4mg l mf and from 12 2 to 45 5mg l uf however tp and tn were not more concentrated in the retentate from uf than in that from mf the retentates had tp concentrations from 0 078 to 0 214mg l and tn concentrations from 0 77 to 2 83mg l although polluted retentates were obtained in all membrane tests the vcfs were very high from 6 9 to 9 1 table 4 which means that the volumes of retentates were small under 3l from 20l of feed in addition breakage of cells and pollutant particles occurs in membrane installations due to the high pressure liu et al 2017 this results in dispersion of these particles and release of organic matter which is then more available for degradation therefore the retentates that contain concentrated algae suspensions can be supplied to biogas plants 3 4 adsorption of pollutants on the membrane in the present study the measured loadings of toc tp and tn in the retentates were lower than those calculated from the mass balance the reason for this observation was the adsorption of these compounds in the membrane structure the adsorption of toc up to 67 tp up to 24 and tn up to 33 table 3 contributed to the rejection of these compounds from lake water in addition to sieve retention during adsorption particles were captured in the membrane structure and were not washed out by the flowing stream in the cross flow mode of filtration these particles had to be smaller than membrane pores and were accumulated inside the pores thus decreasing their diameters as a result the removal of compounds of molecular weights smaller than the nominal pore size of the membrane was possible guo et al 2009 therefore the accumulation of compounds can positively affect the efficiency of retention and may explain the retention of total nitrogen and phosphorus by mf and uf membranes although the nominal pore sizes in the used membranes do not allow the effective retention of tp and tn blocking of the membranes results in the fact that the effective pore sizes are lower thus allowing retention of much smaller particles additionally tp and tn involved in organic matter can be rejected by size exclusion with the membranes used in this experiment in addition colloids that are accumulated on the membrane surface may adsorb dissolved organic compounds andrade et al 2014 which in this study could have improved the removal of toc and explained the relatively high toc removal in mf 3 5 hydraulic parameters of the membrane process both with the use of mf and uf membranes the installation was operated at a constant pressure therefore a decrease in permeate flux in time was observed this decrease led to complete stoppage of the flow because the installation was not equipped with an automatic backwash system and the permeation tests were actually batch tests this drop of flow was caused by membrane fouling by the components of the feed fouling is caused mainly by nom and colloids carroll et al 2000 laabs et al 2006 from nom hydrophilic compounds are the major contributors to fouling whereas fulvic and humic acids are minor contributors in a pilot scale hybrid mf process with coagulation pretreatment that was used to treat lake water two fractions of nom hydrophilic neutrals and strong hydrophobic organic acids with low and medium molecular weight were the primary causes of irreversible fouling dong et al 2018 according to lim and bai 2003 the proportion of pore size to particle size is more important in fouling particles of similar sizes or smaller than the pores block the pores and produce a filtration cake more quickly than larger particles therefore mf membranes are more prone to fouling than uf membranes lee et al 2004 although an increase in tmp generally causes an increase in permeate flux in the present study the use of a higher tmp of 5 bars in uf did not cause the permeate flux to be higher than that in mf at 3 bars table 4 as the tmp increases within some range more pollutants are compressed on the membrane surface which clogs the pores and increases membrane resistance bergamasco et al 2011 sun et al 2015 in the present study the use of a uf membrane with a lower cut off resulted in higher membrane resistance which was almost twice the resistance of the mf membrane table 4 as a result similar values of j v were obtained in both processes from 2 06 to 2 28l m2 min independently of the pressure therefore the flow of compounds through the membrane depended only on the concentration of particular compounds in the permeates for toc the values of d ranged from 5 1 to 16 2mg m2 min for mf and from 4 5 to 13 5mg m2 min for uf for tp the values of d ranged from 0 12 to 0 35mg m2 min for mf and from 0 12 to 0 30mg m2 min for uf for tn the values of d ranged from 1 4 to 4 5mg m2 min for mf and from 1 2 to 4 4mg m2 min for uf in all the filtration batch tests water recovery was high above 85 table 4 which indicates that the use of mf and uf can be effective in lake water reclamation due to the fact that permeate composition permeate flux and water recovery were similar for mf and uf it is suggested to use mf in practice in general mf is operated at lower pressures than uf which lowers operational costs 4 conclusions this paper examined the applicability of membrane filtration for treating waters from different photic layers of urban lakes that differ in trophic and morphometric conditions independently of the toc tp and tn concentrations in the feed the difference in the composition of permeates from mf and uf was not statistically significant the average efficiencies of rejection were 71 6 5 8 toc 16 0 5 7 tp and 19 6 9 3 tn it is suggested that membrane filtration be used periodically during intensive algal blooms for treating waters with the highest primary production to avoid using chemical methods of lake reclamation providing that harmful toxins or other possible pollutants are not present the resulting permeates can be utilized for irrigation purposes or recycled for livestock drinking however these methods of water utilization need further study conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the

1108,in this study pressure driven ceramic membranes for microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf were used to improve the quality of waters in lakes four urban lakes located in the city of olsztyn

composition of lake water from different photic zones and of the type of membrane on the efficiency of removal of total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were investigated the average efficiencies of rejection were 71 6 5 8 toc 16 0 5 7 tp and 19 6 9 3 tn independently of the composition of the feed and the type of membrane due to the similar average permeate fluxes of 2 2 0 1l m2 min and water recoveries of above 85 in mf and uf the use of mf is suggested because it has lower operational costs than uf because membrane filtration of waters from the zones with the highest chlorophyll contents was very effective both in terms of efficiency of pollutant rejection and hydraulic parameters of membranes this technology can be used for selective treatment of parts of water with the highest phytoplankton abundance keywords microfiltration ultrafiltration water treatment organic carbon nitrogen phosphorus 1 introduction global water demand will increase by about 20 30 5 500 6 000km3 y by 2050 3 6 billion people worldwide are already living in areas that suffer from water scarcity at least one month per year and this could increase to 4 8 5 7 billion in 2050 additionally the deterioration of water quality is expected to escalate and this will increase threats to human health the environment and sustainable development wwdr 2018 one of the main threats especially in reservoirs for drinking water is the uncontrolled increase in harmful and toxic cyanobacterial blooms cayelan et al 2012 harke et al 2016 paerl et al 2016 the occurrence of blooms and scums affects eco goods and services derived from lakes such as potable water supplies fisheries or recreation aylward et al 2005 hamilton et al 2014 napiórkowska krzebietke and dunalska 2015 there are many restoration techniques used to improve the water quality in lakes for example oxygenation destratification or mixing with propellers phosphorus inactivation or flocculation dredging or capping of bottom sediments hypolimnetic withdrawal and inflow diversion dunalska 2002 2003 søndergaard et al 2007 hamilton and dada 2016 bartoszek et al 2017 however more sensitive and precise methods are needed to control cyanobacterial blooms due to increasing human population and climate change efforts to achieve effective lake management should combine nature based solutions with engineering and biotechnology tools boryczko et al 2018 membrane filtration can be an alternative to the above mentioned treatments and it has high potential to be employed for the treatment of lake water the advantages of membrane technology include a small operational area high treatment efficiency direct operational control and no addition of chemicals to water rana et al 2005 so far membrane technology has been used to increase the quality of fresh water for various domestic and industrial purposes in water treatment plants mainly nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes are used to remove color and natural organic matter nom before chlorination to avoid formation of chlorinated disinfection byproducts as well as to remove ammonia patterson et al 2012 teow et al 2017 low pressure membrane techniques such as microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf yield a high flux of permeate at low transmembrane pressure luo et al 2011 which means that these techniques have lower energy costs than nf or ro however mf and uf are not effective for the removal of nom so they are used in combined systems with pre treatment by coagulation adsorption or floatation li and visvanathan 2017 dong et al 2018 mf and uf remove microorganisms from water uf is effective for turbidity removal and can be used alone when untreated water is not high in toc when it is high in toc pre treatment is necessary laine et al 2000 for example in the process of adsorption kaleta et al 2017 the present study tested the use of low pressure membranes for increasing the quality of waters in urban lakes that differ trophically and morphometrically without the use of chemical pre treatment the literature data on the treatment of natural waters collected from different depths are scarce therefore in this study the efficiency of removal of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus from lake water was tested at different depths in the photic zone and with different water compositions to conclude if the whole volume of water should be treated for mf and uf ceramic membranes were tested because of their good thermal and chemical stability and their high resistance to corrosion abrasion and fouling baker 2000 lee et al 2013 even with ceramic membranes however fouling remains a problem therefore the effect of the feed composition on the hydraulic parameters of the membranes was evaluated based on the results of this study the use of membranes is suggested for selective treatment of the parts of lakes that contain the highest concentrations of chlorophyll during periods of intensive algal blooms this treatment would have two advantages it would decrease the amount of organic matter in the lake and it would produce effluent that can be used for various purposes 2 materials and methods 2

effluents reached the standards for waters used for irrigations however the possibility of using the permeates for irrigation should be controlled for each case because the above parameters are strongly determined by e g lake productivity in addition the presence of harmful toxins and other possible pollutants should be controlled when the use of waters for irrigations is being considered 3 3 concentrations of pollutants in retentates in general the concentrations of the analyzed compounds were higher in retentates than in the feed table 2 for example the concentrations of toc ranged from 11 5 to 42 4mg l mf and from 12 2 to 45 5mg l uf however tp and tn were not more concentrated in the retentate from uf than in that from mf the retentates had tp concentrations from 0 078 to 0 214mg l and tn concentrations from 0 77 to 2 83mg l although polluted retentates were obtained in all membrane tests the vcfs were very high from 6 9 to 9 1 table 4 which means that the volumes of retentates were small under 3l from 20l of feed in addition breakage of cells and pollutant particles occurs in membrane installations due to the high pressure liu et al 2017 this results in dispersion of these particles and release of organic matter which is then more available for degradation therefore the retentates that contain concentrated algae suspensions can be supplied to biogas plants 3 4 adsorption of pollutants on the membrane in the present study the measured loadings of toc tp and tn in the retentates were lower than those calculated from the mass balance the reason for this observation was the adsorption of these compounds in the membrane structure the adsorption of toc up to 67 tp up to 24 and tn up to 33 table 3 contributed to the rejection of these compounds from lake water in addition to sieve retention during adsorption particles were captured in the membrane structure and were not washed out by the flowing stream in the cross flow mode of filtration these particles had to be smaller than membrane pores and were accumulated inside the pores thus decreasing their diameters as a result the removal of compounds of molecular weights smaller than the nominal pore size of the membrane was possible guo et al 2009 therefore the accumulation of compounds can positively affect the efficiency of retention and may explain the retention of total nitrogen and phosphorus by mf and uf membranes although the nominal pore sizes in the used membranes do not allow the effective retention of tp and tn blocking of the membranes results in the fact that the effective pore sizes are lower thus allowing retention of much smaller particles additionally tp and tn involved in organic matter can be rejected by size exclusion with the membranes used in this experiment in addition colloids that are accumulated on the membrane surface may adsorb dissolved organic compounds andrade et al 2014 which in this study could have improved the removal of toc and explained the relatively high toc removal in mf 3 5 hydraulic parameters of the membrane process both with the use of mf and uf membranes the installation was operated at a constant pressure therefore a decrease in permeate flux in time was observed this decrease led to complete stoppage of the flow because the installation was not equipped with an automatic backwash system and the permeation tests were actually batch tests this drop of flow was caused by membrane fouling by the components of the feed fouling is caused mainly by nom and colloids carroll et al 2000 laabs et al 2006 from nom hydrophilic compounds are the major contributors to fouling whereas fulvic and humic acids are minor contributors in a pilot scale hybrid mf process with coagulation pretreatment that was used to treat lake water two fractions of nom hydrophilic neutrals and strong hydrophobic organic acids with low and medium molecular weight were the primary causes of irreversible fouling dong et al 2018 according to lim and bai 2003 the proportion of pore size to particle size is more important in fouling particles of similar sizes or smaller than the pores block the pores and produce a filtration cake more quickly than larger particles therefore mf membranes are more prone to fouling than uf membranes lee et al 2004 although an increase in tmp generally causes an increase in permeate flux in the present study the use of a higher tmp of 5 bars in uf did not cause the permeate flux to be higher than that in mf at 3 bars table 4 as the tmp increases within some range more pollutants are compressed on the membrane surface which clogs the pores and increases membrane resistance bergamasco et al 2011 sun et al 2015 in the present study the use of a uf membrane with a lower cut off resulted in higher membrane resistance which was almost twice the resistance of the mf membrane table 4 as a result similar values of j v were obtained in both processes from 2 06 to 2 28l m2 min independently of the pressure therefore the flow of compounds through the membrane depended only on the concentration of particular compounds in the permeates for toc the values of d ranged from 5 1 to 16 2mg m2 min for mf and from 4 5 to 13 5mg m2 min for uf for tp the values of d ranged from 0 12 to 0 35mg m2 min for mf and from 0 12 to 0 30mg m2 min for uf for tn the values of d ranged from 1 4 to 4 5mg m2 min for mf and from 1 2 to 4 4mg m2 min for uf in all the filtration batch tests water recovery was high above 85 table 4 which indicates that the use of mf and uf can be effective in lake water reclamation due to the fact that permeate composition permeate flux and water recovery were similar for mf and uf it is suggested to use mf in practice in general mf is operated at lower pressures than uf which lowers operational costs 4 conclusions this paper examined the applicability of membrane filtration for treating waters from different photic layers of urban lakes that differ in trophic and morphometric conditions independently of the toc tp and tn concentrations in the feed the difference in the composition of permeates from mf and uf was not statistically significant the average efficiencies of rejection were 71 6 5 8 toc 16 0 5 7 tp and 19 6 9 3 tn it is suggested that membrane filtration be used periodically during intensive algal blooms for treating waters with the highest primary production to avoid using chemical methods of lake reclamation providing that harmful toxins or other possible pollutants are not present the resulting permeates can be utilized for irrigation purposes or recycled for livestock drinking however these methods of water utilization need further study conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the

1109,toxic cyanobacterial blooms are of major concern in eutrophic inland waters due to their water quality deterioration capabilities understanding their dynamics and driving factors is of great importance to manage bloom events and their consequences ecosystem models enable us to simulate analyze and understand ecological processes in complex aquatic ecosystems in this work we examined the ability of the general lake model aquatic ecodynamics glm aed an open access one dimensional hydrodynamic ecological model to simulate physical variables and the dynamics of two cyanobacterial species in 2016 the effect of possible hydrological and climatic scenarios on cyanobacterial blooms occurrence was also investigated results indicate that the model was able to accurately reproduce changes in water level mape of 0 4 water temperature profiles mape of 5 to 7 and the biomass of microcystis aeruginosa and chrysosporum aphanizomenon ovalisporum at the study area dramatic changes were observed under warming trends including increase in both the length of the stratification period and in cyanobacteria bloom dynamics data analysis revealed that while water temperature was the primary factor determining cyanobacterial succession and occurrence other factors such as water level fluctuations and irradiance are also important our findings suggest that any further increase in temperature would promote the development of potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms at karaoun reservoir the good performance of the model will provide essential insights required for deeper ecological understanding and water quality management keywords cyanobacteria modelling climate eutrophic lakes 1 introduction blooms of toxic cyanobacteria remain an environmental and public health concern in inland lakes and reservoirs the expansion of this event has increased in frequency and geographical distribution over the last decades favored by rising temperatures paerl and huisman 2008 land degradation and anthropogenic activities darwish and fadel 2017 cyanobacterial blooms were reported in several inland water bodies worldwide and are considered as a leading factor of water quality deterioration and impairment bresciani et al 2017 fastner et al 1999 sarazin et al 2002 negative impacts are characterized by bad odors and tastes reduction of water clarity oxygen depletion hypoxia or anoxia during bloom decay subsequent fish kills paerl and otten 2013 and changes in the composition and biodiversity of phytoplankton fadel et al 2014a b these effects are emphasized as several genera of cyanobacteria produce a variety of toxic compounds posing major risks to aquatic life and human health in contaminated waters used for recreational activities and drinking water production falconer 1998 this harmful aspect has drawn attention to a regular monitoring of water bodies through in situ campaigns and earth observation methods to understand the processes inducing blooms of these photosynthetic species consequently their development has been attributed to a variety of environmental drivers fadel 2014 te and gin 2011 havens et al 2003 the effect of water temperature and nutrient availability or eutrophication on the proliferation of cyanobacteria has been extensively investigated in recent years gągała et al 2010 grabowska 2012 water level fluctuations have been less considered on ecosystem alterations and biological effects water level fluctuations can occur naturally within a lake up to 1 5m annually most of the research was conducted on shallow lakes where fluctuations are more noticeable leira and cantonati 2008 however artificial lakes experience greater fluctuations of tens of meters for which effects on ecosystem functioning in general and cyanobacteria in particular have not been fairly studied knowledge about competition between different species and the environmental variables interactions that are regulating biological production is important to predict responses of freshwater biota spatially and temporally with the lack of comprehensive ecological and hydrodynamic behavior of lakes and reservoirs in response to external forcing predictive models have become more valuable bhagowati and ahamad 2018 in management aimed at monitoring predicting understanding and reducing the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms deterministic mathematical models have been applied to affected lakes wu and xu 2011 gal et al 2009 modelling has been recognized for explaining the causal factors or ecosystem processes involved in the development of phytoplankton blooms it provides a means to study the behavior of dynamically changing ecosystems and explore phytoplankton responses to a changing environment pinardi et al 2015 ecological models are able to predict cyanobacterial biomass and occurrence in relation to modifications in environmental variables such as nutrient concentrations and grazing pressure guven and howard 2006 this applies to total cyanobacterial occurrence or abundance and the occurrence of specific taxa gal et al 2009 a coupling with physical models will help establish a linkage between physical biological interactions which will yield a more comprehensive overview of causal mechanisms governing plankton dynamics researchers have been addressing the question of future climate change as a potential driver of the intensification of cyanobacterial blooms paerl and huisman 2009 o neil et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 thus these models can also serve as tools to test different scenario that include changes in climate and hydrological regimes a multitude of coupled one dimensional numerical models has been developed for water quality purposes compared to oceanographic studies these models have been seldom applied to lakes one reason arises from the complexity of freshwater ecosystems although a review by jørgensen 2010 highlights recent advances in lake modelling in which three dimensional models have been widely applied over other models the one dimensionality concept is assumed to restrict the ability to capture spatial heterogeneity within these systems however as franks 1995 stated the choice of the model should respond to the questions being asked aiming at exploring and understanding the dynamics controlling cyanobacterial blooms the dimensionality of a model should not matter as much as its ability to describe the dominant biological features within the ecosystem and forces acting on them in the present study we aim to examine environmental variables affecting the establishment and dynamics of cyanobacteria at karaoun reservoir lebanon a one dimensional modelling approach was used to simulate the hydrodynamics and the succession of two cyanobacterial species we report on model simulation results and apparent environmental factors promoting cyanobacterial blooms we also address the response of cyanobacteria under different climatic and hydrological scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site karaoun reservoir 33 34 n 35 41 e lebanon s largest freshwater body is a monomictic deep waterbody fig 1 it has a surface area of 12km2 at full capacity a maximum and a mean depth of 60 and 19m respectively karaoun reservoir serves purposes such as power generation irrigation fishing and touristic activities unlike some natural mediterranean lakes it features large fluctuations in the annual water level harmful algal blooms of toxic cyanobacteria species microcystis aeruginosa the most common toxic cyanobacteria worldwide and chrysosporum ovalisporum have occurred annually since 2009 fadel 2014 the seasonal trend of blue green algae reveals that m aeruginosa dominates mainly in the summer while c ovalisporum occurs in spring and autumn fadel and slim 2018 a combination of environmental factors controls the occurrence and succession of cyanobacterial blooms interplay between water temperature stratification irradiance nutrient availability and water level is believed to be responsible for changes in the phytoplankton community at karaoun reservoir fadel et al 2014b 2015 these cyanobacteria produce toxins which have been proven to cause mortalities in animals and human health injuries worldwide carmichael et al 2001 the reservoir has experienced a continuous rise in nutrient level due to regular polluting activities on the catchment of the upper litani river the main inflow to karaoun reservoir it is thus considered to be eutrophic to hypereutrophic with low phytoplankton biodiversity fadel et al 2016 karaoun reservoir represents an interesting study site as it belongs to the few regularly monitored lakes and reservoirs of the middle east region among numerous large reservoirs in syria iraq jordan etc 2 2 model description a coupled hydrodynamic ecological model glm aed was used to study the dynamics of karaoun reservoir the general lake model glm is an open access one dimensional physical driver model thus only capturing variations in the vertical domain hipsey et al 2013 glm describes the thermal structure and mixing dynamics of water bodies the model simulates vertical temperature profiles density and salinity at a single point in the lake depending on hydrological and meteorological data these computations provide predictions ranging from months to decades and thus allow the detection of thermal stratification and mixing patterns influences on ecosystem dynamics the aquatic ecodynamics aed is a water quality and ecosystem dynamics model linked to glm through the framework for aquatic biogeochemical models fabm an interface facilitating the coupling of an array of models aed simulates the interactions between nutrients organic matter phytoplankton and zooplankton it also enables the simulation of specific ecological components thus allowing specific phytoplankton groups to be configured 2 3 model forcing data initializing model simulation requires a set of input data these include meteorological and hydrological measurements as well as temperature profiles the latter were recorded at the deepest point in the reservoir located near the dam data required as initial conditions for day 1 of the simulation were retrieved from these observations and consisted of temperature and salinity profiles meteorological conditions fig 2 were observed at haouch ammiq meteorological station situated in the environment of karaoun reservoir these include hourly data for solar radiation cloud cover air temperature relative humidity wind speed as well as daily rainfall needed as daily averaged inputs inflow and outflow rates as well as water level variations required by the model were provided by the litani river authority for reservoir management 2 4 field observations field data of the vertical temperature profile and light intensity were measured hourly during the simulation period using a thermistors chain hobo pendant placed at three depths 0 5m 5 and 10m phycocyanin concentrations were measured using a field probe the microflu blue probe trios optical sensors making use of fluorescent excitation at three depths 0 5 5 and 10m it has an excitation peak at 620nm and reads the fluorescence emitted between 650 and 660nm it provides phycocyanin concentration with a putative measuring range is between 0 and 200μg l with an accuracy of 0 02μg l the probe has been used in several published studies in which the obtained phycocyanin concentrations correlated strongly against the number of cyanobacterial cells r 2 0 7296 brient et al 2008 and biovolumes r 2 0 73 bastien et al 2011a b major limitations of different probes used for phycocyanin estimation were recently covered by bertone et al 2018 to compare model outputs and measurements of cyanobacterial biomass phycocyanin were converted to chlorophyll a μg l using a conversion factor 2 5 model calibration the model was used to simulate water level temperature profiles and phytoplankton biomass within the phytoplankton module two cyanobacteria species were considered microcystis aeruginosa and chrysosporum ovalisporum and were subject to photoinhibition positive values of wphy were selected for both cyanobacteria species indicating constant buoyancy velocities table 2 due to the hypereutrophic status of karaoun reservoir we assume that cyanobacteria are not nutrient limited a period of 167 days ranging from 17 may till 31 october 2016 was regarded for simulation this period is marked by events of toxic cyanobacterial blooms large water level fluctuations and thermal stratification the model was calibrated with water temperature profiles and cyanobacterial biomass acquired at the time based on ranges reported in the literature model parameter calibration for both the hydrodynamic and water quality components was adjusted to find the best agreement between measured and modeled values of the stated variables the parameters of the hydrodynamic glm and biological model aed are presented in tables 1 and 2 model accuracy was evaluated by comparing the daily mean of simulated and measured variables throughout the simulation period using the mean absolute percentage error mape 2 6 climatic and hydrological scenarios to examine the sensitivity and the response of cyanobacteria under different hydrological and climatic conditions we proposed two scenarios a first scenario was tested under favorable conditions to cyanobacterial growth for which wind speed was reduced by 20 air temperature was increased by 10 and the outflow rate was neglected in contrast a second scenario was tested under unfavorable conditions for cyanobacterial growth and comprised raising the wind speed by 20 decreasing air temperature by 10 and setting the outflow rate to its maximum 3 results 3 1 water level fluctuations lake level fluctuated between 838 and 848m above sea level displaying an overall decreasing trend throughout the simulation period fig 3 a gradual decrease in the water level of about 10m was observed at the beginning of may 848m until the end of october 838m this decline results from regular withdrawals mainly for hydropower generation besides the river inflow occurs mainly in the wet season from october till april which makes the simulation period marked by a reduction in inflow volumes from the litani river such large water level fluctuations are typical for karaoun reservoir where annual variations could reach up to 30m alongside large decreases in the lake level especially during the dry season the water level was successfully simulated by the model over the simulation period with high accuracy good agreement was found between observed and simulated lake levels which implies that water fluxes are accurately balanced over the entire period the difference between measurements and simulations was of 0 16m with low values of mean absolute percent error 0 4 3 2 water temperature model was run from 17 may to 31 october 2016 a period that covers approximately 3 months of thermal stratification that weakens gradually at karaoun reservoir the best model results were obtained after applying the model parameters shown in table 3 fig 4 displays temperature simulation results and their corresponding measurements at 0 5 5 and 10m surface water temperature showed high variations in karaoun reservoir relatively at pronounced depths temperature fluctuations decreased differences between warmer surface water temperatures and bottom temperatures were evident indicating thermal stratification the water temperature reached a maximum of 28 c observed in the summer at the end of june and in august and a minimum of 16 c observed in may the model was able to replicate temperature profiles and capture the thermal structure evolution at karaoun reservoir in late spring thermal stratification was already established and strongly persisted till the end of august weak mixing occurred between may 20th and june 12th high wind speed 2m s was recorded at the time which may have interrupted the stratification stratification weakened at the end of august in autumn heating decreased and the water column becomes well mixed from top to bottom in september statistics of temperature time series comparisons are presented in table 3 results suggest that predicted water temperatures at 0 5 5m and 10m depths agree well with observations slight differences occurred for the overall simulation of the water column temperature errors mape occur by less than 8 between the simulated temperatures and the measurements results were found in agreement with the findings of fadel et al 2015 which showed that karaoun reservoir strongly stratified between may and august for the period of 2012 and 2013 it was also reported that thermal stratification was established in spring may however it diminished around the end of july 3 3 cyanobacterial biomass and succession the model simulated the biomasses of m aeruginosa and c ovalisporum reasonably well there was a reasonable correspondence between simulation results and field observations table 3 the model was able to capture cyanobacteria monthly dynamics and species succession fig 5 the simulated m aeruginosa biomass was comparable to the observed biomass at the three simulated depths 0 5 5 10m mape ranged between 21 at 0 5m and 30 at 10m depth for a ovalisporum the mean absolute percentage error mape was 18 at 0 5m 15 at 5m and 114 at 10m model predictions matched peaks of chlorophyll a concentrations however with a slight overestimation of the model in the exponential phase for both species the model also reflected the dominance by either m aeruginosa or c ovalisporum during the simulation period the highest values mostly occurred during the summer when cyanobacteria were the main contributors to phytoplankton biomass at karaoun reservoir 3 4 climate scenarios differences in thermal patterns and cyanobacterial biomass under favorable unfavorable conditions to cyanobacterial growth and original simulation conditions are shown in fig 6 under favorable conditions and in comparison with original model simulations averaged surface water temperature increased with higher air temperatures and was greater than bottom water temperature the duration of thermal stratification lengthened to cover the entire simulation period however with intermittent partial mixing at relatively low depths in september and early october it can be also noticed that the strength in thermal stratification increased in summer under the scenario with warmer water temperatures both c ovalisporum and m aeruginosa had higher biomasses and bloomed earlier largely m aeruginosa dominated c ovalisporum and its biomass was significantly greater both cyanobacteria did not exhibit any activity at 10m depth little wind mixing allowed for more cyanobacteria to float upwards and accumulate at the surface as dense blooms when the water column was stagnant such events occurring in response to a warmer period implies on what is expected to happen more frequently with future climatic warming the opposite was true for the unfavorable scenario with cooler air temperature surface water temperature decreased the increase in wind speed enhanced mixing and thus thermal stratification was quasi inexistent except for a short period in summer when both m aeruginosa and c ovalisporum bloomed very briefly and had their peaks this indicates that the mixing regime was sufficient to limit cyanobacterial buoyancy and distribute them evenly over the entire water column overall the period and severity of blooms were shortened and weakened respectively correspondingly to favorable conditions m aeruginosa outpaced c ovalisporum microcystis was able to maintain its biomass for a longer period from summer till autumn unlike chrysosporum which diminished in autumn 4 discussion 4 1 model performance and uncertainty in this study we used the glm fabm aed suite for modelling the hydrodynamics and water quality of karaoun reservoir in comparison with other one dimensional lake models the predictive ability of the present approach has not been exploited yet frequently the hydrodynamic component has been used for characterizing lake thermal dynamics read et al 2014 fenocchi et al 2017 together with assessing the effect of future climate warming on lakes rose et al 2016 and simulating ice dynamics yao et al 2014 examining the change effect in meteorological drivers on hypolimnetic anoxia in eutrophic lakes snortheim et al 2017 the biological component aed of the model was used to reproduce cyanobacterial dynamics in a few studies vinçon leite et al 2017 bucak et al 2018 however it was never used to reproduce the succession of cyanobacterial species in a reservoir with water level fluctuations thus this work is a first attempt at simulating the succession of two cyanobacterial species and their productivity using biological modules of the coupled glm aed model overall the model successfully reproduced water temperatures and water level at karaoun reservoir through most of the simulation minimal differences were recorded between the predicted and observed variables simulation of biological properties may be impacted by the selection of the hydrodynamic model ultimately physical processes play a major role in determining the distribution of biological components within a lake therefore understanding the physical dynamics that are driving cyanobacteria in a water body is of great concern in this work the success in simulating water temperatures and water level shows that the model can be used for simulating cyanobacterial biomass the ecological component could mostly reproduce the dynamics of cyanobacteria and represent their bloom peak successfully biomass for each species was reasonably well estimated despite relatively low correlations between observations and simulations for early cyanobacteria colonization simulation of cyanobacterial biomass was encountered with relatively considerable deviations between simulated and observed productivity at 3 depths with a lower correlation for the early colonization values of cyanobacteria nevertheless at depths 0 5m and 5m where for the majority of the biomass occurred errors were always less than 20 errors resulting from over and underestimation of water temperature may have resulted in these deviations of simulated cyanobacteria another reason for this uncertainty may arise from converting the observed data to chlorophyll concentrations derivation of parameter values for cyanobacteria simulation remains a problem relevant parameter specification did not characterize karaoun reservoir instead was based on literature ranges obtained from laboratory experiments or a variety of study sites 4 2 succession of cyanobacterial species in response to change in abiotic drivers many studies report that the rates of growth respiration and photosynthesis of phytoplankton are temperature dependent reynolds 1984 jones 1977 jewson 1976 cobelas and jacobsen 2010 harke et al 2016 cirés and ballot 2016 consistent with other studies blooms of cyanobacteria were formed when water temperature was above 20 c where optimal growth temperatures lay microcystis have been found to have an optimal growth temperature at or above 25 c davis et al 2009 chu et al 2007 which explains its absence before 25 06 at lower temperatures in contrast the optimal growth temperature for chrysosporum is between 15 and 28 c robarts and zohary 1987 moreover m aeruginosa has a higher growth rate than c ovalisporum that rises with increasing temperatures in a study aiming to investigate the effect of temperature on cyanobacteria in laboratory isolates konopka and brock 1978 found that below 20 c chrysosporum maintained higher growth and photosynthesis rates than microcystis they also stated that a reverse trend was observed when temperatures reached 30 c the growth of chrysosporum declined progressively onwards and stopped at 37 c in the time that microcystis was able to persist and grow this suggests that c ovalisporum can outgrow m aeruginosa at lower temperatures as observed at karaoun reservoir during spring and early summer thus microcycstis is more limited by low temperatures than chrysosporum further both cyanobacteria species had biomass peaks in summer during strong thermal stratification of the water column thermal stratification influences the dynamics of phytoplankton in lakes as buoyant species cyanobacteria benefit from such thermal conditions and take advantage of concurrent high temperatures as confirmed by other studies ochumba et al 1989 paerl et al 2011a b paerl 1988 however the fact that m aeruginosa was able to sustain its biomass in autumn during mixed and destratified conditions implies that water temperature is more likely to control cyanobacteria succession pattern than thermal stratification although water temperature may be the major factor determining the occurrence of specific cyanobacteria species interaction with other environmental factors cannot be excluded karaoun reservoir is considered hypereutrophic therefore nutrient limitation does not play a role in the succession of cyanobacteria fluctuations in reservoir water level can affect species composition and phytoplankton biomass wang et al 2011 mac donagh et al 2009 karaoun reservoir is distinguished from other natural lakes by its large fluctuations in water level where differences could reach up to 30m annually fadel et al 2015 due to extreme anthropogenic uses compared to natural lakes in which water level fluctuations can reach up to 1 5m such extreme drawdowns are not common and knowledge about how it may influence the water quality within artificial lakes is very limited in return these variations can have major impacts on the thermal structure of the water column they can as well cause extreme ecological responses such as shifts in the phytoplankton community structure and establishment of nuisance cyanobacteria it has been demonstrated that a decrease in the water level can be a driver for cyanobacterial blooms development in lakes zohary and ostrovsky 2011 bakker and hilt 2016 in karaoun reservoir shifts in the phytoplankton structure toward cyanobacteria may be driven by hydrological changes which are reflected in physical conditions including thermal stratification and mixing regime when thermal stratification is established vertical mixing is suppressed and the euphotic zone is often depleted from nutrients sufficient drawdown in water can disrupt thermal stratification a pattern that is observed from september onwards at karaoun reservoir fig 3 wind speed can be also an indicator of mixing and non stratified conditions during the entire survey period mean wind speed was 2m s and associated with both thermal stratification and destratification from september till october except between may 20th and june 12th where mean wind speed reached its maximum 2m s and suppressed thermal stratification this implies that the drop in water level is more likely to explain the breakdown in thermal stratification subsequently this will enhance mixing and entrain nutrient rich hypolimnetic waters into the illuminated surface of the water column after the breakup of thermal stratification at the end of summer huber et al 2012 showed that subsequent high nutrient concentrations favored cyanobacterial dominance in lake müggelsee germany hypolimnetic nutrient enrichment may explain the persistence of high biomass for microcystis from september till october during mixed conditions and favorable growth temperatures competition for light is another factor impacting phytoplankton community structure and competition in eutrophic waters primary producers compete for light rather than nutrients besides being able to sustain biomass under low light conditions cyanobacteria can survive intense light conditions at the water surface and escape photoinhibition the increase in light availability is associated with an increase in biomass which in turn reduces water transparency and increases light limitation microcystis can support higher light intensities than chrysosporum hence microcycstis might have a competitive advantage over chrysosporum especially during the high irradiance phase reported in october it can be also assumed that chrysosporum was subject to photoinhibition at the time which contributed to its complete displacement beside the abiotic drivers of microcystis and chrysosporum species the structure and the life cycle of these species plays an important role in their dominance throughout water bodies the spherical colonial structure of microcystis sp makes them less fragile than filamentous species especially to internal waves cuypers et al 2011 in addition nitrogen fixing species like chrysosporum are more vulnerable to autolysis phenomena by cyanophages than microcystis cairns et al 2016 waterbury and valois 1993 the disappearance of summer blooming microcystis colonies in autumn does not necessarily mean the end of their life cycle latour et al 2004 in winter the colonies of m aeruginosa remain on the sediment as vegetative viable cells to regain the water column in spring misson et al 2012 4 3 climatic and hydrological scenarios calibrated models can provide forecasts for different possible future scenarios and modeling allowing scientists to capture knowledge gaps bullerjahn et al 2016 in most aquatic systems water temperature is an essential parameter acting on the growth of biota regulating chemical reactions and overall affecting the functioning of lake ecosystems whitehead et al 2009 evidence of global warming has raised concerns and prompted evaluation of future increases in water temperature on water quality through numerical modelling kamatsu et al 2007 changes in surface water temperature are a potential environmental driver of cyanobacterial blooms paerl and paul 2012 paerl and huisman 2009 as predicted by the hydrodynamic model under a scenario with increased temperatures blooms of harmful cyanobacteria became more intense similar to the observations reported in this study increased water temperature alongside longer and stronger thermal stratification have been broadly shown to be a response of climatic warming jeppesen et al 2009 stainsby et al 2011 as demonstrated in this paper the duration of thermal stratification became longer and stronger during a scenario of higher temperature and no water withdrawal these scenarios were the ones showing the most extreme reduction of flows and higher temperatures indicating that low water levels combined with higher temperatures may pose a risk to the future water quality of mediterranean ecosystems bucak et al 2018 similar observations have been made in many studies showing that increased occurrences of harmful cyanobacteria blooms significantly impact ecosystem functioning qin et al 2010 paerl and paul 2012 indirect effects of elevated temperature like an earlier onset and longer duration of thermal stratification may also shift the competitive balance in favor of some phytoplankton groups on other ones visser et al 2016 karaoun reservoir has been subject to changes in its physical properties since 2009 revealing signs of climate change these include rising surface water temperatures changes in the stratification pattern reduction in inflows and an increasing trend in the average annual air temperature slim et al 2014 these alterations played a role in structuring its phytoplankton community where the extent and occurrence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms has been shown to be consistent with this state as stated in the above discussion the eco physiological characteristics of m aeruginosa enable it to thrive and defeat c ovalisporum under varying thermal conditions this was clearly noticeable during both scenarios the higher growth rate of m aeruginosa during favorable temperature and light conditions allow it to outgrow c ovalisporum fadel et al 2017 under expected prolonged thermal stratification m aeruginosa colonies will be promoted by enhancing their buoyancy and getting larger mantzouki et al 2016 5 conclusion this work evaluated the use of a one dimensional hydrodynamic ecological model to simulate water temperature water level and the biomass of two cyanobacteria species at karaoun reservoir from may till october 2016 this increased the understanding of cyanobacterial dynamics and the environmental factors controlling their development and succession model predictions were found in good agreement with field measurements the model could capture blooms timing and cyanobacterial succession bloom of c ovalisporum took place in late spring and early summer while m aeruginosa peaked in summer m aeruginosa persisted and had high biomass in autumn where it displaced c ovalisporum since cyanobacteria are associated with water supply problems the model used in this study is of great practical value for predicting the conditions that favor and control their occurrence karaoun reservoir has been and is still undergoing major anthropogenic alterations current and expected water uses call for regular monitoring the success of the model in simulating key ecological processes at karaoun reservoir suggests that a bloom forecast and an early warning system can be performed with confidence this will serve as a tool for tracking the evolution of the water quality of karaoun reservoir and for management strategies conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to

importance to manage bloom events and their consequences ecosystem models enable us to simulate analyze and understand ecological processes in complex aquatic ecosystems in this work we examined the ability of the general lake model aquatic ecodynamics glm aed an open access one dimensional hydrodynamic ecological model to simulate physical variables and the dynamics of two cyanobacterial species in 2016 the effect of possible hydrological and climatic scenarios on cyanobacterial blooms occurrence was also investigated results indicate that the model was able to accurately reproduce changes in water level mape of 0 4 water temperature profiles mape of 5 to 7 and the biomass of microcystis aeruginosa and chrysosporum aphanizomenon ovalisporum at the study area dramatic changes were observed under warming trends including increase in both the length of the stratification period and in cyanobacteria bloom dynamics data analysis revealed that while water temperature was the primary factor determining cyanobacterial succession and occurrence other factors such as water level fluctuations and irradiance are also important our findings suggest that any further increase in temperature would promote the development of potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms at karaoun reservoir the good performance of the model will provide essential insights required for deeper ecological understanding and water quality management keywords cyanobacteria modelling climate eutrophic lakes 1 introduction blooms of toxic cyanobacteria remain an environmental and public health concern in inland lakes and reservoirs the expansion of this event has increased in frequency and geographical distribution over the last decades favored by rising temperatures paerl and huisman 2008 land degradation and anthropogenic activities darwish and fadel 2017 cyanobacterial blooms were reported in several inland water bodies worldwide and are considered as a leading factor of water quality deterioration and impairment bresciani et al 2017 fastner et al 1999 sarazin et al 2002 negative impacts are characterized by bad odors and tastes reduction of water clarity oxygen depletion hypoxia or anoxia during bloom decay subsequent fish kills paerl and otten 2013 and changes in the composition and biodiversity of phytoplankton fadel et al 2014a b these effects are emphasized as several genera of cyanobacteria produce a variety of toxic compounds posing major risks to aquatic life and human health in contaminated waters used for recreational activities and drinking water production falconer 1998 this harmful aspect has drawn attention to a regular monitoring of water bodies through in situ campaigns and earth observation methods to understand the processes inducing blooms of these photosynthetic species consequently their development has been attributed to a variety of environmental drivers fadel 2014 te and gin 2011 havens et al 2003 the effect of water temperature and nutrient availability or eutrophication on the proliferation of cyanobacteria has been extensively investigated in recent years gągała et al 2010 grabowska 2012 water level fluctuations have been less considered on ecosystem alterations and biological effects water level fluctuations can occur naturally within a lake up to 1 5m annually most of the research was conducted on shallow lakes where fluctuations are more noticeable leira and cantonati 2008 however artificial lakes experience greater fluctuations of tens of meters for which effects on ecosystem functioning in general and cyanobacteria in particular have not been fairly studied knowledge about competition between different species and the environmental variables interactions that are regulating biological production is important to predict responses of freshwater biota spatially and temporally with the lack of comprehensive ecological and hydrodynamic behavior of lakes and reservoirs in response to external forcing predictive models have become more valuable bhagowati and ahamad 2018 in management aimed at monitoring predicting understanding and reducing the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms deterministic mathematical models have been applied to affected lakes wu and xu 2011 gal et al 2009 modelling has been recognized for explaining the causal factors or ecosystem processes involved in the development of phytoplankton blooms it provides a means to study the behavior of dynamically changing ecosystems and explore phytoplankton responses to a changing environment pinardi et al 2015 ecological models are able to predict cyanobacterial biomass and occurrence in relation to modifications in environmental variables such as nutrient concentrations and grazing pressure guven and howard 2006 this applies to total cyanobacterial occurrence or abundance and the occurrence of specific taxa gal et al 2009 a coupling with physical models will help establish a linkage between physical biological interactions which will yield a more comprehensive overview of causal mechanisms governing plankton dynamics researchers have been addressing the question of future climate change as a potential driver of the intensification of cyanobacterial blooms paerl and huisman 2009 o neil et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 thus these models can also serve as tools to test different scenario that include changes in climate and hydrological regimes a multitude of coupled one dimensional numerical models has been developed for water quality purposes compared to oceanographic studies these models have been seldom applied to lakes one reason arises from the complexity of freshwater ecosystems although a review by jørgensen 2010 highlights recent advances in lake modelling in which three dimensional models have been widely applied over other models the one dimensionality concept is assumed to restrict the ability to capture spatial heterogeneity within these systems however as franks 1995 stated the choice of the model should respond to the questions being asked aiming at exploring and understanding the dynamics controlling cyanobacterial blooms the dimensionality of a model should not matter as much as its ability to describe the dominant biological features within the ecosystem and forces acting on them in the present study we aim to examine environmental variables affecting the establishment and dynamics of cyanobacteria at karaoun reservoir lebanon a one dimensional modelling approach was used to simulate the hydrodynamics and the succession of two cyanobacterial species we report on model simulation results and apparent environmental factors promoting cyanobacterial blooms we also address the response of cyanobacteria under different climatic and hydrological scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site karaoun reservoir 33 34 n 35 41 e lebanon s largest freshwater body is a monomictic deep waterbody fig 1 it has a surface area of 12km2 at full capacity a maximum and a mean depth of 60 and 19m respectively karaoun reservoir serves purposes such as power generation irrigation fishing and touristic activities unlike some natural mediterranean lakes it features large fluctuations in the annual water level harmful algal blooms of toxic cyanobacteria species microcystis aeruginosa the most common toxic cyanobacteria worldwide and chrysosporum ovalisporum have occurred annually since 2009 fadel 2014 the seasonal trend of blue green algae reveals that m aeruginosa dominates mainly in the summer while c ovalisporum occurs in spring and autumn fadel and slim 2018 a combination of environmental factors controls the occurrence and succession of cyanobacterial blooms interplay between water temperature stratification irradiance nutrient availability and water level is believed to be responsible for changes in the phytoplankton community at karaoun reservoir fadel et al 2014b 2015 these cyanobacteria produce toxins which have been proven to cause mortalities in animals and human health injuries worldwide carmichael et al 2001 the reservoir has experienced a continuous rise in nutrient level due to regular polluting activities on the catchment of the upper litani river the main inflow to karaoun reservoir it is thus considered to be eutrophic to hypereutrophic with low phytoplankton biodiversity fadel et al 2016 karaoun reservoir represents an interesting study site as it belongs to the few regularly monitored lakes and reservoirs of the middle east region among numerous large reservoirs in syria iraq jordan etc 2 2 model description a coupled hydrodynamic ecological model glm aed was used to study the dynamics of karaoun reservoir the general lake model glm is an open access one dimensional physical driver model thus only capturing variations in the vertical domain hipsey et al 2013 glm describes the thermal structure and mixing dynamics of water bodies the model simulates vertical temperature profiles density and salinity at a single point in the lake depending on hydrological and meteorological data these computations provide predictions ranging from months to decades and thus allow the detection of thermal stratification and mixing patterns influences on ecosystem dynamics the aquatic ecodynamics aed is a water quality and ecosystem dynamics model linked to glm through the framework for aquatic biogeochemical models fabm an interface facilitating the coupling of an array of models aed simulates the interactions between nutrients organic matter phytoplankton and zooplankton it also enables the simulation of specific ecological components thus allowing specific phytoplankton groups to be configured 2 3 model forcing data initializing model simulation requires a set of input data these include meteorological and hydrological measurements as well as temperature profiles the latter were recorded at the deepest point in the reservoir located near the dam data required as initial conditions for day 1 of the simulation were retrieved from these observations and consisted of temperature and salinity profiles meteorological conditions fig 2 were observed at haouch ammiq meteorological station situated in the environment of karaoun reservoir these include hourly data for solar radiation cloud cover air temperature relative humidity wind speed as well as daily rainfall needed as daily averaged inputs inflow and outflow rates as well as water level variations required by the model were provided by the litani river authority for reservoir management 2 4 field observations field data of the vertical temperature profile and light intensity were measured hourly during the simulation period using a thermistors chain hobo pendant placed at three depths 0 5m 5 and 10m phycocyanin concentrations were measured using a field probe the microflu blue probe trios optical sensors making use of fluorescent excitation at three depths 0 5 5 and 10m it has an excitation peak at 620nm and reads the fluorescence emitted between 650 and 660nm it provides phycocyanin concentration with a putative measuring range is between 0 and 200μg l with an accuracy of 0 02μg l the probe has been used in several published studies in which the obtained phycocyanin concentrations correlated strongly against the number of cyanobacterial cells r 2 0 7296 brient et al 2008 and biovolumes r 2 0 73 bastien et al 2011a b major limitations of different probes used for phycocyanin estimation were recently covered by bertone et al 2018 to compare model outputs and measurements of cyanobacterial biomass phycocyanin were converted to chlorophyll a μg l using a conversion factor 2 5 model calibration the model was used to simulate water level temperature profiles and phytoplankton biomass within the phytoplankton module two cyanobacteria species were considered microcystis aeruginosa and chrysosporum ovalisporum and were subject to photoinhibition positive values of wphy were selected for both cyanobacteria species indicating constant buoyancy velocities table 2 due to the hypereutrophic status of karaoun reservoir we assume that cyanobacteria are not nutrient limited a period of 167 days ranging from 17 may till 31 october 2016 was regarded for simulation this period is marked by events of toxic cyanobacterial blooms large water level fluctuations and thermal stratification the model was calibrated with water temperature profiles and cyanobacterial biomass acquired at the time based on ranges reported in the literature model parameter calibration for both the hydrodynamic and water quality components was adjusted to find the best agreement between measured and modeled values of the stated variables the parameters of the hydrodynamic glm and biological model aed are presented in tables 1 and 2 model accuracy was evaluated by comparing the daily mean of simulated and measured variables throughout the simulation period using the mean absolute percentage error mape 2 6 climatic and hydrological scenarios to examine the sensitivity and the response of cyanobacteria under different hydrological and climatic conditions we proposed two scenarios a first scenario was tested under favorable conditions to cyanobacterial growth for which wind speed was reduced by 20 air temperature was increased by 10 and the outflow rate was neglected in contrast a second scenario was tested under unfavorable conditions for cyanobacterial growth and comprised raising the wind speed by 20 decreasing air temperature by 10 and setting the outflow rate to its maximum 3 results 3 1 water level fluctuations lake level fluctuated between 838 and 848m above sea level displaying an overall decreasing trend throughout the simulation period fig 3 a gradual decrease in the water level of about 10m was observed at the beginning of may 848m until the end of october 838m this decline results from regular withdrawals mainly for hydropower generation besides the river inflow occurs mainly in the wet season from october till april which makes the simulation period marked by a reduction in inflow volumes from the litani river such large water level fluctuations are typical for karaoun reservoir where annual variations could reach up to 30m alongside large decreases in the lake level especially during the dry season the water level was successfully simulated by the model over the simulation period with high accuracy good agreement was found between observed and simulated lake levels which implies that water fluxes are accurately balanced over the entire period the difference between measurements and simulations was of 0 16m with low values of mean absolute percent error 0 4 3 2 water temperature model was run from 17 may to 31 october 2016 a period that covers approximately 3 months of thermal stratification that weakens gradually at karaoun reservoir the best model results were obtained after applying the model parameters shown in table 3 fig 4 displays temperature simulation results and their corresponding measurements at 0 5 5 and 10m surface water temperature showed high variations in karaoun reservoir relatively at pronounced depths temperature fluctuations decreased differences between warmer surface water temperatures and bottom temperatures were evident indicating thermal stratification the water temperature reached a maximum of 28 c observed in the summer at the end of june and in august and a minimum of 16 c observed in may the model was able to replicate temperature profiles and capture the thermal structure evolution at karaoun reservoir in late spring thermal stratification was already established and strongly persisted till the end of august weak mixing occurred between may 20th and june 12th high wind speed 2m s was recorded at the time which may have interrupted the stratification stratification weakened at the end of august in autumn heating decreased and the water column becomes well mixed from top to bottom in september statistics of temperature time series comparisons are presented in table 3 results suggest that predicted water temperatures at 0 5 5m and 10m depths agree well with observations slight differences occurred for the overall simulation of the water column temperature errors mape occur by less than 8 between the simulated temperatures and the measurements results were found in agreement with the findings of fadel et al 2015 which showed that karaoun reservoir strongly stratified between may and august for the period of 2012 and 2013 it was also reported that thermal stratification was established in spring may however it diminished around the end of july 3 3 cyanobacterial biomass and succession the model simulated the biomasses of m aeruginosa and c ovalisporum reasonably well there was a reasonable correspondence between simulation results and field observations table 3 the model was able to capture cyanobacteria monthly dynamics and species succession fig 5 the simulated m aeruginosa biomass was comparable to the observed biomass at the three simulated depths 0 5 5 10m mape ranged between 21 at 0 5m and 30 at 10m depth for a ovalisporum the mean absolute percentage error mape was 18 at 0 5m 15 at 5m and 114 at 10m model predictions matched peaks of chlorophyll a concentrations however with a slight overestimation of the model in the exponential phase for both species the model also reflected the dominance by either m aeruginosa or c ovalisporum during the simulation period the highest values mostly occurred during the summer when cyanobacteria were the main contributors to phytoplankton biomass at karaoun reservoir 3 4 climate scenarios differences in thermal patterns and cyanobacterial biomass under favorable unfavorable conditions to cyanobacterial growth and original simulation conditions are shown in fig 6 under favorable conditions and in comparison with original model simulations averaged surface water temperature increased with higher air temperatures and was greater than bottom water temperature the duration of thermal stratification lengthened to cover the entire simulation period however with intermittent partial mixing at relatively low depths in september and early october it can be also noticed that the strength in thermal stratification increased in summer under the scenario with warmer water temperatures both c ovalisporum and m aeruginosa had higher biomasses and bloomed earlier largely m aeruginosa dominated c ovalisporum and its biomass was significantly greater both cyanobacteria did not exhibit any activity at 10m depth little wind mixing allowed for more cyanobacteria to float upwards and accumulate at the surface as dense blooms when the water column was stagnant such events occurring in response to a warmer period implies on what is expected to happen more frequently with future climatic warming the opposite was true for the unfavorable scenario with cooler air temperature surface water temperature decreased the increase in wind speed enhanced mixing and thus thermal stratification was quasi inexistent except for a short period in summer when both m aeruginosa and c ovalisporum bloomed very briefly and had their peaks this indicates that the mixing regime was sufficient to limit cyanobacterial buoyancy and distribute them evenly over the entire water column overall the period and severity of blooms were shortened and weakened respectively correspondingly to favorable conditions m aeruginosa outpaced c ovalisporum microcystis was able to maintain its biomass for a longer period from summer till autumn unlike chrysosporum which diminished in autumn 4 discussion 4 1 model performance and uncertainty in this study we used the glm fabm aed suite for modelling the hydrodynamics and water quality of karaoun reservoir in comparison with other one dimensional lake models the predictive ability of the present approach has not been exploited yet frequently the hydrodynamic component has been used for characterizing lake thermal dynamics read et al 2014 fenocchi et al 2017 together with assessing the effect of future climate warming on lakes rose et al 2016 and simulating ice dynamics yao et al 2014 examining the change effect in meteorological drivers on hypolimnetic anoxia in eutrophic lakes snortheim et al 2017 the biological component aed of the model was used to reproduce cyanobacterial dynamics in a few studies vinçon leite et al 2017 bucak et al 2018 however it was never used to reproduce the succession of cyanobacterial species in a reservoir with water level fluctuations thus this work is a first attempt at simulating the succession of two cyanobacterial species and their productivity using biological modules of the coupled glm aed model overall the model successfully reproduced water temperatures and water level at karaoun reservoir through most of the simulation minimal differences were recorded between the predicted and observed variables simulation of biological properties may be impacted by the selection of the hydrodynamic model ultimately physical processes play a major role in determining the distribution of biological components within a lake therefore understanding the physical dynamics that are driving cyanobacteria in a water body is of great concern in this work the success in simulating water temperatures and water level shows that the model can be used for simulating cyanobacterial biomass the ecological component could mostly reproduce the dynamics of cyanobacteria and represent their bloom peak successfully biomass for each species was reasonably well estimated despite relatively low correlations between observations and simulations for early cyanobacteria colonization simulation of cyanobacterial biomass was encountered with relatively considerable deviations between simulated and observed productivity at 3 depths with a lower correlation for the early colonization values of cyanobacteria nevertheless at depths 0 5m and 5m where for the majority of the biomass occurred errors were always less than 20 errors resulting from over and underestimation of water temperature may have resulted in these deviations of simulated cyanobacteria another reason for this uncertainty may arise from converting the observed data to chlorophyll concentrations derivation of parameter values for cyanobacteria simulation remains a problem relevant parameter specification did not characterize karaoun reservoir instead was based on literature ranges obtained from laboratory experiments or a variety of study sites 4 2 succession of cyanobacterial species in response to change in abiotic drivers many studies report that the rates of growth respiration and photosynthesis of phytoplankton are temperature dependent reynolds 1984 jones 1977 jewson 1976 cobelas and jacobsen 2010 harke et al 2016 cirés and ballot 2016 consistent with other studies blooms of cyanobacteria were formed when water temperature was above 20 c where optimal growth temperatures lay microcystis have been found to have an optimal growth temperature at or above 25 c davis et al 2009 chu et al 2007 which explains its absence before 25 06 at lower temperatures in contrast the optimal growth temperature for chrysosporum is between 15 and 28 c robarts and zohary 1987 moreover m aeruginosa has a higher growth rate than c ovalisporum that rises with increasing temperatures in a study aiming to investigate the effect of temperature on cyanobacteria in laboratory isolates konopka and brock 1978 found that below 20 c chrysosporum maintained higher growth and photosynthesis rates than microcystis they also stated that a reverse trend was observed when temperatures reached 30 c the growth of chrysosporum declined progressively onwards and stopped at 37 c in the time that microcystis was able to persist and grow this suggests that c ovalisporum can outgrow m aeruginosa at lower temperatures as observed at karaoun reservoir during spring and early summer thus microcycstis is more limited by low temperatures than chrysosporum further both cyanobacteria species had biomass peaks in summer during strong thermal stratification of the water column thermal stratification influences the dynamics of phytoplankton in lakes as buoyant species cyanobacteria benefit from such thermal conditions and take advantage of concurrent high temperatures as confirmed by other studies ochumba et al 1989 paerl et al 2011a b paerl 1988 however the fact that m aeruginosa was able to sustain its biomass in autumn during mixed and destratified conditions implies that water temperature is more likely to control cyanobacteria succession pattern than thermal stratification although water temperature may be the major factor determining the occurrence of specific cyanobacteria species interaction with other environmental factors cannot be excluded karaoun reservoir is considered hypereutrophic therefore nutrient limitation does not play a role in the succession of cyanobacteria fluctuations in reservoir water level can affect species composition and phytoplankton biomass wang et al 2011 mac donagh et al 2009 karaoun reservoir is distinguished from other natural lakes by its large fluctuations in water level where differences could reach up to 30m annually fadel et al 2015 due to extreme anthropogenic uses compared to natural lakes in which water level fluctuations can reach up to 1 5m such extreme drawdowns are not common and knowledge about how it may influence the water quality within artificial lakes is very limited in return these variations can have major impacts on the thermal structure of the water column they can as well cause extreme ecological responses such as shifts in the phytoplankton community structure and establishment of nuisance cyanobacteria it has been demonstrated that a decrease in the water level can be a driver for cyanobacterial blooms development in lakes zohary and ostrovsky 2011 bakker and hilt 2016 in karaoun reservoir shifts in the phytoplankton structure toward cyanobacteria may be driven by hydrological changes which are reflected in physical conditions including thermal stratification and mixing regime when thermal stratification is established vertical mixing is suppressed and the euphotic zone is often depleted from nutrients sufficient drawdown in water can disrupt thermal stratification a pattern that is observed from september onwards at karaoun reservoir fig 3 wind speed can be also an indicator of mixing and non stratified conditions during the entire survey period mean wind speed was 2m s and associated with both thermal stratification and destratification from september till october except between may 20th and june 12th where mean wind speed reached its maximum 2m s and suppressed thermal stratification this implies that the drop in water level is more likely to explain the breakdown in thermal stratification subsequently this will enhance mixing and entrain nutrient rich hypolimnetic waters into the illuminated surface of the water column after the breakup of thermal stratification at the end of summer huber et al 2012 showed that subsequent high nutrient concentrations favored cyanobacterial dominance in lake müggelsee germany hypolimnetic nutrient enrichment may explain the persistence of high biomass for microcystis from september till october during mixed conditions and favorable growth temperatures competition for light is another factor impacting phytoplankton community structure and competition in eutrophic waters primary producers compete for light rather than nutrients besides being able to sustain biomass under low light conditions cyanobacteria can survive intense light conditions at the water surface and escape photoinhibition the increase in light availability is associated with an increase in biomass which in turn reduces water transparency and increases light limitation microcystis can support higher light intensities than chrysosporum hence microcycstis might have a competitive advantage over chrysosporum especially during the high irradiance phase reported in october it can be also assumed that chrysosporum was subject to photoinhibition at the time which contributed to its complete displacement beside the abiotic drivers of microcystis and chrysosporum species the structure and the life cycle of these species plays an important role in their dominance throughout water bodies the spherical colonial structure of microcystis sp makes them less fragile than filamentous species especially to internal waves cuypers et al 2011 in addition nitrogen fixing species like chrysosporum are more vulnerable to autolysis phenomena by cyanophages than microcystis cairns et al 2016 waterbury and valois 1993 the disappearance of summer blooming microcystis colonies in autumn does not necessarily mean the end of their life cycle latour et al 2004 in winter the colonies of m aeruginosa remain on the sediment as vegetative viable cells to regain the water column in spring misson et al 2012 4 3 climatic and hydrological scenarios calibrated models can provide forecasts for different possible future scenarios and modeling allowing scientists to capture knowledge gaps bullerjahn et al 2016 in most aquatic systems water temperature is an essential parameter acting on the growth of biota regulating chemical reactions and overall affecting the functioning of lake ecosystems whitehead et al 2009 evidence of global warming has raised concerns and prompted evaluation of future increases in water temperature on water quality through numerical modelling kamatsu et al 2007 changes in surface water temperature are a potential environmental driver of cyanobacterial blooms paerl and paul 2012 paerl and huisman 2009 as predicted by the hydrodynamic model under a scenario with increased temperatures blooms of harmful cyanobacteria became more intense similar to the observations reported in this study increased water temperature alongside longer and stronger thermal stratification have been broadly shown to be a response of climatic warming jeppesen et al 2009 stainsby et al 2011 as demonstrated in this paper the duration of thermal stratification became longer and stronger during a scenario of higher temperature and no water withdrawal these scenarios were the ones showing the most extreme reduction of flows and higher temperatures indicating that low water levels combined with higher temperatures may pose a risk to the future water quality of mediterranean ecosystems bucak et al 2018 similar observations have been made in many studies showing that increased occurrences of harmful cyanobacteria blooms significantly impact ecosystem functioning qin et al 2010 paerl and paul 2012 indirect effects of elevated temperature like an earlier onset and longer duration of thermal stratification may also shift the competitive balance in favor of some phytoplankton groups on other ones visser et al 2016 karaoun reservoir has been subject to changes in its physical properties since 2009 revealing signs of climate change these include rising surface water temperatures changes in the stratification pattern reduction in inflows and an increasing trend in the average annual air temperature slim et al 2014 these alterations played a role in structuring its phytoplankton community where the extent and occurrence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms has been shown to be consistent with this state as stated in the above discussion the eco physiological characteristics of m aeruginosa enable it to thrive and defeat c ovalisporum under varying thermal conditions this was clearly noticeable during both scenarios the higher growth rate of m aeruginosa during favorable temperature and light conditions allow it to outgrow c ovalisporum fadel et al 2017 under expected prolonged thermal stratification m aeruginosa colonies will be promoted by enhancing their buoyancy and getting larger mantzouki et al 2016 5 conclusion this work evaluated the use of a one dimensional hydrodynamic ecological model to simulate water temperature water level and the biomass of two cyanobacteria species at karaoun reservoir from may till october 2016 this increased the understanding of cyanobacterial dynamics and the environmental factors controlling their development and succession model predictions were found in good agreement with field measurements the model could capture blooms timing and cyanobacterial succession bloom of c ovalisporum took place in late spring and early summer while m aeruginosa peaked in summer m aeruginosa persisted and had high biomass in autumn where it displaced c ovalisporum since cyanobacteria are associated with water supply problems the model used in this study is of great practical value for predicting the conditions that favor and control their occurrence karaoun reservoir has been and is still undergoing major anthropogenic alterations current and expected water uses call for regular monitoring the success of the model in simulating key ecological processes at karaoun reservoir suggests that a bloom forecast and an early warning system can be performed with confidence this will serve as a tool for tracking the evolution of the water quality of karaoun reservoir and for management strategies conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to
