3645,sustainable agricultural development covers all aspects of agricultural production involving the water food energy nexus wfen and considers the effects of agricultural activities on society economy and ecology multi objective optimization models play an important role in making tradeoff among multiple interests of stakeholders aimed at canal based irrigated agricultural areas water allocation highly depends on canal distribution and the spatial location of irrigation regions determines their water intake order which usually induces serious water allocation inequality the social economic and ecological problems resulting from water inequality would deteriorate without intervention and seriously impact sustainable development thus optimization models must consider water use equity water intake order as well as water equilibrium simultaneously however this will greatly increase computational efforts and solution difficulty the problem becomes worse when uncertain factors are involved in order to overcome these difficulties a distributed multi objective uncertain optimization model was established to help develop comprehensive strategies for agricultural sustainability a novel robust solution method was proposed to offer an efficient way to handle stochastic and fuzzy uncertainties from the perspective of feasibility and optimality robustness finally a case study was conducted to demonstrate the practical application of the developed model the results offer managers insights on agricultural sustainable development keywords sustainable agricultural development robust programming water food energy nexus canal based spatial connection multiple objectives multiple uncertainties 1 introduction resource supply is experiencing increasing pressure due to the combined actions of climate change rapid population growth serious contamination and so on bieber et al 2018 with the progress of knowledge and technology a perspective of sustainable development has evolved pope et al 2004 the focus of development is more than benefits but also includes meeting the needs of environment society and economy hjorth and bagheri 2006 as the most basic human requirements and essential for human development water energy and food are the core of major challenges faced by human society according to the united nations sustainable development goals un sdgs the united nations 2015 in order to tackle these challenges the water food energy nexus wfen is promoted as a conceptual tool for achieving sustainable development and extensive research has been carried out around it cai et al 2018 al saidi and elagib 2017 kurian 2017 endo et al 2017 under the context of population growth irrigated agriculture plays a crucial role in worldwide food security and socio economic welfare and is the largest exploiter of freshwater according to fao food and agriculture organizations 2012 agricultural production also consumes large amounts of water and energy resources while emitting greenhouse gases and other substances increasing pressure on resource scarcity and environmental burden resulting from intensive agricultural activities may undermine resilience of the ecosystem hamper economic growth and limit human well being de vito et al 2017 therefore necessary actions must be taken around the wfen to balance food security and resources consumption make tradeoffs among society economy and environment and realize sustainable development of irrigated agriculture the agricultural system is a compound and complicated system which consists of not only natural elements e g hydrology meteorology soil plants etc but also human factors for example irrigation practices are the result of the combination of multiple factors varying from the behavior of different actors e g farmers water management authorities etc to several interactions between biophysical e g water availability and variability crop water demand etc and socio economic factors e g market conditions energy accessibility policy etc giordano et al 2017 the adoption of wfen can capture the nature of irrigation practices to describe costs and benefits as well as side products e g co2 etc of the system avellán et al 2018 however the spatial distribution of water use sectors is inevitable when making irrigation decisions particularly for canal based irrigation regions guo et al 2018b the location of water use sectors along with the canal decides their water intake order and influences their water accessibility and water efficiency which would have further influence on wfen meanwhile when water supply is insufficient water competition would urge water users close to river intakes to ignore water demand of those at the end of canal and cause water allocation inequality which is harmful to social stability and should be coped with d exelle et al 2012 van campenhout et al 2015 however few studies have been done on distributed optimization models considering water allocation equity and efficiency under the wfen framework since various factors are considered around economy society and ecology goal conflicts would appear when making sustainable decisions marques et al 2015 to this end multi objective optimization is a good way to tackle conflicts from different groups of decision makers and develop tradeoff strategies asadi et al 2012 groot et al 2012 falke et al 2016 li et al 2019c meanwhile uncertainty exists widely due to incomplete information personal perception statistical errors and so on li et al 2020 generally stochastic programming fuzzy programming and interval programming are recognized popular uncertainty programming methods in order to handle probability possibility and gray uncertainties respectively li et al 2019b zhou et al 2013 inuiguchi and ramík 2000 dong et al 2012 actually there are usually multiple uncertainties coexisting in a real world realm and integrated methods have been developed based on the combination of the aforementioned basic uncertain programming methods cai et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 wu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 the principle is to divide multiple uncertainties and solve them separately although it works for dealing with multiple uncertainties the main drawback is the complexity of the integrated method the other kind of research focuses the risk derived by uncertainties rather than uncertainty itself and proposes robust optimization to tackle uncertainty which has become popular due to its ability to provide powerful risk averse strategies robust programming is based on optimality and feasibility robustness and can also be divided into three categories robust stochastic programming mulvey et al 1995a leung et al 2007 robust convex programming ben tal and nemirovski 1998 and robust possibilistic programming pishvaee et al 2012a in spite of aiming at different kinds of uncertainties these three robust programming methods share similar theory and framework the combination of robust programming to solve multiple uncertainties is a theoretically convenient approach and is worth exploring furthermore few studies have been conducted on robust programming with multiple objectives and uncertainties therefore this study will be implemented from two aspects of application and programming methods in order to realize sustainable development of agriculture wfen and canal distribution will be combined to depict irrigated agricultural systems and meet the demand of society economy and environment a distributed multi objective optimization model will be established aimed at multiple objectives and uncertainties in the real world integrated robust programming is pursued based on previous studies and risk averse decisions will be made considering the robustness of optimality of objectives and feasibility of constraints finally a case study will be conducted to show the application of the developed method 2 study area the middle reach of the heihe river basin 98 101 30 e 38 42 n was selected as a real case representation of canal based irrigation regions to depict the problem we try to solve the heihe river basin is the second largest inland valley in the arid region of northwestern china the middle reach region is defined as the area between yingluo gorge and zhengyi gorge as shown in fig 1 covering ganzhou gz linze lz and gaotai gt three administrative districts ads of zhangye city it has high evaporation around 1410 mm year and low precipitation around 140 mm year the heihe river the liyuanhe river and other small branches are the main water sources more than 90 of surface water is consumed by the middle oasis and contributes approximately 90 of agricultural production value of the whole basin liu et al 2018 three gauging stations were constructed to monitor water information of the middle reach including yingluo gaoai and zhengyi stations there is a reservoir in zhengyi gorge with hydropower ability of 0 8 million watt guaranteed output and 6 million watt installed capacity as the biggest water consumption section agricultural irrigation uses approximately 90 of the total water consumption li et al 2019b zhangye city has a complete canal system and a long history of canal irrigation guo et al 2018a the canal network forms the water delivery bond between the river and farmland in this study 20 irrigation districts ids of gz lz and gt located along the heihe and liyuanhe rivers are selected to be the study area for the agricultural development of these ids accounts for more than 90 of total cultivation area in the middle reach and their water intake has close spatial connection according to the spatial information of the canal system and ids along the heihe river and liyuanhe river shown in fig 1 a simplified diagram can be extracted which is shown in fig 2 according to the hierarchical relationship of the canals three classes can be identified including the primary canal pc middle canal mc and upper canal uc primary canals deliver water into fields and upper canals are used to get water from the river and transfer water to lower class canals middle canals are a linkage of primary canals and upper canals upper class canals may connect several lower class canals the irrigated area controlled by primary canals is called the irrigation region ir which is the decision unit of this study an id consists of several irs and an ad is composed of several ids taking crop coverage in 2016 shown in fig 1 as an example the main irrigated vegetation extracted includes crops represented by spring wheat wt field maize fm seed maize sm and vegetables vg as well as some ecological vegetation like grass and forest gf that needs to be irrigated the attributes of the upper and middle canals in the canal network are shown in table 1 the attributes of the primary canals and their hierarchical relationship are shown in table 2 along with the main crop area controlled by canals 3 methodology 3 1 problem overview water food and energy are basic factors of agricultural production activities surface water and underground water are the most important sources of irrigation water which could be used to produce food and maintain ecological vegetation electricity and fossil fuel are the main energy sources of pumped irrigation water saving irrigation practice and crop harvest processing and transportation the agricultural production and the growth of irrigated ecological vegetation consume water and energy resources driving the movement and transformation of water and energy water is most important element of plant growth while energy is the main power of agricultural activities the irrigation makes electric and fossil energy into kinetic energy of water meanwhile hydropower stations realize the energy transformation from kinetic energy of river into electric energy the water cycle as well as energy consumption and regeneration are closely connective with crop production which are essential parts of the wfen the water and energy flow shown in fig 3 describes most of the common situations in hydrological cycle and energy usage of agricultural activities while the optimization models would be different according to the reality according to the analysis on the water and energy flow the water cycle is the key factor of the wfen compared with energy thus water allocation should be chosen as the basic decision variable of the optimization problem based on the water movement the associated energy flow can be derived the wfen is associated with many aspects of agricultural sustainability however sustainability in agriculture is a complex concept and there is no common viewpoint among scholars about its dimensions thus how to quantify agricultural sustainability based on the wfen would be the first obstacle of the optimization problem according to the efforts of previous studies hayati et al 2010 gómez limón and sanchez fernandez 2010 several representative indicators are selected from different views of society economy and ecology based on the major concerns of decision makers and the convenience of data acquisition the benefits of food water fees and energy fees electricity and fossil fuel fee promote the development of the economy water and food security are key to social stability and sustainability the harmful substances emitted during energy consumption threaten the environment and the scarcity of irrigation water for ecological vegetation and services would hinder ecological health as the canal system is the main support of water conveyance its spatial attributes influence water use efficiency and intake order of water use sectors how to utilize spatial information and depict necessary hydrological processes under complex agricultural water system would be the second challenge considering the widespread uncertainty in the real world how to tackle it under the context of a complex problem requires additional efforts surrounded by these challenges a distributed robust optimization model framework was proposed as shown in fig 3 3 2 objectives since canal systems are the linkage between the river and fields the irrigated region controlled by primary canals i e the ir is considered as a decision making unit in this study the decision variables are surface and underground water allocated to crops and ecological vegetation by the end of primary canals during crop growth period according to the water cycle in fig 3 four water balance processes should be focused including soil water balance canal water balance groundwater balance and river water balance soil water balance describes the available water change for plants canal water balance depicts the surface water change from water intake point of river to the end of the primary canals groundwater balance shows the change of groundwater level and river water balance exhibits the water change from the entrance to the exit of the study area the selected objectives of the proposed model are net benefits of agricultural production total water consumption total co2 emission matching coefficient of water and land resources and ecological system service value the objectives and constraints can be described as follows and definitions of symbols are shown in table 3 1 net benefits of agricultural production the agricultural production here is designated as the crop production in the study area the net benefits of agricultural systems consist of income from crops and cost of agricultural activities during cultivation and harvest including water fees from irrigation electricity and fossil fuel fees for groundwater pumping primary food processing and transportation it is assumed that the electricity generated by the hydropower station is used to supplement power consumption of agriculture in a fixed proportion 1 n et b e n e f i t s h i 1 m j 1 n cpric e j y i e l d ijh a r e a ij s w p r i c e i s w c ih g w p r

study was estimated as cseepage 0 24 s w c 1 8 l c i 0 66 l n i 23 19 for all canals in the study area according to the simulation results of zhang et al zhang et al 2019 the canal water balance equation depends on the hierarchy and branch number the water extracted from water intake point of river is the sum of surface water at the end of primary canals and all seepage loss of main and branch canals the total surface water usage should consider all the surface water at the end of primary canals and the seepage of all classes of canals 11 w c h w c s h w c g h i 1 m s w c ih c s e e

china s agricultural industry are growing rapidly which has gained great attention recently lin and xu 2018 as an agriculture oriented area the middle reach of the heihe river basin also faces this problem hence co2 emission is selected as a representative greenhouse and is included as an environmental factor for sustainable development the total co2 emission in this study covers the co2 emission from electricity and fossil fuel consumption during crop production 12 c e h i 1 m j 1 n percoe e l e c t r i c ijh p e r c o f f o s s i l ijh d e n s f 4 gini coefficient for the matching coefficient of water and land resources gini coefficient has been proven to be an effective quantitative approach to measure inequality in water allocation cullis and van koppen 2009 gunasekara et al 2014 hu et al 2016 the matching coefficient of allocated water resources and land resources denotes the allocated water by the end of canals to unit cultivated area which is a good way to measure the water allocation equity in spatial scale the matching coefficient of water and land resources in agriculture can reflect the balance condition and satisfaction degree of the allocated water and associated cultivated land resources in spatial scale even geographic distribution of water and land resources helps equitable agricultural development du et al 2019 in addition the gini coefficient of the ratio of water supply and demand or the per capita water allocated can also be used as indicators of equality li et al 2019a 13 gin i h i 1 m i 1 m matc h ih m a t c h i h 2 m i 1 m matc h ih

the esv of different types of vegetation in currency costanza et al 1997 francesco and antonio 2011 lv et al 2018 it cannot be treated as economic net benefits directly since adoption of different measurement principles and standards will lead to quite different results in practice there are many types of plants intermingled with one another in a region making it hard to value the esv based on the reference value proposed by previous studies besides the growth condition of plants also affects their esv especially for arid and semi arid area in order to solve these challenges the long term remote sensing data of net primary production can be used to calculate the potential esv of study area with the help of measured data yu et al 2009 yu et al 2011 in order to reflect the relationship of the actual esv and the actual evapotranspiration a corrective reference esv method is used to quantify the relationship between water consumption and esv of ecological vegetation 14 es v h i 1 m et

constraints of decision variables are default the definitions of symbols are shown in table 3 1 food security food security is an important indicator of social sustainability the meaning of food security varies with the actual situation of study area in this study whether the food crop yield can feed the local rural population is measured as an indicator of food security while for some

becomes important especially under multiple uncertainties in this study an integrated robust method is proposed to solve the randomness and fuzziness simultaneously the developed method combines the robust stochastic programming mulvey et al 1995b yu and li 2000 for randomness robust possibilistic programming pishvaee and fazli khalaf 2016 pishvaee and torabi 2010 for fuzziness and multi objective programming in order to make the improvement process clear the two robust methods will be introduced first as background knowledge then an integrated method which can deal with randomness and fuzziness with one objective is proposed finally the robust stochastic possibilistic multi objective programming method is introduced 1 robust stochastic programming yu and li 2000 a solution is said to be robust if it has both feasibility and optimality robustness feasibility robustness quantifies the ability of the solution to maintain feasibility under all uncertain circumstances measured by feasibility degree optimality robustness describes the ability of the solution to remain close to the optimal value under all conditions measured by optimality degree based on the concept of robustness the robust scenario based stochastic programming can be depicted in the following model the feature of the programming is to replace a random event with continuous probabilistic distribution by discrete random scenarios with associated probabilities 34 min f h 1 h p h c h x h λ h 1 h p h c h x h h 1 h p h c h x h h 1 h p h j 1 j ω hj δ hj s t b h x h δ h e h h 1 h x h δ h 0 h 1 h where h denotes the discrete scenario from a random event ph is associated probability of random scenario xh is decision variable under the hth scenario ch and eh are parameters of objective and constraints related with random events b are associated parameters of constraints δh is a slack variable denoting the deviation for violations of the control constraints representing the feasibility degree of the control constraints the second part of the objective i e h 1 h p h c h x h h 1 h p h c h x h quantifies the deviation between the results of scenarios and that of the expected value describing the optimality robustness the third part of the objective i e h 1 h p h j 1 j δ hj represents the overall feasibility degree covering all feasibility degrees of the control constraints λ and ωhj are weighed coefficients to recognize the importance degree of optimality and feasibility robustness of the optimization model which are usually assigned by decision makers 2 robust possibilistic programming robust possibilistic programming is a form of fuzzy mathematical programming which deals with imprecise input parameters or lack of knowledge about the exact values of parameters expressed as fuzzy numbers mula et al 2006 the conventional fuzzy optimization model with fuzzy numbers can be expressed as 35 min f c x s t a x d x 0 where c and d are fuzzy numbers the membership function is assumed to be triangular and they can be represented by their three prominent points i e c c p c m c o and d d p d m d o according to the previous studies pishvaee et al 2012b pishvaee and fazli khalaf 2016 the robust possibilistic programming can be formulated as follows the programming can use confidence levels to reflect different kinds of attitudes of decision makers to the constraints with fuzziness and show a compromised attitude 36 min f e c x α c o x e c x β ρ d m d p 2 1 ρ d m d o 2 d p s t a x ρ d m d p 2 1 ρ d m d o 2 x 0 where e denotes expected value of fuzzy number ρ is confidence level with 0 5 ρ 1 α and β are weighed parameters which determine significance of this term against the other terms the second part of the objective quantifies optimality robustness since ax d p is the worst case that could happen the third part measures the feasibility robustness of soft constraints 3 a modified robust stochastic possibilistic programming for one objective models it can be seen that the robust stochastic programming and possibilistic programming have something essential in common the deviation from the expected value indicates optimality robustness and the feasibility robustness can be measured as the violation degree of the most conservative constraints however one of the drawbacks is the absolute operator in stochastic programming in order to get rid of the absolute value sign a modified robust stochastic possibilistic programming for hybrid uncertainty can be generated combining robust stochastic possibilistic programming dehghan et al 2019 and a solution method for goal optimization programming with absolute operator li 1996 37 min f h 1 h p h e c h x h λ h 1 h p h e c h x h h 1 h p h e c h x h 2 θ h α h 1 h p h c h o

variable to transfer the objective function with absolute operator in model 34 into a linear function with the help of constraints 38 4 an integrated robust stochastic possibilistic multi objective programming although the modified model can solve the robust stochastic possibilistic programming problem some weaknesses remain one is how to determine the weighted coefficients the coefficients determined by some decision makers possess strong subjectivity while different kinds of stakeholders may have different preferences for the same coefficients meanwhile multiple objectives may exist in a practical optimization problem in order to reduce the difficulty of setting weighting parameters as well as balance multiple stakeholders a robust stochastic possibilistic multi objective programming rspmop is developed from the expressions of the above three models the structure of the objective can be divided into three parts the first part is the expected objective value the second one denotes the optimality degree and the feasibility degree is the third one thus three categories of objectives can be identified the first group of objectives are expected value and optimality robustness of various goals the second group are feasibility robustness of random control constraints the third group are feasibility robustness of the fuzzy constraints the model can be shown as follows 42 min f 1 i h 1 h p h e c hi x hi λ i h 1 h p h e c hi x hi h 1 h p h e c hi x hi 2 θ hi α i h 1 h p h c hi o x hi e c hi x hi i 1 i 43 min f 2 j h 1 h p h δ hj j 1 j 44 min f 3 k h 1 h p h ρ

h k 1 k 48 x θ h δ hj 0 49 0 5 ρ 1 as the modified model has shown the weighting coefficients of feasibility robustness for randomness and fuzziness disappear meanwhile the weighting coefficients of multiple objectives are also avoided fuzzy goal programming is combined to help solve the model developed zimmermann 1978 yu et al 2012 the solution algorithm can be depicted as step 1 solve the problem using single objective programming for all objective functions for each objective function find the upper and lower bound l u step 2 assume objective function follows triangular membership distribution between upper and lower bounds then membership function for each objective can be expressed as μ f x 1 f x l u f x u l l f x u 0 f x u the rspmop can be converted into 50 max min μ f 1 i

possesses obvious randomness five hydrological levels were divided according to the record of runoff through yingluo gorge 1944 2013 the runoff of liyuanhe river and water discharge from zhengyi gorge were analyzed based on statistical data in five representative hydrological years and are shown in table 4 groundwater exploitation is determined by local policy the practical water demand as well as the groundwater reserve in the aquifers the groundwater availability in table 4 is based on the historical data of the groundwater exploitation of irrigation regions in different hydrological years since groundwater exploitation is influenced by subjective judgement of managers and farmers fuzzy numbers were used to express groundwater availability due to low precipitation in the study area the rainfall into river and canals can be neglected due to their little spatial area and the joint probability between runoff and precipitation can also be ignored due to the low groundwater level the shallow groundwater evaporation into fields was neglected average annual precipitation during the growth period was adopted and groundwater recharge by precipitation can also be ignored the fluctuation of crop price is determined by the market and therefore hard to quantify by any certain probabilistic distribution according to the accessibility of statistical information the price of crops electricity and fossil fuel were considered as fuzzy numbers as seen in table 5 the co2 emitted during electricity and fossil fuel consumption referenced to the local reports and investigation which were also expressed as fuzzy numbers i e percoe 0 8 0 85 1 1 kg co2 kwh and percof 2 17 2 73 3 7 kg co2 kg the price of irrigation water is determined by local policy as shown in table 6 due to the excessive exploitation of groundwater the groundwater depth becomes higher and the local ecological vegetation and biodiversity meet dire threat liu et al 2018 the allowable decline depth of groundwater level during irrigation is calculated based on the groundwater restrained exploitation and the aquifer area from the work of liu et al liu et al 2018 local policy and groundwater reports as well as the specific yield of the aquifer li et al 2019a as shown in table 7 other data can be found in local statistical yearbooks management yearbooks and so on the crop evapotranspiration data were calculated from meteorological data according to the fao 56 penman monteith method li et al 2019a and are shown in table 8 the randomness of water resources is the key factor to restrict local agricultural development and determines agricultural sustainability as a key irrigation water source surface water availability affects water allocation and groundwater exploitation therefore the constraints of surface water resources availability under different hydrological levels are selected as random control constraints in robust stochastic programming although the consumption of energy resources varies with the utilization of water resources the study area faces little threat from scarcity of energy resources thus the influence of the randomness of electricity and fossil fuel availability constraints can be ignored the difference of stochastic and possibilistic optimality robustness are also set to be ignored with λ α 1 in order to solve the developed multi objective model the upper and lower bounds of membership functions should be selected first in practice the upper and lower bounds of membership function can be calculated from single objective models or be assigned by decision makers in this study in order to reveal the influence of optimality robustness penalty single objective models without consideration of the optimality robustness penalty should be solved first with expected value as objective the model e1i represents the single objective model without optimality robustness penalty and i 1 5 represents the objective of net benefits total water consumption co2 emission gini coefficient and esv respectively the other four indicators are also calculated when one single objective model is solved the expected objective value from model eli is expressed as the indicator eli i 1 5 then the single objective models considering the optimality robustness penalty are solved which is represented as the model fli i 1 5 the expression of objective function in the model fli is the same as equation 42 similarly the results for five indicators are called the indicator fli the model f2 and f3 denote the feasibility robustness models shown as eqs 43 and 44 and the indicator f2 and f3 denote the penalty value of feasibility robustness from the random control constraint and fuzzy constraint the optimum objective values from model eli are selected as theoretically optimum values tov to be inputs of the upper or lower bounds in membership functions depends on maximizing or minimizing the models the worst indicator values from model fli are selected as theoretically worst values twv as the other inputs of bounds in membership functions 4 2 resources allocation strategies for irrigation regions optimal surface and underground water use strategies can be obtained from established models fig 4 shows total water allocation by the end of the primary canals and the proportion of surface water and groundwater in various irrigation regions since surface water is the main water source and groundwater is used as supplementary total water consumption is highly influenced by the available surface water under different hydrological years which decreases from 0 89 billion to 0 81 billion cubic meters with the decline of available surface water the surface water consumption reduces from 0 81 to 0 67 billion while the groundwater consumption increases from 83 million to 134 million from h 1 to h 5 meanwhile groundwater use proportion increases from 0 09 in extreme wet years to 0 17 in extreme dry years from fig 4 the water use of southeastern irrigation regions are intensive where ir 4 and ir 5 possess the most land resources and use a relatively large amount of water fig 4 also show that most of irs need to exploit groundwater and ir 15 has a remarkably high ratio of groundwater use in order to show the detail several representative irs are selected according to the biggest consumption of total water surface water and groundwater as well as the biggest groundwater ratio seen as table 9 among all the decision units ir 4 and ir 5 consume the largest quantity of surface water and groundwater and ir 4 15 35 and 39 possess high groundwater ratios which means they face relatively high water shortage risk and groundwater insecurity decision makers should pay attention to their water shortage risk and try to find ways to reduce the dependency on groundwater especially for ir 4 and 5 considering their big irrigated area and high agricultural production meanwhile decision makers should also be cautious about the groundwater level of these regions since energy consumption from groundwater pumping and food processing activities is closely related with water allocation and water productivity the electric and fossil fuel resources present a similar trend with water consumption and crop yield taking electricity as an example as shown in fig 5 the high total electric consumption denotes high consumption of groundwater and yield production the ration of the electric from pumping and crop processing also reveals the water and energy use structure like ir 13 the electric for pumping accounts for 40 4 of total electric in extreme dry year and its groundwater ratio to total water reaches 30 3 showing its high groundwater dependency since canal systems are the main way of water allocation the distance between the irrigation region and water intake point highly influences water delivery efficiency taking upper canal ⅱ as an example uc ⅱ controls 8 primary canals and 1 middle canal mc a that further controls 2 primary canals shown in fig 2 and detailed in table 2 the water delivery efficiency can be shown in table 10 compared with existing water resources efficiency from statistical data optimal water strategies can help reduce water seepage and achieve water saving goals there is significant decrease in cumulative water use efficiency as canal systems have high hierarchy structures and branch number further surface water accessibility varies with water intake priority which means those irrigation regions close to water intake points more easily obtain surface water taking ir 15 as an example it is located at the end of up ⅱ with a distance between ir 15 and heihe river of about 90 km making it the last one to obtain surface water and low water delivery coefficient hence its agricultural production highly depends on groundwater the same conclusion can be derived from table 9 where its groundwater use ratio ranges from 0 22 to 0 66 among different hydrological years besides the groundwater depth would increase 0 16 m year in extreme dry years over exploitation of groundwater will increase groundwater depth further influencing the local ecological vegetation and undermining ecology health according to the water resources management yearbook groundwater of ir 15 accounted for 0 81 of total water in 2015 therefore optimized water delivery strategies can help relieve groundwater exploitation nonetheless the situation still remains grim hence decision makers should take measure to improve the delivery efficiency of tail canals and the water use structure to maintain agricultural development and ecology balance of the whole middle research of the heihe river basin 4 3 water allocation for crops fig 6 depicts net irrigation quota of various crops from surface water and groundwater in extreme wet years respectively the expected net irrigation quotas for wheat field maize seed maize vegetables and grass forest are 3 43 4 77 4 89 4 31 1 88 thousand m3 ha respectively ir 4 15 and 39 depend more on groundwater which is corresponding with the water use structure shown in table 9 the water supply satisfaction is defined as the ratio of crop actual evapotranspiration and potential maximum evapotranspiration fig 7 shows the average irrigation quotas of all crops and ecological vegetation the results imply that the model can guarantee minimum water demand of crops even though in extreme dry condition the satisfaction degrees among different hydrological years do not vary much although those in extreme dry years are obviously lower than others two reasons may contribute to these results the first one is consideration of water supply equity in the objectives and the other one is the involvement of optimality robustness which will be explained in the following section 4 4 objective values for single objective and multi objective models the results of single objective models eli and multi objective model fmo are shown in table 11 fmo denotes the integrated multi objective model considering optimality robustness expressed as equation 50 the results in table 11 can reflect the change of other goals when one goal is set to be optimal which can help decision makers learn the tradeoffs among different objectives for example net benefits and esv will result in large consumption of water and energy resources reflected by the values of total water consumption and co2 emission and meanwhile these two conflict goals would also contend for water and energy resources the gini coefficient represents the water land resources matching degree and quantifies the equity of the water allocation system it expects a result that the same amount of water would be allocated to unit area for all irrigation regions ignoring the difference of crop benefits and costs as well as their water demand however net benefits and esv highlight crop differences to obtain the best results the conflict among these objectives also need to be coordinated as for the feasibility robustness objectives they can reveal resources scarcity in the study area higher values mean a higher level water resources deficit simply pursuing economic benefits will lead to surface water over extraction due to its lower price which will reduce water discharge to zhengyi gorge and threaten water safety of lower reach of the heihe river basin since groundwater has higher water use efficiency it becomes priority water when achieving water consumption and gini goals compared with single objective models the integrated multi objective model we proposed mediates the conflict among multiple objectives according to the membership degrees of tradeoff results the memberships of net benefits co2 emission and esv are equal which means the tradeoff among these three objectives is the key factor that restricts the model solving therefore the proposed model in this study can reach harmony in tradeoff among different objectives the results can also help decision makers well understand the conflicts among different objectives and recognize the key tradeoff from multiple objectives 4 5 robustness and sustainability analysis table 12 shows the membership degrees of the objective values from single objective fli and multi objective models fig 8 demonstrates their distribution which can show the strong coordination ability of the developed model to multiple objectives the membership of single objective model considering the optimality robustness can reflect the influence of the penalty from optimality robustness taking the indicator f11 for example the relation of the results from the model f11 and fmo with twv and tov can be shown in fig 9 if the distance between the tov and twv is defined as 1 the distance from the results of the model f11 to twv is 0 74 while the distance from the results of the model fmo to twv is 0 31 the memberships of the model f1i show the influence of optimality robustness penalty of the objective itself the membership of the model fmo reflects the integrative effect of the tradeoff from multiple objectives and the robustness penalty of the system from the comparison of the memberships from single objective models and multi objective model the leading factor of indicator change can be revealed here the rations of the indicator memberships from the multi objective model and the single objective models are calculated as a way to quantify the influence the biggest memberships for net benefits total water consumption co2 emission gini coefficient and esv from single objective models are 0 74 0 89 0 44 0 88 and 0 97 the ratios for all indicators are 0 42 0 58 0 70 0 38 0 32 0 81 and 1 therefore regarding single objective the optimality robustness of co2 emission is low aimed at multi objective model the influence of the tradeoff among objectives and the optimality robustness of other objectives is relatively remarkable especially for net benefits gini coefficient and esv the feasibility robustness penalty from randomness and fuzziness is low meaning the system possessed high feasibility for decision makers high membership of single objective model means that it is easy to achieve ideal goal for the indicator which can reflect the reasonability of the bounds set by decision makers for example the tov of co2 emission is too high for the system although the system has the potential to reach the tov it is hard to maintain stable due to its low optimality robustness table 13 shows the expected objective values in different hydrological years and the optimality and feasibility robustness penalty from randomness and fuzziness obtained from the established multi objective model with the reduction of available surface water the feasibility of randomness and fuzziness increases the agricultural system faces severe shortage risk of surface water and groundwater especially in extreme arid years which is harmful to the sustainable development therefore it is an efficient way to improve sustainability by enhancing the drought resistance ability compared with the influence of randomness the fuzziness has bigger influence on the optimality of the system hence the decision makers should pay attention to the reduce the fuzziness of the agricultural production including clarifying the groundwater exploitation and so on 4 6 model potential and limitation although the assumptions and simplifications are necessary for the effectiveness and efficiency of the optimization framework there are still some limitations as mentioned before the optimization model framework combines the agricultural sustainable development and the water and energy flow although the concept of the framework is generalized the detailed description of the optimization model could have specificity according to the reality of study area in this study two main aspects should be analyzed to help enhance the performance of the developed framework one is the objectives and constraints the model considered the other one is the depiction of the hydrological processes although we have concluded and extracted the main sustainable indicators and agricultural activities from previous studies several factors are valuable as supplement for example the employment supplied by the irrigated agriculture is a salient indicator of social sustainability the virtual water trade related with the export of crops is also an area of active research advantaged irrigation practices including sprinkling irrigation and trickle irrigation have a huge influence on the agricultural water and energy usage structure the study considering these factors has tremendous potential the description of water cycle may be quite different for different regions the general water cycle and energy flow has been established as shown in fig 3 nonetheless there may be some extra situations happening first the rainfall into river and canals is ignored due to low precipitation in the study area however underestimate its recharge to surface water may cause huge error in water balance calculation another challenge is the water exchange near river it is difficult to describe the water movement between river and groundwater as well as between river and soil because of the high spatial temporal variability finally for the irrigation area with saline alkali soil or paddy field the irrigation return flow is an important part of water resources that is not utilized by the irrigation system which is ignored in the study 5 conclusions aimed at sustainable development of irrigated agricultural production a distributed resources allocation model based on water food energy nexus was built economic social and ecological factors were integrated for consideration to help promote agricultural sustainability in order to deal with uncertainty in its practical application integrated robust stochastic possibilistic multi objective programming was proposed the advantages of the developed model over previous methods in agricultural resources management are 1 it synthesizes interactive activities among social economic ecological and resources dimensions during agricultural production and balances multiple competing goals to guarantee sustainable development 2 considering the key function of canal systems in delivering water and effects on water use efficiency and allocation equity the distributional feature of canal systems was extracted and embedded into the optimization structure making strategies more reliable 3 faced with uncertainty that is widespread in the nature economy and society the proposed programming algorithm can tackle tradeoff among multiple objectives maintain robustness under random and fuzzy factors and reflect the sensitivity of the model to different kinds of uncertainty the optimization structure was applied to an irrigated agricultural region in northwestern china the results show that the model can provide detailed distributed water and energy allocation strategies under different random scenarios further canal water efficiency could be improved and groundwater depth could be controlled to help ecological restoration by adjusting allocation of surface and underground water and reducing the proportion of groundwater exploitation on the premise of guaranteed economic benefits meanwhile according to robustness analysis fuzzy parameters will reduce optimality robustness and the extreme dry years face the highest optimality risk except for extreme wet years other scenarios have risks in surface water deficit especially in extreme dry years therefore decision makers can not only recognize risk of water deficit and goal value reliability based on robustness analysis but also distinguish ecological fragile irrigation regions according to water use proportion the model can also be adapted to meet various goal preferences of different stakeholders by adjusting objective satisfaction intervals in conclusion the developed model and algorithm in this study can provide powerful support to agricultural sustainable development credit authorship contribution statement shanshan guo

3645,sustainable agricultural development covers all aspects of agricultural production involving the water food energy nexus wfen and considers the effects of agricultural activities on society economy and ecology multi objective optimization models play an important role in making tradeoff among multiple interests of stakeholders aimed at canal based irrigated agricultural areas water allocation highly depends on canal distribution and the spatial location of irrigation regions determines their water intake order which usually induces serious water allocation inequality the social economic and ecological problems resulting from water inequality would deteriorate without intervention and seriously impact sustainable development thus optimization models must consider water use equity water intake order as well as water equilibrium simultaneously however this will greatly increase computational efforts and solution difficulty the problem becomes worse when uncertain factors are involved in order to overcome these difficulties a distributed multi objective uncertain optimization model was established to help develop comprehensive strategies for agricultural sustainability a novel robust solution method was proposed to offer an efficient way to handle stochastic and fuzzy uncertainties from the perspective of feasibility and optimality robustness finally a case study was conducted to demonstrate the practical application of the developed model the results offer managers insights on agricultural sustainable development keywords sustainable agricultural development robust programming water food energy nexus canal based spatial connection multiple objectives multiple uncertainties 1 introduction resource supply is experiencing increasing pressure due to the combined actions of climate change rapid population growth serious contamination and so on bieber et al 2018 with the progress of knowledge and technology a perspective of sustainable development has evolved pope et al 2004 the focus of development is more than benefits but also includes meeting the needs of environment society and economy hjorth and bagheri 2006 as the most basic human requirements and essential for human development water energy and food are the core of major challenges faced by human society according to the united nations sustainable development goals un sdgs the united nations 2015 in order to tackle these challenges the water food energy nexus wfen is promoted as a conceptual tool for achieving sustainable development and extensive research has been carried out around it cai et al 2018 al saidi and elagib 2017 kurian 2017 endo et al 2017 under the context of population growth irrigated agriculture plays a crucial role in worldwide food security and socio economic welfare and is the largest exploiter of freshwater according to fao food and agriculture organizations 2012 agricultural production also consumes large amounts of water and energy resources while emitting greenhouse gases and other substances increasing pressure on resource scarcity and environmental burden resulting from intensive agricultural activities may undermine resilience of the ecosystem hamper economic growth and limit human well being de vito et al 2017 therefore necessary actions must be taken around the wfen to balance food security and resources consumption make tradeoffs among society economy and environment and realize sustainable development of irrigated agriculture the agricultural system is a compound and complicated system which consists of not only natural elements e g hydrology meteorology soil plants etc but also human factors for example irrigation practices are the result of the combination of multiple factors varying from the behavior of different actors e g farmers water management authorities etc to several interactions between biophysical e g water availability and variability crop water demand etc and socio economic factors e g market conditions energy accessibility policy etc giordano et al 2017 the adoption of wfen can capture the nature of irrigation practices to describe costs and benefits as well as side products e g co2 etc of the system avellán et al 2018 however the spatial distribution of water use sectors is inevitable when making irrigation decisions particularly for canal based irrigation regions guo et al 2018b the location of water use sectors along with the canal decides their water intake order and influences their water accessibility and water efficiency which would have further influence on wfen meanwhile when water supply is insufficient water competition would urge water users close to river intakes to ignore water demand of those at the end of canal and cause water allocation inequality which is harmful to social stability and should be coped with d exelle et al 2012 van campenhout et al 2015 however few studies have been done on distributed optimization models considering water allocation equity and efficiency under the wfen framework since various factors are considered around economy society and ecology goal conflicts would appear when making sustainable decisions marques et al 2015 to this end multi objective optimization is a good way to tackle conflicts from different groups of decision makers and develop tradeoff strategies asadi et al 2012 groot et al 2012 falke et al 2016 li et al 2019c meanwhile uncertainty exists widely due to incomplete information personal perception statistical errors and so on li et al 2020 generally stochastic programming fuzzy programming and interval programming are recognized popular uncertainty programming methods in order to handle probability possibility and gray uncertainties respectively li et al 2019b zhou et al 2013 inuiguchi and ramík 2000 dong et al 2012 actually there are usually multiple uncertainties coexisting in a real world realm and integrated methods have been developed based on the combination of the aforementioned basic uncertain programming methods cai et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 wu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 the principle is to divide multiple uncertainties and solve them separately although it works for dealing with multiple uncertainties the main drawback is the complexity of the integrated method the other kind of research focuses the risk derived by uncertainties rather than uncertainty itself and proposes robust optimization to tackle uncertainty which has become popular due to its ability to provide powerful risk averse strategies robust programming is based on optimality and feasibility robustness and can also be divided into three categories robust stochastic programming mulvey et al 1995a leung et al 2007 robust convex programming ben tal and nemirovski 1998 and robust possibilistic programming pishvaee et al 2012a in spite of aiming at different kinds of uncertainties these three robust programming methods share similar theory and framework the combination of robust programming to solve multiple uncertainties is a theoretically convenient approach and is worth exploring furthermore few studies have been conducted on robust programming with multiple objectives and uncertainties therefore this study will be implemented from two aspects of application and programming methods in order to realize sustainable development of agriculture wfen and canal distribution will be combined to depict irrigated agricultural systems and meet the demand of society economy and environment a distributed multi objective optimization model will be established aimed at multiple objectives and uncertainties in the real world integrated robust programming is pursued based on previous studies and risk averse decisions will be made considering the robustness of optimality of objectives and feasibility of constraints finally a case study will be conducted to show the application of the developed method 2 study area the middle reach of the heihe river basin 98 101 30 e 38 42 n was selected as a real case representation of canal based irrigation regions to depict the problem we try to solve the heihe river basin is the second largest inland valley in the arid region of northwestern china the middle reach region is defined as the area between yingluo gorge and zhengyi gorge as shown in fig 1 covering ganzhou gz linze lz and gaotai gt three administrative districts ads of zhangye city it has high evaporation around 1410 mm year and low precipitation around 140 mm year the heihe river the liyuanhe river and other small branches are the main water sources more than 90 of surface water is consumed by the middle oasis and contributes approximately 90 of agricultural production value of the whole basin liu et al 2018 three gauging stations were constructed to monitor water information of the middle reach including yingluo gaoai and zhengyi stations there is a reservoir in zhengyi gorge with hydropower ability of 0 8 million watt guaranteed output and 6 million watt installed capacity as the biggest water consumption section agricultural irrigation uses approximately 90 of the total water consumption li et al 2019b zhangye city has a complete canal system and a long history of canal irrigation guo et al 2018a the canal network forms the water delivery bond between the river and farmland in this study 20 irrigation districts ids of gz lz and gt located along the heihe and liyuanhe rivers are selected to be the study area for the agricultural development of these ids accounts for more than 90 of total cultivation area in the middle reach and their water intake has close spatial connection according to the spatial information of the canal system and ids along the heihe river and liyuanhe river shown in fig 1 a simplified diagram can be extracted which is shown in fig 2 according to the hierarchical relationship of the canals three classes can be identified including the primary canal pc middle canal mc and upper canal uc primary canals deliver water into fields and upper canals are used to get water from the river and transfer water to lower class canals middle canals are a linkage of primary canals and upper canals upper class canals may connect several lower class canals the irrigated area controlled by primary canals is called the irrigation region ir which is the decision unit of this study an id consists of several irs and an ad is composed of several ids taking crop coverage in 2016 shown in fig 1 as an example the main irrigated vegetation extracted includes crops represented by spring wheat wt field maize fm seed maize sm and vegetables vg as well as some ecological vegetation like grass and forest gf that needs to be irrigated the attributes of the upper and middle canals in the canal network are shown in table 1 the attributes of the primary canals and their hierarchical relationship are shown in table 2 along with the main crop area controlled by canals 3 methodology 3 1 problem overview water food and energy are basic factors of agricultural production activities surface water and underground water are the most important sources of irrigation water which could be used to produce food and maintain ecological vegetation electricity and fossil fuel are the main energy sources of pumped irrigation water saving irrigation practice and crop harvest processing and transportation the agricultural production and the growth of irrigated ecological vegetation consume water and energy resources driving the movement and transformation of water and energy water is most important element of plant growth while energy is the main power of agricultural activities the irrigation makes electric and fossil energy into kinetic energy of water meanwhile hydropower stations realize the energy transformation from kinetic energy of river into electric energy the water cycle as well as energy consumption and regeneration are closely connective with crop production which are essential parts of the wfen the water and energy flow shown in fig 3 describes most of the common situations in hydrological cycle and energy usage of agricultural activities while the optimization models would be different according to the reality according to the analysis on the water and energy flow the water cycle is the key factor of the wfen compared with energy thus water allocation should be chosen as the basic decision variable of the optimization problem based on the water movement the associated energy flow can be derived the wfen is associated with many aspects of agricultural sustainability however sustainability in agriculture is a complex concept and there is no common viewpoint among scholars about its dimensions thus how to quantify agricultural sustainability based on the wfen would be the first obstacle of the optimization problem according to the efforts of previous studies hayati et al 2010 gómez limón and sanchez fernandez 2010 several representative indicators are selected from different views of society economy and ecology based on the major concerns of decision makers and the convenience of data acquisition the benefits of food water fees and energy fees electricity and fossil fuel fee promote the development of the economy water and food security are key to social stability and sustainability the harmful substances emitted during energy consumption threaten the environment and the scarcity of irrigation water for ecological vegetation and services would hinder ecological health as the canal system is the main support of water conveyance its spatial attributes influence water use efficiency and intake order of water use sectors how to utilize spatial information and depict necessary hydrological processes under complex agricultural water system would be the second challenge considering the widespread uncertainty in the real world how to tackle it under the context of a complex problem requires additional efforts surrounded by these challenges a distributed robust optimization model framework was proposed as shown in fig 3 3 2 objectives since canal systems are the linkage between the river and fields the irrigated region controlled by primary canals i e the ir is considered as a decision making unit in this study the decision variables are surface and underground water allocated to crops and ecological vegetation by the end of primary canals during crop growth period according to the water cycle in fig 3 four water balance processes should be focused including soil water balance canal water balance groundwater balance and river water balance soil water balance describes the available water change for plants canal water balance depicts the surface water change from water intake point of river to the end of the primary canals groundwater balance shows the change of groundwater level and river water balance exhibits the water change from the entrance to the exit of the study area the selected objectives of the proposed model are net benefits of agricultural production total water consumption total co2 emission matching coefficient of water and land resources and ecological system service value the objectives and constraints can be described as follows and definitions of symbols are shown in table 3 1 net benefits of agricultural production the agricultural production here is designated as the crop production in the study area the net benefits of agricultural systems consist of income from crops and cost of agricultural activities during cultivation and harvest including water fees from irrigation electricity and fossil fuel fees for groundwater pumping primary food processing and transportation it is assumed that the electricity generated by the hydropower station is used to supplement power consumption of agriculture in a fixed proportion 1 n et b e n e f i t s h i 1 m j 1 n cpric e j y i e l d ijh a r e a ij s w p r i c e i s w c ih g w p r

2014 hu et al 2016 the matching coefficient of allocated water resources and land resources denotes the allocated water by the end of canals to unit cultivated area which is a good way to measure the water allocation equity in spatial scale the matching coefficient of water and land resources in agriculture can reflect the balance condition and satisfaction degree of the allocated water and associated cultivated land resources in spatial scale even geographic distribution of water and land resources helps equitable agricultural development du et al 2019 in addition the gini coefficient of the ratio of water supply and demand or the per capita water allocated can also be used as indicators of equality li et al 2019a 13 gin i h i 1 m i 1 m matc h ih m a t c h i h 2 m i 1 m matc h ih

the esv of different types of vegetation in currency costanza et al 1997 francesco and antonio 2011 lv et al 2018 it cannot be treated as economic net benefits directly since adoption of different measurement principles and standards will lead to quite different results in practice there are many types of plants intermingled with one another in a region making it hard to value the esv based on the reference value proposed by previous studies besides the growth condition of plants also affects their esv especially for arid and semi arid area in order to solve these challenges the long term remote sensing data of net primary production can be used to calculate the potential esv of study area with the help of measured data yu et al 2009 yu et al 2011 in order to reflect the relationship of the actual esv and the actual evapotranspiration a corrective reference esv method is used to quantify the relationship between water consumption and esv of ecological vegetation 14 es v h i 1 m et

security varies with the actual situation of study area in this study whether the food crop yield can feed the local rural population is measured as an indicator of food security while for some

becomes important especially under multiple uncertainties in this study an integrated robust method is proposed to solve the randomness and fuzziness simultaneously the developed method combines the robust stochastic programming mulvey et al 1995b yu and li 2000 for randomness robust possibilistic programming pishvaee and fazli khalaf 2016 pishvaee and torabi 2010 for fuzziness and multi objective programming in order to make the improvement process clear the two robust methods will be introduced first as background knowledge then an integrated method which can deal with randomness and fuzziness with one objective is proposed finally the robust stochastic possibilistic multi objective programming method is introduced 1 robust stochastic programming yu and li 2000 a solution is said to be robust if it has both feasibility and optimality robustness feasibility robustness quantifies the ability of the solution to maintain feasibility under all uncertain circumstances measured by feasibility degree optimality robustness describes the ability of the solution to remain close to the optimal value under all conditions measured by optimality degree based on the concept of robustness the robust scenario based stochastic programming can be depicted in the following model the feature of the programming is to replace a random event with continuous probabilistic distribution by discrete random scenarios with associated probabilities 34 min f h 1 h p h c h x h λ h 1 h p h c h x h h 1 h p h c h x h h 1 h p h j 1 j ω hj δ hj s t b h x h δ h e h h 1 h x h δ h 0 h 1 h where h denotes the discrete scenario from a random event ph is associated probability of random scenario xh is decision variable under the hth scenario ch and eh are parameters of objective and constraints related with random events b are associated parameters of constraints δh is a slack variable denoting the deviation for violations of the control constraints representing the feasibility degree of the control constraints the second part of the objective i e h 1 h p h c h x h h 1 h p h c h x h quantifies the deviation between the results of scenarios and that of the expected value describing the optimality robustness the third part of the objective i e h 1 h p h j 1 j δ hj represents the overall feasibility degree covering all feasibility degrees of the control constraints λ and ωhj are weighed coefficients to recognize the importance degree of optimality and feasibility robustness of the optimization model which are usually assigned by decision makers 2 robust possibilistic programming robust possibilistic programming is a form of fuzzy mathematical programming which deals with imprecise input parameters or lack of knowledge about the exact values of parameters expressed as fuzzy numbers mula et al 2006 the conventional fuzzy optimization model with fuzzy numbers can be expressed as 35 min f c x s t a x d x 0 where c and d are fuzzy numbers the membership function is assumed to be triangular and they can be represented by their three prominent points i e c c p c m c o and d d p d m d o according to the previous studies pishvaee et al 2012b pishvaee and fazli khalaf 2016 the robust possibilistic programming can be formulated as follows the programming can use confidence levels to reflect different kinds of attitudes of decision makers to the constraints with fuzziness and show a compromised attitude 36 min f e c x α c o x e c x β ρ d m d p 2 1 ρ d m d o 2 d p s t a x ρ d m d p 2 1 ρ d m d o 2 x 0 where e denotes expected value of fuzzy number ρ is confidence level with 0 5 ρ 1 α and β are weighed parameters which determine significance of this term against the other terms the second part of the objective quantifies optimality robustness since ax d p is the worst case that could happen the third part measures the feasibility robustness of soft constraints 3 a modified robust stochastic possibilistic programming for one objective models it can be seen that the robust stochastic programming and possibilistic programming have something essential in common the deviation from the expected value indicates optimality robustness and the feasibility robustness can be measured as the violation degree of the most conservative constraints however one of the drawbacks is the absolute operator in stochastic programming in order to get rid of the absolute value sign a modified robust stochastic possibilistic programming for hybrid uncertainty can be generated combining robust stochastic possibilistic programming dehghan et al 2019 and a solution method for goal optimization programming with absolute operator li 1996 37 min f h 1 h p h e c h x h λ h 1 h p h e c h x h h 1 h p h e c h x h 2 θ h α h 1 h p h c h o

variable to transfer the objective function with absolute operator in model 34 into a linear function with the help of constraints 38 4 an integrated robust stochastic possibilistic multi objective programming although the modified model can solve the robust stochastic possibilistic programming problem some weaknesses remain one is how to determine the weighted coefficients the coefficients determined by some decision makers possess strong subjectivity while different kinds of stakeholders may have different preferences for the same coefficients meanwhile multiple objectives may exist in a practical optimization problem in order to reduce the difficulty of setting weighting parameters as well as balance multiple stakeholders a robust stochastic possibilistic multi objective programming rspmop is developed from the expressions of the above three models the structure of the objective can be divided into three parts the first part is the expected objective value the second one denotes the optimality degree and the feasibility degree is the third one thus three categories of objectives can be identified the first group of objectives are expected value and optimality robustness of various goals the second group are feasibility robustness of random control constraints the third group are feasibility robustness of the fuzzy constraints the model can be shown as follows 42 min f 1 i h 1 h p h e c hi x hi λ i h 1 h p h e c hi x hi h 1 h p h e c hi x hi 2 θ hi α i h 1 h p h c hi o x hi e c hi x hi i 1 i 43 min f 2 j h 1 h p h δ hj j 1 j 44 min f 3 k h 1 h p h ρ

multiple objectives are also avoided fuzzy goal programming is combined to help solve the model developed zimmermann 1978 yu et al 2012 the solution algorithm can be depicted as step 1 solve the problem using single objective programming for all objective functions for each objective function find the upper and lower bound l u step 2 assume objective function follows triangular membership distribution between upper and lower bounds then membership function for each objective can be expressed as μ f x 1 f x l u f x u l l f x u 0 f x u the rspmop can be converted into 50 max min μ f 1 i

possesses obvious randomness five hydrological levels were divided according to the record of runoff through yingluo gorge 1944 2013 the runoff of liyuanhe river and water discharge from zhengyi gorge were analyzed based on statistical data in five representative hydrological years and are shown in table 4 groundwater exploitation is determined by local policy the practical water demand as well as the groundwater reserve in the aquifers the groundwater availability in table 4 is based on the historical data of the groundwater exploitation of irrigation regions in different hydrological years since groundwater exploitation is influenced by subjective judgement of managers and farmers fuzzy numbers were used to express groundwater availability due to low precipitation in the study area the rainfall into river and canals can be neglected due to their little spatial area and the joint probability between runoff and precipitation can also be ignored due to the low groundwater level the shallow groundwater evaporation into fields was neglected average annual precipitation during the growth period was adopted and groundwater recharge by precipitation can also be ignored the fluctuation of crop price is determined by the market and therefore hard to quantify by any certain probabilistic distribution according to the accessibility of statistical information the price of crops electricity and fossil fuel were considered as fuzzy numbers as seen in table 5 the co2 emitted during electricity and fossil fuel consumption referenced to the local reports and investigation which were also expressed as fuzzy numbers i e percoe 0 8 0 85 1 1 kg co2 kwh and percof 2 17 2 73 3 7 kg co2 kg the price of irrigation water is determined by local policy as shown in table 6 due to the excessive exploitation of groundwater the groundwater depth becomes higher and the local ecological vegetation and biodiversity meet dire threat liu et al 2018 the allowable decline depth of groundwater level during irrigation is calculated based on the groundwater restrained exploitation and the aquifer area from the work of liu et al liu et al 2018 local policy and groundwater reports as well as the specific yield of the aquifer li et al 2019a as shown in table 7 other data can be found in local statistical yearbooks management yearbooks and so on the crop evapotranspiration data were calculated from meteorological data according to the fao 56 penman monteith method li et al 2019a and are shown in table 8 the randomness of water resources is the key factor to restrict local agricultural development and determines agricultural sustainability as a key irrigation water source surface water availability affects water allocation and groundwater exploitation therefore the constraints of surface water resources availability under different hydrological levels are selected as random control constraints in robust stochastic programming although the consumption of energy resources varies with the utilization of water resources the study area faces little threat from scarcity of energy resources thus the influence of the randomness of electricity and fossil fuel availability constraints can be ignored the difference of stochastic and possibilistic optimality robustness are also set to be ignored with λ α 1 in order to solve the developed multi objective model the upper and lower bounds of membership functions should be selected first in practice the upper and lower bounds of membership function can be calculated from single objective models or be assigned by decision makers in this study in order to reveal the influence of optimality robustness penalty single objective models without consideration of the optimality robustness penalty should be solved first with expected value as objective the model e1i represents the single objective model without optimality robustness penalty and i 1 5 represents the objective of net benefits total water consumption co2 emission gini coefficient and esv respectively the other four indicators are also calculated when one single objective model is solved the expected objective value from model eli is expressed as the indicator eli i 1 5 then the single objective models considering the optimality robustness penalty are solved which is represented as the model fli i 1 5 the expression of objective function in the model fli is the same as equation 42 similarly the results for five indicators are called the indicator fli the model f2 and f3 denote the feasibility robustness models shown as eqs 43 and 44 and the indicator f2 and f3 denote the penalty value of feasibility robustness from the random control constraint and fuzzy constraint the optimum objective values from model eli are selected as theoretically optimum values tov to be inputs of the upper or lower bounds in membership functions depends on maximizing or minimizing the models the worst indicator values from model fli are selected as theoretically worst values twv as the other inputs of bounds in membership functions 4 2 resources allocation strategies for irrigation regions optimal surface and underground water use strategies can be obtained from established models fig 4 shows total water allocation by the end of the primary canals and the proportion of surface water and groundwater in various irrigation regions since surface water is the main water source and groundwater is used as supplementary total water consumption is highly influenced by the available surface water under different hydrological years which decreases from 0 89 billion to 0 81 billion cubic meters with the decline of available surface water the surface water consumption reduces from 0 81 to 0 67 billion while the groundwater consumption increases from 83 million to 134 million from h 1 to h 5 meanwhile groundwater use proportion increases from 0 09 in extreme wet years to 0 17 in extreme dry years from fig 4 the water use of southeastern irrigation regions are intensive where ir 4 and ir 5 possess the most land resources and use a relatively large amount of water fig 4 also show that most of irs need to exploit groundwater and ir 15 has a remarkably high ratio of groundwater use in order to show the detail several representative irs are selected according to the biggest consumption of total water surface water and groundwater as well as the biggest groundwater ratio seen as table 9 among all the decision units ir 4 and ir 5 consume the largest quantity of surface water and groundwater and ir 4 15 35 and 39 possess high groundwater ratios which means they face relatively high water shortage risk and groundwater insecurity decision makers should pay attention to their water shortage risk and try to find ways to reduce the dependency on groundwater especially for ir 4 and 5 considering their big irrigated area and high agricultural production meanwhile decision makers should also be cautious about the groundwater level of these regions since energy consumption from groundwater pumping and food processing activities is closely related with water allocation and water productivity the electric and fossil fuel resources present a similar trend with water consumption and crop yield taking electricity as an example as shown in fig 5 the high total electric consumption denotes high consumption of groundwater and yield production the ration of the electric from pumping and crop processing also reveals the water and energy use structure like ir 13 the electric for pumping accounts for 40 4 of total electric in extreme dry year and its groundwater ratio to total water reaches 30 3 showing its high groundwater dependency since canal systems are the main way of water allocation the distance between the irrigation region and water intake point highly influences water delivery efficiency taking upper canal ⅱ as an example uc ⅱ controls 8 primary canals and 1 middle canal mc a that further controls 2 primary canals shown in fig 2 and detailed in table 2 the water delivery efficiency can be shown in table 10 compared with existing water resources efficiency from statistical data optimal water strategies can help reduce water seepage and achieve water saving goals there is significant decrease in cumulative water use efficiency as canal systems have high hierarchy structures and branch number further surface water accessibility varies with water intake priority which means those irrigation regions close to water intake points more easily obtain surface water taking ir 15 as an example it is located at the end of up ⅱ with a distance between ir 15 and heihe river of about 90 km making it the last one to obtain surface water and low water delivery coefficient hence its agricultural production highly depends on groundwater the same conclusion can be derived from table 9 where its groundwater use ratio ranges from 0 22 to 0 66 among different hydrological years besides the groundwater depth would increase 0 16 m year in extreme dry years over exploitation of groundwater will increase groundwater depth further influencing the local ecological vegetation and undermining ecology health according to the water resources management yearbook groundwater of ir 15 accounted for 0 81 of total water in 2015 therefore optimized water delivery strategies can help relieve groundwater exploitation nonetheless the situation still remains grim hence decision makers should take measure to improve the delivery efficiency of tail canals and the water use structure to maintain agricultural development and ecology balance of the whole middle research of the heihe river basin 4 3 water allocation for crops fig 6 depicts net irrigation quota of various crops from surface water and groundwater in extreme wet years respectively the expected net irrigation quotas for wheat field maize seed maize vegetables and grass forest are 3 43 4 77 4 89 4 31 1 88 thousand m3 ha respectively ir 4 15 and 39 depend more on groundwater which is corresponding with the water use structure shown in table 9 the water supply satisfaction is defined as the ratio of crop actual evapotranspiration and potential maximum evapotranspiration fig 7 shows the average irrigation quotas of all crops and ecological vegetation the results imply that the model can guarantee minimum water demand of crops even though in extreme dry condition the satisfaction degrees among different hydrological years do not vary much although those in extreme dry years are obviously lower than others two reasons may contribute to these results the first one is consideration of water supply equity in the objectives and the other one is the involvement of optimality robustness which will be explained in the following section 4 4 objective values for single objective and multi objective models the results of single objective models eli and multi objective model fmo are shown in table 11 fmo denotes the integrated multi objective model considering optimality robustness expressed as equation 50 the results in table 11 can reflect the change of other goals when one goal is set to be optimal which can help decision makers learn the tradeoffs among different objectives for example net benefits and esv will result in large consumption of water and energy resources reflected by the values of total water consumption and co2 emission and meanwhile these two conflict goals would also contend for water and energy resources the gini coefficient represents the water land resources matching degree and quantifies the equity of the water allocation system it expects a result that the same amount of water would be allocated to unit area for all irrigation regions ignoring the difference of crop benefits and costs as well as their water demand however net benefits and esv highlight crop differences to obtain the best results the conflict among these objectives also need to be coordinated as for the feasibility robustness objectives they can reveal resources scarcity in the study area higher values mean a higher level water resources deficit simply pursuing economic benefits will lead to surface water over extraction due to its lower price which will reduce water discharge to zhengyi gorge and threaten water safety of lower reach of the heihe river basin since groundwater has higher water use efficiency it becomes priority water when achieving water consumption and gini goals compared with single objective models the integrated multi objective model we proposed mediates the conflict among multiple objectives according to the membership degrees of tradeoff results the memberships of net benefits co2 emission and esv are equal which means the tradeoff among these three objectives is the key factor that restricts the model solving therefore the proposed model in this study can reach harmony in tradeoff among different objectives the results can also help decision makers well understand the conflicts among different objectives and recognize the key tradeoff from multiple objectives 4 5 robustness and sustainability analysis table 12 shows the membership degrees of the objective values from single objective fli and multi objective models fig 8 demonstrates their distribution which can show the strong coordination ability of the developed model to multiple objectives the membership of single objective model considering the optimality robustness can reflect the influence of the penalty from optimality robustness taking the indicator f11 for example the relation of the results from the model f11 and fmo with twv and tov can be shown in fig 9 if the distance between the tov and twv is defined as 1 the distance from the results of the model f11 to twv is 0 74 while the distance from the results of the model fmo to twv is 0 31 the memberships of the model f1i show the influence of optimality robustness penalty of the objective itself the membership of the model fmo reflects the integrative effect of the tradeoff from multiple objectives and the robustness penalty of the system from the comparison of the memberships from single objective models and multi objective model the leading factor of indicator change can be revealed here the rations of the indicator memberships from the multi objective model and the single objective models are calculated as a way to quantify the influence the biggest memberships for net benefits total water consumption co2 emission gini coefficient and esv from single objective models are 0 74 0 89 0 44 0 88 and 0 97 the ratios for all indicators are 0 42 0 58 0 70 0 38 0 32 0 81 and 1 therefore regarding single objective the optimality robustness of co2 emission is low aimed at multi objective model the influence of the tradeoff among objectives and the optimality robustness of other objectives is relatively remarkable especially for net benefits gini coefficient and esv the feasibility robustness penalty from randomness and fuzziness is low meaning the system possessed high feasibility for decision makers high membership of single objective model means that it is easy to achieve ideal goal for the indicator which can reflect the reasonability of the bounds set by decision makers for example the tov of co2 emission is too high for the system although the system has the potential to reach the tov it is hard to maintain stable due to its low optimality robustness table 13 shows the expected objective values in different hydrological years and the optimality and feasibility robustness penalty from randomness and fuzziness obtained from the established multi objective model with the reduction of available surface water the feasibility of randomness and fuzziness increases the agricultural system faces severe shortage risk of surface water and groundwater especially in extreme arid years which is harmful to the sustainable development therefore it is an efficient way to improve sustainability by enhancing the drought resistance ability compared with the influence of randomness the fuzziness has bigger influence on the optimality of the system hence the decision makers should pay attention to the reduce the fuzziness of the agricultural production including clarifying the groundwater exploitation and so on 4 6 model potential and limitation although the assumptions and simplifications are necessary for the effectiveness and efficiency of the optimization framework there are still some limitations as mentioned before the optimization model framework combines the agricultural sustainable development and the water and energy flow although the concept of the framework is generalized the detailed description of the optimization model could have specificity according to the reality of study area in this study two main aspects should be analyzed to help enhance the performance of the developed framework one is the objectives and constraints the model considered the other one is the depiction of the hydrological processes although we have concluded and extracted the main sustainable indicators and agricultural activities from previous studies several factors are valuable as supplement for example the employment supplied by the irrigated agriculture is a salient indicator of social sustainability the virtual water trade related with the export of crops is also an area of active research advantaged irrigation practices including sprinkling irrigation and trickle irrigation have a huge influence on the agricultural water and energy usage structure the study considering these factors has tremendous potential the description of water cycle may be quite different for different regions the general water cycle and energy flow has been established as shown in fig 3 nonetheless there may be some extra situations happening first the rainfall into river and canals is ignored due to low precipitation in the study area however underestimate its recharge to surface water may cause huge error in water balance calculation another challenge is the water exchange near river it is difficult to describe the water movement between river and groundwater as well as between river and soil because of the high spatial temporal variability finally for the irrigation area with saline alkali soil or paddy field the irrigation return flow is an important part of water resources that is not utilized by the irrigation system which is ignored in the study 5 conclusions aimed at sustainable development of irrigated agricultural production a distributed resources allocation model based on water food energy nexus was built economic social and ecological factors were integrated for consideration to help promote agricultural sustainability in order to deal with uncertainty in its practical application integrated robust stochastic possibilistic multi objective programming was proposed the advantages of the developed model over previous methods in agricultural resources management are 1 it synthesizes interactive activities among social economic ecological and resources dimensions during agricultural production and balances multiple competing goals to guarantee sustainable development 2 considering the key function of canal systems in delivering water and effects on water use efficiency and allocation equity the distributional feature of canal systems was extracted and embedded into the optimization structure making strategies more reliable 3 faced with uncertainty that is widespread in the nature economy and society the proposed programming algorithm can tackle tradeoff among multiple objectives maintain robustness under random and fuzzy factors and reflect the sensitivity of the model to different kinds of uncertainty the optimization structure was applied to an irrigated agricultural region in northwestern china the results show that the model can provide detailed distributed water and energy allocation strategies under different random scenarios further canal water efficiency could be improved and groundwater depth could be controlled to help ecological restoration by adjusting allocation of surface and underground water and reducing the proportion of groundwater exploitation on the premise of guaranteed economic benefits meanwhile according to robustness analysis fuzzy parameters will reduce optimality robustness and the extreme dry years face the highest optimality risk except for extreme wet years other scenarios have risks in surface water deficit especially in extreme dry years therefore decision makers can not only recognize risk of water deficit and goal value reliability based on robustness analysis but also distinguish ecological fragile irrigation regions according to water use proportion the model can also be adapted to meet various goal preferences of different stakeholders by adjusting objective satisfaction intervals in conclusion the developed model and algorithm in this study can provide powerful support to agricultural sustainable development credit authorship contribution statement shanshan guo

3646,evapotranspiration et estimation models can be broadly classified as statistical or physical process based models however assuming the limitation of individual approaches the integration of these two approaches has become a challenging task for et simulation under varying surface and climatic conditions to address this issue a revised penman monteith pm formula that uses a non linear exponential clausius clapeyron relationship was proposed in this study the improved pm formula was further coupled into the loss function of the deep learning dl model and subsequently a hybrid dl model was formulated the hybrid dl model with improved physical conceptualization considered the constraints of surface energy balance and turbulent diffusion processes in the et simulation the performance of the hybrid dl model was verified at 212 flux sites from the fluxnet that contain ten types of underlying surfaces across the globe the results revealed that as compared to the original dl model the hybrid dl model improved the predictive capability of et the average root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage difference mapd reduced by 12 1 w m2 and 5 7 respectively for latent heat flux le simulation furthermore the hybrid dl model also performed better than the original dl model in predicting the extreme events such as et under drought and heatwave conditions which justifying its improved generalization capability sensitivity analysis outcomes showed that the vegetation parameters highest influence for et simulations at the 212 flux sites followed by soil parameters and meteorological parameters the hybrid dl model was further applied to map the inter seasonal distribution of global et across twelve months of the year 2015 with five global et products as the benchmark certainly this research achieved the seamless integration of machine learning based et model and physical mechanism based et model and provided a new dimension for et simulation the hybrid dl model could be adopted to generate continuous et datasets across regional and global scales keywords deep learning evapotranspiration penman monteith method hybrid deep learning model physical process description surface energy balance 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is the major hydrological variable that exhibits a pivotal role between the global hydrological cycle and surface energy budget wang and dickinson 2012 xu et al 2018 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b chen et al 2021 for technical guidance in precision irrigation drought prediction and climate change impact assessment on the hydrological cycle accurate quantification of et is of great significance huxman et al 2004 kool et al 2014 chen et al 2020b dash et al 2021 in the past decades researchers have attempted to develop various model conceptualizations to simulate et at site and regional scales e g jung et al 2010 wang and dickinson 2012 carlson et al 1994 yang et al 2015 faridatul et al 2020 shang et al 2021 broadly these et models could be categorized as physical processes based models and statistical based models the physical processes based models usually parameterize et through the surface energy balance constraint and characterization of the water vapor diffusion processes e g chen and liu 2020 yang et al 2015 the different physical conceptualization of these et models include 1 parameterizing et based on the aerodynamic conductance ga and surface conductance gs concepts such as penman monteith pm model penman 1948 monteith 1965 mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 2 parameterizing et using the surface energy balance equation such as surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model bastiaanssen et al 1998 and two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 3 parameterizing et through the construction of land surface temperature and vegetation index feature space such as two source trapezoid model for evapotranspiration ttme long and singh 2012 and mapping evapotranspiration with high resolution and internalized calibration metric model allen et al 2007 these et models are characterized by concrete physical conceptualization and their performance has been extensively validated across varying climatic and surface conditions e g choi et al 2009 tang et al 2011 yongmin et al 2018 chen et al 2021 however a notable limitation of the physical processes based et model lies in the empirical way of determining the key parameters such as various impedance parameters that causes substantial uncertainty to the model outcomes especially in global scale applications mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 furthermore the requirement of large number of ground meteorological and remote sensing input datasets in conjunction with complex model operation constrains the application of physical process based models long and singh 2012 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b chen et al 2021 unlike the physical processes based model the statistical based models simulate et by establishing linear or non linear relationship between the observed et and various input variables jung et al 2009 jung et al 2010 tramontana et al 2016 yin et al 2021 fu et al 2021 the statistical et models can be classified as empirical semi empirical models e g wang et al 2007 and machine learning models e g feng et al 2017a feng et al 2017b chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b since the statistical models are based on the data driven conceptualization they can be easily operated by less skilled operators and applied on a global scale jung et al 2010 furthermore under the availability of future climate change projection information the statistical models could predict et with reasonable accuracy maqsood et al 2021 in general the representative statistical based et models include linear non linear regression models khanmohammadi et al 2018 neural network models liu et al 2020 deep learning models cui et al 2021 random forest models chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b and support vector machine models ashrafzadeh et al 2020 however one limitation of the statistical based et model is that it performs poorly in prediction of extreme et events such as et in extremely drought and heatwave conditions and extension of et simulation outside of the calibration period is highly uncertain in case of the statistical models tramontana et al 2016 furthermore since the statistical model is characterized by the black box fitting process the errors in the model results cannot be adequately traced and explained thereby making the determination of input data sensitivity quite difficult ebert uphoff et al 2019 sun and scanlon 2019 last as the statistical et models do not follow the energy balance equation they lead to the unreasonable et predictions in some conditions such as the latent heat flux le is larger than the net radiation flux rn a recent study demonstrated that the et models based on the physical mechanism and the statistical relationship may not be replaced by each other under all sorts of climate and topographic conditions reichstein et al 2019 conversely coupling the internal mechanism of these two type of et models is a more promising way and challenging solution which in turn attracted wide attention from the agriculture hydrology meteorology and geosciences communities reichstein et al 2019 in the past researchers have made significant attempt to integrate the physical process and statistical models for example dwelle et al 2019 used machine learning approach to build a surrogate model for et simulation reichstein et al 2019 applied the machine learning model to correct the deviations between the simulated et values by physical models and measured et values however there still lacks relevant research on building an efficient hybrid model wherein package the physical constraints into a certain layer of neural network or add the physical constraints to the loss function as a penalty term reichstein et al 2019 compared with the solution of using machine learning as surrogate model the hybrid model conceptualization is more in accordance with the prospects that enrich the artificial intelligence with physical awareness jiang et al 2020 this is because the entire processes of hybrid model establishment is undertaken through unified machine learning architecture until now only a few studies attempted to build a hybrid model by packaging the analytical solution of the physical equation as a hidden layer in the neural network de bezenac et al 2019 wang et al 2020 however the coupling of physical processes into the loss function of the neural network is still hardly reported previous studies indicated that the coupling of physical processes into the loss function as a penalty term can achieve a more seamless hybrid model construction jiang et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 furthermore most of the previous studies emphasize hybrid models to predict rainfall or runoff with non stationary and random hydrological processes jiang et al 2020 whether these hybrid model can effectively improve the performance of et simulation is still unknown the pm method which considers both of the energy balance constraint and turbulent diffusion process has been widely used in various hydrological models land surface models and remote sensing based et models e g liang et al 1994 mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 novick et al 2016 hamman et al 2018 the pm method provides an explicit solution in et simulation and has the potential to be adopted as an ideal et parameterization scheme in coupled machine learning models monteith 1965 penman 1948 however the existing linear clausius clapeyron relationship in the pm method brings conceptualization errors into the et simulations first the linear clausius clapeyron relationship has greater uncertainty during nighttime and cold condition applications paw and gao 1988 second the pm approach is invalid under extreme surface conditions such as water limited condition gs and calm limited condition ga 0 mccoll 2020 mccoll 2020 suggested the linear clausius clapeyron relationship fails to capture es ts represent the saturated vapor pressure hpa at surface temperature under water limited condition and calm limited condition and results in significant errors in the et simulation under two extreme conditions therefore the current pm approach cannot be coupled directly into the machine learning models hence more accurate description of the clausius clapeyron relationship in a revised version of the pm method is highly essential therefore to achieve more accurate et simulation it is urgent to develop an integrated machine learning based and physical process based et model the present research was undertaken with the following specific objectives 1 to develop a hybrid deep learning dl model by coupling the improved pm formula with the loss function of the existing dl model 2 to investigate whether the hybrid dl model can accurately predict the et under extreme conditions and have the generalization ability 3 to investigate whether the hybrid dl model is competent enough to map the spatial variation of et 2 methodology 2 1 deep learning framework first the existing dl model was constructed to simulate the latent heat flux le w m2 the dl model was based on the concept of neural networks with multi layer perceptions ivakhnenko and lapa 1966 the total number of perceptions layers present in a given dl model is characterized in terms of the depth the conventional shallow neural network models contain only one or two hidden layers such as artificial intelligence neural network ann model but the total layers of the dl model can range between tens to hundreds chollet 2017 the performance of dl model is proven to be better than the ann model in most cases however the requirement of large amount of computing resources in case of the dl model is regarded as the main constraint in its applications shang et al 2021 a typical dl model consists of multiple layers of network a loss function and an optimizer reichstein et al 2019 the weight for a specific parameter represents the importance and contribution of that individual parameter in the entire neural network in the optimization process of the dl model the loss function was used to adjust the weights in individual layers of the neural network in order to reduce the difference between the predicted le and the observed le granata and nunno 2021 the entire parameter optimization processes in the dl model were performed through the back error propagation mechanism as suggested by benvenuto and piazza 1992 the specific forward and back propagation processes in dl model please refer to supplemental information for individual iteration of the optimization of the dl model the loss value will gradually decrease as the weight of each layer is updated the loss represents the difference between the predicted value and the observed value in the machine learning models when the loss value reaches to its minimum the corresponding prediction value in this case is considered as the final output of the dl model shang et al 2021 in order to avoid overfitting of the dl model the number of hidden layers were varied in the range of 7 100 to decide the optimum number of hidden layers as a consequence the dl model with 35 hidden layers has the best le simulation accuracy as evidenced from lowest root mean square error rmse a structured schematic diagram of the existing dl model with 37 layers is shown in fig 1 a an input layer that directly connect to the various input variables 35 hidden layers and an output layer that provides target prediction with one neuron all observation datasets were shuffled across different observation time and test sites to divide the entire datasets into three analysis periods 62 of training dataset 18 of validation dataset and 20 of test dataset in the training process of the existing dl model the rmse was selected as the loss function it should be noted that if the existing dl model is used to predict the le under the given net radiant flux rn and soil heat flux g the surface energy balance may not be ensured the surface energy loss is about 70 w m2 according to the calculations 2 2 hybrid dl model formulation the hybrid model is formulated by coupling the dl model and the modified pm method mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 the surface conductance gs in the pm method determines the water vapor and energy exchange between the ground surface and the atmosphere the gs is controlled by the joint effect of meteorological factors soil factors and vegetation factors a large number of studies suggested that the gs is the main source of uncertainty in the pm method e g jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 raupach 2001 scheff frierson 2013 in the hybrid dl model the existing dl model was used to predict the gs subsequently input the predicted gs to the revised pm method to compute le by calculating the error between the predicted le by the revised pm method and the observed le the weight parameters in the dl model were constantly adjusted to correct the gs predictions moreover due to the introduction of the concept of energy balance the hybrid dl model requires additional inputs of rn and g fig 1 b shows the structure of the proposed hybrid dl model the conventional pm method considers the ground surface as a big leaf to describe the water vapor and energy exchange between the ground surface and the atmosphere as mentioned before the primary limitation of the pm method is that the linearization scheme of the clausius clapeyron relationship lead to large errors for the le simulations monteith 1965 penman 1948 to solve this issue we developed an improved pm method that used a modified version of the clausius clapeyron relationship for le simulation monteith 1965 penman 1948 vallis et al 2019 further the improved pm method was coupled into the loss function of the conventional dl model so as to ensure that the hybrid dl model is constrained by the energy budget and turbulent diffusion processes the following details describe the entire parametric scheme adopted in the hybrid dl model the original pm method and the surface energy balance equation are presented in the eqs 1 and 2 respectively penman 1948 monteith 1965 1 le δ r n g ρ c p v p d g a δ γ 1 g a g s

saturated vapor pressure hpa at temperature ta to reduce the uncertainty in the linear transformation of the original clausius clapeyron relationship significant efforts have been made to propose a second order or a quartic order taylor expansion form of the clausius clapeyron relationship baldocchi et al 2005 milly 1991 paw and gao 1988 however these methods are effective in the daytime while rn g is greater than 0 but will lead to large errors in the nighttime when rn g is smaller than 0 mccoll 2020 to develop a universal solution of the pm method that can accurately estimate et under various conditions all values of rn g the approach suggested by vallis et al 2019 was used in this study to establish an exponential relationship between es ts and es ta as shown in eq 4 4 e s t s e s t a exp λ c p t a 2 t s t a while both eqs 3 and 4 are reasonable under the smaller ta ts but the revised clausius clapeyron relationship eq 4 is more reliable when ta ts is higher in eq 4 when the exponential term changes linearly with the air temperature exp x 1 x near x 0 the expression of the revised clausius clapeyron relationship is same as the linear version eq 3 therefore the revised clausius clapeyron relationship doesn t need any additional assumptions parameters and inputs the h in the energy balance equation is parameterized as the temperature gradient between the ground surface and the air shown as eq 5 su 2002 5 h ρ c p g a t s t a incorporating eqs 4 and 5 into eq 2 the revised version of the surface energy balance equation can be re written as eq 6 6 r n g ρ λ g s

in the hybrid dl model is presented in eq 8 note that the eq 8 looks similar to the rmse loss function in the conventional dl model however the predicted le le w m2 in eq 8 is calculated using the revised pm method coupled with gs as predicted by the dl model 8 l o s s l e l e 1 n i 1 n l e l e 2 where n is the total number of samples le is the predicted value w m2 and le is the true value w m2 2 3 data source 2 3 1 flux data source the observed et and various input variables at the 212 eddy correlation ec sites from the fluxnet for the period 2014 2015 were used for the training verification and testing of the existing dl and hybrid dl models https fluxnet fluxdata org data download data these flux stations contain a wide range of vegetation surfaces and provides rich water and heat transfer information generally the vegetation cover types from the 212 ec sites can be divided into ten categories barren or sparsely vegetated bsv woody savannas ws mixed forests mf deciduous broad leaved forests dbf evergreen broad leaved forests ebf closed shrublands cs open shrublands os savannas sns grasslands gl and croplands cl fig 2 shows the geographic location of 212 flux sites used in this study in all of the 212 ec sites the observation frequency of water vapor concentration and wind speed are both 10 hz and et is calculated as the fluctuating covariance of water vapor concentration and wind speed every half hour in addition to the et observation these flux sites also provide continuous measurements of rn and g every half hour moreover since part of et observation data is inaccurate and unreliable we have formulated a strict flux data screening criterion as given by reichstein et al 2005 first the flux data measured on rainy days were excluded because the sensor signal response of the open path ec system is affected by precipitation second the flux data with ec energy closure ratio defined as le h rn g less than 0 8 were excluded it should be noted that we did not exclude the nighttime le and negative le values this is because the improved pm formula has the ability to predict le at nighttime and under the condition of rn g 0 for all of the half hour flux data selected for the dl model training verification and testing used bowen ratio method to correct the energy balance closure twine et al 2000 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b 2 3

et al 2020b cui et al 2021 specifically six types of meteorological data including the air temperature ta relative humidity rh radiation ra horizontal wind speed u vapor pressure difference vpd and co2 concentration ca were continuously observed at the 212 sites furthermore the measured surface soil water content swc data was adopted from the fluxnet tier 1 dataset for vegetation characteristics

that the lai remains unchanged during the 8 days of observation period mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov the vegetation height hc data was retrieved from the geoscience laser altimeter system glas using the procedure proposed by chen 2010 for satellite based lai and hc observations the pixel values were extracted according to the geographic location of the 212 flux sites table 1 present the specific information of the 11 input variables for existing dl and hybrid dl models to improve the efficiency of the dl model training the average and standard deviation of all input variables were calculated and normalized before the model application 2 4 model performance evaluation total of 9 input variables excluding the rn and g were involved in the existing and hybrid dl models to generate 502 variable combinations vc to provide a comprehensive evaluation and understanding of the impact of different input variables on the final le predictions we iteratively adopted 502 vcs in the existing and hybrid dl models for training verification and testing furthermore four statistical parameters were used to evaluate the performance of the existing and hybrid dl models under different variable combinations including the rmse bias coefficient of determination r2 and mean absolute percentage difference mapd the rmse and mapd were used to evaluate the absolute deviation between the simulated and the measured et value r2 was used to evaluate the degree of fit for the simulated and the measured et value and bias was used to quantify the over underestimation as compared to the measured et values 3 results and analysis in this section we focus on testing the hybrid dl model performance in four aspects 1 the performance of the hybrid dl model in et simulation and comparison with existing dl model and six classic machine learning models 2 the generalized performance of the hybrid dl model and its prediction ability under extreme et conditions 3 the performance of the hybrid dl model in mapping spatial distribution of et in global scale and 4 sensitivity of different input parameters for the et simulation in hybrid dl model 3 1 evaluation of hybrid dl model performance in et simulation since the hybrid dl model was modified from the existing dl model it is necessary to compare the performance of the hybrid dl model with the existing dl model to understand the effectiveness of coupled physical process in model conceptualization to ensure the unbiased model comparison the measured rn and g were also used as input for the existing dl model training but the energy balance may not be guaranteed in this case we selected six vcs for the existing and hybrid dl models among the 502 vcs based on the lower rmse and mapd values the rmse for the selected six vcs were less than 70 w m2 and mapd were less than 18 for existing and hybrid dl models as envisaged from figs 3 and 4 the best le simulation accuracy for the existing dl model and hybrid dl model were obtained by vc 1 with all of the nine input variables when part of the meteorological input variables such as u rh and vpd were missing the performance of the two dl models were gradually reduced refer to tables 2 and s1 however both the existing and hybrid dl models exhibited high errors in case of lacking in the soil and vegetation data such as swc hc and lai inter comparison the performance between the two dl models justified the hybrid dl model improved capability in le simulation for the hybrid dl model the rmse values range between 41 3 and 56 9 w m2 with an average value of 49 3 w m2 54 2 68 2 w m2 with an average estimate of 61 4 w m2 for the existing dl model mapd values range between 5 2 and 14 6 with an average value of 9 1 11 8 17 6 with an average value of 14 8 for the existing dl model under six vcs in summary when the revised pm method was coupled into the loss function of the existing dl model the average rmse reduced 12 1 w m2 and the average mapd reduced 5 7 for the six vcs moreover the bias estimates revealed that the existing dl model tends to underestimate the le in most cases the bias values range between 4 3 and 5 1 w m2 with an average value of 0 5 w m2 for the hybrid dl model under six vcs 18 1 7 8 w m2 with an average value of 6 4 w m2 for the existing dl model surprisingly the r2 values obtained by the hybrid dl model were lower than the existing dl model the r2 values range between 0 79 and 0 88 with an average value of 0 84 for the hybrid dl model under six vcs 0 83 0 91 with an average value of 0 87 for the existing dl model a possible reason could be that the existing dl model only set the closest fitting of simulated and measured le as the optimization target but not constraint the energy balance and turbulent diffusion processes in the model conceptualization thereby leading to a higher r2 value note that a higher r2 does not necessarily mean a better model performance therefore model selection and evaluation using a variety of statistical parameters is important long and singh 2013 dash et al 2020 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b to have a clear insight about the robustness of the hybrid dl model 100 repeated simulations were performed using the existing and hybrid dl models under vc 1 the testing results revealed that the rmse and mapd values obtained by the hybrid dl model were lower than the existing dl model in 89 simulations but slightly higher in the remaining 11 simulations the average rmse and mapd for the hybrid dl model in the 100 simulations were 41 3 w m2 and 5 2 respectively 54 2 w m2 and 11 8 respectively for the existing dl model in addition to the testing period the better performance of the hybrid dl model over the existing dl model also reflected in the cross validations for the training period the average rmse r2 bias and mapd in the 100 simulations were 38 5 w m2 0 84 1 3 w m2 and 6 4 respectively for the hybrid dl model 55 1 w m2 0 87 10 1 w m2 and 12 3 respectively for the existing dl model for the validation period the average rmse r2 bias and mapd in 100 simulations were 39 2 w m2 0 83 1 6 w m2 and 6 8 respectively for the hybrid dl model 55 9 w m2 0 86 11 2 w m2 and 12 8 respectively for the existing dl model to have a comprehensive understanding of the performance of the hybrid dl model the le prediction by the hybrid dl model was further compared with the six classic machine learning models support vector regression svr chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b random forest rf feng et al 2017a feng et al 2017b xgboost fan et al 2018 back propagation neural network bpnn traore et al 2014 extreme learning machine elm feng et al 2017a feng et al 2017b and convolutional neural networks cnn patrícia et al 2020 the seven machine learning models including the hybrid dl model used the same training validation and testing datasets from fig 5 the six machine learning models svr rf bpnn xgboost elm and cnn exhibited inferior performance to the proposed hybrid dl model although the r2 value for some of the machine learning models higher than the hybrid dl model rf xgboost elm and cnn the rmse and mapd estimates of the hybrid dl model were significantly lower than the six classic machine learning models 3 2 generalization performance of hybrid dl model the generalization capability reflect the adaptability of the machine learning models to a wide range of simulation scenarios which is important in hybrid dl model application kak 1998 msa et al 2020 in order to test the generalization capability of the hybrid dl model the two dl models were compared for their prediction ability of extreme events to achieve this we set 0 to1st percentile and 99 100th percentile of various input variables to provide extreme simulation scenarios for example 0 to1st percentile of ta represent the extreme cold condition and 99 100th percentile of ta represent the heat wave condition similarly 0 to1st percentile of swc represent the extreme drought condition and 99 100st percentile of swc represent the extreme wet condition fig 6 illustrates an example of the time series of le predicted by the two dl models in four ec sites under extreme events a extreme drought b heat wave c low lai d cloudy for the prediction of extreme drought events 0 to1st percentile of swc the testing results suggested that the performance of the hybrid dl model was significantly better than the existing dl model the r2 and rmse estimates were 0 70 and 49 7 w m2 for the hybrid dl model in prediction of et under extreme drought events 0 28 and 100 2 w m2 for the existing dl model the robust testing performance of the hybrid dl model was also detected under heat wave condition the r2 and rmse estimates were 0 65 and 56 3 w m2 for the hybrid dl model under heat wave condition 0 22 and 107 4 w m2 for the existing dl model moreover the bias statistics indicated that the existing dl model significantly underestimated the le under heat wave condition bias of 96 9 w m2 conversely the existing dl model significantly overestimated the le under extreme drought condition bias of 102 2 w m2 the hybrid dl model which was coupled with the physical dynamics of et successfully captured the crests and troughs of le time series in these two extreme scenarios bias of 10 8 w m2 for heat wave condition and bias of 2 1 w m2 for drought condition the stronger generalization ability of the hybrid dl model also reflected in prediction of le under 0 to1st percentile of lai and ra specifically the r2 rmse and bias estimates were 0 57 48 4 w m2 and 6 4 w m2 respectively for the hybrid dl model under 0 to1st percentile of lai 0 25 106 7 w m2 and 94 1 w m2 respectively for the existing dl model the r2 rmse and bias were 0 61 51 6 w m2 and 3 2 w m2 respectively for the hybrid dl model under 0 to1st percentile of ra 0 17 134 8 w m2 and 106 7 w m2 respectively for the existing dl model these results prove that the hybrid dl model has a great potential in providing reliable le predictions under the low lai and cloudy days however the higher rmse and absolute of bias values indicated that the existing dl model performs poorly and significantly overestimated le in these two extreme scenarios 3 3 the contribution of different input variables to le simulation determining the contribution of different input parameters to le simulation is of great significance for further improving the performance of hybrid dl model in le prediction here the importance of different variables was expressed as percentage wherein percentage close to 100 reveals that the variable is important for the simulation of le and vice versa cui et al 2021 shang et al 2021 in general the contribution of vegetation parameters were slightly higher than that of the soil variables while the influence of atmospheric parameters on le simulations were the lowest fig s1 specifically the mean relative contribution of the nine input variables under ten vegetation types were decreased in the order of hc 77 3 lai 72 6 swc 71 1 ta 65 7 ra 51 4 vpd 46 2 ca 39 7 rh 27 2 and u 11 9 the strong influence of swc on the surface conductance and le has been widely reported by previous studies e g seneviratne et al 2006 dirmeyer 2011 gentine et al 2012 however the high contribution of hc on le prediction was only recently recognized and yet to be verified thoroughly groh et al 2019 klein et al 2015 the findings of this study demonstrated that the importance of hc was even larger than swc which could be due to the fact that the hc is closely related to the vegetation water content and rate of vegetation transpiration further all the 212 flux sites used in this study are classified as vegetation coverage sites hence lack of non vegetation coverage sites led le to be more sensitive to vegetation attribute parameters only the rh and u exhibited little effects on le simulation which signifies that the hybrid dl model is also applicable for areas lacking observations of rh and u 3 4 can the hybrid dl model efficiently map the spatial variation of et the above testing results demonstrated that the systematic coupling between the existing dl model and the physical process description could improve the et prediction capability in a wide range of surface conditions at site scale applications however the site scale et predictions mainly reflected the perception capability of the hybrid dl model but its deductive ability could not be well demonstrated jiang et al 2020 to gain further insight about whether the hybrid dl model can appropriately map the et spatial distribution is of great interest this can serve as a direct evidence that a hybrid dl model has greater simulation ability under varying climates and surface conditions to achieve this objective the hybrid dl model was further applied to map the et distribution in global scale the global daily meteorological data sets were downloaded from the era5 reanalysis datasets josey et al 2018 dou et al 2020 the global lai and hc data were obtained from the 8 day mcd15a2h and glas products respectively chen 2010 mu et al 2011 the global monthly swc data was retrieved from the climate change initiative cci product of the european space agency esa all the input data sets were resampled to a spatial resolution of 5 km 5 km hollmann et al 2013 as envisaged in fig 7a 7c the le gradually decreased from low latitudes to high latitudes regions furthermore the larger le values were observed in areas with high vegetation coverage and the smaller le values were pre dominant in low vegetation coverage areas for example the larger le were mainly confined to the amazon plain region southern african savannah and the south east asian archipelago corresponding to the higher lai and hc in these areas generally the spatial pattern of le was consistent with the previous global et studies e g jung et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 zeng et al 2012 further to justify the robustness of the hybrid dl model the accuracy of the global et predicted by the hybrid dl model were compared with several other global et products at the 134 ec sites from the fluxnet 2015 these et products include modis mod16 product mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 breathing earth system simulator product bess jiang and ryu 2016 priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl product fisher et al 2015 global land surface evaporation the amsterdam methodology gleam product miralles et al 2010 and atmospheric land exchange inverse alexi product anderson et al 2012 the comparison results suggested that the hybrid dl model and modis mod16 et model performed better than the remaining four et models fig s2 and table 3 furthermore although both the hybrid dl model and the modis mod16 model are based on the pm method conceptualization inter comparison the performance between the two models demonstrated the superiority of the hybrid dl model that couples machine learning and et physical dynamics over the mod16 model that only relies on modified pm method rmse of 42 7 w m2 for the hybrid dl model and rmse of 49 1 w m2 for the mod16 model these promising results confirmed that the hybrid dl model not only well undertakes the task of et prediction in site scale but also can be used for the prediction and mapping of regional et distribution which indicate that the hybrid dl model has great potential to generate et datasets at global and regional scales 4 discussion 4 1 advantages of the hybrid dl model the improved performance of the hybrid dl model for et prediction could be attributed to the following reasons 1 updating the loss function in the existing dl model previously the loss function of the neural network based models were defined as various error functions such as absolute value loss function log loss function square loss function and exponential loss function kording and wolpert 2004 clough et al 2019 although these loss functions have different manifestations they are essentially based on the quantification of the distance between the predicted value and the observed value reichstein et al 2019 these loss functions lead to a pure fitting relationship between various input variables and the et measurements the lack of physical process description enables these neural network based models to yield in mediocre performance in most of the cases especially for extreme et conditions e g khanmohammadi et al 2018 liu et al 2020 feng et al 2017a feng et al 2017b the model conceptualization of the hybrid dl model proposed herein accounted the physical process dynamics of et by coupling the modified pm method into the loss function to this end the hybrid dl model is no longer remained as a pure fitting conceptualization but has the ability to determine the et in a more physical way the robust verification performance confirmed the necessity of developing customized machine learning models in different application scenarios and the importance of enriching the machine learning models with the physical awareness 2 benefits of the improved pm method the original pm method used a linearization scheme of the clausius clapeyron relationship and proven to be inappropriate in some limiting conditions mccoll 2020 paw and gao 1988 most importantly the method struggles in the le simulation under condition of rn g 0 leading to non functionality of et simulation in the nighttime the new non linear exponential scheme of clausius clapeyron relationship proposed in this study can better describe the mutual feedback between the es ts and es ta the robust le prediction performance is a concrete evidence for the reliability of the improved pm method 3 the optimum hidden layers were well determined the determination of the number of hidden layers in the dl model is a key step to achieve high precision et simulation cui et al 2021 shang et al 2021 in this study we found that the rmse ranged between 41 3 and 112 6 w m2 by vc 1 when the number of hidden layers varied between 7 and 100 a wide range of rmse variation indicated that the pre training verification processes of the dl model using different hidden layer number are quite essential in order to distinguish the contribution of the coupling physical mechanism and revised p m formula for the accuracy improvement of the existing dl model we set three simulation scenarios case 1 the hybrid dl model with original p m formula case 2 the hybrid dl model with revised p m formula case 3 the existing dl model the three simulation scenarios were performed 100 repeated simulations the verification results indicated that the average rmse of case 2 was reduced by 12 9 w m2 as compared to case 3 and the average rmse of case 1 was reduced by 10 2 w m2 as compared to case 3 this is certainly a convincing evidence that coupling physical mechanisms rather than the revised p m formula is the main contribution for improvement in the accuracy of the existing dl model 4 2 primary uncertainties of hybrid dl model in et prediction although the hybrid dl model demonstrated robust et prediction performance there are still several limitations and uncertainties in the model conceptualization the first limitation existing in all the machine learning based et models where the machine learning model requires a large number of training datasets to obtain the reliable et forecasts cui et al 2021 shang et al 2021 the low quantity and poor quality training samples significantly reduce the accuracy of the et predictions jiang et al 2020 feng et al 2017a feng et al 2017b however in real practice it is difficult to meet good quality and large quantitative requirements of training samples which brings greater uncertainty to the model performance for example the ec system under weaker turbulence condition will lead to significant et observation errors furthermore only 68 of the measured et data sets to be used for model training verification and testing after implementing data screening strategy refer to section 2 3 1 notably the dataset used here was retrieved from the 212 flux sites across the world ensuring availability of considerable amount of data for analysis even under strict data screening operation however when applying the hybrid dl model to a watershed or regional scale that contains only limited flux sites the performance of the model will reduced due to less availability of the measured et data the second uncertainty is the spatial scale overfitting problem associated with the machine learning model meyer et al 2018 meyer et al 2016 which means that the machine learning model can accurately predict the et time series at point scale applications but there will be substantial errors in mapping the spatial distribution of et according to the uncertainty analysis the 8 day mcd15a2h lai product in the hybrid dl model caused numerous prediction outliers which could be due to the assumption that the lai remains unchanged within 8 days observation period however the lai changes slightly in 8 days observation period in reality the third uncertainty is the spatial mismatch of various input data sources and le observations for example the spatial resolution of hc measurements based on the glas was 1000 m chen 2010 and the spatial resolution of mcd15a2h derived lai product was 500 m mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 however the observed le flux footprint varied from tens to thousands of meters chen et al 2009 which lead to the footprint of measured le can t well match the lai and hc in pixel scale application the spatial mismatch of the input variables and measured le lead to the erroneous capture of spatial information thereby bringing unpredictable errors to the establishment of the non linear relationship between measured le and various input variables finally the observation error from the ec system cannot be ignored which creates substantial uncertainty during the analysis foken 2008 the characteristics of the ec system make it unsuitable to capture the large eddies however small eddies can be captured reasonably and causing energy closure problem although the bowen ratio method was used in this study to correct the energy closure issue twine et al 2000 it cannot fully solve the le observation error of the ec system 4 3 towards smarter dl model for et simulation this study coupled the modified pm method to the loss function of the dl model and the physical process description of et was seamlessly merged into the existing dl model architecture taking into account the flexibility and scalability of the dl model the developed hybrid dl model is not an unchangeable template for example the loss function can be coupled into any neural network based machine learning models such as the ann bpnn elm and cnn moreover if the big leaf hypothesis in the pm method is replaced with the shuttleworth wallace s w model which based on the theory of dual source energy balance shuttleworth and wallace 1985 shuttleworth and gurney 1990 the hybrid dl model will have the capability to predict et components such as soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration furthermore as mentioned before another way to build a hybrid model is to package the physical equations into a certain layer of the neural network model jiang et al 2020 to this end subsequent research can build a more in depth physically based hybrid model which not only couple the pm method into the loss function but also incorporate the pm method into the input layers of the neural network architecture this deeply integrated model architectures may further enhance the et predictive ability in addition to solving the one dimensional equation in the energy balance equation eq 6 the coupling of partial differential equations in the dl framework and the realization of three dimensional numerical simulations have been widely explored sirignano and spiliopoulos 2018 in the past few decades the dl model has emerged to be a powerful tool in solving partial differential equations sirignano and spiliopoulos 2018 for instance the cnn model that relies on iterative convolution operations is a prospective solution that combines deep learning neural networks with high dimensional dynamic conceptualization schemes de oliveira e lucas et al 2020 keeping the above advancements in mind simulation of diffusion processes of et in three dimensional space is not an unreachable dream last the future research may further encode rainfall and runoff modules in the loss function so as to address the existing constraint of water balance on et simulation integrating energy balance water balance and turbulent diffusion processes provide opportunities for further improvement in the representation of physical processes in et simulation 5 conclusions this research developed a hybrid deep learning dl model to predict evapotranspiration et by coupling the improved penman monteith pm method to the loss function of the dl model the improved pm method was based on a non linear exponential clausius clapeyron relationship over the linear exponential clausius clapeyron relationship in the original pm method the hybrid dl model combines the characteristics of both statistical based et model and physical process based et model the performance of the newly proposed hybrid dl model was verified at the 212 flux sites from the fluxnet 2015 that contain ten types of vegetation surfaces across the globe the simulation outcomes of the hybrid dl model were further compared with six classic machine learning models and subsequently the global et distribution was mapped by the hybrid dl model the specific conclusions and findings of this research are as follows 1 as compared to the existing dl model the hybrid dl model exhibited improved capability for et prediction with average root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage difference mapd values for the six variable combinations vcs were reduced by 12 1 w m2 and 5 7 however the stronger fitting ability of the existing dl model resulted in higher coefficient of determination r2 value than the hybrid dl model moreover the hybrid dl model outperformed the six classic machine learning models svr rf bpnn xgboost elm and cnn in et simulation 2 the hybrid dl model exhibited strong generalization ability and could accurately predict the et under extreme scenarios of drought heat wave low leaf area index lai and cloudy sky under these four extreme scenarios the existing dl model were characterized by large errors and significant over underestimation issues while the hybrid dl model successful predicted the peak and trough of the et time series 3 for global scale et simulation the vegetation parameters has the greatest impact in hybrid dl model followed by the soil parameters and meteorological parameters 4 the hybrid dl model outperformed the five et products modis mod16 bess pt jpl gleam and alexi in global scale et mapping and demonstrated great potential for generating global and regional scale et datasets 5 the primary uncertainty of the hybrid dl model come from the low quantity and poor quality training samples spatial mismatch issue of various input sources and errors from eddy correlation ec based flux observations to further improve the performance of the hybrid dl model and enhance the model physical conceptualization subsequent research could replace the pm method with the shuttleworth wallace dual source approach or couple the water balance module in the loss function this research significantly reduced the uncertainty of et simulation in both site and regional scale by coupling the machine learning model with the physical process description the hybrid dl model is of great importance while evaluating the response of land surface et to climate change monitoring soil entropy and estimation of vegetation water consumption credit authorship

3646,evapotranspiration et estimation models can be broadly classified as statistical or physical process based models however assuming the limitation of individual approaches the integration of these two approaches has become a challenging task for et simulation under varying surface and climatic conditions to address this issue a revised penman monteith pm formula that uses a non linear exponential clausius clapeyron relationship was proposed in this study the improved pm formula was further coupled into the loss function of the deep learning dl model and subsequently a hybrid dl model was formulated the hybrid dl model with improved physical conceptualization considered the constraints of surface energy balance and turbulent diffusion processes in the et simulation the performance of the hybrid dl model was verified at 212 flux sites from the fluxnet that contain ten types of underlying surfaces across the globe the results revealed that as compared to the original dl model the hybrid dl model improved the predictive capability of et the average root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage difference mapd reduced by 12 1 w m2 and 5 7 respectively for latent heat flux le simulation furthermore the hybrid dl model also performed better than the original dl model in predicting the extreme events such as et under drought and heatwave conditions which justifying its improved generalization capability sensitivity analysis outcomes showed that the vegetation parameters highest influence for et simulations at the 212 flux sites followed by soil parameters and meteorological parameters the hybrid dl model was further applied to map the inter seasonal distribution of global et across twelve months of the year 2015 with five global et products as the benchmark certainly this research achieved the seamless integration of machine learning based et model and physical mechanism based et model and provided a new dimension for et simulation the hybrid dl model could be adopted to generate continuous et datasets across regional and global scales keywords deep learning evapotranspiration penman monteith method hybrid deep learning model physical process description surface energy balance 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is the major hydrological variable that exhibits a pivotal role between the global hydrological cycle and surface energy budget wang and dickinson 2012 xu et al 2018 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b chen et al 2021 for technical guidance in precision irrigation drought prediction and climate change impact assessment on the hydrological cycle accurate quantification of et is of great significance huxman et al 2004 kool et al 2014 chen et al 2020b dash et al 2021 in the past decades researchers have attempted to develop various model conceptualizations to simulate et at site and regional scales e g jung et al 2010 wang and dickinson 2012 carlson et al 1994 yang et al 2015 faridatul et al 2020 shang et al 2021 broadly these et models could be categorized as physical processes based models and statistical based models the physical processes based models usually parameterize et through the surface energy balance constraint and characterization of the water vapor diffusion processes e g chen and liu 2020 yang et al 2015 the different physical conceptualization of these et models include 1 parameterizing et based on the aerodynamic conductance ga and surface conductance gs concepts such as penman monteith pm model penman 1948 monteith 1965 mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 2 parameterizing et using the surface energy balance equation such as surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model bastiaanssen et al 1998 and two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 3 parameterizing et through the construction of land surface temperature and vegetation index feature space such as two source trapezoid model for evapotranspiration ttme long and singh 2012 and mapping evapotranspiration with high resolution and internalized calibration metric model allen et al 2007 these et models are characterized by concrete physical conceptualization and their performance has been extensively validated across varying climatic and surface conditions e g choi et al 2009 tang et al 2011 yongmin et al 2018 chen et al 2021 however a notable limitation of the physical processes based et model lies in the empirical way of determining the key parameters such as various impedance parameters that causes substantial uncertainty to the model outcomes especially in global scale applications mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 furthermore the requirement of large number of ground meteorological and remote sensing input datasets in conjunction with complex model operation constrains the application of physical process based models long and singh 2012 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b chen et al 2021 unlike the physical processes based model the statistical based models simulate et by establishing linear or non linear relationship between the observed et and various input variables jung et al 2009 jung et al 2010 tramontana et al 2016 yin et al 2021 fu et al 2021 the statistical et models can be classified as empirical semi empirical models e g wang et al 2007 and machine learning models e g feng et al 2017a feng et al 2017b chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b since the statistical models are based on the data driven conceptualization they can be easily operated by less skilled operators and applied on a global scale jung et al 2010 furthermore under the availability of future climate change projection information the statistical models could predict et with reasonable accuracy maqsood et al 2021 in general the representative statistical based et models include linear non linear regression models khanmohammadi et al 2018 neural network models liu et al 2020 deep learning models cui et al 2021 random forest models chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b and support vector machine models ashrafzadeh et al 2020 however one limitation of the statistical based et model is that it performs poorly in prediction of extreme et events such as et in extremely drought and heatwave conditions and extension of et simulation outside of the calibration period is highly uncertain in case of the statistical models tramontana et al 2016 furthermore since the statistical model is characterized by the black box fitting process the errors in the model results cannot be adequately traced and explained thereby making the determination of input data sensitivity quite difficult ebert uphoff et al 2019 sun and scanlon 2019 last as the statistical et models do not follow the energy balance equation they lead to the unreasonable et predictions in some conditions such as the latent heat flux le is larger than the net radiation flux rn a recent study demonstrated that the et models based on the physical mechanism and the statistical relationship may not be replaced by each other under all sorts of climate and topographic conditions reichstein et al 2019 conversely coupling the internal mechanism of these two type of et models is a more promising way and challenging solution which in turn attracted wide attention from the agriculture hydrology meteorology and geosciences communities reichstein et al 2019 in the past researchers have made significant attempt to integrate the physical process and statistical models for example dwelle et al 2019 used machine learning approach to build a surrogate model for et simulation reichstein et al 2019 applied the machine learning model to correct the deviations between the simulated et values by physical models and measured et values however there still lacks relevant research on building an efficient hybrid model wherein package the physical constraints into a certain layer of neural network or add the physical constraints to the loss function as a penalty term reichstein et al 2019 compared with the solution of using machine learning as surrogate model the hybrid model conceptualization is more in accordance with the prospects that enrich the artificial intelligence with physical awareness jiang et al 2020 this is because the entire processes of hybrid model establishment is undertaken through unified machine learning architecture until now only a few studies attempted to build a hybrid model by packaging the analytical solution of the physical equation as a hidden layer in the neural network de bezenac et al 2019 wang et al 2020 however the coupling of physical processes into the loss function of the neural network is still hardly reported previous studies indicated that the coupling of physical processes into the loss function as a penalty term can achieve a more seamless hybrid model construction jiang et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 furthermore most of the previous studies emphasize hybrid models to predict rainfall or runoff with non stationary and random hydrological processes jiang et al 2020 whether these hybrid model can effectively improve the performance of et simulation is still unknown the pm method which considers both of the energy balance constraint and turbulent diffusion process has been widely used in various hydrological models land surface models and remote sensing based et models e g liang et al 1994 mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 novick et al 2016 hamman et al 2018 the pm method provides an explicit solution in et simulation and has the potential to be adopted as an ideal et parameterization scheme in coupled machine learning models monteith 1965 penman 1948 however the existing linear clausius clapeyron relationship in the pm method brings conceptualization errors into the et simulations first the linear clausius clapeyron relationship has greater uncertainty during nighttime and cold condition applications paw and gao 1988 second the pm approach is invalid under extreme surface conditions such as water limited condition gs and calm limited condition ga 0 mccoll 2020 mccoll 2020 suggested the linear clausius clapeyron relationship fails to capture es ts represent the saturated vapor pressure hpa at surface temperature under water limited condition and calm limited condition and results in significant errors in the et simulation under two extreme conditions therefore the current pm approach cannot be coupled directly into the machine learning models hence more accurate description of the clausius clapeyron relationship in a revised version of the pm method is highly essential therefore to achieve more accurate et simulation it is urgent to develop an integrated machine learning based and physical process based et model the present research was undertaken with the following specific objectives 1 to develop a hybrid deep learning dl model by coupling the improved pm formula with the loss function of the existing dl model 2 to investigate whether the hybrid dl model can accurately predict the et under extreme conditions and have the generalization ability 3 to investigate whether the hybrid dl model is competent enough to map the spatial variation of et 2 methodology 2 1 deep learning framework first the existing dl model was constructed to simulate the latent heat flux le w m2 the dl model was based on the concept of neural networks with multi layer perceptions ivakhnenko and lapa 1966 the total number of perceptions layers present in a given dl model is characterized in terms of the depth the conventional shallow neural network models contain only one or two hidden layers such as artificial intelligence neural network ann model but the total layers of the dl model can range between tens to hundreds chollet 2017 the performance of dl model is proven to be better than the ann model in most cases however the requirement of large amount of computing resources in case of the dl model is regarded as the main constraint in its applications shang et al 2021 a typical dl model consists of multiple layers of network a loss function and an optimizer reichstein et al 2019 the weight for a specific parameter represents the importance and contribution of that individual parameter in the entire neural network in the optimization process of the dl model the loss function was used to adjust the weights in individual layers of the neural network in order to reduce the difference between the predicted le and the observed le granata and nunno 2021 the entire parameter optimization processes in the dl model were performed through the back error propagation mechanism as suggested by benvenuto and piazza 1992 the specific forward and back propagation processes in dl model please refer to supplemental information for individual iteration of the optimization of the dl model the loss value will gradually decrease as the weight of each layer is updated the loss represents the difference between the predicted value and the observed value in the machine learning models when the loss value reaches to its minimum the corresponding prediction value in this case is considered as the final output of the dl model shang et al 2021 in order to avoid overfitting of the dl model the number of hidden layers were varied in the range of 7 100 to decide the optimum number of hidden layers as a consequence the dl model with 35 hidden layers has the best le simulation accuracy as evidenced from lowest root mean square error rmse a structured schematic diagram of the existing dl model with 37 layers is shown in fig 1 a an input layer that directly connect to the various input variables 35 hidden layers and an output layer that provides target prediction with one neuron all observation datasets were shuffled across different observation time and test sites to divide the entire datasets into three analysis periods 62 of training dataset 18 of validation dataset and 20 of test dataset in the training process of the existing dl model the rmse was selected as the loss function it should be noted that if the existing dl model is used to predict the le under the given net radiant flux rn and soil heat flux g the surface energy balance may not be ensured the surface energy loss is about 70 w m2 according to the calculations 2 2 hybrid dl model formulation the hybrid model is formulated by coupling the dl model and the modified pm method mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 the surface conductance gs in the pm method determines the water vapor and energy exchange between the ground surface and the atmosphere the gs is controlled by the joint effect of meteorological factors soil factors and vegetation factors a large number of studies suggested that the gs is the main source of uncertainty in the pm method e g jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 raupach 2001 scheff frierson 2013 in the hybrid dl model the existing dl model was used to predict the gs subsequently input the predicted gs to the revised pm method to compute le by calculating the error between the predicted le by the revised pm method and the observed le the weight parameters in the dl model were constantly adjusted to correct the gs predictions moreover due to the introduction of the concept of energy balance the hybrid dl model requires additional inputs of rn and g fig 1 b shows the structure of the proposed hybrid dl model the conventional pm method considers the ground surface as a big leaf to describe the water vapor and energy exchange between the ground surface and the atmosphere as mentioned before the primary limitation of the pm method is that the linearization scheme of the clausius clapeyron relationship lead to large errors for the le simulations monteith 1965 penman 1948 to solve this issue we developed an improved pm method that used a modified version of the clausius clapeyron relationship for le simulation monteith 1965 penman 1948 vallis et al 2019 further the improved pm method was coupled into the loss function of the conventional dl model so as to ensure that the hybrid dl model is constrained by the energy budget and turbulent diffusion processes the following details describe the entire parametric scheme adopted in the hybrid dl model the original pm method and the surface energy balance equation are presented in the eqs 1 and 2 respectively penman 1948 monteith 1965 1 le δ r n g ρ c p v p d g a δ γ 1 g a g s 2 r n l e h g where ρ is the density of the air kg m3 cp is the constant pressure specific heat 1005 j kg k δ is the change in the saturated vapor pressure with air temperature kpa k γ is the psychrometric constant 0 667 kpa k ga is the aerodynamic conductance m s parameterized through li et al 2005 gs is the surface conductance m s which is estimated from the dl model vpd is the vapor pressure deficit kpa rn is the net radiant flux w m2 g is the soil heat flux w m2 and h is the sensible heat flux w m2 the original approximation of the clausius clapeyron relationship is presented in eq 3 3 e s t s e s t a d e s dt t a t s t a where the ta is the air temperature k and ts is the surface temperature k es ts is the saturated vapor pressure hpa at temperature ts and es ta is the saturated vapor pressure hpa at temperature ta to reduce the uncertainty in the linear transformation of the original clausius clapeyron relationship significant efforts have been made to propose a second order or a quartic order taylor expansion form of the clausius clapeyron relationship baldocchi et al 2005 milly 1991 paw and gao 1988 however these methods are effective in the daytime while rn g is greater than 0 but will lead to large errors in the nighttime when rn g is smaller than 0 mccoll 2020 to develop a universal solution of the pm method that can accurately estimate et under various conditions all values of rn g the approach suggested by vallis et al 2019 was used in this study to establish an exponential relationship between es ts and es ta as shown in eq 4 4 e s t s e s t a exp λ c p t a 2 t s t a while both eqs 3 and 4 are reasonable under the smaller ta ts but the revised clausius clapeyron relationship eq 4 is more reliable when ta ts is higher in eq 4 when the exponential term changes linearly with the air temperature exp x 1 x near x 0 the expression of the revised clausius clapeyron relationship is same as the linear version eq 3 therefore the revised clausius clapeyron relationship doesn t need any additional assumptions parameters and inputs the h in the energy balance equation is parameterized as the temperature gradient between the ground surface and the air shown as eq 5 su 2002 5 h ρ c p g a t s t a incorporating eqs 4 and 5 into eq 2 the revised version of the surface energy balance equation can be re written as eq 6 6 r n g ρ λ g s g a g s g a e s t a exp λ c p t a 2 t s t a e a ρ c p g a t s t a upon solving the ts in eq 6 replacing the obtained ts in eq 4 and the surface energy balance equation eq 2 the expression of le

in the hybrid dl model is presented in eq 8 note that the eq 8 looks similar to the rmse loss function in the conventional dl model however the predicted le le w m2 in eq 8 is calculated using the revised pm method coupled with gs as predicted by the dl model 8 l o s s l e l e 1 n i 1 n l e l e 2 where n is the total number of samples le is the predicted value w m2 and le is the true value w m2 2 3 data source 2 3 1 flux data source the observed et and various input variables at the 212 eddy correlation ec sites from the fluxnet for the period 2014 2015 were used for the training verification and testing of the existing dl and hybrid dl models https fluxnet fluxdata org data download data these flux stations contain a wide range of vegetation surfaces and provides rich water and heat transfer information generally the vegetation cover types from the 212 ec sites can be divided into ten categories barren or sparsely vegetated bsv woody savannas ws mixed forests mf deciduous broad leaved forests dbf evergreen broad leaved forests ebf closed shrublands cs open shrublands os savannas sns grasslands gl and croplands cl fig 2 shows the geographic location of 212 flux sites used in this study in all of the 212 ec sites the observation frequency of water vapor concentration and wind speed are both 10 hz and et is calculated as the fluctuating covariance of water vapor concentration and wind speed every half hour in addition to the et observation these flux sites also provide continuous measurements of rn and g every half hour moreover since part of et observation data is inaccurate and unreliable we have formulated a strict flux data screening criterion as given by reichstein et al 2005 first the flux data measured on rainy days were excluded because the sensor signal response of the open path ec system is affected by precipitation second the flux data with ec energy closure ratio defined as le h rn g less than 0 8 were excluded it should be noted that we did not exclude the nighttime le and negative le values this is because the improved pm formula has the ability to predict le at nighttime and under the condition of rn g 0 for all of the half hour flux data selected for the dl model training verification and testing used bowen ratio method to correct the energy balance closure twine et al 2000 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b 2 3 2 input data sources the input variables of the existing dl and hybrid dl models can be classified as meteorological data soil property information and vegetation characteristics chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b cui et al 2021 specifically six types of meteorological data including the air temperature ta relative humidity rh radiation ra horizontal wind speed u vapor pressure difference vpd and co2 concentration ca were continuously observed at the 212 sites furthermore the measured surface soil water content swc data was adopted from the fluxnet tier 1 dataset for vegetation characteristics

that the lai remains unchanged during the 8 days of observation period mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov the vegetation height hc data was retrieved from the geoscience laser altimeter system glas using the procedure proposed by chen 2010 for satellite based lai and hc observations the pixel values were extracted according to the geographic location of the 212 flux sites table 1 present the specific information of the 11 input variables for existing dl and hybrid dl models to improve the efficiency of the dl model training the average and standard deviation of all input variables were calculated and normalized before the model application 2 4 model performance evaluation total of 9 input variables excluding the rn and g were involved in the existing and hybrid dl models to generate 502 variable combinations vc to provide a comprehensive evaluation and understanding of the impact of different input variables on the final le predictions we iteratively adopted 502 vcs in the existing and hybrid dl models for training verification and testing furthermore four statistical parameters were used to evaluate the performance of the existing and hybrid dl models under different variable combinations including the rmse bias coefficient of determination r2 and mean absolute percentage difference mapd the rmse and mapd were used to evaluate the absolute deviation between the simulated and the measured et value r2 was used to evaluate the degree of fit for the simulated and the measured et value and bias was used to quantify the over underestimation as compared to the measured et values 3 results and analysis in this section we focus on testing the hybrid dl model performance in four aspects 1 the performance of the hybrid dl model in et simulation and comparison with existing dl model and six classic machine learning models 2 the generalized performance of the hybrid dl model and its prediction ability under extreme et conditions 3 the performance of the hybrid dl model in mapping spatial distribution of et in global scale and 4 sensitivity of different input parameters for the et simulation in hybrid dl model 3 1 evaluation of hybrid dl model performance in et simulation since the hybrid dl model was modified from the existing dl model it is necessary to compare the performance of the hybrid dl model with the existing dl model to understand the effectiveness of coupled physical process in model conceptualization to ensure the unbiased model comparison the measured rn and g were also used as input for the existing dl model training but the energy balance may not be guaranteed in this case we selected six vcs for the existing and hybrid dl models among the 502 vcs based on the lower rmse and mapd values the rmse for the selected six vcs were less than 70 w m2 and mapd were less than 18 for existing and hybrid dl models as envisaged from figs 3 and 4 the best le simulation accuracy for the existing dl model and hybrid dl model were obtained by vc 1 with all of the nine input variables when part of the meteorological input variables such as u rh and vpd were missing the performance of the two dl models were gradually reduced refer to tables 2 and s1 however both the existing and hybrid dl models exhibited high errors in case of lacking in the soil and vegetation data such as swc hc and lai inter comparison the performance between the two dl models justified the hybrid dl model improved capability in le simulation for the hybrid dl model the rmse values range between 41 3 and 56 9 w m2 with an average value of 49 3 w m2 54 2 68 2 w m2 with an average estimate of 61 4 w m2 for the existing dl model mapd values range between 5 2 and 14 6 with an average value of 9 1 11 8 17 6 with an average value of 14 8 for the existing dl model under six vcs in summary when the revised pm method was coupled into the loss function of the existing dl model the average rmse reduced 12 1 w m2 and the average mapd reduced 5 7 for the six vcs moreover the bias estimates revealed that the existing dl model tends to underestimate the le in most cases the bias values range between 4 3 and 5 1 w m2 with an average value of 0 5 w m2 for the hybrid dl model under six vcs 18 1 7 8 w m2 with an average value of 6 4 w m2 for the existing dl model surprisingly the r2 values obtained by the hybrid dl model were lower than the existing dl model the r2 values range between 0 79 and 0 88 with an average value of 0 84 for the hybrid dl model under six vcs 0 83 0 91 with an average value of 0 87 for the existing dl model a possible reason could be that the existing dl model only set the closest fitting of simulated and measured le as the optimization target but not constraint the energy balance and turbulent diffusion processes in the model conceptualization thereby leading to a higher r2 value note that a higher r2 does not necessarily mean a better model performance therefore model selection and evaluation using a variety of statistical parameters is important long and singh 2013 dash et al 2020 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b to have a clear insight about the robustness of the hybrid dl model 100 repeated simulations were performed using the existing and hybrid dl models under vc 1 the testing results revealed that the rmse and mapd values obtained by the hybrid dl model were lower than the existing dl model in 89 simulations but slightly higher in the remaining 11 simulations the average rmse and mapd for the hybrid dl model in the 100 simulations were 41 3 w m2 and 5 2 respectively 54 2 w m2 and 11 8 respectively for the existing dl model in addition to the testing period the better performance of the hybrid dl model over the existing dl model also reflected in the cross validations for the training period the average rmse r2 bias and mapd in the 100 simulations were 38 5 w m2 0 84 1 3 w m2 and 6 4 respectively for the hybrid dl model 55 1 w m2 0 87 10 1 w m2 and 12 3 respectively for the existing dl model for the validation period the average rmse r2 bias and mapd in 100 simulations were 39 2 w m2 0 83 1 6 w m2 and 6 8 respectively for the hybrid dl model 55 9 w m2 0 86 11 2 w m2 and 12 8 respectively for the existing dl model to have a comprehensive understanding of the performance of the hybrid dl model the le prediction by the hybrid dl model was

hybrid dl model were significantly lower than the six classic machine learning models 3 2 generalization performance of hybrid dl model the generalization capability reflect the adaptability of the machine learning models to a wide range of simulation scenarios which is important in hybrid dl model application kak 1998 msa et al 2020 in order to test the generalization capability of the hybrid dl model the two dl models were compared for their prediction ability of extreme events to achieve this we set 0 to1st percentile and 99 100th percentile of various input variables to provide extreme simulation scenarios for example 0 to1st percentile of ta represent the extreme cold condition and 99 100th percentile of ta represent the heat wave condition similarly 0 to1st percentile of swc represent the extreme drought condition and 99 100st percentile of swc represent the extreme wet condition fig 6 illustrates an example of the time series of le predicted by the two dl models in four ec sites under extreme events a extreme drought b heat wave c low lai d cloudy for the prediction of extreme drought events 0 to1st percentile of swc the testing results suggested that the performance of the hybrid dl model was significantly better than the existing dl model the r2 and rmse estimates were 0 70 and 49 7 w m2 for the hybrid dl model in prediction of et under extreme drought events 0 28 and 100 2 w m2 for the existing dl model the robust testing performance of the hybrid dl model was also detected under heat wave condition the r2 and rmse estimates were 0 65 and 56 3 w m2 for the hybrid dl model under heat wave condition 0 22 and 107 4 w m2 for the existing dl model moreover the bias statistics indicated that the existing dl model significantly underestimated the le under heat wave condition bias of 96 9 w m2 conversely the existing dl model significantly overestimated the le under extreme drought condition bias of 102 2 w m2 the hybrid dl model which was coupled with the physical dynamics of et successfully captured the crests and troughs of le time series in these two extreme scenarios bias of 10 8 w m2 for heat wave condition and bias of 2 1 w m2 for drought condition the stronger generalization ability of the hybrid dl model also reflected in prediction of le under 0 to1st percentile of lai and ra specifically the r2 rmse and bias estimates were 0 57 48 4 w m2 and 6 4 w m2 respectively for the hybrid dl model under 0 to1st percentile of lai 0 25 106 7 w m2 and 94 1 w m2 respectively for the existing dl model the r2 rmse and bias were 0 61 51 6 w m2 and 3 2 w m2 respectively for the hybrid dl model under 0 to1st percentile of ra 0 17 134 8 w m2 and 106 7 w m2 respectively for the existing dl model these results prove that the hybrid dl model has a great potential in providing reliable le predictions under the low lai and cloudy days however the higher rmse and absolute of bias values indicated that the existing dl model performs poorly and significantly overestimated le in these two extreme scenarios 3 3 the contribution of different input variables to le simulation determining the contribution of different input parameters to le simulation is of great significance for further improving the performance of hybrid dl model in le prediction here the importance of different variables was expressed as percentage wherein percentage close to 100 reveals that the variable is important for the simulation of le and vice versa cui et al 2021 shang et al 2021 in general the contribution of vegetation parameters were slightly higher than that of the soil variables while the influence of atmospheric parameters on le simulations were the lowest fig s1 specifically the mean relative contribution of the nine input variables under ten vegetation types were decreased in the order of hc 77 3 lai 72 6 swc 71 1 ta 65 7 ra 51 4 vpd 46 2 ca 39 7 rh 27 2 and u 11 9 the strong influence of swc on the surface conductance and le has been widely reported by previous studies e g seneviratne et al 2006 dirmeyer 2011 gentine et al 2012 however the high contribution of hc on le prediction was only recently recognized and yet to be verified thoroughly groh et al 2019 klein et al 2015 the findings of this study demonstrated that the importance of hc was even larger than swc which could be due to the fact that the hc is closely related to the vegetation water content and rate of vegetation transpiration further all the 212 flux sites used in this study are classified as vegetation coverage sites hence lack of non vegetation coverage sites led le to be more sensitive to vegetation attribute parameters only the rh and u exhibited little effects on le simulation which signifies that the hybrid dl model is also applicable for areas lacking observations of rh and u 3 4 can the hybrid dl model efficiently map the spatial variation of et the above testing results demonstrated that the systematic coupling between the existing dl model and the physical process description could improve the et prediction capability in a wide range of surface conditions at site scale applications however the site scale et predictions mainly reflected the perception capability of the hybrid dl model but its deductive ability could not be well demonstrated jiang et al 2020 to gain further insight about whether the hybrid dl model can appropriately map the et spatial distribution is of great interest this can serve as a direct evidence that a hybrid dl model has greater simulation ability under varying climates and surface conditions to achieve this objective the hybrid dl model was further applied to map the et distribution in global scale the global daily meteorological data sets were downloaded from the era5 reanalysis datasets josey et al 2018 dou et al 2020 the global lai and hc data were obtained from the 8 day mcd15a2h and glas products respectively chen 2010 mu et al 2011 the global monthly swc data was retrieved from the climate change initiative cci product of the european space agency esa all the input data sets were resampled to a spatial resolution of 5 km 5 km hollmann et al 2013 as envisaged in fig 7a 7c the le gradually decreased from low latitudes to high latitudes regions furthermore the larger le values were observed in areas with high vegetation coverage and the smaller le values were pre dominant in low vegetation coverage areas for example the larger le were mainly confined to the amazon plain region southern african savannah and the south east asian archipelago corresponding to the higher lai and hc in these areas generally the spatial pattern of le was consistent with the previous global et studies e g jung et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 zeng et al 2012 further to justify the robustness of the hybrid dl model the accuracy of the global et predicted by the hybrid dl model were compared with several other global et products at the 134 ec sites from the fluxnet 2015 these et products include modis mod16 product mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 breathing earth system simulator product bess jiang and ryu 2016 priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl product fisher et al 2015 global land surface evaporation the amsterdam methodology gleam product miralles et al 2010 and atmospheric land exchange inverse alexi product anderson et al 2012 the comparison results suggested that the hybrid dl model and modis mod16 et model performed better than the remaining four et models fig s2 and table 3 furthermore although both the hybrid dl model and the modis mod16 model are based on the pm method conceptualization inter comparison the performance between the two models demonstrated the superiority of the hybrid dl model that couples machine learning and et physical dynamics over the mod16 model that only relies on modified pm method rmse of 42 7 w m2 for the hybrid dl model and rmse of 49 1 w m2 for the mod16 model these promising results confirmed that the hybrid dl model not only well undertakes the task of et prediction in site scale but also can be used for the prediction and mapping of regional et distribution which indicate that the hybrid dl model has great potential to generate et datasets at global and regional scales 4 discussion 4 1 advantages of the hybrid dl model the improved performance of the hybrid dl model for et prediction could be attributed to the following reasons 1 updating the loss function in the existing dl model previously the loss function of the neural network based models were defined as various error functions such as absolute value loss function log loss function square loss function and exponential loss function kording and wolpert 2004 clough et al 2019 although these loss functions have different manifestations they are essentially based on the quantification of the distance between the predicted value and the observed value reichstein et al 2019 these loss functions lead to a pure fitting relationship between various input variables and the et measurements the lack of physical process description enables these neural network based models to yield in mediocre performance in most of the cases especially for extreme et conditions e g khanmohammadi et al 2018 liu et al 2020 feng et al 2017a feng et al 2017b the model conceptualization of the hybrid dl model proposed herein accounted the physical process dynamics of et by coupling the modified pm method into the loss function to this end the hybrid dl model is no longer remained as a pure fitting conceptualization but has the ability to determine the et in a more physical way the robust verification performance confirmed the necessity of developing customized machine learning models in different application scenarios and the importance of enriching the machine learning models with the physical awareness 2 benefits of the improved pm method the original pm method used a linearization scheme of the clausius clapeyron relationship and proven to be inappropriate in some limiting conditions mccoll 2020 paw and gao 1988 most importantly the method struggles in the le simulation under condition of rn g 0 leading to non functionality of et simulation in the nighttime the new non linear exponential scheme of clausius clapeyron relationship proposed in this study can better describe the mutual feedback between the es ts and es ta the robust le prediction performance is a concrete evidence for the reliability of the improved pm method 3 the optimum hidden layers were well determined the determination of the number of hidden layers in the dl model is a key step to achieve high precision et simulation cui et al 2021 shang et al 2021 in this study we found that the rmse ranged between 41 3 and 112 6 w m2 by vc 1 when the number of hidden layers varied between 7 and 100 a wide range of rmse variation indicated that the pre training verification processes of the dl model using different hidden layer number are quite essential in order to distinguish the contribution of the coupling physical mechanism and revised p m formula for the accuracy improvement of the existing dl model we set three simulation scenarios case 1 the hybrid dl model with original p m formula case 2 the hybrid dl model with revised p m formula case 3 the existing dl model the three simulation scenarios were performed 100 repeated simulations the verification results indicated that the average rmse of case 2 was reduced by 12 9 w m2 as compared to case 3 and the average rmse of case 1 was reduced by 10 2 w m2 as compared to case 3 this is certainly a convincing evidence that coupling physical mechanisms rather than the revised p m formula is the main contribution for improvement in the accuracy of the existing dl model 4 2 primary uncertainties of hybrid dl model in et prediction although the hybrid dl model demonstrated robust et prediction performance there are still several limitations and uncertainties in the model conceptualization the first limitation existing in all the machine learning based et models where the machine learning model requires a large number of training datasets to obtain the reliable et forecasts cui et al 2021 shang et al 2021 the low quantity and poor quality training samples significantly reduce the accuracy of the et predictions jiang et al 2020 feng et al 2017a feng et al 2017b however in real practice it is difficult to meet good quality and large quantitative requirements of training samples which brings greater uncertainty to the model performance for example the ec system under weaker turbulence condition will lead to significant et observation errors furthermore only 68 of the measured et data sets to be used for model training verification and testing after implementing data screening strategy refer to section 2 3 1 notably the dataset used here was retrieved from the 212 flux sites across the world ensuring availability of considerable amount of data for analysis even under strict data screening operation however when applying the hybrid dl model to a watershed or regional scale that contains only limited flux sites the performance of the model will reduced due to less availability of the measured et data the second uncertainty is the spatial scale overfitting problem associated with the machine learning model meyer et al 2018 meyer et al 2016 which means that the machine learning model can accurately predict the et time series at point scale applications but there will be substantial errors in mapping the spatial distribution of et according to the uncertainty analysis the 8 day mcd15a2h lai product in the hybrid dl model caused numerous prediction outliers which could be due to the assumption that the lai remains unchanged within 8 days observation period however the lai changes slightly in 8 days observation period in reality the third uncertainty is the spatial mismatch of various input data sources and le observations for example the spatial resolution of hc measurements based on the glas was 1000 m chen 2010 and the spatial resolution of mcd15a2h derived lai product was 500 m mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 however the observed le flux footprint varied from tens to thousands of meters chen et al 2009 which lead to the footprint of measured le can t well match the lai and hc in pixel scale application the spatial mismatch of the input variables and measured le lead to the erroneous capture of spatial information thereby bringing unpredictable errors to the establishment of the non linear relationship between measured le and various input variables finally the observation error from the ec system cannot be ignored which creates substantial uncertainty during the analysis foken 2008 the characteristics of the ec system make it unsuitable to capture the large eddies however small eddies can be captured reasonably and causing energy closure problem although the bowen ratio method was used in this study to correct the energy closure issue twine et al 2000 it cannot fully solve the le observation error of the ec system 4 3 towards smarter dl model for et simulation this study coupled the modified pm method to the loss function of the dl model and the physical process description of et was seamlessly merged into the existing dl model architecture taking into account the flexibility and scalability of the dl model the developed hybrid dl model is not an unchangeable template for example the loss function can be coupled into any neural network based machine learning models such as the ann bpnn elm and cnn moreover if the big leaf hypothesis in the pm method is replaced with the shuttleworth wallace s w model which based on the theory of dual source energy balance shuttleworth and wallace 1985 shuttleworth and gurney 1990 the hybrid dl model will have the capability to predict et components such as soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration furthermore as mentioned before another way to build a hybrid model is to package the physical equations into a certain layer of the neural network model jiang et al 2020 to this end subsequent research can build a more in depth physically based hybrid model which not only couple the pm method into the loss function but also incorporate the pm method into the input layers of the neural network architecture this deeply integrated model architectures may further enhance the et predictive ability in addition to solving the one dimensional equation in the energy balance equation eq 6 the coupling of partial differential equations in the dl framework and the realization of three dimensional numerical simulations have been widely explored sirignano and spiliopoulos 2018 in the past few decades the dl model has emerged to be a powerful tool in solving partial differential equations sirignano and spiliopoulos 2018 for instance the cnn model that relies on iterative convolution operations is a prospective solution that combines deep learning neural networks with high dimensional dynamic conceptualization schemes de oliveira e lucas et al 2020 keeping the above advancements in mind simulation of diffusion processes of et in three dimensional space is not an unreachable dream last the future research may further encode rainfall and runoff modules in the loss function so as to address the existing constraint of water balance on et simulation integrating energy balance water balance and turbulent diffusion processes provide opportunities for further improvement in the representation of physical processes in et simulation 5 conclusions this research developed a hybrid deep learning dl model to predict evapotranspiration et by coupling the improved penman monteith pm method to the loss function of the dl model the improved pm method was based on a non linear exponential clausius clapeyron relationship over the linear exponential clausius clapeyron relationship in the original pm method the hybrid dl model combines the characteristics of both statistical based et model and physical process based et model the performance of the newly proposed hybrid dl model was verified at the 212 flux sites from the fluxnet 2015 that contain ten types of vegetation surfaces across the globe the simulation outcomes of the hybrid dl model were further compared with six classic machine learning models and subsequently the global et distribution was mapped by the hybrid dl model the specific conclusions and findings of this research are as follows 1 as compared to the existing dl model the hybrid dl model exhibited improved capability for et prediction with average root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage difference mapd values for the six variable combinations vcs were reduced by 12 1 w m2 and 5 7 however the stronger fitting ability of the existing dl model resulted in higher coefficient of determination r2 value than the hybrid dl model moreover the hybrid dl model outperformed the six classic machine learning models svr rf bpnn xgboost elm and cnn in et simulation 2 the hybrid dl model exhibited strong generalization ability and could accurately predict the et under extreme scenarios of drought heat wave low leaf area index lai and cloudy sky under these four extreme scenarios the existing dl model were characterized by large errors and significant over underestimation issues while the hybrid dl model successful predicted the peak and trough of the et time series 3 for global scale et simulation the vegetation parameters has the greatest impact in hybrid dl model followed by the soil parameters and meteorological parameters 4 the hybrid dl model outperformed the five et products modis mod16 bess pt jpl gleam and alexi in global scale et mapping and demonstrated great potential for generating global and regional scale et datasets 5 the primary uncertainty of the hybrid dl model come from the low quantity and poor quality training samples spatial mismatch issue of various input sources and errors from eddy correlation ec based flux observations to further improve the performance of the hybrid dl model and enhance the model physical conceptualization subsequent research could replace the pm method with the shuttleworth wallace dual source approach or couple the water balance module in the loss function this research significantly reduced the uncertainty of et simulation in both site and regional scale by coupling the machine learning model with the physical process description the hybrid dl model is of great importance while evaluating the response of land surface et to climate change monitoring soil entropy and estimation of vegetation water consumption credit authorship

3647,integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic models are particularly well suited for the simulation of baseflow as exchange fluxes does not rely on boundary conditions regional scale hydrologic models are of particular interest as they can provide guidance to stakeholders toward sustainable water resources management however integrated hydrologic models are rarely considered at the regional scale because their computational costs usually prevent efficient model calibration and predictive uncertainty analysis moreover estimation of baseflow and each water budget component usually requires additional post processing steps in this paper we thus aim here to provide a hybrid approach for the application of an integrated hydrologic model at the regional scale when low flow processes are of primary concern a surface water mass balance module has been developed to solve the hydrological mass balance from precipitations and temperature datasets this module calculates potential infiltration fluxes that are used as input to the integrated modeling platform hydrogeosphere hgs this approach provides a computationally tractable integrated model where low flow processes are explicitly considered baseflows generated in an integrated fashion and each water budget component accessible the model is applied to a region covering 36 900 km2 in the southeastern part of the province of quebec canada thanks to the computational efficiency of the approach a rigorous mathematical parameter estimation the levenberg marquardt form of the iterative ensemble smoother can be considered to calibrate the model to baseflow of eight main rivers snow water equivalent and evapotranspiration an ensemble of 187 equally probable realizations was used for history matching of observations and for the non linear uncertainty analysis an improved representation of baseflow can be linked to an appropriate non linear uncertainty quantification through an efficient integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model to support managing water resources at the regional scale keywords process based hydrological model iterative ensemble smoother baseflow regional scale 1 introduction the simulation of baseflow which is the groundwater flow component of streamflow requires a quantitative assessment of groundwater surface water gw sw exchanges in regional hydrologic models the governing flow equations for the surface and the subsurface are usually not explicitly solved in an integrated fashion with two way exchange between the surface and the subsurface and simulated baseflow strongly depends on boundary conditions for example in surface hydrologic models baseflow is often assumed to be equal to the outlet from a groundwater flow reservoir in which simplified groundwater flow equations are solved which can potentially hinder the application of these models to investigate low flow dynamics in subsurface hydrology groundwater flow models are often linked to a conductance concept to generate baseflow potentially increasing the uncertainty associated with baseflow simulations brunner et al 2010 for either surface or subsurface hydrologic models the simulation of baseflow may raise critical issues as simplifying assumptions are usually made regarding one domain or the other staudinger et al 2019 thus proper simulation of baseflow ideally requires an integrated solution of the equations between the surface and the subsurface integrated surface and subsurface hydrological models eliminate boundaries between surface and subsurface such that the simulation of baseflow can be significantly improved brunner et al 2017 this new generation of numerical models are increasingly used at the catchment scale i e less than 10 000 km2 tagnon et al 2020 cochand et al 2019 goderniaux et al 2009 and for basin to continental areas covering more than 100 000 km2 xu et al 2021 chen et al 2020 maxwell et al 2015 catchment scale models usually offer computationally tractable solutions that can be useful to investigate specific river groundwater interactions issues at the catchment scale these models are often associated with robust assisted calibration algorithms and the uncertainties are generally well discussed schilling et al 2017 goderniaux et al 2015 on the other hand large scale models are often used to quantify physical processes and components of a large scale water balance contrary to catchment scale models these large scale models are less frequently coupled with assisted calibration algorithms and less attention is given to quantify uncertainty regional scale models are an intermediate between catchment scale and large scale models the regional scale is also often very well suited for water resource managers as it can correspond to the territory covered by water agencies however high computational costs associated with integrated numerical models at the regional scale are often a constraint for their development in a reasonable timeframe moreover regional scale model must be also accepted as a reliable tool by the practitioners thus demonstrating model calibration and quantification of the uncertainties which typically require numerous model executions are a prerequisite toward the acceptance of the model doherty and moore 2020 delottier et al 2017 as a result integrated surface and subsurface numerical models are often disregarded at the regional scale and the representation of gw sw interactions is therefore simplified barthel and banzhaf 2016 the hydrogeosphere hgs model is applied here at the regional scale hgs is an integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model that simulates coupled three dimensional variably saturated subsurface flow and two dimensional surface water flow brunner and simmons 2012 hgs is also capable of simulating snow accumulation snowmelt and evapotranspiration the code can either be coupled to a climate model davison et al 2018 or forced with climatic variables goderniaux et al 2011 in hgs precipitation is the main input and it is redistributed along the surface and in the subsurface through the solution of the governing flow equations however due to the extensive surface subsurface coupling in hgs inputting precipitation directly can result in long simulation times for a regional scale model thus to reduce simulation times hgs is used here with the surface water mass balance module ledoux et al 1984 of eaudyssée a french integrated modeling platform pryet et al 2015 saleh et al 2011 the surface water mass balance module swmb is able to generate spatially and temporally variable potential infiltration rates at a low computational cost the resulting potential infiltration is then used as the input flux assigned to the integrated hgs model instead of assigning total precipitation although the infiltration processes are simplified in swmb the integrated surface and subsurface flow is still simulated at the regional scale within hgs this proposed hybrid approach reduces computational time which in turn enables the use of more mathematically rigorous ensemble based methods of parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis another benefit of this hybrid configuration is that hgs can directly simulate baseflow which typically requires advanced and computationally restrictive volumetric balance post processing tools when hgs is forced with precipitations partington et al 2011 this modeling approach is applied to a 36 900 km2 region in southeastern quebec canada where the hydrology is strongly influenced by the annual snowmelt in this region baseflow derived freshwater and groundwater are important water sources for ecosystems and human activities e g agriculture drinking water supply the region includes the watersheds of eight main rivers with regional groundwater flow dynamics originating from the appalachian uplands and emerging in the lowlands beaudry et al 2018 janos et al 2018 saby et al 2016 previous modeling studies in the region focused on the catchment scale for example in gagné et al 2018 levison et al 2016 sulis et al 2011b but the broader groundwater flow dynamics of the entire region have not yet been investigated the choice of this region was also motivated by the need to address challenges related to supporting water resources management and climate change adaptation larocque et al 2019 finally the southeastern québec is the most data dense region in the québec province in terms of observations and hydrogeological understanding which enables the development of such an integrated surface and subsurface numerical model a comprehensive parameter estimation and non linear uncertainty analysis are also presented using the levenberg marquardt form of the iterative ensemble smoother ies chen and oliver 2013 this algorithm allows for the implementation of a calibration constrained predictive uncertainty analysis that produces an ensemble of equally probable models at a significantly lower computational cost than that required by the more classical monte carlo analysis white 2018 the hydrogeological context of the region as well as the data used by the model is first presented then the underlying theory and implementation of the surface water mass balance module is thoroughly described with a brief description of the major equations used by hgs the model development and parameter estimation are then described followed by the presentation of baseflow simulations at the regional scale finally model assumptions and limitations are discussed 2 study area this study is carried out over an area of 36 900 km2 located south of the st lawrence river between montréal and québec city in southeastern québec canada fig 1 the topography is relatively flat in lowlands aligned with the st lawrence river where surface slopes are less than 2 on average and it is more pronounced in the appalachians with surface slopes exceeding 7 a mixed forest of conifer and hardwood covers 43 of the area a large portion of the forest has been cleared for agricultural activities mainly along the saint lawrence river in the lowlands and agricultural land covers 55 of the total area crops mainly consist of cereals corn and wheat and oilseeds soybeans arable zones in the lowlands are mostly drained swamps where groundwater is available for irrigation in the summer groundwater also represents a source of drinking water for some municipalities the region is characterized by a continental humid climate with pronounced seasonal variations with warm and wet summers and cold and dry winters as an example the daily average temperature for the southwestern portion of the region ranges from a low of 10 1 c in january to a high of 19 4 c in july with 1142 mm for the average annual precipitations environment canada winter precipitation may either be solid snow or liquid rain and fallen snow may either accumulate or melt depending on the ambient air temperature snowfall generally starts in november and continues until march when snowmelt typically begins the hydrogeological regime is strongly influenced by snowmelt which generates the highest surface flows snowmelt is also a primary source for infiltration and it increases soil saturation leading to increased exchanges fluxes between the surface and the subsurface germain et al 2020 infiltration from snowmelt represents the main annual groundwater recharge event schilling et al 2021 the region contains eight major river catchments that are from east to west the chateauguay 2588 km2 richelieu 2613 km2 yamaska 4832 km2 st françois 10346 km2 nicolet 3442 km2 bécancour 2607 km2 du chêne 813 km2 and chaudière 6755 km2 catchments fig 1 the main drainage network is oriented in a southeastern northwestern direction flow in the main rivers is in the northwestern direction and they discharge into the st lawrence river at the northwestern edge of the area fig 1 2 1 the geology two distinct geologic provinces form the bedrock in the study area the appalachian orogen in the southeast and the st lawrence sedimentary platform in the northwest nastev et al 2016 the boundary between the two provinces is shown by the green line in fig 1 the appalachian orogen is characterized by extensively thrusted sheets of low grade metamorphic rocks which create a hilly topography with a well developed drainage network the st lawrence sedimentary platform consists of a topographically low flat lying sequence of sandstones and carbonates the bedrock units of both provinces form a continuous regional aquifer a comprehensive analysis of thousands of water well specific capacity tests in the western part of the study area richelieu and yamaska catchments showed that the hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock decreases significantly with depth and reaches a minimum value representative of sparsely fractured bedrock at a depth of 100 m laurencelle 2018 this observed vertical decrease of hydraulic conductivity is consistent with common hard rock aquifer conceptual models lachassagne et al 2021 moreover it was found that high hydraulic conductivity values are generally in the upper 20 40 m of the bedrock where weathering has been more intense this upper bedrock is generally characterized with significant variation of hydraulic conductivity with depth spanning several orders of magnitude with maximum hydraulic conductivity values preferentially located in the lowlands where the weathering profile has probably been preserved from erosion in the appalachians where the weathering profile is less significant the maximum hydraulic conductivity values are lower and the vertical range of hydraulic conductivity is less pronounced laurencelle 2018 the bedrock is overlain by a thin succession of discontinuous quaternary sediments which contrary to the bedrock exhibit strong spatial heterogeneity over the region to characterize this spatial heterogeneity a regional 3d hydrostratigraphic model for the quaternary sediments has been proposed from a compilation of 3d models already existing for several watersheds and the analysis of thousands of public water well records nastev et al 2016 the quaternary sediments can be grouped into three distinct hydrostratigraphic units 1 sandy sediments sand unit that consist of littoral and sublittoral permeable sands 2 low permeability clayey sediments clay unit deposited in large surface water bodies that inundated the area at the end of the last glaciation and 3 compact basal glacial and non glacial deposits till unit typically of low permeability deposited during the last glacial advance the spatial distribution of sediments in the geological model was used to generate the spatial distribution of the geological units fig 2 in the hgs finite element model which is described later in the appalachians the quaternary sediment cover is generally thin and discontinuous and consists primarily of till rock outcrops are more common in the appalachians than in the sedimentary platform the sand and the clay units are mostly absent in the appalachians and occur almost exclusively in the lowlands of the st lawrence platform where they overlie the till unit when the clay unit is present its thickness is on average 20 to 30 m with maximum values ranging between 50 and 70 m 2 2 forcing input weather data in order to estimate seasonal baseflow an historical weather dataset precipitations and temperatures that spans the canada and united states border and therefore covers the whole study area is considered https daymet ornl gov the historical data were generated by spatially interpolating ground observations with a gaussian weighting scheme of surrounding weather stations using the daymet algorithm thornton et al 1997 information on the location of weather stations used to build the daymet data can be found at https daymet ornl gov overview html daily precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature at a spatial resolution of 1 km2 were downloaded daymet version 3 and spatially aggregated over a structured 25 km2 forcing grid fig 4 general information on the quality of the three daymet model outputs considered minimum maximum temperature and precipitations can be found for the continental united states essou et al 2016 newman et al 2015 overall the daymet dataset is identified as generally wetter than other databases this pattern was confirmed in the lake champlain basin which is a nearby area of the southeastern québec region huang et al 2020 also another recent study evaluates the differences between four common gridded precipitation datasets used in north america including daymet for the estimation of the water budget components in a montagneous watershed schreiner mcgraw and ajami 2020 specifically they found that the daymet dataset has a higher bias in estimating snow water equivalent 2 3 ground based observations fourteen streamflow gauging stations distributed in the study area fig 4 provide direct measurements of total daily streamflow q for the period 1970 to 2016 from direct measurements of streamflow the hydrograph separation allows to estimate the baseflow which is assumed here to be the groundwater flow component of streamflow baseflow is considered as the primary observation type as it is also the main prediction of the model the hydrograph can be separated with experimental modelling or river discharge filtering methods healy and scanlon 2010 however experimental studies are more appropriate for field scale approaches and modelling solutions can be time consuming and not as appropriate at the regional scale in this study we benefited from a previous regional project poirier 2012 that provided estimation of parameters for several hydrometric stations in the region by the application of the eckhardt recursive digital filter rdf method eckhardt 2005 the general form of the rdf is 1 qb t 1 bfi max λ qb t 1 1 λ bfi max q t 1 λ bfi max where qbt is the filtered baseflow m3 s 1 at the time t qbt 1 is the filtered baseflow m3 s 1 at time t 1 bfimax is the maximum value of the baseflow index which is the long term ratio of baseflow to total streamflow λ is the baseflow recession constant and qt is the total streamflow m3 s 1 at time t the rdf parameters used for this study are summarised in table a1 eq 1 has been used to estimate daily baseflow from daily streamflow measurements as illustrated in fig 3 the estimated baseflow is then aggregated monthly and the monthly means of baseflow from september 2011 to august 2015 are used for the estimation of baseflow during a representative average seasonal cycle that ranges from september to august this overall procedure has been implemented with the software r r core team 2013 and applied for each of the fourteen gauging stations despite the approximations made for the estimation of baseflow the resulting values are assumed to be representative of the real groundwater flow component of streamflow for the considered gauging stations to characterize prior spatial variation of the estimated baseflow across the region the mean monthly baseflow of the representative average seasonal cycle for late summer i e september is normalized with the watershed area of the considered gauging stations overall the normalized baseflow ranges from 27 to 120 mm y 1 fig 4 these normalized baseflow values do not indicate an obvious correlation and presence of spatial patterns between the watersheds as baseflow can be related to a series of different factors such as geology soils climate land use and physiography of the watersheds in addition to baseflow estimates a network of forty monitoring wells provide hydraulic head data fig 4 those wells are screened in either the most permeable surficial sediments sand and till units or in the most permeable section of the bedrock aquifer which is typically near the contact with the overlying glacial sediments in these wells the water table depth is generally within 10 m from ground surface and annual water table fluctuations range from 1 to 2 5 m continuous hydraulic head records are primarily available for the period from 2000 to 2016 which is shorter than the period for streamflow 2 4 satellite based observations satellite based hydrologic data on snow cover and evapotranspiration were also considered to complement the coverage provided by ground based observations these historical data were included to increase the spatial and temporal distribution of historical hydrologic information while providing complementary evaluation of relevant variables simulated by the integrated model the use of spatially distributed data derived from remote sensing is always interesting in constraining the models during calibration brunner et al 2007 typically these satellite based observations are used to evaluate the relative regional model performance in quantifying the hydrologic water balance the snow water equivalent swe was obtained by the snodas modelling and data assimilation system carroll et al 2001 this system integrates snow data from satellite airborne platforms and ground stations with model estimates of snow cover the swe data are at a temporal and spatial resolution of 1 day and 1 km2 respectively for the period from 2011 to 2015 which is when the swe data were mostly available the maximum snow accumulation reaches 140 cm assuming 100 kg m 3 for snow density and the typical snow thickness varies between 0 and 100 cm finally actual evapotranspiration aet was obtained by the modis myd16a2 land algorithm this algorithm is based on the penman monteith equation which uses daily meteorological data and 8 day remotely sensed vegetation property dynamics running et al 2017 the temporal and spatial resolutions of the aet data are 8 days and 0 25 km2 respectively the aet records were mostly available for the period 2003 to 2016 for this study the original swe and aet datasets have been spatially aggregated to the 25 km2 weather forcing grid fig 4 and the temporal resolution was harmonized over a monthly time scale 3 modeling approach the integrated regional model developed here involves a surface water mass balance swmb module and the integrated surface and subsurface hydrogeosphere hgs model fig 5 the following section presents the underlying theory of the swmb module and hgs and the interaction between these two models 3 1 the surface water mass balance module the swmb module developed here is based on a production function ledoux et al 1984 that has been included in the french hydrologic modeling platform eaudyssée pryet et al 2015 saleh et al 2011 the module splits daily precipitation into actual evapotranspiration overland flow soil storage and infiltration by using a series of cascading reservoirs that are in order the snowpack the water balance the partition and the transfer reservoirs fig 5 daily total precipitation flux m s 1 and air temperature c are the main input to the swmb module rain and snow fluxes are differentiated according to an air temperature threshold tth c when the mean daily temperature t c is below the threshold precipitation for that interval is labelled as snow and is accumulated within a snowpack reservoir fig 5 the volume of snow accumulated expressed as snow water equivalent swe m is computed with a snow module the snow module is not originally proposed in the production function and it was added into the swmb for this snow influenced region following an enhanced temperature based formulation massmann 2019 that module also calculates snowmelt water flux qe m s 1 when the mean temperature increases above the threshold using 2 qe η t t th ω r n for t t th where η m c 1 s 1 is the melting constant also known as the day degree factor rn w m 2 is the net radiation which is the difference between the net shortwave and longwave radiations and ω m s 1 w m 2 1 is a factor converting the energy flux density to snowmelt depth the day degree factor is a lumped parameter that encapsulates the effects of consistent topographical patterns such as slope or aspect snowmelt occurs as long as the volume of snow accumulated is positive because the net radiation term is considered explicitly in eq 2 the melting constant which requires estimation depends only on the diurnal range of temperatures which makes the calculation of snowmelt more robust in the context of climate change raleigh and clark 2014 for the simulations presented here sublimation losses from the snowpack are not considered because the contribution of sublimation to the total water balance is assumed negligible schilling et al 2021 the total liquid precipitation flux pl m s 1 is the sum of rain and snowmelt water it is routed to the water balance reservoir which computes actual evapotranspiration flux aet m s 1 and generates qwater m s 1 which is the flux of water leaving the water balance reservoir if evapotranspiration and water storage needs are met fig 5 the computation of the actual evapotranspiration flux typically requires the definition of a potential evapotranspiration flux etc m s 1 which is computed following the crop coefficient approach pereira et al 2015 allen et al 1998 3 e t c k c et 0 where et0 m s 1 is a reference potential evapotranspiration flux and kc is a crop coefficient used to scale et0 according to land cover and crop growing seasons based on the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 define the following daily reference potential evapotranspiration et0 from a reference crop surface with an assumed crop height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 4 et 0 0 408 δ r n γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 342 u 2 where t c is the mean daily temperature u2 is the averaged wind speed at a height of 2 m m s 1 ea kpa is the actual vapor pressure es ea represents the vapour pressure deficit of the air kpa δ is the slope of the relationship between the saturation vapor pressure and temperature kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the net radiation term rn in eq 2 differs from that in eq 4 only by the albedo used in the calculation of net shortwave radiations rns because the albedo is usually higher for snow covered surface due to snow reflection the assessment of et0 requires weather data that are not available in the historical weather dataset so that missing data concerning humidity and radiations are estimated from temperatures allen et al 1998 accordingly rns which is usually measured locally with a pyranometer is rather derived from the daily air temperature range tmax tmin with hargreaves radiation formula allen et al 1998 5 r ns 1 a l b e d o k rs t max t min r a where ra mj m 2 d 1 is the daily extraterrestrial radiation that is a function of latitude and time of year and krs is an adjustment coefficient that is usually set to 0 16 for locations where land mass dominates and air masses are not strongly influenced by a large water body additionally the actual vapor pressure ea usually derived from humidity measurements is rather estimated by assuming that the dewpoint temperature is near the daily minimum temperature tmin 6 e a 0 611 e x p 17 27 t min t min 237 3 although eq 4 requires some meteorological data that have to be approximated from temperatures to compute the reference potential evapotranspiration it explicitly considers radiative fluxes which are critical in a physically based assessment of the impacts of climate change erler et al 2019 actual evapotranspiration is computed in the water balance reservoir with 7 aet m i n et c r b p eff q water where r b m is the current level of the water balance reservoir which is updated at the end of a daily stress period the term qwater m s 1 is the remaining movable water flux that can leave the water balance reservoir if evapotranspiration and water storage needs are met this movable water is given by 8 q water m a x r b p eff r bmax 0 m a x 0 r h a r b a 2 r b a m a x 0 r h a r b a 4 c r t d c r t where crt m is the mean soil capacity and dcrt m is the minimum soil capacity these two parameters depend on the soil cover for example a well drained sandy soil is generally associated with low crt and dcrt values these parameters can be adjusted during calibration rb max m is the maximum level of the water balance reservoir given by 9 r bmax 2 c r t d c r t d c r t and rha m and rba m are intermediate variables used here to simplify notation they are defined as 10 rha m i n r

current daily stress period with 12 r bnext r b p eff q w a e t water leaving the water balance reservoir qwater enters the partition reservoir fig 5 this reservoir partitions incoming qwater between infiltration excess overland flow qo m s 1 and potential infiltration qi m s 1 according to the maximum soil infiltration capacity fn m s 1 with qi min qwater fn and qo max 0 qwater qi the potential infiltration qi is immediately available as input to the hydrogeosphere model whilst the infiltration excess overland flow qo is not included in hydrogeosphere 3 2 the hydrogeosphere model hydrogeosphere hgs is an integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model that solves fully coupled two dimensional surface water and three dimensional groundwater flow using the control volume finite element method brunner and simmons 2012 hgs splits the total simulation domain into a subsurface domain representing groundwater flow and a surface domain for surface water flow three dimensional variability saturated groundwater flow is described by richards equation 13 s w s s ψ t θ s w t k k r ψ z γ ex q where θ s s m 1 ψ m z m and k m s 1 are porosity specific storage pressure head elevation head and saturated hydraulic conductivity respectively the volumetric fluid exchange rate between the surface and the subsurface domains is represented by γ ex m3 m 3 s 1 and q is a source or sink term within the subsurface domain m3 s 1 in variably saturated conditions the relative permeability k r is a function of the saturation s w and is modeled following the van genuchten equations van genuchten 1980 s w s wr 1 s wr 1 α ψ β v 14 s w 1 ψ 0 with the relative permeability given by k r s e l p 1 1 s e 1 v v 2 15 v 1 1 β β 1 where α m 1 is the inverse of the air entry pressure head β is the pore size distribution index lp is the pore connectivity parameter assumed equal to 0 5 and se is often called an effective saturation given by se sw swr 1 swr with swr being the residual water saturation two dimensional surface water flow is described by the diffusion wave equation 16 ϕ 0 h 0 t x d 0 k ox h 0 x y d 0 k oy h 0 y d 0 γ 0 q 0 where ϕ 0 is a surface flow domain porosity h 0 m is the surface water elevation d 0 m is the surface water flow depth γ 0 m3 m 3 s 1 is the volumetric fluid exchange between the surface and the subsurface domains and q 0 m s 1 is a source or sink term within the surface domain the surface conductances k ox m s 1 and k oy m s 1 are approximated by manning s equation hgs couples the surface and subsurface domains through a dual node approach that requires a coupling length l exch m to set a virtual exchange surface between the domains liggett et al 2012 the coupling term is expressed as 17 d 0 γ 0 k r k v l exch h h 0 where k v m s 1 is the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity of the underlying porous media kr is the relative permeability of the interface between surface and subsurface and h m is hydraulic head this type of coupling scheme was found to be numerically efficient compared to the common node approach rooij 2017 ebel et al 2009 the coupled non linear equations are linearized with the newton raphson method and the resulting matrix system is solved iteratively therrien and sudicky 1996 the solution is marched through time with an adaptive time stepping procedure 3 3 interaction between swmb and hgs total precipitation is the input to hgs when it is used as a stand alone model the model then partitions total precipitation into evapotranspiration surface and subsurface flow components according to the model parameters swmb is used here instead to partition total precipitation into potential infiltration qi when the infiltration capacity fn of the soil allows infiltration this means that the term overland flow qo removed from the model water balance is physically referred to the infiltration excess hortonian overland flow that occurs when the soil s infiltration capacity is exceeded qi is then temporally aggregated as a monthly mean and used in hgs as a specified flux boundary condition for the subsurface i e the top layer over the structured 25 km2 forcing grid accordingly qi is only referred as a potential infiltration because the saturation excess overland flow can occurs when the water table rise to the land surface swmb therefore replaces the surface partitioning option already available in hgs with the advantage of greatly reducing simulation times at regional scale the hgs model can then be used with the surface flow domain active integrated model or inactive variably saturated groundwater model note that the inactive surface water flow domain is only used for the model calibration which will be described later this weak loosely coupling i e one way interaction between swmb and hgs allows for an explicit physically based and computationally efficient simulation of low flow processes at the regional scale with an integrated surface and subsurface flow model although swmb and hgs are run completely consecutively the use of hgs allows the representation of feedbacks between the surface and the subsurface but oriented toward the low flow processes thus the proposed interaction between swmb and hgs is a significant improvement of the commonly used procedure where the subsurface is usually disconnected from the surface water flow domain barthel and banzhaf 2016 4 model setup 4 1 3d mesh prior to generating a full 3d mesh for the study area a 2d mesh was generated to discretize the horizontal extent of the simulation domain shown in fig 1 a 2d unstructured triangular mesh with lateral inter nodal spacing ranging from 500 m to 1000 m fig 6 was generated with algomesh hydroalgorithmics pty ltd 2016 the mesh was refined near the main hydrological features such as the regional streamflow network and lake boundaries and also close to the groundwater wells the nodal elevations of the 2d mesh fig 1 were interpolated from a 90 m resolution srtm digital elevation model jarvis et al 2008 the 2d mesh was then replicated vertically through the subsurface to generate the 3d mesh a total of 20 finite element layers of variable thickness were thus used to discretize the subsurface extending from ground surface to a depth of 200 m below ground surface this depth is above the fresh and brackish water interface in the region and density driven effects can be neglected the vertical extent of the model is shown for two cross sections in fig 2 illustrating the variable elevation of ground surface and the thickness of the bedrock the mesh was refined vertically a portion of the mesh shown in fig 6 illustrates the horizontal refinement close to the surface drainage network and the vertical refinement in the upper part of the mesh and deeper at the top of the bedrock the resulting 3d finite element mesh contains 1 8 million nodes and 3 4 million elements 4 2 material properties as mentioned previously the spatial distribution of the geological units within the 3d mesh shown in fig 2 is derived from the 3d model compiled by nastev et al 2016 the facies associated to the voxels of the 3d geological model are transferred to the 3d hgs mesh with a geospatial nearest neighbour function the hydraulic properties of the quaternary sediments were assumed homogeneous within each unit and representative initial values prior to calibration were taken from the literature table 1 bedrock is represented as an equivalent porous medium and as opposed to each unit forming the quaternary sediments its hydraulic conductivity decreases by several orders of magnitude with depth thus the following exponential equation was used to assign a hydraulic conductivity that decreases with depth from a maximum value k max m s 1 at the top of bedrock to a minimum value k min m s 1 janos et al 2018 18 log k z l o g k min l o g k max l o g k min e α l z where k z m s 1 is the hydraulic conductivity at a depth z m below the top of bedrock and α l m 1 is a decay constant furthermore to account for the larger maximum hydraulic conductivity of bedrock in the st lawrence lowlands compared to the appalachians a spatially variable value of kmax was adjusted over the study area using the pilot point method doherty 2003 a total of 336 pilot points were distributed across the model domain with a mean distance of 15 km between points fig 4 and table 1 the pilot points for spatially distributed parameters are estimated at discrete locations and then interpolated over the 25 km2 grid an isotropic exponential variogram with a range of 45 km a sill of 1 and a nugget of zero was used to generate at a 25 km2 resolution the heterogeneous conditional estimation of the parameters other parameters that were adjusted using pilot points are identified in table 1 4 3 boundary conditions a no flow boundary condition was assigned to the bottom of the model the lateral boundaries of the surface flow domain including the st lawrence river were assigned a critical depth boundary condition which allows surface water to freely exit the model until the water level reaches a prescribed critical depth fig 1 this boundary condition helps prevent unrealistic surface water pounding along the edges of the model as a result of the coarse mesh resolution which may create local topographic lows along the st lawrence river the majority of surface water is leaving the domain at the prediction points illustrated in fig 1 which are used for the predictive uncertainty analysis presented in section 6 4 a no flow boundary condition was assigned to the lateral boundaries of the subsurface domain which corresponds to groundwater divides the model is intended to represent the natural hydrological state of the domain and anthropogenic influences such as dam driven streamflow regulation and municipal water withdrawals are not considered the potential infiltration flux computed by swmb is assigned to the subsurface faces located at the top of the model and converted by hgs into nodal volumetric fluxes by multiplying by the contributing area of the chosen face for an integrated surface and subsurface flow simulation with hgs that infiltration water can migrate deeper in the subsurface or exfiltrate in the surface domain thus the surface flow domain is expected to be mostly characterized by water exfiltrating from the porous media domain to reduce simulation times during the calibration step a free drainage boundary condition was applied to the subsurface top faces to prevent exfiltrated water from returning to the porous media domain using this type of boundary conditions is equivalent to assuming that the regional aquifers are mainly drained by the major streamflow network i e the return flow is neglected during calibration the baseflow simulated at a gauging station is approximated as the sum of all exfiltrated water from the top faces within a given watershed fig 4 once calibration was completed the free drainage boundary condition was removed so that exfiltrated water can eventually reinfiltrate and return to the porous media domain 4 4 simulation control all processes within the swmb module are computed on a daily basis from the weather forcing data which are the daily mean precipitation and the minimum and maximum daily mean temperatures fig 7 a control period that ranges from 2011 09 01 to 2015 08 31 fig 7 was chosen for calibration because it represents the best overlap between the available observed data and the historical weather forcing records thus providing the maximum number of observations the daily potential infiltration fluxes computed by swmb along the four years period are aggregated into monthly mean fluxes for simulating a representative average seasonal cycle with hgs this seasonal cycle ranges from september to august thus hgs is running with monthly stress periods along one single year i e 12 stress periods representing the seasonal variability observed in four years 2011 to 2015 the representative average seasonal cycle can be viewed as a compromise between steady states and fully transient simulations in order to simulate the seasonal variability while maintaining forward simulations computationally tractable the maximum time step size in hgs is set to five days the newton absolute and newton residual convergence criteria were set sufficiently low to reach a mass balance error less than 5 which is consistent with the assumed error on forcing data at the regional scale however the mass balance error was usually less than 1 in an integrated surface water and groundwater mode the hgs model takes 12 h to simulate the representative seasonal cycle for a full year using 8 cpus in parallel on a inter xeon cpu e5 1650 v3 3 5 ghz with 32 go memory computer when exfiltrated water is not allowed to return in the porous media domain for model calibration the simulation time is reduced to 2 5 h for 1 cpu this significant reduction of simulation time allows computing the uncertainty analysis constrained by calibration on a highly parallelized cluster www computecanada ca 5 parameter estimation approach a levenberg marquardt form of the iterative ensemble smoother ies is applied for parameter estimation chen and oliver 2013 ies is a batch form of the ensemble kalman filter enkf where all data are assimilated in a single step and model parameters can be updated iteratively it is well suited for efficient history matching and uncertainty quantification in high parameter dimension space the levenberg marquardt form of the iterative ensemble smoother has been implemented into the model independent software pest white 2018 the ies does not require to compute a full rank jacobian matrix which is computationally expensive the computational therefore only depends on the number of realizations within the ensemble rather than the number of model parameters in addition to pest pest hp and pest related utilities such as addreg1 ppcov parrep and genlinpred available in the pest suite package were also used for refining parameter estimates and to compute various statistics doherty 2021a b 5 1 the initial ensemble the performance of the ies is related to its ability to reduce the prior uncertainty while providing a reliable estimate of the posterior uncertainty performance is primarily driven by the quality and size of the initial ensemble that must encompass as best as possible the observations evensen 2018 to improve the initial ensemble mean prior to applying the ies preliminary simulations were designed to improve first estimates of parameters following a manually and assisted procedure for the latter the classic form of the gmla gauss marquardt levenberg algorithm aster et al 2018 marquardt 1963 was used in conjunction with a tikhonov regularization and singular value decomposition doherty 2015 tikhonov and arsenin 1977 to ensure that these initial estimates remained realistic from a hydrogeological perspective for instance parameters that are associated with land use and soil type information in the swmb module were initially estimated by including the soft knowledge of these regional zones providing generally consistent initial conditional estimation of these parameters in the surface domain of hgs commonly used manning s roughness coefficients were manually adjusted to produce the most realistic surface water depth distribution these initial values which are assumed to represent the best prior knowledge before the generation of the initial ensemble are listed in table 1 because the sensitivity matrix is approximated from the ensemble the size of the initial ensemble is critical for the performance of ies the closer the initial ensemble size is to the parameter space dimension the better is the fit between the observed data and simulated values however there is no advantage in choosing an ensemble size equal to the number of parameters as there will be no computational gain for the calculation of the sensitivity matrix thus the size of the initial ensemble is often driven by the computational resource limits however an ensemble size that is too small can lead to ensemble collapse and spurious correlations chen and oliver 2017 it can have negative consequences such as underestimation of the uncertainty or poor data match therefore it is highly recommended to define an ensemble size that is slightly larger than the solution space dimension to prevent over utilization over fitting or under utilization under fitting of measurement datasets moore and doherty 2006 from an approximation of the solution space dimensionality we chose two hundred realizations to populate the initial ensemble this initial ensemble size is a compromise between the minimum required to properly quantify model uncertainty and the maximum allowed based on computational constraints the two hundred initial parameter realizations were generated by pest where initial parameters values table 1 were assumed to be the mean of a normal distribution associated with the prior standard deviations table 2 5 2 observations and objective function the observations considered for parameter estimation are baseflow swe and aet as described in section 2 hydraulic heads measured in wells are used a posteriori to verify the parameter estimation the observation dataset contains a total of 27 963 observations the most salient parameters for calibration were chosen according to a sensitivity analysis carried out with pest among the 2377 parameters used in the model 2361 belong to the 16 different parameter groups that are included within the parameter estimation process table 1 other parameters such as the van genuchten parameters can only be informed to a small degree with water table measurements brunner et al 2012 so that unsaturated zone parameters are not included in parameters estimation moreover hydrodynamic parameters of the clay unit are also fixed to prior values because there are no observations to support their estimations the objective function used for calibration is the weighted sum of squared differences between simulated and observed data theoretically the weights are inversely proportional to the observation errors however the assimilation of diverse data types is challenging with such regional scale model and acceptable results are very unlikely when following a strict weights formulation in our case baseflow estimations are considered more consistent and reliable targets because baseflow is also the prediction of interest for the model moreover more concern is given to the capacity of the model to reproduce the transient dynamic of baseflow along the representative seasonal cycle thus the weighting strategy is rather based on a soft consideration of the complementary dataset i e swe and aet while focusing parameter estimation on the capacity of the model to reproduce realistic historical simulations of baseflow 6 results 6 1 parameter estimation in the course of defining the initial parameter ensemble 11 realizations were removed due to excessive run times the remaining 189 realizations were then used to evaluate the prior uncertainty fig 8 specific attention was paid to the capacity of the prior realizations to capture most of the baseflow estimations for the representative seasonal cycle for the evaluation of the posterior ensemble two additional realizations were removed due to excessive run times in total 187 realizations were therefore used to populate the posterior ensemble in general the overall objective function was reduced for the posterior ensemble compared to the prior ensemble at the 14 gauging stations fig 8 for some realizations the history match is better than that of the initial calibrated model with gmla because almost all parameters were included in the ies it was not the case for the initial calibration which used a sequential approach to limit the computational cost associated with filling a full ranked jacobian matrix the history matching performance of the snowpack and evapotranspiration can be evaluated over the region and along the representative seasonal cycle from the ensemble mean fig 9 the root mean square error rmse which is used to evaluate the model performance over the region is computed from the sum of the residuals over the representative seasonal cycle it is clear that according to the considered observed datasets the snowpack is overestimated in the appalachians rmse generally higher than 1 m but is reasonably simulated in the lowlands fig 9 this is illustrated by the evaluation of the simulations against the observations for three cells in different parts of the region fig 9 additionally the evapotranspiration performed better in the western part of the model than the eastern part with a regional mean rmse of 3 8 mm fig 9 when looking at transient time series evapotranspiration is overestimated during snowmelt period but the model provides reasonable simulations of evapotranspiration during low flow periods i e usually from july to september the mean parameter values for the posterior ensemble are physically plausible table 1 in general modified parameter values resulting from history matching are consistent with spatial patterns observed within the model such as soil type zonation fig a1 and fall within the expected range of values no mathematical regularization was applied during the application of the ies the posterior ensemble of simulated baseflow demonstrates good agreement with estimated baseflow fig 10 with good reproduction of snowmelt and low flow periods however the posterior ensemble of simulated baseflow does not contain all estimated baseflow values this difference could be attributed to model structural error such as the error induced by the forcing data or mesh resolution also baseflow is estimated and not directly measured and probable estimation errors make a perfect fit not desirable partington et al 2012 the ability of the posterior ensemble to reproduce the estimated dynamics of the historical seasonal baseflow cycle the snow water accumulation and evapotranspiration suggests that this model ensemble can generate realistic baseflow for the entire region 6 2 model evaluation for steady state flow to evaluate the capability of the integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model to reproduce the observed surface drainage network and hydraulic heads steady state simulations were conducted with the ensemble mean for these simulations hgs was forced with a spatially variable flux at the subsurface that represents the mean annual potential infiltration and the model was run until the volume of water in the subsurface reaches a constant value which represents steady state conditions in hgs the surface drainage network is not imposed as a boundary condition but it develops according to the model parameters and is represented by simulated surface water depths fig 11 a visual inspection of the steady state surface water depths indicates a good agreement between the actual and simulated stream flow network for the region especially for major rivers and lakes with surface flow depths representing the delineation of the main lakes there are a few unrealistic surface water accumulations such as in the chateauguay region in the western part of the domain which is likely due to the lower order stream flow network that cannot be precisely represented with the current mesh resolution the illustration of gw sw exchange fluxes across the region shows a majority of groundwater exfiltration along the streams fig 11b this result was expected as the potential infiltration is computed by swmb and assigned to the subsurface domain of hgs which then computes infiltration and exfiltration in an integrated fashion in our case the majority of groundwater exfiltration is located along the streams however the streams are not always gaining groundwater and the water that has exfiltrated to the surface returns to the subsurface via the unsaturated zone the simulated steady state water table is shallow for most of the region with a mean depth to water table dtwt of approximately 8 m fig 12 a the simulated water table depths are consistent with observations and expert knowledge gagné et al 2015 lefebvre et al 2015 cloutier et al 2013 larocque et al 2013 the unsaturated zone is thicker in the mountainous regions of the appalachians in the southwestern part of the model and thinner in the flatter lying regions of the st lawrence lowlands at the northeast limit of the model fig 12a also shows that the spatial variability of the depth to the water table is lower in the lowlands than in the appalachians which is an indication of the magnitude of the hydraulic gradient in the lowlands which are generally characterized by high maximum bedrock hydraulic conductivities lower hydraulic gradients suggest slower groundwater flow and longer groundwater flowpaths groundwater flows generally from the appalachians toward the st lawrence river but groundwater flow direction can be locally influenced by the major streamflow network that drains the aquifers fig 11b in the appalachians which are generally characterized by lower maximum bedrock hydraulic conductivities the opposite conditions are observed with high gradients indicating shorter groundwater flowpaths occurring from points of maximum elevation toward the nearest valley where groundwater exfiltration creates a dense local scale stream network that feeds the larger river system fig 11a the evaluation of the model performance shows that the majority of the groundwater control points are associated with a root mean square error rmse below 10 m and that almost half the observations are below 3 m of rmse fig 13 this is an acceptable result since groundwater levels were not included in the calibration procedure and that the uncertainty indicated by the ensemble variance can easily exceed more than 3 m at locations distant from streams fig 12b thus the rmse is close to the quantified model uncertainty for the majority of observation wells the worst groundwater level performances i e greater than 10 m in rmse are associated to observation wells that are open to the shallow bedrock which is more likely to be fractured overall evaluation of the coupled surface and subsurface flow simulation suggests that the groundwater component of the southeastern québec region is adequately reproduced by the integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model 6 3 regional water budget water budget components were computed for each catchment table 3 precipitation in the western part of the region for example the chateauguay and richelieu catchments is generally lower than in the eastern part such as the chaudière and st françois catchments this distribution is coherent with actual evapotranspiration which is lower in the west and higher in the east although actual evapotranspiration may be water limited for a short period in the summer it is mostly energy limited during the representative seasonal cycle monthly mean over september 2011 to august 2015 due to the humid climate this short water limited period could partly explain consistency between precipitation and actual evapotranspiration patterns potential infiltration fluxes are highly heterogeneous over the region the uncertainty 2σ related to the potential infiltration flux ranges from 5 6 for the well monitored yamaska catchment to 28 2 for the du chene non monitored catchment 6 4 baseflow predictive uncertainty the baseflow predictive uncertainty is quantified through the direct simulation of integrated surface water and groundwater flow for the 187 realizations that populate the posterior ensemble this approach assumes that the model predictive uncertainty is constant from month to month the yearly mean baseflow is simulated at the outlet of the eight major catchments fig 1 and the simulated baseflow distributions are provided by the ensemble of model realizations fig 14 the maximum likelihood baseflow values are 3 0 11 28 15 68 16 64 35 66 40 62 41 56 and 46 62 m3 s 1 for the du chene richelieu nicolet chateauguay becancour yamaska chaudiere and st francois river outlets respectively when looking at specific baseflow table 3 the becancour catchment appears to yield a very high baseflow comparing to the adjacent catchments i e nicolet and chaudiere it is quite surprising since the hydrogeological conditions are not very different in fact the quality of the estimated specific baseflow for the gauging station 024 014 may very well be limited by errors and uncertainty leading to hydrologic simulations that reproduce these errors besides that the chateauguay and yamaska catchments have the most important specific simulated baseflow this is consistent with the geology since most of these catchments are characterized by relatively permeable sediments that favor infiltration at the expense of overland flow table 3 the uncertainty associated to the prediction of potential infiltration table 3 and baseflow fig 14 expressed as a percentage of each model output can be compared to evaluate the main contributor to the total baseflow uncertainty 2σ in general there is no significant change in the uncertainty expressed as a percentage between potential infiltration and baseflow meaning that baseflow predictive uncertainty is therefore mainly controlled by the uncertainty associated with the potential infiltration flux which is closely related to the swmb module parameters as a first interpretation this can be the direct consequence of the parameterization choices for the subsurface flow domain which use pilot points only for the bedrock maximum hydraulic conductivity the majority of parameters belonging to the swmb module were parameterized with pilot points allowing a more robust quantification of the uncertainty for these parameters cui et al 2021 white et al 2017 thus the uncertainty for the parameters related to the swmb module is certainly better quantified than the uncertainty associated to the subsurface flow domain another possible interpretation is that the baseflow uncertainty has been computed from steady state simulations meaning that geological control on the variance of the mean baseflow is minimized because the dynamic groundwater storage has no effects on the simulations moreover the uncertainty of baseflow increases for catchments where estimations of baseflow are scarce e g du chêne and richelieu demonstrating the importance of a dense yet well distributed observation dataset to reduce the model based uncertainty finally the baseflow distributions shown in fig 14 integrate the full extent of the watersheds since the prediction points are at the outlet the uncertainty related to the simulated hydraulic heads fig 12 shows a strong spatial variation over the region with preferential high uncertainties located in deeper water table locations and low uncertainties in shallower aquifer locations thus the uncertainty associated with simulated baseflow is expected to increase in the appalachians where the uncertainty associated with computed hydraulic head predictions is large 7 discussion 7 1 snowpack it has been observed that the snowpack tends to be overestimated in the appalachians while providing reasonable historical simulations in the lowlands this can be attributed to the imperfect temperature index model equation 2 used in a coarse 25 km2 mesh resolution although temperature index melt modelling remains a standard its ability to satisfactorily reproduce snow dynamics in complex terrain is questionable warscher et al 2013 moreover model mesh resolution adopted in this study for the surface water mass balance is certainly too coarse to simulate snow accumulation and snowmelt in steep sub catchments and complex terrain where ablation processes are multiple and snow depth highly variable it is clear that improving spatial distribution and simulation of snow water equivalent over the region is needed for instance more sophisticated distributed energy balance approaches can be recommended thornton et al 2021 cantet et al 2019 the principal consequence of the snowpack overestimation is the increase of evapotranspiration in spring that enables compensation white et al 2014 parameter compensation would remain mostly hidden or overlooked without the consideration of the distributed remote sensing data that helped to strengthen our confidence on the simulations over low flow periods 7 2 model parameterization the model used here includes a parameterization with pilot points for some parameters including bedrock maximum hydraulic conductivity mean soil water stock soil infiltration capacity snowmelt rate and crop coefficients it can be referred to as an intermediary parameterized model compared to models with cell based parameterization presented in some recent studies knowling et al 2019 the use of pilot points was motivated by the need to appropriately quantify the model based uncertainty while ensuring the capacity of the regional model to properly use the spatially variable observations in the region which would have been more challenging with a zone based parameterization cui et al 2021 hunt et al 2020 white et al 2017 hunt et al 2007 moore and doherty 2006 an interesting discussion about model parameterization strategies for a regional scale model can also be found in pool et al 2015 7 3 potential sources of baseflow residual mismatch following the application of ies the spread of the ensemble of historical simulations does not contain all the baseflow estimates over the seasonal cycle due to limitations in the representation of local scale heterogeneity riverine wetlands and riverbank an exact simulation of the estimated baseflow dynamics is not possible and some misfit can be attributed to the incapacity of such a regional scale model to properly represent sub grid processes that can highly influence the baseflow at local scale noorduijn et al 2021 larocque et al 2016 sulis et al 2011a in addition estimation of baseflow is very challenging with automated basefow separation techniques partington et al 2012 so that a perfect fit to the data may not be desirable finally a large proportion of the residual spatio temporal mismatch can probably be attributed to the meteorological forcing data and to the interpolated spatial fields of meteorological variables used to drive the historical model simulations 7 4 representative average seasonal cycle the regional hydrologic model was calibrated following a representative average seasonal cycle that uses monthly normal over four years from september 2011 to august 2015 although the limited four year period considered may reduce the capacity of the model to handle drastically different dynamics this can be seen as a significant improvement of the steady state simulations commonly seen in regional scale integrated modeling studies additionally this temporal aspect of the model discretization is more likely to perform reliably under forcing conditions that exceed the range of historical observations as is typical in climate change impact assessments erler et al 2019 however the daily and interannual variability is not considered in the simulation of baseflow so that monthly normal estimates may be smoothed and intermittent character of gw sw exchanges lost in such an energy limited region this potentially leads to increased infiltration and a positive bias in baseflow and groundwater levels 7 5 overland flow processes the simulated water balance has shown that overland flow i e infiltration excess overland flow represents a large part of the effective rainfall in the proposed modeling framework the overland flow is computed in the water balance module but not included within the integrated surface and subsurface hgs model accordingly it is worthwhile to question the potential consequences of neglecting this part of the water balance on the regional simulations of groundwater levels and gw sw exchanges the proposed hybrid configuration underestimates the total groundwater flux within the modelled domain as runoff is already removed at the source and potentially delayed infiltration by runoff further downstream is neglected partington et al 2013 including all forms of overland flow generation and re infiltration typically requires an integrated model forced with effective rainfall which is a more rigorous way to use hgs it would however lead to a significant increase in the model simulation time 7 6 free drainage boundary condition the parameters were estimated with a simplified model configuration that disregards the surface domain this decision was motivated to further reduce the model computational time in the inverse problem which requires numerous forward model executions in our view it was an acceptable assumption since the streams are mainly characterized with groundwater exfiltration fig 11b however it should be recognized that gw sw interactions are not in a single direction and neglecting return flow in the subsurface may potentially underestimate infiltration leading to a negative bias for baseflow and groundwater levels moreover it did not allow including the land surface model parameters such as the roughness coefficients that can influence baseflow simulations especially for transient dynamics thus the application of ies presented here represents a first step toward a comprehensive parameter estimation of the whole regional model where land surface model parameters can also be included 7 7 withdrawals the hydrological simulations proposed in this study did not consider withdrawals and the model therefore represents the natural hydrological state when inspecting the regional water balance table 3 it is clear that the amount of groundwater pumping is very small and almost always within the range of uncertainty for the baseflow simulations accordingly neglecting the contribution of groundwater pumping is not expected to influence significantly the results at this scale 7 8 model application we do not anticipate that such a model can be used for highly detailed reproduction of baseflow dynamics at any location along a stream and smaller watershed scale model would be better suited for this task we rather encourage the development of nested catchment models where simulation outputs from this regional scale model can be valuable for smaller scale models for example by providing boundary conditions however this regional model can be particularly suitable and stand alone to provide detailed representations of regional water balance processes and estimation of baseflow at the scale of the major watersheds represented over the region additionally the present model should be restricted to studying dynamic processes following a representative average seasonal cycle approach to be consistent with the performance assessment used in this study 8 conclusions a computationally efficient integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model that specifically addresses baseflow predictions for a regional scale domain has been presented to avoid the significant computation times and potential numerical instabilities typically associated with such integrated models a surface water mass balance module was coupled to the integrated hydrogeosphere hgs modeling platform and potential infiltration was treated as an input flux rather than total precipitation with this increased computational efficiency and the use of a highly parallelized computer cluster a rigorous calibration constrained uncertainty analysis has been provided this study therefore represents one of the first instances of a non linear predictive uncertainty analysis for a regional scale and integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model an ensemble of equally probable models was generated to provide explicit regional simulations of baseflow for eight majors watersheds along with the associated predictive uncertainty further work is required to investigate the effects of process simplification boundary conditions and uncertainty quantification to reduce the current model limitations comparison of models simulations using different conceptualizations and boundary

3647,integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic models are particularly well suited for the simulation of baseflow as exchange fluxes does not rely on boundary conditions regional scale hydrologic models are of particular interest as they can provide guidance to stakeholders toward sustainable water resources management however integrated hydrologic models are rarely considered at the regional scale because their computational costs usually prevent efficient model calibration and predictive uncertainty analysis moreover estimation of baseflow and each water budget component usually requires additional post processing steps in this paper we thus aim here to provide a hybrid approach for the application of an integrated hydrologic model at the regional scale when low flow processes are of primary concern a surface water mass balance module has been developed to solve the hydrological mass balance from precipitations and temperature datasets this module calculates potential infiltration fluxes that are used as input to the integrated modeling platform hydrogeosphere hgs this approach provides a computationally tractable integrated model where low flow processes are explicitly considered baseflows generated in an integrated fashion and each water budget component accessible the model is applied to a region covering 36 900 km2 in the southeastern part of the province of quebec canada thanks to the computational efficiency of the approach a rigorous mathematical parameter estimation the levenberg marquardt form of the iterative ensemble smoother can be considered to calibrate the model to baseflow of eight main rivers snow water equivalent and evapotranspiration an ensemble of 187 equally probable realizations was used for history matching of observations and for the non linear uncertainty analysis an improved representation of baseflow can be linked to an appropriate non linear uncertainty quantification through an efficient integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model to support managing water resources at the regional scale keywords process based hydrological model iterative ensemble smoother baseflow regional scale 1 introduction the simulation of baseflow which is the groundwater flow component of streamflow requires a quantitative assessment of groundwater surface water gw sw exchanges in regional hydrologic models the governing flow equations for the surface and the subsurface are usually not explicitly solved in an integrated fashion with two way exchange between the surface and the subsurface and simulated baseflow strongly depends on boundary conditions for example in surface hydrologic models baseflow is often assumed to be equal to the outlet from a groundwater flow reservoir in which simplified groundwater flow equations are solved which can potentially hinder the application of these models to investigate low flow dynamics in subsurface hydrology groundwater flow models are often linked to a conductance concept to generate baseflow potentially increasing the uncertainty associated with baseflow simulations brunner et al 2010 for either surface or subsurface hydrologic models the simulation of baseflow may raise critical issues as simplifying assumptions are usually made regarding one domain or the other staudinger et al 2019 thus proper simulation of baseflow ideally requires an integrated solution of the equations between the surface and the subsurface integrated surface and subsurface hydrological models eliminate boundaries between surface and subsurface such that the simulation of baseflow can be significantly improved brunner et al 2017 this new generation of numerical models are increasingly used at the catchment scale i e less than 10 000 km2 tagnon et al 2020 cochand et al 2019 goderniaux et al 2009 and for basin to continental areas covering more than 100 000 km2 xu et al 2021 chen et al 2020 maxwell et al 2015 catchment scale models usually offer computationally tractable solutions that can be useful to investigate specific river groundwater interactions issues at the catchment scale these models are often associated with robust assisted calibration algorithms and the uncertainties are generally well discussed schilling et al 2017 goderniaux et al 2015 on the other hand large scale models are often used to quantify physical processes and components of a large scale water balance contrary to catchment scale models these large scale models are less frequently coupled with assisted calibration algorithms and less attention is given to quantify uncertainty regional scale models are an intermediate between catchment scale and large scale models the regional scale is also often very well suited for water resource managers as it can correspond to the territory covered by water agencies however high computational costs associated with integrated numerical models at the regional scale are often a constraint for their development in a reasonable timeframe moreover regional scale model must be also accepted as a reliable tool by the practitioners thus demonstrating model calibration and quantification of the uncertainties which typically require numerous model executions are a prerequisite toward the acceptance of the model doherty and moore 2020 delottier et al 2017 as a result integrated surface and subsurface numerical models are often disregarded at the regional scale and the representation of gw sw interactions is therefore simplified barthel and banzhaf 2016 the hydrogeosphere hgs model is applied here at the regional scale hgs is an integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model that simulates coupled three dimensional variably saturated subsurface flow and two dimensional surface water flow brunner and simmons 2012 hgs is also capable of simulating snow accumulation snowmelt and evapotranspiration the code can either be coupled to a climate model davison et al 2018 or forced with climatic variables goderniaux et al 2011 in hgs precipitation is the main input and it is redistributed along the surface and in the subsurface through the solution of the governing flow equations however due to the extensive surface subsurface coupling in hgs inputting precipitation directly can result in long simulation times for a regional scale model thus to reduce simulation times hgs is used here with the surface water mass balance module ledoux et al 1984 of eaudyssée a french integrated modeling platform pryet et al 2015 saleh et al 2011 the surface water mass balance module swmb is able to generate spatially and temporally variable potential infiltration rates at a low computational cost the resulting potential infiltration is then used as the input flux assigned to the integrated hgs model instead of assigning total precipitation although the infiltration processes are simplified in swmb the integrated surface and subsurface flow is still simulated at the regional scale within hgs this proposed hybrid approach reduces computational time which in turn enables the use of more mathematically rigorous ensemble based methods of parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis another benefit of this hybrid configuration is that hgs can directly simulate baseflow which typically requires advanced and computationally restrictive volumetric balance post processing tools when hgs is forced with precipitations partington et al 2011 this modeling approach is applied to a 36 900 km2 region in southeastern quebec canada where the hydrology is strongly influenced by the annual snowmelt in this region baseflow derived freshwater and groundwater are important water sources for ecosystems and human activities e g agriculture drinking water supply the region includes the watersheds of eight main rivers with regional groundwater flow dynamics originating from the appalachian uplands and emerging in the lowlands beaudry et al 2018 janos et al 2018 saby et al 2016 previous modeling studies in the region focused on the catchment scale for example in gagné et al 2018 levison et al 2016 sulis et al 2011b but the broader groundwater flow dynamics of the entire region have not yet been investigated the choice of this region was also motivated by the need to address challenges related to supporting water resources management and climate change adaptation larocque et al 2019 finally the southeastern québec is the most data dense region in the québec province in terms of observations and hydrogeological understanding which enables the development of such an integrated surface and subsurface numerical model a comprehensive parameter estimation and non linear uncertainty analysis are also presented using the levenberg marquardt form of the iterative ensemble smoother ies chen and oliver 2013 this algorithm allows for the implementation of a calibration constrained predictive uncertainty analysis that produces an ensemble of equally probable models at a significantly lower computational cost than that required by the more classical monte carlo analysis white 2018 the hydrogeological context of the region as well as the data used by the model is first presented then the underlying theory and implementation of the surface water mass balance module is thoroughly described with a brief description of the major equations used by hgs the model development and parameter estimation are then described followed by the presentation of baseflow simulations at the regional scale finally model assumptions and limitations are discussed 2 study area this study is carried out over an area of 36 900 km2 located south of the st lawrence river between montréal and québec city in southeastern québec canada fig 1 the topography is relatively flat in lowlands aligned with the st lawrence river where surface slopes are less than 2 on average and it is more pronounced in the appalachians with surface slopes exceeding 7 a mixed forest of conifer and hardwood covers 43 of the area a large portion of the forest has been cleared for agricultural activities mainly along the saint lawrence river in the lowlands and agricultural land covers 55 of the total area crops mainly consist of cereals corn and wheat and oilseeds soybeans arable zones in the lowlands are mostly drained swamps where groundwater is available for irrigation in the summer groundwater also represents a source of drinking water for some municipalities the region is characterized by a continental humid climate with pronounced seasonal variations with warm and wet summers and cold and dry winters as an example the daily average temperature for the southwestern portion of the region ranges from a low of 10 1 c in january to a high of 19 4 c in july with 1142 mm for the average annual precipitations environment canada winter precipitation may either be solid snow or liquid rain and fallen snow may either accumulate or melt depending on the ambient air temperature snowfall generally starts in november and continues until march when snowmelt typically begins the hydrogeological regime is strongly influenced by snowmelt which generates the highest surface flows snowmelt is also a primary source for infiltration and it increases soil saturation leading to increased exchanges fluxes between the surface and the subsurface germain et al 2020 infiltration from snowmelt represents the main annual groundwater recharge event schilling et al 2021 the region contains eight major river catchments that are from east to west the chateauguay 2588 km2 richelieu 2613 km2 yamaska 4832 km2 st françois 10346 km2 nicolet 3442 km2 bécancour 2607 km2 du chêne 813 km2 and chaudière 6755 km2 catchments fig 1 the main drainage network is oriented in a southeastern northwestern direction flow in the main rivers is in the northwestern direction and they discharge into the st lawrence river at the northwestern edge of the area fig 1 2 1 the geology two distinct geologic provinces form the bedrock in the study area the appalachian orogen in the southeast and the st lawrence sedimentary platform in the northwest nastev et al 2016 the boundary between the two provinces is shown by the green line in fig 1 the appalachian orogen is characterized by extensively thrusted sheets of low grade metamorphic rocks which create a hilly topography with a well developed drainage network the st lawrence sedimentary platform consists of a topographically low flat lying sequence of sandstones and carbonates the bedrock units of both provinces form a continuous regional aquifer a comprehensive analysis of thousands of water well specific capacity tests in the western part of the study area richelieu and yamaska catchments showed that the hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock decreases significantly with depth and reaches a minimum value representative of sparsely fractured bedrock at a depth of 100 m laurencelle 2018 this observed vertical decrease of hydraulic conductivity is consistent with common hard rock aquifer conceptual models lachassagne et al 2021 moreover it was found that high hydraulic conductivity values are generally in the upper 20 40 m of the bedrock where weathering has been more intense this upper bedrock is generally characterized with significant variation of hydraulic conductivity with depth spanning several orders of magnitude with maximum hydraulic conductivity values preferentially located in the lowlands where the weathering profile has probably been preserved from erosion in the appalachians where the weathering profile is less significant the maximum hydraulic conductivity values are lower and the vertical range of hydraulic conductivity is less pronounced laurencelle 2018 the bedrock is overlain by a thin succession of discontinuous quaternary sediments which contrary to the bedrock exhibit strong spatial heterogeneity over the region to characterize this spatial heterogeneity a regional 3d hydrostratigraphic model for the quaternary sediments has been proposed from a compilation of 3d models already existing for several watersheds and the analysis of thousands of public water well records nastev et al 2016 the quaternary sediments can be grouped into three distinct hydrostratigraphic units 1 sandy sediments sand unit that consist of littoral and sublittoral permeable sands 2 low permeability clayey sediments clay unit deposited in large surface water bodies that inundated the area at the end of the last glaciation and 3 compact basal glacial and non glacial deposits till unit typically of low permeability deposited during the last glacial advance the spatial distribution of sediments in the geological model was used to generate the spatial distribution of the geological units fig 2 in the hgs finite element model which is described later in the appalachians the quaternary sediment cover is generally thin and discontinuous and consists primarily of till rock outcrops are more common in the appalachians than in the sedimentary platform the sand and the clay units are mostly absent in the appalachians and occur almost exclusively in the lowlands of the st lawrence platform where they overlie the till unit when the clay unit is present its thickness is on average 20 to 30 m with maximum values ranging between 50 and 70 m 2 2 forcing input weather data in order to estimate seasonal baseflow an historical weather dataset precipitations and temperatures that spans the canada and united states border and therefore covers the whole study area is considered https daymet ornl gov the historical data were generated by spatially interpolating ground observations with a gaussian weighting scheme of surrounding weather stations using the daymet algorithm thornton et al 1997 information on the location of weather stations used to build the daymet data can be found at https daymet ornl gov overview html daily precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature at a spatial resolution of 1 km2 were downloaded daymet version 3 and spatially aggregated over a structured 25 km2 forcing grid fig 4 general information on the quality of the three daymet model outputs considered minimum maximum temperature and precipitations can be found for the continental united states essou et al 2016 newman et al 2015 overall the daymet dataset is identified as generally wetter than other databases this pattern was confirmed in the lake champlain basin which is a nearby area of the southeastern québec region huang et al 2020 also another recent study evaluates the differences between four common gridded precipitation datasets used in north america including daymet for the estimation of the water budget components in a montagneous watershed schreiner mcgraw and ajami 2020 specifically they found that the daymet dataset has a higher bias in estimating snow water equivalent 2 3 ground based observations fourteen streamflow gauging stations distributed in the study area fig 4 provide direct measurements of total daily streamflow q for the period 1970 to 2016 from direct measurements of streamflow the hydrograph separation allows to estimate the baseflow which is assumed here to be the groundwater flow component of streamflow baseflow is considered as the primary observation type as it is also the main prediction of the model the hydrograph can be separated with experimental modelling or river discharge filtering methods healy and scanlon 2010 however experimental studies are more appropriate for field scale approaches and modelling solutions can be time consuming and not as appropriate at the regional scale in this study we benefited from a previous regional project poirier 2012 that provided estimation of parameters for several hydrometric stations in the region by the application of the eckhardt recursive digital filter rdf method eckhardt 2005 the general form of the rdf is 1 qb t 1 bfi max λ qb t 1 1 λ bfi max q t 1 λ bfi max where qbt is the filtered baseflow m3 s 1 at the time t qbt 1 is the filtered baseflow m3 s 1 at time t 1 bfimax is the maximum value of the baseflow index which is the long term ratio of baseflow to total streamflow λ is the baseflow recession constant and qt is the total streamflow m3 s 1 at time t the rdf parameters used for this study are summarised in table a1 eq 1 has been used to estimate daily baseflow from daily streamflow measurements as illustrated in fig 3 the estimated baseflow is then aggregated monthly and the monthly means of baseflow from september 2011 to august 2015 are used for the estimation of baseflow during a representative average seasonal cycle that ranges from september to august this overall procedure has been implemented with the software r r core team 2013 and applied for each of the fourteen gauging stations despite the approximations made for the estimation of baseflow the resulting values are assumed to be representative of the real groundwater flow component of streamflow for the considered gauging stations to characterize prior spatial variation of the estimated baseflow across the region the mean monthly baseflow of the representative average seasonal cycle for late summer i e september is normalized with the watershed area of the considered gauging stations overall the normalized baseflow ranges from 27 to 120 mm y 1 fig 4 these normalized baseflow values do not indicate an obvious correlation and presence of spatial patterns between the watersheds as baseflow can be related to a series of different factors such as geology soils climate land use and physiography of the watersheds in addition to baseflow estimates a network of forty monitoring wells provide hydraulic head data fig 4 those wells are screened in either the most permeable surficial sediments sand and till units or in the most permeable section of the bedrock aquifer which is typically near the contact with the overlying glacial sediments in these wells the water table depth is generally within 10 m from ground surface and annual water table fluctuations range from 1 to 2 5 m continuous hydraulic head records are primarily available for the period from 2000 to 2016 which is shorter than the period for streamflow 2 4 satellite based observations satellite based hydrologic data on snow cover and evapotranspiration were also considered to complement the coverage provided by ground based observations these historical data were included to increase the spatial and temporal distribution of historical hydrologic information while providing complementary evaluation of relevant variables simulated by the integrated model the use of spatially distributed data derived from remote sensing is always interesting in constraining the models during calibration brunner et al 2007 typically these satellite based observations are used to evaluate the relative regional model performance in quantifying the hydrologic water balance the snow water equivalent swe was obtained by the snodas modelling and data assimilation system carroll et al 2001 this system integrates snow data from satellite airborne platforms and ground stations with model estimates of snow cover the swe data are at a temporal and spatial resolution of 1 day and 1 km2 respectively for the period from 2011 to 2015 which is when the swe data were mostly available the maximum snow accumulation reaches 140 cm assuming 100 kg m 3 for snow density and the typical snow thickness varies between 0 and 100 cm finally actual evapotranspiration aet was obtained by the modis myd16a2 land algorithm this algorithm is based on the penman monteith equation which uses daily meteorological data and 8 day remotely sensed vegetation property dynamics running et al 2017 the temporal and spatial resolutions of the aet data are 8 days and 0 25 km2 respectively the aet records were mostly available for the period 2003 to 2016 for this study the original swe and aet datasets have been spatially aggregated to the 25 km2 weather forcing grid fig 4 and the temporal resolution was harmonized over a monthly time scale 3 modeling approach the integrated regional model developed here involves a surface water mass balance swmb module and the integrated surface and subsurface hydrogeosphere hgs model fig 5 the following section presents the underlying theory of the swmb module and hgs and the interaction between these two models 3 1 the surface water mass balance module the swmb module developed here is based on a production function ledoux et al 1984 that has been included in the french hydrologic modeling platform eaudyssée pryet et al 2015 saleh et al 2011 the module splits daily precipitation into actual evapotranspiration overland flow soil storage and infiltration by using a series of cascading reservoirs that are in order the snowpack the water balance the partition and the transfer reservoirs fig 5 daily total precipitation flux m s 1 and air temperature c are the main input to the swmb module rain and snow fluxes are differentiated according to an air temperature threshold tth c when the mean daily temperature t c is below the threshold precipitation for that interval is labelled as snow and is accumulated within a snowpack reservoir fig 5 the volume of snow accumulated expressed as snow water equivalent swe m is computed with a snow module the snow module is not originally proposed in the production function and it was added into the swmb for this snow influenced region following an enhanced temperature based formulation massmann 2019 that module also calculates snowmelt water flux qe m s 1 when the mean temperature increases above the threshold using 2 qe η t t th ω r n for t t th where η m c 1 s 1 is the melting constant also known as the day degree factor rn w m 2 is the net radiation which is the difference between the net shortwave and longwave radiations and ω m s 1 w m 2 1 is a factor converting the energy flux density to snowmelt depth the day degree factor is a lumped parameter that encapsulates the effects of consistent topographical patterns such as slope or aspect snowmelt occurs as long as the volume of snow accumulated is positive because the net radiation term is considered explicitly in eq 2 the melting constant which requires estimation depends only on the diurnal range of temperatures which makes the calculation of snowmelt more robust in the context of climate change raleigh and clark 2014 for the simulations presented here sublimation losses from the snowpack are not considered because the contribution of sublimation to the total water balance is assumed negligible schilling et al 2021 the total liquid precipitation flux pl m s 1 is the sum of rain and snowmelt water it is routed to the water balance reservoir which computes actual evapotranspiration flux aet m s 1 and generates qwater m s 1 which is the flux of water leaving the water balance reservoir if evapotranspiration and water storage needs are met fig 5 the computation of the actual evapotranspiration flux typically requires the definition of a potential evapotranspiration flux etc m s 1 which is computed following the crop coefficient approach pereira et al 2015 allen et al 1998 3 e t c k c et 0 where et0 m s 1 is a reference potential evapotranspiration flux and kc is a crop coefficient used to scale et0 according to land cover and crop growing seasons based on the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 define the following daily reference potential evapotranspiration et0 from a reference crop surface with an assumed crop height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 4 et 0 0 408 δ r n γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 342 u 2 where t c is the mean daily temperature u2 is the averaged wind speed at a height of 2 m m s 1 ea kpa is the actual vapor pressure es ea represents the vapour pressure deficit of the air kpa δ is the slope of the relationship between the saturation vapor pressure and temperature kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the net radiation term rn in eq 2 differs from that in eq 4 only by the albedo used in the calculation of net shortwave radiations rns because the albedo is usually higher for snow covered surface due to snow reflection the assessment of et0 requires weather data that are not available in the historical weather dataset so that missing data concerning humidity and radiations are estimated from temperatures allen et al 1998 accordingly rns which is usually measured locally with a pyranometer is rather derived from the daily air temperature range tmax tmin with hargreaves radiation formula allen et al 1998 5 r ns 1 a l b e d o k rs t max t min r a where ra mj m 2 d 1 is the daily extraterrestrial radiation that is a function of latitude and time of year and krs is an adjustment coefficient that is usually set to 0 16 for locations where land mass dominates and air masses are not strongly influenced by a large water body additionally the actual vapor pressure ea usually derived from humidity measurements is rather estimated by assuming that the dewpoint temperature is near the daily minimum temperature tmin 6 e a 0 611 e x p 17 27 t min t min 237 3 although eq 4 requires some meteorological data that have to be approximated from temperatures to compute the reference potential evapotranspiration it explicitly considers radiative fluxes which are critical in a physically based assessment of the impacts of climate change erler et al 2019 actual evapotranspiration is computed in the water balance reservoir with 7 aet m i n et c r b p eff q water where r b m is the current level of the water balance reservoir which is updated at the end of a daily stress period the term qwater m s 1 is the remaining movable water flux that can leave the water balance reservoir if evapotranspiration and water storage needs are met this movable water is given by 8 q water m a x r b p eff r bmax 0 m a x 0 r h a r b a 2 r b a m a x 0 r h a r b a 4 c r t d c r t where crt m is the mean soil capacity and dcrt m is the minimum soil capacity these two

infiltration excess overland flow qo m s 1 and potential infiltration qi m s 1 according to the maximum soil infiltration capacity fn m s 1 with qi min qwater fn and qo max 0 qwater qi the potential infiltration qi is immediately available as input to the hydrogeosphere model whilst the infiltration excess overland flow qo is not included in hydrogeosphere 3 2 the hydrogeosphere model hydrogeosphere hgs is an integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model that solves fully coupled two dimensional surface water and three dimensional groundwater flow using the control volume finite element method brunner and simmons 2012 hgs splits the total simulation domain into a subsurface domain representing groundwater flow and a surface domain for surface water flow three dimensional variability saturated groundwater flow is described by richards equation 13 s w s s ψ t θ s w t k k r ψ z γ ex q where θ s s m 1 ψ m z m and k m s 1 are porosity specific storage pressure head elevation head and saturated hydraulic conductivity respectively the volumetric fluid exchange rate between the surface and the subsurface domains is represented by γ ex m3 m 3 s 1 and q is a source or sink term within the subsurface domain m3 s 1 in variably saturated conditions the relative permeability k r is a function of the saturation s w and is modeled following the van genuchten equations van genuchten 1980 s w s wr 1 s wr 1 α ψ β v 14 s w 1 ψ 0 with the relative permeability given by k r s e l p 1 1 s e 1 v v 2 15 v 1 1 β β 1 where α m 1 is the inverse of the air entry pressure head β is the pore size distribution index lp is the pore connectivity parameter assumed equal to 0 5 and se is often called an effective saturation given by se sw swr 1 swr with swr being the residual water saturation two dimensional surface water flow is described by the diffusion wave equation 16 ϕ 0 h 0 t x d 0 k ox h 0 x y d 0 k oy h 0 y d 0 γ 0 q 0 where ϕ 0 is a surface flow domain porosity h 0 m is the surface water elevation d 0 m is the surface water flow depth γ 0 m3 m 3 s 1 is the volumetric fluid exchange between the surface and the subsurface domains and q 0 m s 1 is a source or sink term within the surface domain the surface conductances k ox m s 1 and k oy m s 1 are approximated by manning s equation hgs couples the surface and subsurface domains through a dual node approach that requires a coupling length l exch m to set a virtual exchange surface between the domains liggett et al 2012 the coupling term is expressed as 17 d 0 γ 0 k r k v l exch h h 0 where k v m s 1 is the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity of the underlying porous media kr is the relative permeability of the interface between surface and subsurface and h m is hydraulic head this type of coupling scheme was found to be numerically efficient compared to the common node approach rooij 2017 ebel et al 2009 the coupled non linear equations are linearized with the newton raphson method and the resulting matrix system is solved iteratively therrien and sudicky 1996 the solution is marched through time with an adaptive time stepping procedure 3 3 interaction between swmb and hgs total precipitation is the input to hgs when it is used as a stand alone model the model then partitions total precipitation into evapotranspiration surface and subsurface flow components according to the model parameters swmb is used here instead to partition total precipitation into potential infiltration qi when the infiltration capacity fn of the soil allows infiltration this means that the term overland flow qo removed from the model water balance is physically referred to the infiltration excess hortonian overland flow that occurs when the soil s infiltration capacity is exceeded qi is then temporally aggregated as a monthly mean and used in hgs as a specified flux boundary condition for the subsurface i e the top layer over the structured 25 km2 forcing grid accordingly qi is only referred as a potential infiltration because the saturation excess overland flow can occurs when the water table rise to the land surface swmb therefore replaces the surface partitioning option already available in hgs with the advantage of greatly reducing simulation times at regional scale the hgs model can then be used with the surface flow domain active integrated model or inactive variably saturated groundwater model note that the inactive surface water flow domain is only used for the model calibration which will be described later this weak loosely coupling i e one way interaction between swmb and hgs allows for an explicit physically based and computationally efficient simulation of low flow processes at the regional scale with an integrated surface and subsurface flow model although swmb and hgs are run completely consecutively the use of hgs allows the representation of feedbacks between the surface and the subsurface but oriented toward the low flow processes thus the proposed interaction between swmb and hgs is a significant improvement of the commonly used procedure where the subsurface is usually disconnected from the surface water flow domain barthel and banzhaf 2016 4 model setup 4 1 3d mesh prior to generating a full 3d mesh for the study area a 2d mesh was generated to discretize the horizontal extent of the simulation domain shown in fig 1 a 2d unstructured triangular mesh with lateral inter nodal spacing ranging from 500 m to 1000 m fig 6 was generated with algomesh hydroalgorithmics pty ltd 2016 the mesh was refined near the main hydrological features such as the regional streamflow network and lake boundaries and also close to the groundwater wells the nodal elevations of the 2d mesh fig 1 were interpolated from a 90 m resolution srtm digital elevation model jarvis et al 2008 the 2d mesh was then replicated vertically through the subsurface to generate the 3d mesh a total of 20 finite element layers of variable thickness were thus used to discretize the subsurface extending from ground surface to a depth of 200 m below ground surface this depth is above the fresh and brackish water interface in the region and density driven effects can be neglected the vertical extent of the model is shown for two cross sections in fig 2 illustrating the variable elevation of ground surface and the thickness of the bedrock the mesh was refined vertically a portion of the mesh shown in fig 6 illustrates the horizontal refinement close to the surface drainage network and the vertical refinement in the upper part of the mesh and deeper at the top of the bedrock the resulting 3d finite element mesh contains 1 8 million nodes and 3 4 million elements 4 2 material properties as mentioned previously the spatial distribution of the geological units within the 3d mesh shown in fig 2 is derived from the 3d model compiled by nastev et al 2016 the facies associated to the voxels of the 3d geological model are transferred to the 3d hgs mesh with a geospatial nearest neighbour function the hydraulic properties of the quaternary sediments were assumed homogeneous within each unit and representative initial values prior to calibration were taken from the literature table 1 bedrock is represented as an equivalent porous medium and as opposed to each unit forming the quaternary sediments its hydraulic conductivity decreases by several orders of magnitude with depth thus the following exponential equation was used to assign a hydraulic conductivity that decreases with depth from a maximum value k max m s 1 at the top of bedrock to a minimum value k min m s 1 janos et al 2018 18 log k z l o g k min l o g k max l o g k min e α l z where k z m s 1 is the hydraulic conductivity at a depth z m below the top of bedrock and α l m 1 is a decay constant furthermore to account for the larger maximum hydraulic conductivity of bedrock in the st lawrence lowlands compared to the appalachians a spatially variable value of kmax was adjusted over the study area using the pilot point method doherty 2003 a total of 336 pilot points were distributed across the model domain with a mean distance of 15 km between points fig 4 and table 1 the pilot points for spatially distributed parameters are estimated at discrete locations and then interpolated over the 25 km2 grid an isotropic exponential variogram with a range of 45 km a sill of 1 and a nugget of zero was used to generate at a 25 km2 resolution the heterogeneous conditional estimation of the parameters other parameters that were adjusted using pilot points are identified in table 1 4 3 boundary conditions a no flow boundary condition was assigned to the bottom of the model the lateral boundaries of the surface flow domain including the st lawrence river were assigned a critical depth boundary condition which allows surface water to freely exit the model until the water level reaches a prescribed critical depth fig 1 this boundary condition helps prevent unrealistic surface water pounding along the edges of the model as a result of the coarse mesh resolution which may create local topographic lows along the st lawrence river the majority of surface water is leaving the domain at the prediction points illustrated in fig 1 which are used for the predictive uncertainty analysis presented in section 6 4 a no flow boundary condition was assigned to the lateral boundaries of the subsurface domain which corresponds to groundwater divides the model is intended to represent the natural hydrological state of the domain and anthropogenic influences such as dam driven streamflow regulation and municipal water withdrawals are not considered the potential infiltration flux computed by swmb is assigned to the subsurface faces located at the top of the model and converted by hgs into nodal volumetric fluxes by multiplying by the contributing area of the chosen face for an integrated surface and subsurface flow simulation with hgs that infiltration water can migrate deeper in the subsurface or exfiltrate in the surface domain thus the surface flow domain is expected to be mostly characterized by water exfiltrating from the porous media domain to reduce simulation times during the calibration step a free drainage boundary condition was applied to the subsurface top faces to prevent exfiltrated water from returning to the porous media domain using this type of boundary conditions is equivalent to assuming that the regional aquifers are mainly drained by the major streamflow network i e the return flow is neglected during calibration the baseflow simulated at a gauging station is approximated as the sum of all exfiltrated water from the top faces within a given watershed fig 4 once calibration was completed the free drainage boundary condition was removed so that exfiltrated water can eventually reinfiltrate and return to the porous media domain 4 4 simulation control all processes within the swmb module are computed on a daily basis from the weather forcing data which are the daily mean precipitation and the minimum and maximum daily mean temperatures fig 7 a control period that ranges from 2011 09 01 to 2015 08 31 fig 7 was chosen for calibration because it represents the best overlap between the available observed data and the historical weather forcing records thus providing the maximum number of observations the daily potential infiltration fluxes computed by swmb along the four years period are aggregated into monthly mean fluxes for simulating a representative average seasonal cycle with hgs this seasonal cycle ranges from september to august thus hgs is running with monthly stress periods along one single year i e 12 stress periods representing the seasonal variability observed in four years 2011 to 2015 the representative average seasonal cycle can be viewed as a compromise between steady states and fully transient simulations in order to simulate the seasonal variability while maintaining forward simulations computationally tractable the maximum time step size in hgs is set to five days the newton absolute and newton residual convergence criteria were set sufficiently low to reach a mass balance error less than 5 which is consistent with the assumed error on forcing data at the regional scale however the mass balance error was usually less than 1 in an integrated surface water and groundwater mode the hgs model takes 12 h to simulate the representative seasonal cycle for a full year using 8 cpus in parallel on a inter xeon cpu e5 1650 v3 3 5 ghz with 32 go memory computer when exfiltrated water is not allowed to return in the porous media domain for model calibration the simulation time is reduced to 2 5 h for 1 cpu this significant reduction of simulation time allows computing the uncertainty analysis constrained by calibration on a highly parallelized cluster www computecanada ca 5 parameter estimation approach a levenberg marquardt form of the iterative ensemble smoother ies is applied for parameter estimation chen and oliver 2013 ies is a batch form of the ensemble kalman filter enkf where all data are assimilated in a single step and model parameters can be updated iteratively it is well suited for efficient history matching and uncertainty quantification in high parameter dimension space the levenberg marquardt form of the iterative ensemble smoother has been implemented into the model independent software pest white 2018 the ies does not require to compute a full rank jacobian matrix which is computationally expensive the computational therefore only depends on the number of realizations within the ensemble rather than the number of model parameters in addition to pest pest hp and pest related utilities such as addreg1 ppcov parrep and genlinpred available in the pest suite package were also used for refining parameter estimates and to compute various statistics doherty 2021a b 5 1 the initial ensemble the performance of the ies is related to its ability to reduce the prior uncertainty while providing a reliable estimate of the posterior uncertainty performance is primarily driven by the quality and size of the initial ensemble that must encompass as best as possible the observations evensen 2018 to improve the initial ensemble mean prior to applying the ies preliminary simulations were designed to improve first estimates of parameters following a manually and assisted procedure for the latter the classic form of the gmla gauss marquardt levenberg algorithm aster et al 2018 marquardt 1963 was used in conjunction with a tikhonov regularization and singular value decomposition doherty 2015 tikhonov and arsenin 1977 to ensure that these initial estimates remained realistic from a hydrogeological perspective for instance parameters that are associated with land use and soil type information in the swmb module were initially estimated by including the soft knowledge of these regional zones providing generally consistent initial conditional estimation of these parameters in the surface domain of hgs commonly used manning s roughness coefficients were manually adjusted to produce the most realistic surface water depth distribution these initial values which are assumed to represent the best prior knowledge before the generation of the initial ensemble are listed in table 1 because the sensitivity matrix is approximated from the ensemble the size of the initial ensemble is critical for the performance of ies the closer the initial ensemble size is to the parameter space dimension the better is the fit between the observed data and simulated values however there is no advantage in choosing an ensemble size equal to the number of parameters as there will be no computational gain for the calculation of the sensitivity matrix thus the size of the initial ensemble is often driven by the computational resource limits however an ensemble size that is too small can lead to ensemble collapse and spurious correlations chen and oliver 2017 it can have negative consequences such as underestimation of the uncertainty or poor data match therefore it is highly recommended to define an ensemble size that is slightly larger than the solution space dimension to prevent over utilization over fitting or under utilization under fitting of measurement datasets moore and doherty 2006 from an approximation of the solution space dimensionality we chose two hundred realizations to populate the initial ensemble this initial ensemble size is a compromise between the minimum required to properly quantify model uncertainty and the maximum allowed based on computational constraints the two hundred initial parameter realizations were generated by pest where initial parameters values table 1 were assumed to be the mean of a normal distribution associated with the prior standard deviations table 2 5 2 observations and objective function the observations considered for parameter estimation are baseflow swe and aet as described in section 2 hydraulic heads measured in wells are used a posteriori to verify the parameter estimation the observation dataset contains a total of 27 963 observations the most salient parameters for calibration were chosen according to a sensitivity analysis carried out with pest among the 2377 parameters used in the model 2361 belong to the 16 different parameter groups that are included within the parameter estimation process table 1 other parameters such as the van genuchten parameters can only be informed to a small degree with water table measurements brunner et al 2012 so that unsaturated zone parameters are not included in parameters estimation moreover hydrodynamic parameters of the clay unit are also fixed to prior values because there are no observations to support their estimations the objective function used for calibration is the weighted sum of squared differences between simulated and observed data theoretically the weights are inversely proportional to the observation errors however the assimilation of diverse data types is challenging with such regional scale model and acceptable results are very unlikely when following a strict weights formulation in our case baseflow estimations are considered more consistent and reliable targets because baseflow is also the prediction of interest for the model moreover more concern is given to the capacity of the model to reproduce the transient dynamic of baseflow along the representative seasonal cycle thus the weighting strategy is rather based on a soft consideration of the complementary dataset i e swe and aet while focusing parameter estimation on the capacity of the model to reproduce realistic historical simulations of baseflow 6 results 6 1 parameter estimation in the course of defining the initial parameter ensemble 11 realizations were removed due to excessive run times the remaining 189 realizations were then used to evaluate the prior uncertainty fig 8 specific attention was paid to the capacity of the prior realizations to capture most of the baseflow estimations for the representative seasonal cycle for the evaluation of the posterior ensemble two additional realizations were removed due to excessive run times in total 187 realizations were therefore used to populate the posterior ensemble in general the overall objective function was reduced for the posterior ensemble compared to the prior ensemble at the 14 gauging stations fig 8 for some realizations the history match is better than that of the initial calibrated model with gmla because almost all parameters were included in the ies it was not the case for the initial calibration which used a sequential approach to limit the computational cost associated with filling a full ranked jacobian matrix the history matching performance of the snowpack and evapotranspiration can be evaluated over the region and along the representative seasonal cycle from the ensemble mean fig 9 the root mean square error rmse which is used to evaluate the model performance over the region is computed from the sum of the residuals over the representative seasonal cycle it is clear that according to the considered observed datasets the snowpack is overestimated in the appalachians rmse generally higher than 1 m but is reasonably simulated in the lowlands fig 9 this is illustrated by the evaluation of the simulations against the observations for three cells in different parts of the region fig 9 additionally the evapotranspiration performed better in the western part of the model than the eastern part with a regional mean rmse of 3 8 mm fig 9 when looking at transient time series evapotranspiration is overestimated during snowmelt period but the model provides reasonable simulations of evapotranspiration during low flow periods i e usually from july to september the mean parameter values for the posterior ensemble are physically plausible table 1 in general modified parameter values resulting from history matching are consistent with spatial patterns observed within the model such as soil type zonation fig a1 and fall within the expected range of values no mathematical regularization was applied during the application of the ies the posterior ensemble of simulated baseflow demonstrates good agreement with estimated baseflow fig 10 with good reproduction of snowmelt and low flow periods however the posterior ensemble of simulated baseflow does not contain all estimated baseflow values this difference could be attributed to model structural error such as the error induced by the forcing data or mesh resolution also baseflow is estimated and not directly measured and probable estimation errors make a perfect fit not desirable partington et al 2012 the ability of the posterior ensemble to reproduce the estimated dynamics of the historical seasonal baseflow cycle the snow water accumulation and evapotranspiration suggests that this model ensemble can generate realistic baseflow for the entire region 6 2 model evaluation for steady state flow to evaluate the capability of the integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model to reproduce the observed surface drainage network and hydraulic heads steady state simulations were conducted with the ensemble mean for these simulations hgs was forced with a spatially variable flux at the subsurface that represents the mean annual potential infiltration and the model was run until the volume of water in the subsurface reaches a constant value which represents steady state conditions in hgs the surface drainage network is not imposed as a boundary condition but it develops according to the model parameters and is represented by simulated surface water depths fig 11 a visual inspection of the steady state surface water depths indicates a good agreement between the actual and simulated stream flow network for the region especially for major rivers and lakes with surface flow depths representing the delineation of the main lakes there are a few unrealistic surface water accumulations such as in the chateauguay region in the western part of the domain which is likely due to the lower order stream flow network that cannot be precisely represented with the current mesh resolution the illustration of gw sw exchange fluxes across the region shows a majority of groundwater exfiltration along the streams fig 11b this result was expected as the potential infiltration is computed by swmb and assigned to the subsurface domain of hgs which then computes infiltration and exfiltration in an integrated fashion in our case the majority of groundwater exfiltration is located along the streams however the streams are not always gaining groundwater and the water that has exfiltrated to the surface returns to the subsurface via the unsaturated zone the simulated steady state water table is shallow for most of the region with a mean depth to water table dtwt of approximately 8 m fig 12 a the simulated water table depths are consistent with observations and expert knowledge gagné et al 2015 lefebvre et al 2015 cloutier et al 2013 larocque et al 2013 the unsaturated zone is thicker in the mountainous regions of the appalachians in the southwestern part of the model and thinner in the flatter lying regions of the st lawrence lowlands at the northeast limit of the model fig 12a also shows that the spatial variability of the depth to the water table is lower in the lowlands than in the appalachians which is an indication of the magnitude of the hydraulic gradient in the lowlands which are generally characterized by high maximum bedrock hydraulic conductivities lower hydraulic gradients suggest slower groundwater flow and longer groundwater flowpaths groundwater flows generally from the appalachians toward the st lawrence river but groundwater flow direction can be locally influenced by the major streamflow network that drains the aquifers fig 11b in the appalachians which are generally characterized by lower maximum bedrock hydraulic conductivities the opposite conditions are observed with high gradients indicating shorter groundwater flowpaths occurring from points of maximum elevation toward the nearest valley where groundwater exfiltration creates a dense local scale stream network that feeds the larger river system fig 11a the evaluation of the model performance shows that the majority of the groundwater control points are associated with a root mean square error rmse below 10 m and that almost half the observations are below 3 m of rmse fig 13 this is an acceptable result since groundwater levels were not included in the calibration procedure and that the uncertainty indicated by the ensemble variance can easily exceed more than 3 m at locations distant from streams fig 12b thus the rmse is close to the quantified model uncertainty for the majority of observation wells the worst groundwater level performances i e greater than 10 m in rmse are associated to observation wells that are open to the shallow bedrock which is more likely to be fractured overall evaluation of the coupled surface and subsurface flow simulation suggests that the groundwater component of the southeastern québec region is adequately reproduced by the integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model 6 3 regional water budget water budget components were computed for each catchment table 3 precipitation in the western part of the region for example the chateauguay and richelieu catchments is generally lower than in the eastern part such as the chaudière and st françois catchments this distribution is coherent with actual evapotranspiration which is lower in the west and higher in the east although actual evapotranspiration may be water limited for a short period in the summer it is mostly energy limited during the representative seasonal cycle monthly mean over september 2011 to august 2015 due to the humid climate this short water limited period could partly explain consistency between precipitation and actual evapotranspiration patterns potential infiltration fluxes are highly heterogeneous over the region the uncertainty 2σ related to the potential infiltration flux ranges from 5 6 for the well monitored yamaska catchment to 28 2 for the du chene non monitored catchment 6 4 baseflow predictive uncertainty the baseflow predictive uncertainty is quantified through the direct simulation of integrated surface water and groundwater flow for the 187 realizations that populate the posterior ensemble this approach assumes that the model predictive uncertainty is constant from month to month the yearly mean baseflow is simulated at the outlet of the eight major catchments fig 1 and the simulated baseflow distributions are provided by the ensemble of model realizations fig 14 the maximum likelihood baseflow values are 3 0 11 28 15 68 16 64 35 66 40 62 41 56 and 46 62 m3 s 1 for the du chene richelieu nicolet chateauguay becancour yamaska chaudiere and st francois river outlets respectively when looking at specific baseflow table 3 the becancour catchment appears to yield a very high baseflow comparing to the adjacent catchments i e nicolet and chaudiere it is quite surprising since the hydrogeological conditions are not very different in fact the quality of the estimated specific baseflow for the gauging station 024 014 may very well be limited by errors and uncertainty leading to hydrologic simulations that reproduce these errors besides that the chateauguay and yamaska catchments have the most important specific simulated baseflow this is consistent with the geology since most of these catchments are characterized by relatively permeable sediments that favor infiltration at the expense of overland flow table 3 the uncertainty associated to the prediction of potential infiltration table 3 and baseflow fig 14 expressed as a percentage of each model output can be compared to evaluate the main contributor to the total baseflow uncertainty 2σ in general there is no significant change in the uncertainty expressed as a percentage between potential infiltration and baseflow meaning that baseflow predictive uncertainty is therefore mainly controlled by the uncertainty associated with the potential infiltration flux which is closely related to the swmb module parameters as a first interpretation this can be the direct consequence of the parameterization choices for the subsurface flow domain which use pilot points only for the bedrock maximum hydraulic conductivity the majority of parameters belonging to the swmb module were parameterized with pilot points allowing a more robust quantification of the uncertainty for these parameters cui et al 2021 white et al 2017 thus the uncertainty for the parameters related to the swmb module is certainly better quantified than the uncertainty associated to the subsurface flow domain another possible interpretation is that the baseflow uncertainty has been computed from steady state simulations meaning that geological control on the variance of the mean baseflow is minimized because the dynamic groundwater storage has no effects on the simulations moreover the uncertainty of baseflow increases for catchments where estimations of baseflow are scarce e g du chêne and richelieu demonstrating the importance of a dense yet well distributed observation dataset to reduce the model based uncertainty finally the baseflow distributions shown in fig 14 integrate the full extent of the watersheds since the prediction points are at the outlet the uncertainty related to the simulated hydraulic heads fig 12 shows a strong spatial variation over the region with preferential high uncertainties located in deeper water table locations and low uncertainties in shallower aquifer locations thus the uncertainty associated with simulated baseflow is expected to increase in the appalachians where the uncertainty associated with computed hydraulic head predictions is large 7 discussion 7 1 snowpack it has been observed that the snowpack tends to be overestimated in the appalachians while providing reasonable historical simulations in the lowlands this can be attributed to the imperfect temperature index model equation 2 used in a coarse 25 km2 mesh resolution although temperature index melt modelling remains a standard its ability to satisfactorily reproduce snow dynamics in complex terrain is questionable warscher et al 2013 moreover model mesh resolution adopted in this study for the surface water mass balance is certainly too coarse to simulate snow accumulation and snowmelt in steep sub catchments and complex terrain where ablation processes are multiple and snow depth highly variable it is clear that improving spatial distribution and simulation of snow water equivalent over the region is needed for instance more sophisticated distributed energy balance approaches can be recommended thornton et al 2021 cantet et al 2019 the principal consequence of the snowpack overestimation is the increase of evapotranspiration in spring that enables compensation white et al 2014 parameter compensation would remain mostly hidden or overlooked without the consideration of the distributed remote sensing data that helped to strengthen our confidence on the simulations over low flow periods 7 2 model parameterization the model used here includes a parameterization with pilot points for some parameters including bedrock maximum hydraulic conductivity mean soil water stock soil infiltration capacity snowmelt rate and crop coefficients it can be referred to as an intermediary parameterized model compared to models with cell based parameterization presented in some recent studies knowling et al 2019 the use of pilot points was motivated by the need to appropriately quantify the model based uncertainty while ensuring the capacity of the regional model to properly use the spatially variable observations in the region which would have been more challenging with a zone based parameterization cui et al 2021 hunt et al 2020 white et al 2017 hunt et al 2007 moore and doherty 2006 an interesting discussion about model parameterization strategies for a regional scale model can also be found in pool et al 2015 7 3 potential sources of baseflow residual mismatch following the application of ies the spread of the ensemble of historical simulations does not contain all the baseflow estimates over the seasonal cycle due to limitations in the representation of local scale heterogeneity riverine wetlands and riverbank an exact simulation of the estimated baseflow dynamics is not possible and some misfit can be attributed to the incapacity of such a regional scale model to properly represent sub grid processes that can highly influence the baseflow at local scale noorduijn et al 2021 larocque et al 2016 sulis et al 2011a in addition estimation of baseflow is very challenging with automated basefow separation techniques partington et al 2012 so that a perfect fit to the data may not be desirable finally a large proportion of the residual spatio temporal mismatch can probably be attributed to the meteorological forcing data and to the interpolated spatial fields of meteorological variables used to drive the historical model simulations 7 4 representative average seasonal cycle the regional hydrologic model was calibrated following a representative average seasonal cycle that uses monthly normal over four years from september 2011 to august 2015 although the limited four year period considered may reduce the capacity of the model to handle drastically different dynamics this can be seen as a significant improvement of the steady state simulations commonly seen in regional scale integrated modeling studies additionally this temporal aspect of the model discretization is more likely to perform reliably under forcing conditions that exceed the range of historical observations as is typical in climate change impact assessments erler et al 2019 however the daily and interannual variability is not considered in the simulation of baseflow so that monthly normal estimates may be smoothed and intermittent character of gw sw exchanges lost in such an energy limited region this potentially leads to increased infiltration and a positive bias in baseflow and groundwater levels 7 5 overland flow processes the simulated water balance has shown that overland flow i e infiltration excess overland flow represents a large part of the effective rainfall in the proposed modeling framework the overland flow is computed in the water balance module but not included within the integrated surface and subsurface hgs model accordingly it is worthwhile to question the potential consequences of neglecting this part of the water balance on the regional simulations of groundwater levels and gw sw exchanges the proposed hybrid configuration underestimates the total groundwater flux within the modelled domain as runoff is already removed at the source and potentially delayed infiltration by runoff further downstream is neglected partington et al 2013 including all forms of overland flow generation and re infiltration typically requires an integrated model forced with effective rainfall which is a more rigorous way to use hgs it would however lead to a significant increase in the model simulation time 7 6 free drainage boundary condition the parameters were estimated with a simplified model configuration that disregards the surface domain this decision was motivated to further reduce the model computational time in the inverse problem which requires numerous forward model executions in our view it was an acceptable assumption since the streams are mainly characterized with groundwater exfiltration fig 11b however it should be recognized that gw sw interactions are not in a single direction and neglecting return flow in the subsurface may potentially underestimate infiltration leading to a negative bias for baseflow and groundwater levels moreover it did not allow including the land surface model parameters such as the roughness coefficients that can influence baseflow simulations especially for transient dynamics thus the application of ies presented here represents a first step toward a comprehensive parameter estimation of the whole regional model where land surface model parameters can also be included 7 7 withdrawals the hydrological simulations proposed in this study did not consider withdrawals and the model therefore represents the natural hydrological state when inspecting the regional water balance table 3 it is clear that the amount of groundwater pumping is very small and almost always within the range of uncertainty for the baseflow simulations accordingly neglecting the contribution of groundwater pumping is not expected to influence significantly the results at this scale 7 8 model application we do not anticipate that such a model can be used for highly detailed reproduction of baseflow dynamics at any location along a stream and smaller watershed scale model would be better suited for this task we rather encourage the development of nested catchment models where simulation outputs from this regional scale model can be valuable for smaller scale models for example by providing boundary conditions however this regional model can be particularly suitable and stand alone to provide detailed representations of regional water balance processes and estimation of baseflow at the scale of the major watersheds represented over the region additionally the present model should be restricted to studying dynamic processes following a representative average seasonal cycle approach to be consistent with the performance assessment used in this study 8 conclusions a computationally efficient integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model that specifically addresses baseflow predictions for a regional scale domain has been presented to avoid the significant computation times and potential numerical instabilities typically associated with such integrated models a surface water mass balance module was coupled to the integrated hydrogeosphere hgs modeling platform and potential infiltration was treated as an input flux rather than total precipitation with this increased computational efficiency and the use of a highly parallelized computer cluster a rigorous calibration constrained uncertainty analysis has been provided this study therefore

3648,since 1963 liquid radioactive waste has been injected into deep artesian aquifer waste disposal sites at the siberian chemical combine the injection and overlaying zones are sandy clay formations with complex internal architectures therefore obtaining relevant forecasts of long term waste migration largely depends on accounting for the heterogeneity of water bearing sediments at present it is impossible to create regional models that consider detailed hydraulic heterogeneity due to the insufficient provision parameters and limitations of computing capacities therefore for long term forecasts of the migration of contaminants in groundwater the solution is to use a dual domain model to use a dual domain model one must set the mass transfer parameter to estimate this parameter the article proposes an approach using an auxiliary three dimensional 3d high resolution model of hydraulic heterogeneity this model was constructed using the transition probability markov chain geostatistical approach tp mc method and detailed lithological analysis data of the sections of 295 boreholes in the siberian chemical combine region which were obtained by core studies and using geophysical methods for studying boreholes an important feature of this model was that the thicknesses of the low permeability hydrofacies have an exponential like distribution with an average thickness of about 6 m this thickness heterogeneity as it appeared from the simulation results essentially affects the overall subsurface contaminant spreading during long time the effective mass transfer rate coefficient was obtained by processing the breakthrough curves of the flux concentrations by modeling horizontal migration on the auxiliary model providing setting the highest weight coefficients in the tail part of the breakthrough curve as a result of the selection the effective mass transfer rate coefficient for the assessment of long term subsurface waste migration for the conditions of the siberian chemical combine was 6 4 10 8 day 1 keywords contaminant transport simulation waste disposal site diffusion dual domain model effective parameters mass transfer rate coefficient 1 introduction modern legislation of the russian federation makes it possible to continue the injection of low level radioactive waste at the sites where it began in the 1960s rybalchenko et al 2005 one such site is the waste disposal site of the siberian chemical combine scc it is located 20 km to the north of the city tomsk western siberia and is the largest nuclear waste injection site in russia since the 1960s more than 45 million m3 of liquid radioactive wastes mostly low level radioactive wastes have been injected by wells to a depth of 270 400 m foley et al 1998 injection and overlaying zones are sandy clay formations with complex internal architectures bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 after stopping the waste will migrate into the geological environment and remain dangerous to the biota for a long time therefore to predict the spread of contaminants it is necessary to develop models of their long term migration in regional scale groundwater flow examples of such predictions can be found in previous works shestakov et al 2002 glinskii et al 2014 these models are based on multiyear dozens of years injection monitoring data zubkov et al 2005 the forecasts have a time scale of one or two orders of magnitude longer in this case the following question arises how can we consider predictive models of the processes that have not been well manifested in migration monitoring one example of such processes is the diffusion of contamination into low permeability clay sediments the effect of which on the overall waste migration can noticeably affect the contaminant pattern over a significantly longer period than the duration of up to date monitoring the reliability of predictive simulation on the migration of liquid radioactive waste significantly depends on accounting for the hydraulic and chemical heterogeneity of the injection and overlaying formations at different spatial scales however at regional scales the subsurface characterization of hydraulic heterogeneity is practically unattainable or cost prohibitive even if reliable subsurface models are available the computational complexity of solving transport over these scales would be enormous hence regional upscaled transport models are required these upscaled models must be able to represent non fickian effects created by connected high conductivity pathways and mass transfer processes between high and low permeability hydrofacies due to diffusion the effective parameters of the models should be determined using the migration monitoring data or estimated using auxiliary models unfortunately the estimates based on the injection monitoring data are of little use because the size of the contamination area from each borehole is currently considerably smaller than the size of the area of the possible migration in the post injection period therefore an important task is to assess the effective hydraulic and chemical parameters for regional models by synthesizing available geological information on heterogeneity and reproducing hydraulic heterogeneity on the auxiliary support scale models with a smaller spatial scale and greater grid resolution for reproducing heterogeneity in heterogeneous media which are represented in the geologic section by alternating sandy and clayey interlayers contaminant transport is performed by advection through high permeability interlayers while contaminants accumulate in low permeability clayer interlayers due to diffusion as previously noted see e g pauloo et al 2021 under such conditions for subhorizontal regional transport migrant spreading is poorly described by the one domain classical advection dispersion model under such conditions for regional flow and transport simulation considering the dynamics of the redistribution contaminant between high and low permeability hydro facies a dual domain mass transfer model can be used as a reasonable simplification a dual domain mass transfer model is used for transport in mobile domains high permeability hydrofacies where the contaminants primarily move by advection and an immobile domain low permeability hydrofacies where contaminants primarily move by diffusion the intensity of the mass transfer is controlled by the mass transfer rate coefficient which is a parameter of the dual domain model this coefficient depends on the geometry of channels diffusion coefficients in them and rate of advective transport the dual domain model has been used to represent physical and chemical nonequilibrium mass transfer processes since the 1950s the simplest non equilibrium mass transfer between a mobile domain and an immobile domain is approximated as a first order exchange dictated by a single rate coefficient a far more comprehensive description of mass transfer between mobile and immobile regions is the multi rate model wang et al 2005 it accounts for simultaneous mass transfer processes governed by multiple first order equations and a set of mass transfer rate coefficients following a probability density function haggerty and gorelick 1995 a review of many different mathematical forms of the dual domain model can be found in haggerty and gorelick 1995 a multi rate model is fast because the experimental data and analyses of different authors show that the calculated mass transfer rate coefficients decrease with an increase in characteristic time of migration of the contaminant in a heterogeneous medium fernàndez garcia and sanchez vila 2015 haggerty et al 2004 haggerty and gorelick 1995 this behavior of the mass transfer rate coefficient in a medium whose representative element contains various low permeability interlayers occurs because thinner interlayers are filled faster than thicker layers which leads to an exchange dynamics that differ from the simple dual domain model with a single rate mass transfer coefficient the multi rate exchange model has a different mathematical formulation from the classical dual domain model with a constant single rate mass transfer coefficient which is implemented in well known general transport simulation codes such as mt3dms zheng and wang 2002 or usgs mt3d bedekar et al 2016 therefore an important question is how to account for the multi rate exchange using the classical formulation of the dual domain model and the program codes that implement it the goal of this work is to estimate the upscaled dual domain mass transfer rate coefficient for long term regional scale radioactive waste migration assessment in heterogeneous formation with the various low permeable layers thickness based on a three dimensional high spatial resolution hydraulic heterogeneity model the practical significance of this work for the given site is associated with the substantiation of regional flow and transport models of the water bearing strata which consist of approximately 40 low permeability sediments bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 glinskii et al 2014 these sediments form a significant capacity where waste injected into a high permeability part of the stratum can accumulate during the migration process and affect the overall waste subsurface spreading over a long time scale considering this capacity in models will increase the validity of the flow and transport simulation based forecasts of long term waste migration in the post injection period although sorption and decay play a significant role in the retardation of radioactive waste components at this site these processes are not considered or parameterized in this article details of the consideration of these processes which are related to the specifics of the chemical composition of the waste can be found in noskov et al 2007 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and available data fig 1 a shows the location of the injection site relative to the regional groundwater flow boundary the tom river the area of possible migration of injected wastes in the post injection period is shown in this figure based on the results of previous model predictions shestakov et al 2002 glinskii et al 2014 in recent decades the monitoring results show that the injected waste remains within the waste disposal site zubkov et al 2005 within these limits most wells have been drilled as part of the site characterization foley et al 1998 and waste migration monitoring programs zubkov et al 2005 in other words the size of the area of detailed heterogeneity studies is an order of magnitude smaller than the area of potential waste migration in groundwater therefore a high resolution support scale three dimensional 3 d model was developed to study the patterns of advection diffusion transport of pollution in the geological environment the boundaries of this model coincide in plan with the boundaries of the area of detailed studies the studied geologic formation that includes the injection aquifers and overlaying semipermeable layers represents heterogeneous sand clay strata formed in a continental near sea border environment shestakov et al 2002 the dataset includes approximately 46 km of lithological logs in 295 characterization monitoring and injection wells which were drilled during the past 40 years within the site the vertical resolution of logs is 0 5 m the injection aquifers and semipermeable layers in the study area have a complex internal architecture consisting of a sequence of high permeability and relatively low permeability units hydrofacies a previous lithological study of the well core showed approximately equal volume fractions of high and low permeability hydrofacies in the studied formation and its anisotropy the horizontal correlation scale exceeds the vertical scale more than 30 times bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 2 2 heterogeneous hydrofacies model transition probability markov chain geostatistics t progs carle 1999 were used to simulate the subsurface distribution of hydrofacies in the detailed study area fig 1b and 1c this approach has been successfully used for a long time to produce useful stochastic realizations to investigate flow and transport processes in heterogeneous hydrogeological systems for example the t progs software package has been widely and successfully applied to the study of a range of problems and processes involving subsurface heterogeneity including the analysis of contaminant plumes upscaling of flow and transport parameters assessment of nuclear waste disposal heterogeneity effects on contaminant transport and effects of diffusion and dispersion on groundwater tracers carle and fogg 2020 model development is described in detail by bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 the 3d heterogeneous model simulated the structure of injection aquifer iii and the overlying semipermeable layer relative aquitard d geologic data were categorized into four hydrofacies units categories sand clay sand sandy clay and clay in decreasing order of hydraulic conductivity the hydrofacies units serve as the basis to define the formation system scale heterogeneity of hydraulic properties lithologic data were used to develop an indicator database that represented the presence or absence of each hydrofacies type at each point of observation with a vertical spacing of 0 5 m from these data the proportions for each hydrofacies were directly calculated additional parameters were estimated to describe the mean lengths of each hydrofacies along with the principal directions in the horizontal and vertical directions and the embedded transition probabilities to represent the cross correlation among different hydrofacies the mean length of the hydrofacies in the horizontal direction is approximately 100 300 m and the mean thickness in the vertical direction is approximately 3 6 m bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 the mean thickness of all hydrofacies obeys an exponential distribution conditioning data for the tprogs model included approximately 295 well lithological logs bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 the overall dimensions of the heterogeneous model are 4300 m 3500 m 130 m the simulated region is discretized with a regular grid with spacing 25 m 25 m 0 5 m for a total of 6 260 800 cells the size of the cells was selected to capture the heterogeneities at the hydrofacies scale the simulated lengths of the model are several times larger than the mean lengths of the heterogeneous hydrofacies assemblage markov chain models were developed in each of three directions and subsequently used in a transition probability based indicator simulation with cokriging and a final quenching step carle and fogg 1997 to realize the distribution of hydrofacies the model parameters hydrofacies proportion hydrofacies mean lengths and juxtapositional preference among hydrofacies were inferred from available quantitative data and the model realizations were generated and conditioned on these data the vertical average distribution of hydrofacies from the well data was compared with simulation results to validate the simulation results bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 then appropriate conductivity values of the hydrofacies were assigned to the numerical blocks of the model according to the indicator distribution based on data from the field and the literature estimates most permeable k 1 m day sand permeable k 0 03 m day clay sand and poorly permeable k 0 001 m day sandy clay glinskii et al 2014 foley et al 1998 for the least permeable clay hydrofacies an experimentally determined conductivity value of 1 1 10 5 m day was used lekhov and sokolov 2017 the porosity for the entire modeling area was equal to 0 2 2 3 simulation of advective diffusion transport to clarify the effect of diffusion on transport and to further determine the mass transfer rate coefficient the advective diffusion transport was simulated using the obtained 3d heterogeneous hydrofacies model the 3d steady state flow problem for the heterogeneous model in the horizontal direction was simulated using the finite difference code modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 constant heads were assigned to the left and right sides of the model the head difference of 5 m was selected to reproduce the typical natural horizontal mean flow gradient for the given environment shestakov et al 2002 no flow boundary conditions on all other sides neumann boundaries were used all other cells are assigned as active flow cells a 3 d advective diffusion transport model of the injection area was developed by mt3dms zheng wang 2002 the model used the diffusion coefficient of the clay and sandy clay hydrofacies obtained under laboratory conditions on undisturbed clay samples for nano3 294 1 mmol l using the end diffusion technique lekhov et al 2021 the samples had a diameter of 3 cm and an average length of 7 cm and were taken from the scc site at depths of 200 400 m the solution for the experiment was a modeled low activity contaminant of the scc during the experiment the electrical conductivity was measured using ec sensors installed along the samples each 2 cm the duration of the diffusion experiments for different samples was 77 247 days the diffusion coefficient for the entire modeling area of low permeability sediments clay and sandy clay hydrofacies was established to be 3 2 10 6 m2 day the simulation time was 13 700 years considering the removal of all or most of the non sorbing component from the model model hydrofacies were divided into mobile domains which were represented by sand and clay sand with hydraulic conductivities of 1 m day and 0 03 m day and immobile domains which were represented by clay and sandy clay with hydraulic conductivities of 0 00001 m day and 0 001 m day the instantaneous pulse injection of the non sorbing component in high permeability cells i e the cells with hydraulic conductivity greater than 0 001 m day into the cross section of the 3rd right model layer was considered the injection to different high permeability cells was considered by assigning in these cells constant dimensionless concentration equals one 2 4 the approach to determine of the upscaled mass transfer rate coefficient regional transport models for the long term prediction of waste migration which consider detailed lithological heterogeneity are currently excluded due to a lack of spatial distribution of heterogeneity parameters therefore an attempt was made to reduce the 3d hydraulic heterogeneity model to a one dimensional dual domain mass transfer ddmt model assuming that the size of the 3d model can roughly correspond to a few blocks of the regional model with effective upscaled transport parameters the 1 d equations for the dual domain mass transfer model have the following view rumynin 2011 1 d gd 2 c x 2 v c x n 0 c t n c t n c t α c c where c and c are the concentrations in the flowing part of the medium mobile domain and the low permeability part of the medium immobile domain respectively dgd is the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2 t n 0 is the effective porosity of the mobile domain n is the effective porosity of the immobile domain α is the mass transfer rate coefficient t 1 a one dimensional transport model of the medium with a dual domain porosity with dimensions of 4300 25 0 5 m3 and a block size of 25 25 0 5 m3 was generated the total length of a one dimensional 1d model corresponds to a three dimensional 3d model at the left and right boundaries of the model a constant head difference of 5 m was set and the remainder of the boundaries were impenetrable the effective upscaled hydraulic conductivity keff in the horizontal direction was determined from steady state groundwater flow simulations on the 3d high resolution hydraulic heterogeneity model described in section 2 2 as 2 k eff ql ω h 1 h 2 where q is the total flow rate l3 t l is the length of the flow path l h 1 and h 2 are the constant heads at the boundaries of the model l and ω is the cross sectional flow area l2 the calculated effective upscaled hydraulic conductivity equal to 0 298 m day was subsequently used in a one dimensional model the mass transfer rate coefficient was determined by obtaining a simulated breakthrough curves to the one dimensional model that considers the dual domain porosity and comparing it with the breakthrough curve determined during 3d modeling section 2 3 the fitting of the breakthrough curves and comparison with the breakthrough curve from the 3d modeling data were performed using the pest optimizer doherty and hunt 2010 in fitting the breakthrough curve the dispersion coefficient and parameters of the dual domain mass transfer model were used such as the mass transfer rate coefficient effective porosity of the mobile domain and effective porosity of the immobile domain the porosity of the mobile and immobile domains was changed so that the total porosity was 0 2 in total which is equal to the total porosity in the 3d model to minimize the objective function it is necessary to set the initial values of the parameters in the selection the initial values were estimated using the method of statistical moments based on the 3d modeling results consider the instantaneous pulse injection c 0 δ t into the initial section of a one dimensional flow then the distribution of flux concentration c t z downstream is described by the following dependence jury 1990 3 c t l c 0 δ t f t t l where ft t z is the probability distribution function of the arrival times this function has different forms for the one domain and dual domain mass transfer models for these solutions expressions for the first and second order normalized moments are known the first order normalized central moment average travel time is the same for both models and is written as follows jury 1990 4 e l t l u where l is the length of the flow model l and u is the mean seepage velocity u v n l t the second order normalized moment variance of the arrival times for the one domain mass transfer model can be written as jury 1990 5a va r l t 2 d l u 3 the second order normalized moment for the arrival time of the ddmt model can be written as jury 1990 5b va r l t 2 d l u 3 χ 2 1 χ χ 2 l n α u χ n 0 n 0 n expression 6b for the second order moment for the arrival time of the ddmt model consists of two terms one of which is the second order moment of the one domain mass transfer model see eq 5a by calculating the apparent porosity from the peak of the breakthrough curve for the three dimensional model and determining the hydrodynamic dispersion from the second statistical moment it is possible to estimate the mass transfer rate coefficient α to compare the curves obtained by the ddmt model with the breakthrough curve determined from the 3d modeling data we used the transition from the flowing concentration cf to the distribution function of the concentration arrival times ft according to the expression 6 f t c f q m total where mtotal is the total mass of the component in the 3d model m the method of statistical moments obtained the effective porosity of the mobile domain high permeable part was 0 12 the effective porosity of the immobile domain low permeable part was 0 08 the dispersion coefficient was 0 84 m2 day and the mass transfer rate coefficient was 3 28 10 8 day 1 the obtained parameter values were used as an initial approximation to fit the breakthrough curve of the 3d modeling data by a dual domain model using the pest optimizer doherty and hunt 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the effect of diffusion on transport based on the results of the advective diffusion modeling described in section 2 3 the breakthrough curve of the flux concentration cf was constructed fig 2 which shows the total mass discharge through the opposite boundary of the model at different times 7 c f d m out dtq where q is the discharge rate l 3 t t is time t and m out is the total mass component leaving the model m the breakthrough curves of flowing concentration were plotted using the dimensionless time t tadv where t is the simulation time and t adv is the characteristic time of advective transport through the model the time of advective transport is calculated by tk l n v where v is the average flow velocity l t n is the porosity and l is the length of the model along the primary direction of flow l to determine the effect of diffusion on transport the resulting breakthrough curve was compared with the breakthrough curve from bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 for 3d pure advective solute transport using the pmpath program chiang and kinzelbach 2001 on the same heterogeneous model a comparison of the breakthrough curves of the advective and advective diffusion modeling results fig 2 shows that the breakthrough curve of advective diffusion transport has a peak concentration of 30 less than that of advective transport and the long tail indicates the accumulation of the share of non sorbing components in hydrofacies assigned to blocks thus with such geologic medium structure it is necessary to consider diffusion to more reliably predict the long term regional scale radioactive waste migration in the scc area 3 2 estimation of the upscaled mass transfer rate coefficient for a dual domain medium the calculated breakthrough curves from the 3 d simulation are used to estimate the mass transfer rate coefficient for a dual domain medium the selected curves for the 1 d dual domain model using the pest code section 2 4 are shown in fig 3 three breakthrough curves were fitted by changing the weight coefficients for the points of the breakthrough curve of three dimensional modeling for breakthrough curve set 1 all points have identical weights of 1 for the breakthrough curve set 2 the model data in the peak area have a weight of 0 5 for breakthrough curve set 3 the model data in the peak area have a weight of 0 2 fig 3 fig 3 shows that none of the breakthrough curves obtained by the dual domain mass transfer model fully describes the 3d simulation breakthrough curve moreover a better described tail of the curve corresponds to a worse description of the concentration peak the data table 1 of the third curve set 3 were used as the most appropriate parameter values the effective porosity of the mobile domain was 0 13 the effective porosity of the immobile domain was 0 06 the dispersion coefficient was 0 70 m2 day and the mass transfer rate coefficient was 6 42 10 8 day 1 the obtained mass transfer rate coefficient is quite close to the value calculated by the method of statistical moments so it can be used to determine the mass transfer rate coefficient the breakthrough curve of 3d modeling cannot be completely described using set 3 most likely because the process of diffusion filling of low permeability lenses is determined by both the diffusion coefficient and the thickness lenses thus for a horizontally layered reservoir with a constant thickness of low permeability layers parameter α is directly proportional to the diffusion coefficient and inversely proportional to the square of the thickness rumynin 2011 according to the analysis of the borehole cores the thickness of the interlayers of the studied complex has an exponential distribution thus due to diffusion the thinner interlayers are filled faster then thicker ones are filled this type of filling makes the mass transfer rate coefficient decrease over time 3 3 a multirate model to explain the non uniqueness of the upscaled mass transfer rate coefficient this behavior of the mass transfer rate coefficient over time was noted in previously published works where parameter α in model 1 is inversely proportional to the experiment time based on the analysis of the experimental data of various authors haggerty et al 2004 and theoretical analysis of the model with multirate exchange fernàndez garcia and sanchez vila 2015 consider the contaminant transport in an aquifer consisting of two lithological units hydrofacies high permeability mobile domain unit and relatively low permeability immobile domain unit with a lenticular structure fig 4 moreover the high permeability unit has a volume fraction χ and the other units have a volume fraction of 1 χ consider a heterogeneous aquifer with a thickness of m where there is a flow of groundwater with a mean flow gradient j j x j y j z suppose that the mean vertical component of this gradient m j z is zero i e dupuis s assumption is fulfilled for the entire aquifer thickness but there are local fluctuations of the vertical component of the gradient associated with the hydraulic heterogeneity and finite horizontal dimensions of each unit then the balance equation of a nonsorbing component in such an aquifer has the following form when integrated eq 1 over the entire thickness 8 χ n 0 0 m c z t d z 1 χ n 0 m c z t 0 m xy d n 0 xy c z d z 0 m xy c z v z d x where c z and c z are the solute concentrations in mobile and immobile domains high permeable and low permeable hydrofacies respectively m l3 no is the effective porosity of the mobile domain n is the effective porosity of the immobile domain v is the flow velocity l t and d is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor in the mobile domain l2 t assuming that in each vertical section of the aquifer the concentration in the high permeability hydrofacies insignificantly changes in the vertical direction we introduce the averaged over cross section concentration in the high permeability hydrofacies 9 c m 1 0 m c z d z then eq 8 can be written in the form 10 χ n 0 c t 1 χ n 0 m c t z d z xy d gd n 0 xy c xy v xy c where v xy kef j and k ef l t is the effective horizontal hydraulic conductivity l t and d gd is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor in the mobile domain l2 t in 2 d x y space upscaled for full aquifer thickness assuming that each vertical section contains a large number of low permeability lenses replace the aquifer thickness integral in eq 10 with the integral of the probability distribution of the thicknesses of these lenses 11 χ n 0 c t 1 χ n 0 c t m f m d m xy d gd n 0 xy c xy v xy c where f m is the probability distribution function of the lens thickness of low permeability layers to further analyze the migration model in eq 11 it is reasonable to pass from the thickness of the lens distribution function to the exchange coefficient distribution function between permeable and low permeability units analysis of lithological logs of 295 wells in the area of the scc with a vertical resolution of 0 5 m showed that the thicknesses of low permeability layers have a distribution closely follow exponential fig 5 in the dissection of the section the thicknesses of individual interlayers start from a certain minimum thickness m min so we will use the truncated density function of the exponential distribution as the thickness distribution function 12 f m λ exp λ m m min m m min where λ is the distribution parameter the exchange coefficient distribution function between permeable and low permeability units for distribution of thicknesses described by eq 12 has the following form see appendix for details 13 φ d α 3 α 0 α 2 α exp x min 3 α 0 α α 0 4 d 0 n m 0 2 accordingly eq 11 can be rewritten as 14 χ n 0 c t 1 χ n 0 c t φ d α d α xy d n 0 xy c xy v xy c c α t α c c α model 14 has been repeatedly analyzed by various authors haggerty and gorelick 1995 wang et al 2005 and it is connected with the substitution of the general solution for the exchange equation into dependence 14 assuming that the initial concentration in the immobile domain is zero we can write the general expression for the relationship between the concentrations in the immobile domain and mobile domain as the solution of eq 14 with the initial condition c α 0 0 15 c α t 0 t α c τ e x p α t τ d τ then the average concentration in the low permeability part c t can be obtained by averaging eq 15 over α 16 c t 0 t g t τ c τ d τ g t 0 α max α φ d α exp α t d α where g t is the memory function carrera et al 1998 accordingly the transport equation in a high permeability part of the aquifer can be written as 17 χ n 0 c t 1 χ n c t d n 0 xy c xy v xy c the system of eqs 16 17 describes the multi rate mass transfer model the physical meaning of using this model for the conditions under consideration is as follows in each section of the aquifer there may be low permeability layers of different thicknesses and the penetration rate of the component into the layer is inversely proportional to the square of its thickness i e each layer will be filled at its own rate controlled by the value of α depending on its thickness the system of eqs 16 17 differs from the single rate dual domain model in practical applications fernàndez garcia and sanchez vila 2015 considered the time dependent single rate mass transfer model termed the t srmt model as a simplification of eqs 16 17 within the framework of the notation the t srmt model can be written as 18 χ 0 n 0 c t 1 χ 0 n c t d n 0 xy c xy v xy c c t α t c c where χ 0 is the effective fraction of the high permeability domain and α t is the time dependent mass transfer coefficient an asymptotic analysis of solute transport from an instantaneous source using the time dependent single rate mass transfer model t srmt and multi rate mass transfer model mrmt with constant in time parameters gave the following expression for parameter α t fernàndez garcia and sanchez vila 2015 19 α t 0 α max α 2 φ d α exp α t d α 0 α max α φ d α exp α t d α dependence 19 shows that the time dependent mass transfer coefficient decreases with time which is consistent with the observations compiled by haggerty et al 2004 in different sites worldwide therefore using the parameters to model the mass transfer in the heterogeneous model d 0 3 2 10 6 m2 day n 0 2 m min 0 5 m m0 6 5 m the theoretical mass transfer rate coefficient at pe 0 for a period of up to 10000 years was calculated using dependence 19 the obtained values are shown in fig 6 and show that the theoretical mass transfer rate coefficient for the characteristic time of the numerical experiment reaches values on the order of 10 8 days 1 which indicates the correct value of a certain mass transfer rate coefficient by selecting the breakthrough curve 4 conclusions the dual domain model is selected for long term regional transport simulations in the area of the siberian chemical combine assuming that low permeability hydrofacies are the immobile domain and the well permeable hydrofacies compose the mobile domain to upscale the parameter of the first order mass transfer rate between mobile and immobile domains the breakthrough curve of the flux concentration which is obtained by simulating the advective diffusion transport in the horizontal direction on the support scale 3d high resolution model of hydraulic heterogeneity is processed using a dual domain model an important feature of this model was that the thicknesses of the low permeability hydrofacies have an exponential like distribution with an average thickness of about 6 m the processing results show that the simulated breakthrough curve is quite difficult to describe in a dual domain model with a constant mass transfer coefficient to explain this result a dual domain model with multiple rate mass transfer exchange was developed this model is applicable to the object under study because diffusion occurs in various thickness values of the low permeability layers this theoretical analysis shows that when using the classical single rate dual domain model in the case of multi rate exchange between high permeability and low permeability parts of a heterogeneous aquifer the mass transfer rate coefficient should depend on the time of predictive modeling to obtain an effective and suitable mass transfer coefficient to predict long term waste migration in groundwater on a regional scale the largest weight coefficients in the tail part of the breakthrough curve should be used to process the breakthrough curve the obtained characteristic value of the effective mass transfer rate coefficient rate of mass transfer of the first order which is suitable for long term regional transport simulations in the area of the siberian chemical combine is 6 4 10 8 day 1 credit authorship contribution statement s p pozdniakov conceptualization methodology software

permeability units for exponential distribution of thickness let us consider the integral balance of migration in the vertical section of one of the low permeability layers fig 4d lenses with thickness mi and average concentration ci a1 m i n d c i dt d m d c i dz z g bot d m d c i dz z g top v z c v z c i where dm is the molecular diffusion coefficient z g is the lower or upper boundary of the lenses and vz is the vertical velocity of advective transport through it since the vertical velocity due to fluctuations in homogeneities in the velocity field of a flow with an average horizontal gradient is unknown at each point for the following analysis we will assume that the vertical velocity is a constant for all interlayers using the lumped parameter model principles pozdniakov and shestakov 1998 we express the diffusion flux at the boundary as a2 d m d c i dz d m c c i m i 6 δ where m i 6 is the distance from the boundary to the hydraulic center where the capacity of the interlayer is concentrated and δ is the distance to the hydraulic center of the adjacent high permeability interlayer substituting a1 into a2 we can write a3 c i t α i c c i where αi is the exchange coefficient and equal to a4 α i n 1 2 d m m i m i 6 δ v z m i let us rewrite the dependence a4 in the form a4a α i α 0 1 2 x i x i 6 δ pe 4 x i where indicated α 0 4 d m n m 0 2 x i m

it is necessary to transfer from the layer thickness distribution function to the exchange coefficient distribution function to obtain to the exchange coefficient distribution function we introduce simplifying assumption δ 0 i e the distance to the hydraulic center of the interlayer is substantially smaller than the characteristic thickness m0 in addition we assume that the magnitude of the

3648,since 1963 liquid radioactive waste has been injected into deep artesian aquifer waste disposal sites at the siberian chemical combine the injection and overlaying zones are sandy clay formations with complex internal architectures therefore obtaining relevant forecasts of long term waste migration largely depends on accounting for the heterogeneity of water bearing sediments at present it is impossible to create regional models that consider detailed hydraulic heterogeneity due to the insufficient provision parameters and limitations of computing capacities therefore for long term forecasts of the migration of contaminants in groundwater the solution is to use a dual domain model to use a dual domain model one must set the mass transfer parameter to estimate this parameter the article proposes an approach using an auxiliary three dimensional 3d high resolution model of hydraulic heterogeneity this model was constructed using the transition probability markov chain geostatistical approach tp mc method and detailed lithological analysis data of the sections of 295 boreholes in the siberian chemical combine region which were obtained by core studies and using geophysical methods for studying boreholes an important feature of this model was that the thicknesses of the low permeability hydrofacies have an exponential like distribution with an average thickness of about 6 m this thickness heterogeneity as it appeared from the simulation results essentially affects the overall subsurface contaminant spreading during long time the effective mass transfer rate coefficient was obtained by processing the breakthrough curves of the flux concentrations by modeling horizontal migration on the auxiliary model providing setting the highest weight coefficients in the tail part of the breakthrough curve as a result of the selection the effective mass transfer rate coefficient for the assessment of long term subsurface waste migration for the conditions of the siberian chemical combine was 6 4 10 8 day 1 keywords contaminant transport simulation waste disposal site diffusion dual domain model effective parameters mass transfer rate coefficient 1 introduction modern legislation of the russian federation makes it possible to continue the injection of low level radioactive waste at the sites where it began in the 1960s rybalchenko et al 2005 one such site is the waste disposal site of the siberian chemical combine scc it is located 20 km to the north of the city tomsk western siberia and is the largest nuclear waste injection site in russia since the 1960s more than 45 million m3 of liquid radioactive wastes mostly low level radioactive wastes have been injected by wells to a depth of 270 400 m foley et al 1998 injection and overlaying zones are sandy clay formations with complex internal architectures bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 after stopping the waste will migrate into the geological environment and remain dangerous to the biota for a long time therefore to predict the spread of contaminants it is necessary to develop models of their long term migration in regional scale groundwater flow examples of such predictions can be found in previous works shestakov et al 2002 glinskii et al 2014 these models are based on multiyear dozens of years injection monitoring data zubkov et al 2005 the forecasts have a time scale of one or two orders of magnitude longer in this case the following question arises how can we consider predictive models of the processes that have not been well manifested in migration monitoring one example of such processes is the diffusion of contamination into low permeability clay sediments the effect of which on the overall waste migration can noticeably affect the contaminant pattern over a significantly longer period than the duration of up to date monitoring the reliability of predictive simulation on the migration of liquid radioactive waste significantly depends on accounting for the hydraulic and chemical heterogeneity of the injection and overlaying formations at different spatial scales however at regional scales the subsurface characterization of hydraulic heterogeneity is practically unattainable or cost prohibitive even if reliable subsurface models are available the computational complexity of solving transport over these scales would be enormous hence regional upscaled transport models are required these upscaled models must be able to represent non fickian effects created by connected high conductivity pathways and mass transfer processes between high and low permeability hydrofacies due to diffusion the effective parameters of the models should be determined using the migration monitoring data or estimated using auxiliary models unfortunately the estimates based on the injection monitoring data are of little use because the size of the contamination area from each borehole is currently considerably smaller than the size of the area of the possible migration in the post injection period therefore an important task is to assess the effective hydraulic and chemical parameters for regional models by synthesizing available geological information on heterogeneity and reproducing hydraulic heterogeneity on the auxiliary support scale models with a smaller spatial scale and greater grid resolution for reproducing heterogeneity in heterogeneous media which are represented in the geologic section by alternating sandy and clayey interlayers contaminant transport is performed by advection through high permeability interlayers while contaminants accumulate in low permeability clayer interlayers due to diffusion as previously noted see e g pauloo et al 2021 under such conditions for subhorizontal regional transport migrant spreading is poorly described by the one domain classical advection dispersion model under such conditions for regional flow and transport simulation considering the dynamics of the redistribution contaminant between high and low permeability hydro facies a dual domain mass transfer model can be used as a reasonable simplification a dual domain mass transfer model is used for transport in mobile domains high permeability hydrofacies where the contaminants primarily move by advection and an immobile domain low permeability hydrofacies where contaminants primarily move by diffusion the intensity of the mass transfer is controlled by the mass transfer rate coefficient which is a parameter of the dual domain model this coefficient depends on the geometry of channels diffusion coefficients in them and rate of advective transport the dual domain model has been used to represent physical and chemical nonequilibrium mass transfer processes since the 1950s the simplest non equilibrium mass transfer between a mobile domain and an immobile domain is approximated as a first order exchange dictated by a single rate coefficient a far more comprehensive description of mass transfer between mobile and immobile regions is the multi rate model wang et al 2005 it accounts for simultaneous mass transfer processes governed by multiple first order equations and a set of mass transfer rate coefficients following a probability density function haggerty and gorelick 1995 a review of many different mathematical forms of the dual domain model can be found in haggerty and gorelick 1995 a multi rate model is fast because the experimental data and analyses of different authors show that the calculated mass transfer rate coefficients decrease with an increase in characteristic time of migration of the contaminant in a heterogeneous medium fernàndez garcia and sanchez vila 2015 haggerty et al 2004 haggerty and gorelick 1995 this behavior of the mass transfer rate coefficient in a medium whose representative element contains various low permeability interlayers occurs because thinner interlayers are filled faster than thicker layers which leads to an exchange dynamics that differ from the simple dual domain model with a single rate mass transfer coefficient the multi rate exchange model has a different mathematical formulation from the classical dual domain model with a constant single rate mass transfer coefficient which is implemented in well known general transport simulation codes such as mt3dms zheng and wang 2002 or usgs mt3d bedekar et al 2016 therefore an important question is how to account for the multi rate exchange using the classical formulation of the dual domain model and the program codes that implement it the goal of this work is to estimate the upscaled dual domain mass transfer rate coefficient for long term regional scale radioactive waste migration assessment in heterogeneous formation with the various low permeable layers thickness based on a three dimensional high spatial resolution hydraulic heterogeneity model the practical significance of this work for the given site is associated with the substantiation of regional flow and transport models of the water bearing strata which consist of approximately 40 low permeability sediments bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 glinskii et al 2014 these sediments form a significant capacity where waste injected into a high permeability part of the stratum can accumulate during the migration process and affect the overall waste subsurface spreading over a long time scale considering this capacity in models will increase the validity of the flow and transport simulation based forecasts of long term waste migration in the post injection period although sorption and decay play a significant role in the retardation of radioactive waste components at this site these processes are not considered or parameterized in this article details of the consideration of these processes which are related to the specifics of the chemical composition of the waste can be found in noskov et al 2007 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and available data fig 1 a shows the location of the injection site relative to the regional groundwater flow boundary the tom river the area of possible migration of injected wastes in the post injection period is shown in this figure based on the results of previous model predictions shestakov et al 2002 glinskii et al 2014 in recent decades the monitoring results show that the injected waste remains within the waste disposal site zubkov et al 2005 within these limits most wells have been drilled as part of the site characterization foley et al 1998 and waste migration monitoring programs zubkov et al 2005 in other words the size of the area of detailed heterogeneity studies is an order of magnitude smaller than the area of potential waste migration in groundwater therefore a high resolution support scale three dimensional 3 d model was developed to study the patterns of advection diffusion transport of pollution in the geological environment the boundaries of this model coincide in plan with the boundaries of the area of detailed studies the studied geologic formation that includes the injection aquifers and overlaying semipermeable layers represents heterogeneous sand clay strata formed in a continental near sea border environment shestakov et al 2002 the dataset includes approximately 46 km of lithological logs in 295 characterization monitoring and injection wells which were drilled during the past 40 years within the site the vertical resolution of logs is 0 5 m the injection aquifers and semipermeable layers in the study area have a complex internal architecture consisting of a sequence of high permeability and relatively low permeability units hydrofacies a previous lithological study of the well core showed approximately equal volume fractions of high and low permeability hydrofacies in the studied formation and its anisotropy the horizontal correlation scale exceeds the vertical scale more than 30 times bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 2 2 heterogeneous hydrofacies model transition probability markov chain geostatistics t progs carle 1999 were used to simulate the subsurface distribution of hydrofacies in the detailed study area fig 1b and 1c this approach has been successfully used for a long time to produce useful stochastic realizations to investigate flow and transport processes in heterogeneous hydrogeological systems for example the t progs software package has been widely and successfully applied to the study of a range of problems and processes involving subsurface heterogeneity including the analysis of contaminant plumes upscaling of flow and transport parameters assessment of nuclear waste disposal heterogeneity effects on contaminant transport and effects of diffusion and dispersion on groundwater tracers carle and fogg 2020 model development is described in detail by bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 the 3d heterogeneous model simulated the structure of injection aquifer iii and the overlying semipermeable layer relative aquitard d geologic data were categorized into four hydrofacies units categories sand clay sand sandy clay and clay in decreasing order of hydraulic conductivity the hydrofacies units serve as the basis to define the formation system scale heterogeneity of hydraulic properties lithologic data were used to develop an indicator database that represented the presence or absence of each hydrofacies type at each point of observation with a vertical spacing of 0 5 m from these data the proportions for each hydrofacies were directly calculated additional parameters were estimated to describe the mean lengths of each hydrofacies along with the principal directions in the horizontal and vertical directions and the embedded transition probabilities to represent the cross correlation among different hydrofacies the mean length of the hydrofacies in the horizontal direction is approximately 100 300 m and the mean thickness in the vertical direction is approximately 3 6 m bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 the mean thickness of all hydrofacies obeys an exponential distribution conditioning data for the tprogs model included approximately 295 well lithological logs bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 the overall dimensions of the heterogeneous model are 4300 m 3500 m 130 m the simulated region is discretized with a regular grid with spacing 25 m 25 m 0 5 m for a total of 6 260 800 cells the size of the cells was selected to capture the heterogeneities at the hydrofacies scale the simulated lengths of the model are several times larger than the mean lengths of the heterogeneous hydrofacies assemblage markov chain models were developed in each of three directions and subsequently used in a transition probability based indicator simulation with cokriging and a final quenching step carle and fogg 1997 to realize the distribution of hydrofacies the model parameters hydrofacies proportion hydrofacies mean lengths and juxtapositional preference among hydrofacies were inferred from available quantitative data and the model realizations were generated and conditioned on these data the vertical average distribution of hydrofacies from the well data was compared with simulation results to validate the simulation results bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 then appropriate conductivity values of the hydrofacies were assigned to the numerical blocks of the model according to the indicator distribution based on data from the field and the literature estimates most permeable k 1 m day sand permeable k 0 03 m day clay sand and poorly permeable k 0 001 m day sandy clay glinskii et al 2014 foley et al 1998 for the least permeable clay hydrofacies an experimentally determined conductivity value of 1 1 10 5 m day was used lekhov and sokolov 2017 the porosity for the entire modeling area was equal to 0 2 2 3 simulation of advective diffusion transport to clarify the effect of diffusion on transport and to further determine the mass transfer rate coefficient the advective diffusion transport was simulated using the obtained 3d heterogeneous hydrofacies model the 3d steady state flow problem for the heterogeneous model in the horizontal direction was simulated using the finite difference code modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 constant heads were assigned to the left and right sides of the model the head difference of 5 m was selected to reproduce the typical natural horizontal mean flow gradient for the given environment shestakov et al 2002 no flow boundary conditions on all other sides neumann boundaries were used all other cells are assigned as active flow cells a 3 d advective diffusion transport model of the injection area was developed by mt3dms zheng wang 2002 the model used the diffusion coefficient of the clay and sandy clay hydrofacies obtained under laboratory conditions on undisturbed clay samples for nano3 294 1 mmol l using the end diffusion technique lekhov et al 2021 the samples had a diameter of 3 cm and an average length of 7 cm and were taken from the scc site at depths of 200 400 m the solution for the experiment was a modeled low activity contaminant of the scc during the experiment the electrical conductivity was measured using ec sensors installed along the samples each 2 cm the duration of the diffusion experiments for different samples was 77 247 days the diffusion coefficient for the entire modeling area of low permeability sediments clay and sandy clay hydrofacies was established to be 3 2 10 6 m2 day the simulation time was 13 700 years considering the removal of all or most of the non sorbing component from the model model hydrofacies were divided into mobile domains which were represented by sand and clay sand with hydraulic conductivities of 1 m day and 0 03 m day and immobile domains which were represented by clay and sandy clay with hydraulic conductivities of 0 00001 m day and 0 001 m day the instantaneous pulse injection of the non sorbing component in high permeability cells i e the cells with hydraulic conductivity greater than 0 001 m day into the cross section of the 3rd right model layer was considered the injection to different high permeability cells was considered by assigning in these cells constant dimensionless concentration equals one 2 4 the approach to determine of the upscaled mass transfer rate coefficient regional transport models for the long term prediction of waste migration which consider detailed lithological heterogeneity are currently excluded due to a lack of spatial distribution of heterogeneity parameters therefore an attempt was made to reduce the 3d hydraulic heterogeneity model to a one dimensional dual domain mass transfer ddmt model assuming that the size of the 3d model can roughly correspond to a few blocks of the regional model with effective upscaled transport parameters the 1 d equations for the dual domain mass transfer model have the following view rumynin 2011 1 d gd 2 c x 2 v c x n 0 c t n c t n c t α c c where c and c are the concentrations in the flowing part of the medium mobile domain and the low permeability part of the medium immobile domain respectively dgd is the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2 t n 0 is the effective porosity of the mobile domain n is the effective porosity of the immobile domain α is the mass transfer rate coefficient t 1 a one dimensional transport model of the medium with a dual domain porosity with dimensions of 4300 25 0 5 m3 and a block size of 25 25 0 5 m3 was generated the total length of a one dimensional 1d model corresponds to a three dimensional 3d model at the left and right boundaries of the model a constant head difference of 5 m was set and the remainder of the boundaries were impenetrable the effective upscaled hydraulic conductivity keff in the horizontal direction was determined from steady state groundwater flow simulations on the 3d high resolution hydraulic heterogeneity model described in section 2 2 as 2 k eff ql ω h 1 h 2 where q is the total flow rate l3 t l is the length of the flow path l h 1 and h 2 are the constant heads at the boundaries of the model l and ω is the cross sectional flow area l2 the calculated effective upscaled hydraulic conductivity equal to 0 298 m day was subsequently used in a one dimensional model the mass transfer rate coefficient was determined by obtaining a simulated breakthrough curves to the one dimensional model that considers the dual domain porosity and comparing it with the breakthrough curve determined during 3d modeling section 2 3 the fitting of the breakthrough curves and comparison with the breakthrough curve from the 3d modeling data were performed using the pest optimizer doherty and hunt 2010 in fitting the breakthrough curve the dispersion coefficient and parameters of the dual domain mass transfer model were used such as the mass transfer rate coefficient effective porosity of the mobile domain and effective porosity of the immobile domain the porosity of the mobile and immobile domains was changed so that the total porosity was 0 2 in total which is equal to the total porosity in the 3d model to minimize the objective function it is necessary to set the initial values of the parameters in the selection the initial values were estimated using the method of statistical moments based on the 3d modeling results consider the instantaneous pulse injection c 0 δ t into the initial section of a one dimensional flow then the distribution of flux concentration c t z downstream is described by the following dependence jury 1990 3 c t l c 0 δ t f t t l where ft t z is the probability distribution function of the arrival times this function has different forms for the one domain and dual domain mass transfer models for these solutions expressions for the first and second order normalized moments are known the first order normalized central moment average travel time is the same for both models and is written as follows jury 1990 4 e l t l u where l is the length of the flow model l and u is the mean seepage velocity u v n l t the second order normalized moment variance of the arrival times for the one domain mass transfer model can be written as jury 1990 5a va r l t 2 d l u 3 the second order normalized moment for the arrival time of the ddmt model can be written as jury 1990 5b va r l t 2 d l u 3 χ 2 1 χ χ 2 l n α u χ n 0 n 0 n expression 6b for the second order moment for the arrival time of the ddmt model consists of two terms one of which is the second order moment of the one domain mass transfer model see eq 5a by calculating the apparent porosity from the peak of the breakthrough curve for the three dimensional model and determining the hydrodynamic dispersion from the second statistical moment it is possible to estimate the mass transfer rate coefficient α to compare the curves obtained by the ddmt model with the breakthrough curve determined from the 3d modeling data we used the transition from the flowing concentration cf to the distribution function of the concentration arrival times ft according to the expression 6 f t c f q m total where mtotal is the total mass of the component in the 3d model m the method of statistical moments obtained the effective porosity of the mobile domain high permeable part was 0 12 the effective porosity of the immobile domain low permeable part was 0 08 the dispersion coefficient was 0 84 m2 day and the mass transfer rate coefficient was 3 28 10 8 day 1 the obtained parameter values were used as an initial approximation to fit the breakthrough curve of the 3d modeling data by a dual domain model using the pest optimizer doherty and hunt 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the effect of diffusion on transport based on the results of the advective diffusion modeling described in section 2 3 the breakthrough curve of the flux concentration cf was constructed fig 2 which shows the total mass discharge through the opposite boundary of the model at different times 7 c f d m out dtq where q is the discharge rate l 3 t t is time t and m out is the total mass component leaving the model m the breakthrough curves of flowing concentration were plotted using the dimensionless time t tadv where t is the simulation time and t adv is the characteristic time of advective transport through the model the time of advective transport is calculated by tk l n v where v is the average flow velocity l t n is the porosity and l is the length of the model along the primary direction of flow l to determine the effect of diffusion on transport the resulting breakthrough curve was compared with the breakthrough curve from bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 for 3d pure advective solute transport using the pmpath program chiang and kinzelbach 2001 on the same heterogeneous model a comparison of the breakthrough curves of the advective and advective diffusion modeling results fig 2 shows that the breakthrough curve of advective diffusion transport has a peak concentration of 30 less than that of advective transport and the long tail indicates the accumulation of the share of non sorbing components in hydrofacies assigned to blocks thus with such geologic medium structure it is necessary to consider diffusion to more reliably predict the long term regional scale radioactive waste migration in the scc area 3 2 estimation of the upscaled mass transfer rate coefficient for a dual domain medium the calculated breakthrough curves from the 3 d simulation are used to estimate the mass transfer rate coefficient for a dual domain medium the selected curves for the 1 d dual domain model using the pest code section 2 4 are shown in fig 3 three breakthrough curves were fitted by changing the weight coefficients for the points of the breakthrough curve of three dimensional modeling for breakthrough curve set 1 all points have identical weights of 1 for the breakthrough curve set 2 the model data in the peak area have a weight of 0 5 for breakthrough curve set 3 the model data in the peak area have a weight of 0 2 fig 3 fig 3 shows that none of the breakthrough curves obtained by the dual domain mass transfer model fully describes the 3d simulation breakthrough curve moreover a better described tail of the curve corresponds to a worse description of the concentration peak the data table 1 of the third curve set 3 were used as the most appropriate parameter values the effective porosity of the mobile domain was 0 13 the effective porosity of the immobile domain was 0 06 the dispersion coefficient was 0 70 m2 day and the mass transfer rate coefficient was 6 42 10 8 day 1 the obtained mass transfer rate coefficient is quite close to the value calculated by the method of statistical moments so it can be used to determine the mass transfer rate coefficient the breakthrough curve of 3d modeling cannot be completely described using set 3 most likely because the process of diffusion filling of low permeability lenses is determined by both the diffusion coefficient and the thickness lenses thus for a horizontally layered reservoir with a constant thickness of low permeability layers parameter α is directly proportional to the diffusion coefficient and inversely proportional to the square of the thickness rumynin 2011 according to the analysis of the borehole cores the thickness of the interlayers of the studied complex has an exponential distribution thus due to diffusion the thinner interlayers are filled faster then thicker ones are filled this type of filling makes the mass transfer rate coefficient decrease over time 3 3 a multirate model to explain the non uniqueness of the upscaled mass transfer rate coefficient this behavior of the mass transfer rate coefficient over time was noted in previously published works where parameter α in model 1 is inversely proportional to the experiment time based on the analysis of the experimental data of various authors haggerty et al 2004 and theoretical analysis of the model with multirate exchange fernàndez garcia and sanchez vila 2015 consider the contaminant transport in an aquifer consisting of two lithological units hydrofacies high permeability mobile domain unit and relatively low permeability immobile domain unit with a lenticular structure fig 4 moreover the high permeability unit has a volume fraction χ and the other units have a volume fraction of 1 χ consider a heterogeneous aquifer with a thickness of m where there is a flow of groundwater with a mean flow gradient j j x j y j z suppose that the mean vertical component of this gradient m j z is zero i e dupuis s assumption is fulfilled for the entire aquifer thickness but there are local fluctuations of the vertical component of the gradient associated with the hydraulic heterogeneity and finite horizontal dimensions of each unit then the balance equation of a nonsorbing component in such an aquifer has the following form when integrated eq 1 over the entire thickness 8 χ n 0 0 m c z t d z 1 χ n 0 m c z t 0 m xy d n 0 xy c z d z 0 m xy c z v z d x where c z and c z are the solute concentrations in mobile and immobile domains high permeable and low permeable hydrofacies respectively m l3 no is the effective porosity of the mobile domain n is the effective porosity of the immobile domain v is the flow velocity l t and d is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor in the mobile domain l2 t assuming that in each vertical section of the aquifer the concentration in the high permeability hydrofacies insignificantly changes in the vertical direction we introduce the averaged over cross section concentration in the high permeability hydrofacies 9 c m 1 0 m c z d z then eq 8 can be written in the form 10 χ n 0 c t 1 χ n 0 m c t z d z xy d gd n 0 xy c xy v xy c where v xy kef j and k ef l t is the effective horizontal hydraulic conductivity l t and d gd is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor in the mobile domain l2 t in 2 d x y space upscaled for full aquifer thickness assuming that each vertical section contains a large number of low permeability lenses replace the aquifer thickness integral in eq 10 with the integral of the probability distribution of the thicknesses of these lenses 11 χ n 0 c t 1 χ n 0 c t m f m d m xy d gd n 0 xy c xy v xy c where f m is the probability distribution function of the lens thickness of low permeability layers to further analyze the migration model in eq 11 it is reasonable to pass from the thickness of the lens distribution function to the exchange coefficient distribution function between permeable and low permeability units analysis of lithological logs of 295 wells in the area of the scc with a vertical resolution of 0 5 m showed that the thicknesses of low permeability layers have a distribution closely follow exponential fig 5 in the dissection of the section the thicknesses of individual interlayers start from a certain minimum thickness m min so we will use the truncated density function of the exponential distribution as the thickness distribution function 12 f m λ exp λ m m min m m min where λ is the distribution parameter the exchange coefficient distribution function between permeable and low permeability units for distribution of thicknesses described by eq 12 has the following form see appendix for details 13 φ d α 3 α 0 α 2 α exp x min 3 α 0 α α 0 4 d 0 n m 0 2 accordingly eq 11 can be rewritten as 14 χ n 0 c t 1 χ n 0 c t φ d α d α xy d n 0 xy c xy v xy c c α t α c c α model 14 has been repeatedly analyzed by various authors haggerty and gorelick 1995 wang et al 2005 and it is connected with the substitution of the general solution for the exchange equation into dependence 14 assuming that the initial concentration in the immobile domain is zero we can write the general expression for the relationship between the concentrations in the immobile domain and mobile domain as the solution of eq 14 with the initial condition c α 0 0 15 c α t 0 t α c τ e x p α t τ d τ then the average concentration in the low permeability part c t can be obtained by averaging eq 15 over α 16 c t 0 t g t τ c τ d τ g t 0 α max α φ d α exp α t d α where g t is the memory function carrera et al 1998 accordingly the transport equation in a high permeability part of the aquifer can be written as 17 χ n 0 c t 1 χ n c t d n 0 xy c xy v xy c the system of eqs 16 17 describes the multi rate mass transfer model the physical meaning of using this model for the conditions under consideration is as follows in each section of the aquifer there may be low permeability layers of different thicknesses and the penetration rate of the component into the layer is inversely proportional to the square of its thickness i e each layer will be filled at its own rate controlled by the value of α depending on its thickness the system of eqs 16 17 differs from the single rate dual domain model in practical applications fernàndez garcia and sanchez vila 2015 considered the time dependent single rate mass transfer model termed the t srmt model as a simplification of eqs 16 17 within the framework of the notation the t srmt model can be written as 18 χ 0 n 0 c t 1 χ 0 n c t d n 0 xy c xy v xy c c t α t c c where χ 0 is the effective fraction of the high permeability domain and α t is the time dependent mass transfer coefficient an asymptotic analysis of solute transport from an instantaneous source using the time dependent single rate mass transfer model t srmt and multi rate mass transfer model mrmt with constant in time parameters gave the following expression for parameter α t fernàndez garcia and sanchez vila 2015 19 α t 0 α max α 2 φ d α exp α t d α 0 α max α φ d α exp α t d α dependence 19 shows that the time dependent mass transfer coefficient decreases with time which is consistent with the observations compiled by haggerty et al 2004 in different sites worldwide therefore using the parameters to model the mass transfer in the heterogeneous model d 0 3 2 10 6 m2 day n 0 2 m min 0 5 m m0 6 5 m the theoretical mass transfer rate coefficient at pe 0 for a period of up to 10000 years was calculated using dependence 19 the obtained values are shown in fig 6 and show that the theoretical mass transfer rate coefficient for the characteristic time of the numerical experiment reaches values on the order of 10 8 days 1 which indicates the correct value of a certain mass transfer rate coefficient by selecting the breakthrough curve 4 conclusions the dual domain model is selected for long term regional transport simulations in the area of the siberian chemical combine assuming that low permeability hydrofacies are the immobile domain and the well permeable hydrofacies compose the mobile domain to upscale the parameter of the first order mass transfer rate between mobile and immobile domains the breakthrough curve of the flux concentration which is obtained by simulating the advective diffusion transport in the horizontal direction on the support scale 3d high resolution model of hydraulic heterogeneity is processed using a dual domain model an important feature of this model was that the thicknesses of the low permeability hydrofacies have an exponential like distribution with an average thickness of about 6 m the processing results show that the simulated breakthrough curve is quite difficult to describe in a dual domain model with a constant mass transfer coefficient to explain this result a dual domain model with multiple rate mass transfer exchange was developed this model is applicable to the object under study because diffusion occurs in various thickness values of the low permeability layers this theoretical analysis shows that when using the classical single rate dual domain model in the case of multi rate exchange between high permeability and low permeability parts of a heterogeneous aquifer the mass transfer rate coefficient should depend on the time of predictive modeling to obtain an effective and suitable mass transfer coefficient to predict long term waste migration in groundwater on a regional scale the largest weight coefficients in the tail part of the breakthrough curve should be used to process the breakthrough curve the obtained characteristic value of the effective mass transfer rate coefficient rate of mass transfer of the first order which is suitable for long term regional transport simulations in the area of the siberian chemical combine is 6 4 10 8 day 1 credit authorship contribution statement s p pozdniakov conceptualization methodology software

permeability units for exponential distribution of thickness let us consider the integral balance of migration in the vertical section of one of the low permeability layers fig 4d lenses with thickness mi and average concentration ci a1 m i n d c i dt d m d c i dz z g bot d m d c i dz z g top v z c v z c i where dm is the molecular diffusion coefficient z g is the lower or upper boundary of the lenses and vz is the vertical velocity of advective transport through it since the vertical velocity due to fluctuations in homogeneities in the velocity field of a flow with an average horizontal gradient is unknown at each point for the following analysis we will assume that the vertical velocity is a constant for all interlayers using the lumped parameter model principles pozdniakov and shestakov 1998 we express the diffusion flux at the boundary as a2 d m d c i dz d m c c i m i 6 δ where m i 6 is the distance from the boundary to the hydraulic center where the capacity of the interlayer is concentrated and δ is the distance to the hydraulic center of the adjacent high permeability interlayer substituting a1 into a2 we can write a3 c i t α i c c i where αi is the exchange coefficient and equal to a4 α i n 1 2 d m m i m i 6 δ v z m i let us rewrite the dependence a4 in the form a4a α i α 0 1 2 x i x i 6 δ pe 4 x i where indicated α 0 4 d m n m 0 2 x i m i m 0 δ δ m 0 pe v z m 0 d m thus the exchange coefficient for each interlayer depends on its capacity the molecular diffusion coefficient and the rate of advective transport through the interlayer in dependence a4a the dimensionless complex pe characterizes the effect of vertical advective transport in weakly permeable lenses on their migrant filling to further analyze the migration model in eq 11 it is necessary to transfer from the layer thickness distribution function to the exchange coefficient distribution function to obtain to the exchange coefficient distribution function we introduce simplifying assumption δ 0 i e the distance to the hydraulic center of the interlayer is substantially smaller than the characteristic thickness m0 in addition we assume that the magnitude of the vertical flow velocity in the lenses is so small that the local peclet number for each lens tends to zero thus a4a can be rewritten in the form a5 α i α 0 3 x i 2 choosing in eq 12 m0 λ 1 as the characteristic thickness we obtain the dimensionless exponential distribution of the low permeable layer thickness x a6 f x exp x min x x x min next we apply for eqs a6a and a5 a general rule with a known distribution function f x and if x ψ α one can find the distribution function ψ α f ψ α ψ α under the accepted assumptions the probability density function of mass transfer rates φd for diffusion transport local peclet number is equal to zero i e pe 0 will have the following form a7 φ d α 3 α 0 α 2 α exp x min 3 α 0 α α 0 4 d 0 n m 0 2 
3649,scale transformation is a problem in many fields especially in geoscience but there is less report on the use of scale transformation to control non point source nps pollution this study constructs a new framework for nps pollution management by re downscaling pollution source area and exploring the effects of best management practices bmps on water quality improvement at large scale after treatment of small scale subwatersheds combined with soil and water assessment tool swat the advantage and uncertainty of the framework were explored though a case study in the three gorges reservoir region china based on the results the framework improved the efficiency of priority management areas pmas identification after the re downscaling the pmas the total phosphorus tp load intensity increased from 59 3 kg km2 to 84 3 kg km2 for those high ranking pmas while the area of pmas with the maximum intensity increased by 4 44 the framework has the most obvious advantages when the tp reduction target is set as 38 00 the nps management area after re downscaling would reduce by 2 46 compare to primary pmas water quality target assessment points and hydrological periods are identified as the uncertain factors the selection of proper water quality target and the assessment point would account for 19 03 and 10 61 reduction of nps control area from dry to wet years the nps control area increased by 647 km2 which accounts for 26 71 of the watershed while the maximum intensity changed from 27 6 kg km2 to 59 3 kg km2 the new framework can be extended to other watersheds for the nps management at watershed scale keywords scale transformation priority management areas nonpoint source pollution swat model nps management area 1 introduction as an important concept in all scientific disciplines scale has a wide range of effects wu et al 2014 the scale effect indicates the influence of scale change on the research results or the possibility of the research results obtained at a certain scale extending to other scales chen et al 2019a zhang et al 2016 showed that the spatial scale effect did not change the relationships between suspended sediment concentration and the intra and inter scale flow sediment which provided suggestions for event based sediment control dai et al 2019 showed that the scale effect will change the time of concentration for impervious area and then affect urban non point source nps pollution zhu et al 2019 indicated that the scale effect affected the transmission path of nps and the baseflow became a more important pathway of the nps as the spatial scale increased the problems caused by the scale effect are mainly due to the inconsistency between the simulation scales in the study and the characteristic scales of the actual process li et al 2021 the resulting solution is scale conversion and the methods include spatial analysis local dynamic model similarity based scale conversion distributed hydrological model etc yao et al 2019 amin et al 2020 used topo swat soil and water assessment tool for scale transformation to make total maximum daily load goals more refined and the cost is reduced by 26 after using topo swat to achieve the same treatment effect han et al 2021 evaluated ecological changes through the development of multi scale transformation methods and deepened their understanding of ecosystem services however few studies have applied scale transformation to nps pollution control affected by topography climate hydrology and other factors nps pollution has the characteristics of large randomness and large temporal and spatial variation of pollution load chen et al 2019b according to the characteristics of nps the selection and layout of measures need to be considered in the treatment of nps pollution and the measures need to invest in construction and maintenance and need to occupy land resources therefore it is necessary to identify the priority management areas pmas in the treatment of nps pollution kim et al 2021 the identification methods of the pmas can be roughly divided into three categories the empirical formula method the multi factor comprehensive analysis method and the mechanism model method gossweiler et al 2021 shen et al 2015 guo et al 2004 identified the pmas by combining geographic information system and agricultural non point pollution potential index method and the method was especially useful for identifying pmas when the basic data was not fully accessible as the related functions of the mechanism model become more and more perfect it is more common to use models ghebremichael et al 2010 used swat model to identify and quantify pmas of total phosphorus tp loss the results showed that 80 of tp loss occurs from only 24 of the watershed area dong et al 2018 incorporated water quality response into pmas identification by swat model and genetic algorithm and the results demonstrated that 85 of diffused tp came from 30 of the watershed area however when pollution is light only the pmas ranked first is treated can still get more reduction than the required reduction which will lead to excessive area being treated if the pmas is divided into a small scale at a time the identification efficiency of the pmas will be greatly reduced and the region where the pollution is not serious will be over identified meanwhile some structural best management practices bmps such as constructed wetlands grassed swales and vegetative filter strips and so on are often installed at small scales cools et al 2011 which leads to the mismatch between the identified pmas scale and the bmps implementation scale chen et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to re downscale the pmas at present the nps pollution caused by excessive use of chemical fertilizers livestock manure emissions and urban emissions and other factors has become an important reason for the deterioration of water quality in the watershed while bmps have become an important measure to improve water quality dai et al 2019 liu et al 2019 chen et al 2019 gitau et al 2006 used nutriment management crop rotations riparian forest buffers to reduce tp by 60 and introduced a genetic algorithm to minimize the cost in the town brook watershed with the area of 37 km2 wang et al 2017 explored the effect of native landscaping and infiltration trench on total nitrogen tn and tp reduction in small watersheds with the area of 9 14 km2 li et al 2021 explored the reduction effect of returning the grain plots to forestry on hydrologic response units hrus scale and the tn reduction rate was 58 60 however the current evaluation of bmps is often limited to the same scales few people explored the effect of bmps on water quality improvement at different scales after treatment of some small scale subwatersheds especially after treatment of key pollution source areas in this study the scale transformation is combined with the pmas to control the nps pollution the main objectives are as follows 1 to develop a new framework for nps pollution management the pollution source area is re downscaled and the effects of bmps on water quality improvement at large scales was explored 2 to explore the efficiency and uncertainty of the framework 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the wuxi section of the daning river watershed which is located on the northern bank of the three gorges reservoir area and belongs to the first level tributary of the yangtze river fig 1 the drainage area of the whole watershed is 4170 km2 of which the watershed area of wuxi section is 2422 km2 the climate of the watershed is the subtropical humid monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 18 4 c and an average annual rainfall of 1049 3 mm currently tn and tp are the main pollutants in the study area fig a 1 the tp and tn were selected as the management objects the database used in this study is shown in table a 1 2 2 the general framework the framework for scaling transformation includes two aspects pmas identification based on spatial downscaling and the effect evaluation of bmps on large scale water quality at small scale fig 2 step i watershed division the first step is to divide the watershed into subwatersheds at present the main method of watershed division is direction 8 multi directional flow algorithm turcotte et al 2001 in general watersheds are divided based on dem using the hydrology module of geographic information system shen et al 2013 in order to considered the artificial influence based on the natural catchment process sun et al 2021 proposed a new framework to divide the typical agriculture intensive catchment su and luo 2021 proposed a method for dividing catchments in plain river network areas watershed division is the spatial basis for the implementation of the framework the purpose of the division is to calculate the nps of the subwatershed and obtain the spatial distribution of nps step ii pollution load calculation in this step the production and emission of pollutants are calculated calculation methods include export coefficient method and model method et al li and zhang 2019 the calculation formula of the export coefficient method is as follows do et al 2011 1 l i 1 n e i a i where l is the total pollution load n is the type of land use or different sources of pollution such as livestock and population ei is the output coefficient of pollutant i ai is the area of land use type i or the number of livestock and population the export coefficient method requires less data and the method is relatively simple but the calculation results are relatively rough the model method requires precise data and some models consider the migration and transformation mechanism of pollutants and the results have high credibility li and zhang 2019 spatial temporal scales and data availability are the two main factors should be considered when a model is chosen grizzetti et al 2005 storm water management model swmm and hspf hydrological simulation program fortran model can simulate urban runoff process and can be used to calculate nps pollution in urban watershed lee et al 2010 in agricultural watersheds swat and apex agricultural policy environmental extender can be used to simulate the occurrence and transmission path of nps and calculate nps pollution swat model can calculate nps pollution at medium or large scale and apex model calculates nps pollution at small watershed or field scale feng et al 2021 environmental fluid dynamics code efdc model can simulate hydrodynamic activity and water quality in the river channel which can be used to calculate the non point source pollution load in the river gao et al 2015 after pollution calculation the nps of the study area can be quantified which is the basis for subsequent pmas identification step iii pmas identification according to the results of nps pollution calculation the results are classified by cluster analysis there are many clustering analysis methods including k means density based spatial clustering of application with noise dbscan self organizing maps som gaussian mixture model gmm et al srivastava 2021 qu and lu 2018 used k means clustering analysis to divide ecological services into several groups for formulating management strategies the evaluation indicator is introduced to identify pmas after subwatershed classification different indicators were selected to evaluate nps pollution and their focus differently evaluation indicators mainly include three categories based on production emissions and contribution the evaluation indicator based on production mainly considers the influence of subwatershed pollution load shen et al 2013 the evaluation indicator based on emissions emphasizes the emissions of pollutants in the watershed which is generally based on the concentration of pollutants and considers the water function of the region shen et al 2015 the evaluation indicator based on contribution is the contribution of watershed pollutants to a certain section of the river which takes into account the pollution load of subwatershed and the river channel transmission liu et al 2019 after pmas are determined assessment points are found in the classified subwatersheds for subsequent nps control step iv nps control based on pmas water quality monitoring stations watershed final outlet important tributaries cross section can be considered as assessment points the assessment point is to represent the impact of water quality improvement in subwatersheds at different scales on the whole watershed therefore the effect of watershed treatment is simplified as the change of water quality at assessment point bmps generally include filter strip fertilization reduction and conservation of farmland into forest et al the filter strip mainly reduces pollutants through the interception of vegetation and the reduction effect is related to the width of the filter strip liu et al 2019 fertilizer reduction and conservation of farmland into forest mainly reduce nps pollution caused by planting through source control liu et al 2020 it is necessary to specify a management rule to determine the extent to which the current pollution unit group can be treated and the next ranking of pollution unit group can be treated the management rules can be set to meet the current water quality standards of pollution production units or reduce their priority rankings 2 3 watershed division and pollution calculation the watershed is first divided into subwatersheds by direction 8 algorithm subwatersheds were classified into smaller hrus based on a combination of land use soil type and slope thresholds if hrus is further divided it is divided into grid scale when the watershed is divided into smaller scale it can be matched with the implementation scale of structural bmps liu et al 2019 however due to hrus does not consider relationships between upstream and downstream it cannot be used as the final analysis unit therefore this study adopts a compromise method to divide the key subwatersheds into secondary subwatersheds again to ensure relationship between the upstream and downstream of the research unit the study area is divided into 22 subwatersheds using the hydrology module of geographic information system according to the pmas identification results the southwest region of the study area is the pma so the region is divided into 19 secondary subwatersheds again fig 1 the study area is a typical large scale agricultural watershed so the swat model was used to calculate pollution load the swat is a semi distributed process based and time continuous model that has been widely used to calculate pollution load arnold et al 1998 and simulate the management on water quality the model works by dividing the watershed into hrus each hrus has the same soil types land uses and slopes the total pollution load of subwatershed is the sum of each hrus 2 e i j 1 n a cu i j c cu i j where ei is the pollution load of the subwatershed i acu i j is the area of the subwatershed i ccu i j is the load intensity of the subwatershed i n is the number of hrus surface runoff in each hru was estimated using a modification of the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method usda 1972 nutrients migrate from subwatersheds to rivers with runoff the qual2e model in swat were used to describe the process of nutrient transformation and degradation in the channel swat models were established twice the first at the whole watershed scale and the second at the subwatershed scale the model parameters and verification and calibration results are shown in table a 2 and table a 3 due to there is no hydrological and water quality monitoring station at the outlet of subwatershed 12 fig 1 so the flow and pollution load of subwatershed 12 in the initial simulation results are used as the required reference values 2 4 pmas identification this study selected three indicators to evaluate nps pollution including pollutant production pollutant emission index and pollutant contribution to the assessment point and the value of the evaluation results is used as the basis for the identification of pmas based on the simulation result of the swat model the strength of the nps pollution load intensity is calculated pollution load intensity of each subwatershed can be calculated from the following formula 3 n i w ij n ij s i where ni is the pollution load intensity of the i subwatershed kg km2 nij is the production of pollutant j on the i subwatershed kg wij is the proportion of pollutant j in all pollution forms on the i subwatershed si is the area of the i subwatershed km2 the evaluation indicators of pollution emission index focus on considering the emission concentration limits of water function zoning the core is to calculate the pollution emission intensity of subwatersheds when the upstream of the emission unit meets the standard the main process include calculation of emission concentration and determination of emission standards kovacs et al 2012 the tp pollution index was used as the final index to calculate the emission concentration emission potential of each subwatershed is determined by pollution index the calculation method is as follows 4 i i log 2 c i o u t c i 0 where ii is the pollution index of the i subwatershed ci out is the concentration of pollutants at the outlet of the i subwatershed when the upstream reaches the standard ci 0 is the maximum concentration of pollutants in the i subwatershed when water quality standards are met specifically when ci c it indicates that the unit emission is up to the standard if the whole watershed emission is still over the standard it is caused by the upstream unit the calculation method of ci out is as follows 5 c i o u t p i o u t sub i a i q t 6 p i 0 o u t u p s t r e a m c i 0 q t where pi 0out is the maximum pollution load that the i subwatershed can discharge when the upstream reaches the standard subi is the pollutant load generated on the i subwatershed ai is the river coefficient of the i subwatershed q is the flow of watershed outlet t is the evaluation time river coefficient is the ratio of export pollution load to import pollution load of pollution production unit when ai 1 the river has a retention of pollutants when ai 1 the river has produced pollutants 7 a i rch i o u t rch i i n 8 rch i i n rch i 1 o u t sub i where rchi out is the pollution load output of the i subwatershed outlet rchi in is the pollution load output of the i subwatershed entrance rchi 1 out is the pollution load output of the i 1 subwatershed daning river is divided into four main tributaries xixi river houxi river baiyang river and dongxi river the corresponding surface water standards are different according to the water quality required by china s government the tp emission concentration limit is 0 2 mg l and tn is 0 2 mg l in the houxi river the tp emission concentration limit is 0 2 mg l and tn is 1 0 mg l in the baiyang river the tp emission concentration limit is 0 1 mg l and tn is 0 5 mg l in other subwatersheds the evaluation indicator of pollutant contribution to assessment point is mainly based on markov chain theory markov chains are similar to upstream and downstream hydraulic linkages and pollutant transport processes so markov chain model is used to calculate the pollution contribution of subwatersheds liu et al 2019 firstly the relationship between upstream and downstream of river network needs to be generalized into transition probability matrix in short it is assumed that a total of n subwatersheds were divided and if the subwatershed j is the downstream subwatershed of the subwatershed i the number of rows i and columns j in the matrix n n is 1 the rest number of rows i is 0 the specific process is shown in fig 2e h is the upstream and downstream relationship matrix 10 h i j 1 the s u b w a t e r s h e d j i s t h e d o w n s t r e a m s u b w a t e r s h e d o f t h e s u b w a t e r s h e d i 0 otherwise secondly the pollution load output of the subwatershed and the migration and transformation process in the river should be characterized by pollutant production and river retention coefficient the retention coefficient matrix r is expressed as follows 11 r y 1 0 0 0 0 y n 12 y i rch in rch out rch in 13 rch i i n rch i 1 o u t sub i the river channel retention coefficient y is different from the river channel coefficient α and its physical meaning refers to the reduced pollution due to the complex physical chemical and biological processes in the river if the pollutant is not reduced in the river or the river contributes some pollutant y is defined as 0 the transfer of pollutants in the river network is calculated by matrix based on the above data as shown in the following 14 h h i r where h is the upstream and downstream relationship matrix i is a unit matrix r is a retention coefficient matrix finally the contribution of subwatersheds to assessment points is calculated assuming that the watershed has m assessment points the assessment point matrix k k1 k2 kn t the assessment point ki was taken as an example where ki is located at the export section of subwatershed i the contribution of other subwatersheds to ki is h k n v k 15 h k i j h k i j if i k 1 if i j k 0 if i k a n d j k 16 v k i 1 if i k 0 otherwise in order to explore the contribution ranking of subwatersheds after downscaling in the whole watershed the pmas identification results of 19 secondary subwatersheds and 22 primary subwatersheds were coupled to analyze the pmas of 40 subwatersheds in the whole watershed the contribution of unit area of each subwatershed to assessment point 13 can be calculated by the following equation 17 g i g i g 12 g i s i where gi is the contribution of subwatershed i when subwatershed 13 is used as the assessment point kg km2 gi is the contribution intensity of subwatershed i when subwatershed 12 9 is used as the assessment point kg km2 g i is the sum of contributions from all secondary subwatersheds when subwatershed 12 19 is used as assessment point kg g12 is the contribution intensity of subwatershed 12 when subwatershed 13 is used as the assessment point kg si is the area of the secondary subwatershed i km2 2 5 nps control based on pmas the wuxi hydrological and water quality monitoring station was used as the assessment point fig 1 the pmas of tn were identified based on contribution two nonstructural bmps and one structural bmps were added to each subwatershed until the concentration produced in the subwatershed reaches the standard the two nonstructural bmps include returning farmland to forest above 15 and reducing fertilizer application by 30 and the structural bmps are represented by 15 m filter strips by changing the input of land use in swat model the farmland above 15 is transformed into forest to complete land management measures for nutrient management measures the fertilizer applied to farmland is reduced by 30 in the management file mgt filter strips was evaluated in the vfs routine where the field area to vfs area ration filter ration the fraction of total runoff from a field entering the most concentrated 10 of a vfs filter con and the fraction of flow through the most concentrated 10 of fully channelized vfs filter ch were adjusted qiu et al 2019 the width of filter strips indicates that the filter strips is set to 15 m to calculate interception efficiency the treatment rule of tn is that the surface concentration of each subwatershed reaches 0 5 mg l first the subwatersheds with the highest contribution to tn are treated until the tn concentration produced reaches 0 5 mg l and then the next subwatersheds are treated the tp pollution index of the subwatershed located in the upstream of the assessment point was calculated the management rule of tp is to complete the addition of the same measures only when the types and orders of the measures are added to the current subwatersheds indifferently can the next subwatershed treatment be carried out due to tp pollution is lighter than tn bmps are the same as tn except filter strip 3 results 3 1 pmas identification results based on spatial downscaling the evaluation indicator of contribution was used to identify pmas in wet year the contribution intensity of over 1 3 of the secondary subwatersheds were more than 60 kg km2 in dry year the contribution intensity of all 19 subwatersheds was below 40 kg km2 the identification results of pmas were the same the maximum tp contribution intensity occurred in wet year which were 84 3 kg km2 and 82 0 kg km2 respectively fig 3 the subwatersheds became pmas mainly include two aspects one was that the subwatershed produced many pollutants and the retention coefficient was small and the other was that the subwatersheds were located at the source of tributaries and were close to the assessment point the maximum contribution intensity of primary subwatershed was 59 3 kg km2 in wet year however after the fine division of the subwatershed the contribution intensity of top five secondary subwatersheds was more than 64 2 kg km2 in wet year and the top subwatershed accounted for only 0 70 of the total watershed area and contributed 2 15 to assessment point 3 2 pmas management results the contribution of tn to the assessment point was calculated in wet year subwatershed 7 had the largest contribution of 2938 3 kg km2 and the contribution of subwatershed 2 was the least which was 414 5 kg km2 the specific rankings of pmas are shown in table a 4 tn was treated according to the pmas ranking the tn export concentration of the assessment point was calculated only the first subwatershed was treated if the tn concentration of subwatershed 7 was less than 0 50 mg l the total export concentration decreased to 1 79 mg l after the treatment of the top five subwatersheds the total export concentration was reduced by 30 compared with the initial 2 10 mg l which reached 1 50 mg l when the pollution load of the top nine subwatersheds reaches the standard the total export concentration reached 0 96 mg l the largest tp emission index was 14 3 and the least tp emission index was 1 1 in wet year returning farmland to forest above 15 and reducing fertilizer application by 30 were implemented based on treatment rules the cumulative area of treatment of the whole watershed and the cumulative reduction rate of tp concentration of the assessment point were calculated when only the subwatershed with the largest tp emission index was treated the tp load concentration was reduced by 0 55 and the contribution of assessment point was reduced by 0 07 after the second ranking subwatershed with the area of 47 km2 was treated it was reduced by 0 49 while the contribution of assessment point was only reduced by 0 05 however after the application of the measures in subwatershed ranked third and fourth the area needed to be controlled nearly six times more than the top watershed and the tp concentration at the assessment point could only be reduced by 0 14 3 3 uncertainty of the identification results of pmas the largest tp load intensity was 50 3 kg km2 in wet year 39 5 kg km2 in normal year and 38 8 kg km2 in dry year the least tp load intensity was 20 2 kg km2 in wet year 14 1 kg km2 in normal year and 14 8 kg km2 in dry year fig 4 a c it can be seen that the identification results of pmas in each year were almost similar subwatershed 4 and 12 had the largest tp load intensity the reason was that the area of subwatershed 4 and 12 was large and the chemical fertilizer and pesticide pollution in these regions was also serious the tp pollution index of wet normal and dry years in the study area was calculated the pollution index of the subwatersheds in wet normal and dry years were ranged 1 15 and most of the subwatersheds were ranged 8 11 it can be seen that the identification results of pmas in each year were the same fig 4 d f the tp pollution index of subwatershed 10 12 and 7 was the largest they were ranged 12 15 subwatershed 10 12 is located in the branch of houxi river and the water quality standard was 0 2 mg l which was required by china s government the highly water quality made the tp emission concentration of these subwatersheds not meet the relevant water quality standards which made them become the pmas the subwatershed 7 was the largest of the 22 subwatersheds the output of pollutants on the whole watershed was large so the tp pollution index was also large the maximum pollution contribution intensity was 59 3 kg km2 30 2 kg km2 and 27 6 kg km2 in wet year normal year and dry year respectively and the minimum contribution intensity was 15 7 kg km2 9 6 kg km2 and 7 7 kg km2 respectively the subwatershed 4 12 9 had the largest contribution intensity fig 4 g i subwatershed 12 4 were located in the upstream of tributaries and closed to the source which made them have steep slope and large catchment area therefore the production of pollutants was large which directly leaded to their large contribution to the assessment point and became pmas subwatershed 9 were closer to the assessment point which made it easier for pollutants migrate to the assessment point and became pmas due to the downstream of the watershed has little effect on water quality improvement pmas are not identified in the downstream of the assessment point 4 discussions 4 1 advantage of the framework the traditional method to divide the pmas is the optimal catchment area identified based on the threshold recommended by dem and geographic information system therefore the identified of pmas are not conducive to the implementation of structural bmps by most studies because the scale of structural bmps generally do not exceed 1 km2 it can be seen from table 1 that if the watershed with area greater than 2000 km2 is divided into subwatersheds the area of the pmas is generally 46 380 km2 dong et al 2018 ou and wang 2008 ou and wang 2008 in this study the top pmas was re downscaled on the basis of traditional methods and considering the implementation of bmps a watershed of 2422 km2 was divided twice by the framework the area of the top pmas decreased from 254 km2 to 17 km2 and the maximum tp contribution intensity increased from 59 3 kg km2 to 84 3 kg km2 after the re downscaling the top pmas the area of the region with the tp contribution intensity greater 59 3 kg km2 was 107 km2 which was accounted for 4 44 of the whole watershed area fig 3 although some large watersheds can reach 1 20 km2 after divided into grid scale ding et al 2020 behera and panda 2006 the whole watershed is divided into grid scale greatly reduces the simulation efficiency the framework can improve the identification efficiency of pmas which is reflected in the increase of pollution contribution intensity by 29 66 and the increase of the area of pmas with the maximum pollution contribution intensity by 34 41 after re downscaling the key pollution source area the control area of nps becomes more dispersed the area of one region is smaller and the pollution contribution intensity is larger the identification of pmas concentrates the areas with serious nps pollution and the management based on pmas can greatly reduce the area of treatment ding et al 2020 dong et al 2018 liu et al 2016 niraula et al 2013 ou and wang 2008 ou and wang 2008 the framework can further reduce the nps management area compared with the first identified pmas the contribution rate of assessment point was taken as the reduction target when the reduction target is less than 54 73 the nps management area after re downscaling the pmas is smaller than that based on pmas especially when the reduction target is 38 00 the advantage of the framework is most obvious the reduced area accounts for 2 46 of the watershed area fig 5 when the reduction target is small only small area need to be treated the framework shows the advantages of concentrating nps in small areas as the increase of the reduction target the ranking bottom regions which has little nps pollution with large area need to be treated the advantage of framework was decreased 4 2 uncertainty of the framework the pmas identified in this paper are mainly located in the west many studies choose the daning river basin as the study area and the location of pmas is basically consistent between this study and other studies shen et al 2015 chen et al 2014 wang et al 2016 therefore the framework can accurately identify the pmas the factors affecting the identification of pmas include rainfall pollutant type identification method of pmas etc seo et al 2021 showed that as large amounts of rainfall occurred in the midstream and downstream area of the nakdong river the distribution of high ranking critical source areas csas are the same with rainfall chen et al 2014 showed that the area of tn pmas was 2 42 times that of tp pmas rudra et al 2020 showed that both simple index based methods and detailed hwq models to determine csas are limited in canadian conditions it is recommended to consider a variety of methods to identify csas ouyang et al 2008 took pollution load intensity as the evaluation indicator of pmas in this study when the pollution load intensity is greater than 40 kg km2 as the standard of pmas the nps management area is 777 km2 accounting for 32 08 of the whole watershed area chen et al 2014 took the contribution intensity of pollutants to key sections as the identification indicator of pmas to consider the reduction effect of rivers if the impact of assessment points is considered in this study pmas need the contribution of subwatersheds to the assessment points to be greater than 10 and the pollution load intensity is greater than 40 kg km2 the nps management area is reduced by 257 km2 accounting for 10 61 of the whole watershed the chemical and physical reactions of pollutants with other substances in the process of river migration will greatly reduce the load liu et al 2020 the reduced area is mainly affected by the distance from the assessment point it is suggested to increase the number of assessment points which can not only reduce the uncertainty of the framework but also can understand the interactions between multiple river points chen et al 2014 in order to effectively protect watershed with multiple water functional zones shen et al 2015 identified the pmas with the consideration of water quality if the impact of water quality is considered in this study regions with tp pollution index greater than 12 and pollution load intensity greater than 40 kg km2 can become pmas the nps management area is reduced by 461 km2 accounting for 19 03 of the whole watershed the reduced areas have relatively low water quality targets and they were not to be focused when the water quality target of the region is low it has greater water environmental capacity and it can accommodate more pollution maximum pollution load intensity changed from 38 8 kg km2 in dry years to 50 3 kg km2 in wet years maximum pollution contribution intensity changed from 27 6 kg km2 in dry years to 59 3 kg km2 in wet years the nps management area increased by 647 km2 from wet to normal and dry years without considering pmas identified by pollution index which accounts for 26 71 of the whole watershed area hydrological period has great influence on the occurrence and transmission of nps pollution cheng et al 2019 when rainfall increases it will wash more pesticides fertilizers dust and other pollutants into the river resulting in increased nps pollution however the maximum pollution index was 14 3 in dry and wet years without change although heavy rainfall led to heavy pollution loads the flow also increased which dilutes pollutants at a certain level and reduces their concentrations chang et al 2005 the management of pmas should be considered based on hydrological periods more cost is invested in nps treatment in wet year and the treatment can be reduced in the dry year wei et al 2017 compared with tp with light pollution tn with heavy pollution can get more reduction 3 of the area was treated can get 20 reduction of tp however if the water quality target at the assessment point is 0 5 mg l tn cannot meet the target even if 90 of the watershed is treated when the treatment goal is high only the top pmas treated cannot meet the requirements and the ranking bottom regions needed to be treated the pollution load of the ranking bottom regions is lower than the average level of the whole watershed so the efficiency of the framework is continuously reduced until the results of the framework treatment and the whole watershed management are the same giri et al 2012 it is suggested that the identified pmas with the most serious pollution and relatively large area should be implemented the framework again the reason is that after all subwatersheds are treated the top pmas still have large nps pollution compared with other subwatersheds 5 conclusions this study constructs a new framework for nps pollution management based on scale transformation the advantage and uncertainty of the framework were explored the maximum tp load intensity increased by 29 66 after the re downscaling of the top pmas the nps control area decreased after re downscaling the pmas especially 38 00 is set as the reduction target the reduced area accounts for 2 46 of the watershed area the uncertainty of the framework is mainly affected by water quality target assessment points and hydrological periods the consideration of water quality target and assessment point reduced the nps control area accounting for 19 03 and 10 61 of the watershed area from dry to wet years the increased nps control area accounts for 26 71 of the watershed area when the pmas is re downscaled the system error is caused due to the refinement of the river transmission process in some subwatersheds in future more precise data should be obtained through field research to reduce systematic errors in the implementation of the framework credit

3649,scale transformation is a problem in many fields especially in geoscience but there is less report on the use of scale transformation to control non point source nps pollution this study constructs a new framework for nps pollution management by re downscaling pollution source area and exploring the effects of best management practices bmps on water quality improvement at large scale after treatment of small scale subwatersheds combined with soil and water assessment tool swat the advantage and uncertainty of the framework were explored though a case study in the three gorges reservoir region china based on the results the framework improved the efficiency of priority management areas pmas identification after the re downscaling the pmas the total phosphorus tp load intensity increased from 59 3 kg km2 to 84 3 kg km2 for those high ranking pmas while the area of pmas with the maximum intensity increased by 4 44 the framework has the most obvious advantages when the tp reduction target is set as 38 00 the nps management area after re downscaling would reduce by 2 46 compare to primary pmas water quality target assessment points and hydrological periods are identified as the uncertain factors the selection of proper water quality target and the assessment point would account for 19 03 and 10 61 reduction of nps control area from dry to wet years the nps control area increased by 647 km2 which accounts for 26 71 of the watershed while the maximum intensity changed from 27 6 kg km2 to 59 3 kg km2 the new framework can be extended to other watersheds for the nps management at watershed scale keywords scale transformation priority management areas nonpoint source pollution swat model nps management area 1 introduction as an important concept in all scientific disciplines scale has a wide range of effects wu et al 2014 the scale effect indicates the influence of scale change on the research results or the possibility of the research results obtained at a certain scale extending to other scales chen et al 2019a zhang et al 2016 showed that the spatial scale effect did not change the relationships between suspended sediment concentration and the intra and inter scale flow sediment which provided suggestions for event based sediment control dai et al 2019 showed that the scale effect will change the time of concentration for impervious area and then affect urban non point source nps pollution zhu et al 2019 indicated that the scale effect affected the transmission path of nps and the baseflow became a more important pathway of the nps as the spatial scale increased the problems caused by the scale effect are mainly due to the inconsistency between the simulation scales in the study and the characteristic scales of the actual process li et al 2021 the resulting solution is scale conversion and the methods include spatial analysis local dynamic model similarity based scale conversion distributed hydrological model etc yao et al 2019 amin et al 2020 used topo swat soil and water assessment tool for scale transformation to make total maximum daily load goals more refined and the cost is reduced by 26 after using topo swat to achieve the same treatment effect han et al 2021 evaluated ecological changes through the development of multi scale transformation methods and deepened their understanding of ecosystem services however few studies have applied scale transformation to nps pollution control affected by topography climate hydrology and other factors nps pollution has the characteristics of large randomness and large temporal and spatial variation of pollution load chen et al 2019b according to the characteristics of nps the selection and layout of measures need to be considered in the treatment of nps pollution and the measures need to invest in construction and maintenance and need to occupy land resources therefore it is necessary to identify the priority management areas pmas in the treatment of nps pollution kim et al 2021 the identification methods of the pmas can be roughly divided into three categories the empirical formula method the multi factor comprehensive analysis method and the mechanism model method gossweiler et al 2021 shen et al 2015 guo et al 2004 identified the pmas by combining geographic information system and agricultural non point pollution potential index method and the method was especially useful for identifying pmas when the basic data was not fully accessible as the related functions of the mechanism model become more and more perfect it is more common to use models ghebremichael et al 2010 used swat model to identify and quantify pmas of total phosphorus tp loss the results showed that 80 of tp loss occurs from only 24 of the watershed area dong et al 2018 incorporated water quality response into pmas identification by swat model and genetic algorithm and the results demonstrated that 85 of diffused tp came from 30 of the watershed area however when pollution is light only the pmas ranked first is treated can still get more reduction than the required reduction which will lead to excessive area being treated if the pmas is divided into a small scale at a time the identification efficiency of the pmas will be greatly reduced and the region where the pollution is not serious will be over identified meanwhile some structural best management practices bmps such as constructed wetlands grassed swales and vegetative filter strips and so on are often installed at small scales cools et al 2011 which leads to the mismatch between the identified pmas scale and the bmps implementation scale chen et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to re downscale the pmas at present the nps pollution caused by excessive use of chemical fertilizers livestock manure emissions and urban emissions and other factors has become an important reason for the deterioration of water quality in the watershed while bmps have become an important measure to improve water quality dai et al 2019 liu et al 2019 chen et al 2019 gitau et al 2006 used nutriment management crop rotations riparian forest buffers to reduce tp by 60 and introduced a genetic algorithm to minimize the cost in the town brook watershed with the area of 37 km2 wang et al 2017 explored the effect of native landscaping and infiltration trench on total nitrogen tn and tp reduction in small watersheds with the area of 9 14 km2 li et al 2021 explored the reduction effect of returning the grain plots to forestry on hydrologic response units hrus scale and the tn reduction rate was 58 60 however the current evaluation of bmps is often limited to the same scales few people explored the effect of bmps on water quality improvement at different scales after treatment of some small scale subwatersheds especially after treatment of key pollution source areas in this study the scale transformation is combined with the pmas to control the nps pollution the main objectives are as follows 1 to develop a new framework for nps pollution management the pollution source area is re downscaled and the effects of bmps on water quality improvement at large scales was explored 2 to explore the efficiency and uncertainty of the framework 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the wuxi section of the daning river watershed which is located on the northern bank of the three gorges reservoir area and belongs to the first level tributary of the yangtze river fig 1 the drainage area of the whole watershed is 4170 km2 of which the watershed area of wuxi section is 2422 km2 the climate of the watershed is the subtropical humid monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 18 4 c and an average annual rainfall of 1049 3 mm currently tn and tp are the main pollutants in the study area fig a 1 the tp and tn were selected as the management objects the database used in this study is shown in table a 1 2 2 the general framework the framework for scaling transformation includes two aspects pmas identification based on spatial downscaling and the effect evaluation of bmps on large scale water quality at small scale fig 2 step i watershed division the first step is to divide the watershed into subwatersheds at present the main method of watershed division is direction 8 multi directional flow algorithm turcotte et al 2001 in general watersheds are divided based on dem using the hydrology module of geographic information system shen et al 2013 in order to considered the artificial influence based on the natural catchment process sun et al 2021 proposed a new framework to divide the typical agriculture intensive catchment su and luo 2021 proposed a method for dividing catchments in plain river network areas watershed division is the spatial basis for the implementation of the framework the purpose of the division is to calculate the nps of the subwatershed and obtain the spatial distribution of nps step ii pollution load calculation in this step the production and emission of pollutants are calculated calculation methods include export coefficient method and model method et al li and zhang 2019 the calculation formula of the export coefficient method is as follows do et al 2011 1 l i 1 n e i a i where l is the total pollution load n is the type of land use or different sources of pollution such as livestock and population ei is the output coefficient of pollutant i ai is the area of land use type i or the number of livestock and population the export coefficient method requires less data and the method is relatively simple but the calculation results are relatively rough the model method requires precise data and some models consider the migration and transformation mechanism of pollutants and the results have high credibility li and zhang 2019 spatial temporal scales and data availability are the two main factors should be considered when a model is chosen grizzetti et al 2005 storm water management model swmm and hspf hydrological simulation program fortran model can simulate urban runoff process and can be used to calculate nps pollution in urban watershed lee et al 2010 in agricultural watersheds swat and apex agricultural policy environmental extender can be used to simulate the occurrence and transmission path of nps and calculate nps pollution swat model can calculate nps pollution at medium or large scale and apex model calculates nps pollution at small watershed or field scale feng et al 2021 environmental fluid dynamics code efdc model can simulate hydrodynamic activity and water quality in the river channel which can be used to calculate the non point source pollution load in the river gao et al 2015 after pollution calculation the nps of the study area can be quantified which is the basis for subsequent pmas identification step iii pmas identification according to the results of nps pollution calculation the results are classified by cluster analysis there are many clustering analysis methods including k means density based spatial clustering of application with noise dbscan self organizing maps som gaussian mixture model gmm et al srivastava 2021 qu and lu 2018 used k means clustering analysis to divide ecological services into several groups for formulating management strategies the evaluation indicator is introduced to identify pmas after subwatershed classification different indicators were selected to evaluate nps pollution and their focus differently evaluation indicators mainly include three categories based on production emissions and contribution the evaluation indicator based on production mainly considers the influence of subwatershed pollution load shen et al 2013 the evaluation indicator based on emissions emphasizes the emissions of pollutants in the watershed which is generally based on the concentration of pollutants and considers the water function of the region shen et al 2015 the evaluation indicator based on contribution is the contribution of watershed pollutants to a certain section of the river which takes into account the pollution load of subwatershed and the river channel transmission liu et al 2019 after pmas are determined assessment points are found in the classified subwatersheds for subsequent nps control step iv nps control based on pmas water quality monitoring stations watershed final outlet important tributaries cross section can be considered as assessment points the assessment point is to represent the impact of water quality improvement in subwatersheds at different scales on the whole watershed therefore the effect of watershed treatment is simplified as the change of water quality at assessment point bmps generally include filter strip fertilization reduction and conservation of farmland into forest et al the filter strip mainly reduces pollutants through the interception of vegetation and the reduction effect is related to the width of the filter strip liu et al 2019 fertilizer reduction and conservation of farmland into forest mainly reduce nps pollution caused by planting through source control liu et al 2020 it is necessary to specify a management rule to determine the extent to which the current pollution unit group can be treated and the next ranking of pollution unit group can be treated the management rules can be set to meet the current water quality standards of pollution production units or reduce their priority rankings 2 3 watershed division and pollution calculation the watershed is first divided into subwatersheds by direction 8 algorithm subwatersheds were classified into smaller hrus based on a combination of land use soil type and slope thresholds if hrus is further divided it is divided into grid scale when the watershed is divided into smaller scale it can be matched with the implementation scale of structural bmps liu et al 2019 however due to hrus does not consider relationships between upstream and downstream it cannot be used as the final analysis unit therefore this study adopts a compromise method to divide the key subwatersheds into secondary subwatersheds again to ensure relationship between the upstream and downstream of the research unit the study area is divided into 22 subwatersheds using the hydrology module of geographic information system according to the pmas identification results the southwest region of the study area is the pma so the region is divided into 19 secondary subwatersheds again fig 1 the study area is a typical large scale agricultural watershed so the swat model was used to calculate pollution load the swat is a semi distributed process based and time continuous model that has been widely used to calculate pollution load arnold et al 1998 and simulate the management on water quality the model works by dividing the watershed into hrus each hrus has the same soil types land uses and slopes the total pollution load of subwatershed is the sum of each hrus 2 e i j 1 n a cu i j c cu i j where ei is the pollution load of the subwatershed i acu i j is the area of the subwatershed i ccu i j is the load intensity of the subwatershed i n is the number of hrus surface runoff in each hru was estimated using a modification of the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method usda 1972 nutrients migrate from subwatersheds to rivers with runoff the qual2e model in swat were used to describe the process of nutrient transformation and degradation in the channel swat models were established twice the first at the whole watershed scale and the second at the subwatershed scale the model parameters and verification and calibration results are shown in table a 2 and table a 3 due to there is no hydrological and water quality monitoring station at the outlet of subwatershed 12 fig 1 so the flow and pollution load of subwatershed 12 in the initial simulation results are used as the required reference values 2 4 pmas identification this study selected three indicators to evaluate nps pollution including pollutant production pollutant emission index and pollutant contribution to the assessment point and the value of the evaluation results is used as the basis for the identification of pmas based on the simulation result of the swat model the strength of the nps pollution load intensity is calculated pollution load intensity of each subwatershed can be calculated from the following formula 3 n i w ij n ij s i where ni is the pollution load intensity of the i subwatershed kg km2 nij is the production of pollutant j on the i subwatershed kg wij is the proportion of pollutant j in all pollution forms on the i subwatershed si is the area of the i subwatershed km2 the evaluation indicators of pollution emission index focus on considering the emission concentration limits of water function zoning the core is to calculate the pollution emission intensity of subwatersheds when the upstream of the emission unit meets the standard the main process include calculation of emission concentration and determination of emission standards kovacs et al 2012 the tp pollution index was used as the final index to calculate the emission concentration emission potential of each subwatershed is determined by pollution index the calculation method is as follows 4 i i log 2 c i o u t c i 0 where ii is the pollution index of the i subwatershed ci out is the concentration of pollutants at the outlet of the i subwatershed when the upstream reaches the standard ci 0 is the maximum concentration of pollutants in the i subwatershed when water quality standards are met specifically when ci c it indicates that the unit emission is up to the standard if the whole watershed emission is still over the standard it is caused by the upstream unit the calculation method of ci out is as follows 5 c i o u t p i o u t sub i a i q t 6 p i 0 o u t u p s t r e a m c i 0 q t where pi 0out is the maximum pollution load that the i subwatershed can discharge when the upstream reaches the standard subi is the pollutant load generated on the i subwatershed ai is the river coefficient of the i subwatershed q is the flow of watershed outlet t is the evaluation time river coefficient is the ratio of export pollution load to import pollution load of pollution production unit when ai 1 the river has a retention of pollutants when ai 1 the river has produced pollutants 7 a i rch i o u t rch i i n 8 rch i i n rch i 1 o u t sub i where rchi out is the pollution load output of the i subwatershed outlet rchi in is the pollution load output of the i subwatershed entrance rchi 1 out is the pollution load output of the i 1 subwatershed daning river is divided into four main tributaries xixi river houxi river baiyang river and dongxi river the corresponding surface water standards are different according to the water quality required by china s government the tp emission concentration limit is 0 2 mg l and tn is 0 2 mg l in the houxi river the tp emission concentration limit is 0 2 mg l and tn is 1 0 mg l in the baiyang river the tp emission concentration limit is 0 1 mg l and tn is 0 5 mg l in other subwatersheds the evaluation indicator of pollutant contribution to assessment point is mainly based on markov chain theory markov chains are similar to upstream and downstream hydraulic linkages and pollutant transport processes so markov chain model is used to calculate the pollution contribution of subwatersheds liu et al 2019 firstly the relationship between upstream and downstream of river network needs to be generalized into transition probability matrix in short it is assumed that a total of n subwatersheds were divided and if the subwatershed j is the downstream subwatershed of the subwatershed i the number of rows i and columns j in the matrix n n is 1 the rest number of rows i is 0 the specific process is shown in fig 2e h is the upstream and downstream relationship matrix 10 h i j 1 the s u b w a t e r s h e d j i s t h e d o w n s t r e a m s u b w a t e r s h e d o f t h e s u b w a t e r s h e d i 0 otherwise secondly the pollution load output of the subwatershed and the migration and transformation process in the river should be characterized by pollutant production and river retention coefficient the retention coefficient matrix r is expressed as follows 11 r y 1 0 0 0 0 y n 12 y i rch in rch out rch in 13 rch i i n rch i 1 o u t sub i the river channel retention coefficient y is different from the river channel coefficient α and its physical meaning refers to the reduced pollution due to the complex physical chemical and biological processes in the river if the pollutant is not reduced in the river or the river contributes some pollutant y is defined as 0 the transfer of pollutants in the river network is calculated by matrix based on the above data as shown in the following 14 h h i r where h is the upstream and downstream relationship matrix i is a unit matrix r is a retention coefficient matrix finally the contribution of subwatersheds to assessment points is calculated assuming that the watershed has m assessment points the assessment point matrix k k1 k2 kn t the assessment point ki was taken as an example where ki is located at the export section of subwatershed i the contribution of other subwatersheds to ki is h k n v k 15 h k i j h k i j if i k 1 if i j k 0 if i k a n d j k 16 v k i 1 if i k 0 otherwise in order to explore the contribution ranking of subwatersheds after downscaling in the whole watershed the pmas identification results of 19 secondary subwatersheds and 22 primary subwatersheds were coupled to analyze the pmas of 40 subwatersheds in the whole watershed the contribution of unit area of each subwatershed to assessment point 13 can be calculated by the following equation 17 g i g i g 12 g i s i where gi is the contribution of subwatershed i when subwatershed 13 is used as the assessment point kg km2 gi is the contribution intensity of subwatershed i when subwatershed 12 9 is used as the assessment point kg km2 g i is the sum of contributions from all secondary subwatersheds when subwatershed 12 19 is used as assessment point kg g12 is the contribution intensity of subwatershed 12 when subwatershed 13 is used as the assessment point kg si is the area of the secondary subwatershed i km2 2 5 nps control based on pmas the wuxi hydrological and water quality monitoring station was used as the assessment point fig 1 the pmas of tn were identified based on contribution two nonstructural bmps and one structural bmps were added to each subwatershed until the concentration produced in the subwatershed reaches the standard the two nonstructural bmps include returning farmland to forest above 15 and reducing fertilizer application by 30 and the structural bmps are represented by 15 m filter strips by changing the input of land use in swat model the farmland above 15 is transformed into forest to complete land management measures for nutrient management measures the fertilizer applied to farmland is reduced by 30 in the management file mgt filter strips was evaluated in the vfs routine where the field area to vfs area ration filter ration the fraction of total runoff from a field entering the most concentrated 10 of a vfs filter con and the fraction of flow through the most concentrated 10 of fully channelized vfs filter ch were adjusted qiu et al 2019 the width of filter strips indicates that the filter strips is set to 15 m to calculate interception efficiency the treatment rule of tn is that the surface concentration of each subwatershed reaches 0 5 mg l first the subwatersheds with the highest contribution to tn are treated until the tn concentration produced reaches 0 5 mg l and then the next subwatersheds are treated the tp pollution index of the subwatershed located in the upstream of the assessment point was calculated the management rule of tp is to complete the addition of the same measures only when the types and orders of the measures are added to the current subwatersheds indifferently can the next subwatershed treatment be carried out due to tp pollution is lighter than tn bmps are the same as tn except filter strip 3 results 3 1 pmas identification results based on spatial downscaling the evaluation indicator of contribution was used to identify pmas in wet year the contribution intensity of over 1 3 of the secondary subwatersheds were more than 60 kg km2 in dry year the contribution intensity of all 19 subwatersheds was below 40 kg km2 the identification results of pmas were the same the maximum tp contribution intensity occurred in wet year which were 84 3 kg km2 and 82 0 kg km2 respectively fig 3 the subwatersheds became pmas mainly include two aspects one was that the subwatershed produced many pollutants and the retention coefficient was small and the other was that the subwatersheds were located at the source of tributaries and were close to the assessment point the maximum contribution intensity of primary subwatershed was 59 3 kg km2 in wet year however after the fine division of the subwatershed the contribution intensity of top five secondary subwatersheds was more than 64 2 kg km2 in wet year and the top subwatershed accounted for only 0 70 of the total watershed area and contributed 2 15 to assessment point 3 2 pmas management results the contribution of tn to the assessment point was calculated in wet year subwatershed 7 had the largest contribution of 2938 3 kg km2 and the contribution of subwatershed 2 was the least which was 414 5 kg km2 the specific rankings of pmas are shown in table a 4 tn was treated according to the pmas ranking the tn export concentration of the assessment point was calculated only the first subwatershed was treated if the tn concentration of subwatershed 7 was less than 0 50 mg l the total export concentration decreased to 1 79 mg l after the treatment of the top five subwatersheds the total export concentration was reduced by 30 compared with the initial 2 10 mg l which reached 1 50 mg l when the pollution load of the top nine subwatersheds reaches the standard the total export concentration reached 0 96 mg l the largest tp emission index was 14 3 and the least tp emission index was 1 1 in wet year returning farmland to forest above 15 and reducing fertilizer application by 30 were implemented based on treatment rules the cumulative area of treatment of the whole watershed and the cumulative reduction rate of tp concentration of the assessment point were calculated when only the subwatershed with the largest tp emission index was treated the tp load concentration was reduced by 0 55 and the contribution of assessment point was reduced by 0 07 after the second ranking subwatershed with the area of 47 km2 was treated it was reduced by 0 49 while the contribution of assessment point was only reduced by 0 05 however after the application of the measures in subwatershed ranked third and fourth the area needed to be controlled nearly six times more than the top watershed and the tp concentration at the assessment point could only be reduced by 0 14 3 3 uncertainty of the identification results of pmas the largest tp load intensity was 50 3 kg km2 in wet year 39 5 kg km2 in normal year and 38 8 kg km2 in dry year the least tp load intensity was 20 2 kg km2 in wet year 14 1 kg km2 in normal year and 14 8 kg km2 in dry year fig 4 a c it can be seen that the identification results of pmas in each year were almost similar subwatershed 4 and 12 had the largest tp load intensity the reason was that the area of subwatershed 4 and 12 was large and the chemical fertilizer and pesticide pollution in these regions was also serious the tp pollution index of wet normal and dry years in the study area was calculated the pollution index of the subwatersheds in wet normal and dry years were ranged 1 15 and most of the subwatersheds were ranged 8 11 it can be seen that the identification results of pmas in each year were the same fig 4 d f the tp pollution index of subwatershed 10 12 and 7 was the largest they were ranged 12 15 subwatershed 10 12 is located in the branch of houxi river and the water quality standard was 0 2 mg l which was required by china s government the highly water quality made the tp emission concentration of these subwatersheds not meet the relevant water quality standards which made them become the pmas the subwatershed 7 was the largest of the 22 subwatersheds the output of pollutants on the whole watershed was large so the tp pollution index was also large the maximum pollution contribution intensity was 59 3 kg km2 30 2 kg km2 and 27 6 kg km2 in wet year normal year and dry year respectively and the minimum contribution intensity was 15 7 kg km2 9 6 kg km2 and 7 7 kg km2 respectively the subwatershed 4 12 9 had the largest contribution intensity fig 4 g i subwatershed 12 4 were located in the upstream of tributaries and closed to the source which made them have steep slope and large catchment area therefore the production of pollutants was large which directly leaded to their large contribution to the assessment point and became pmas subwatershed 9 were closer to the assessment point which made it easier for pollutants migrate to the assessment point and became pmas due to the downstream of the watershed has little effect on water quality improvement pmas are not identified in the downstream of the assessment point 4 discussions 4 1 advantage of the framework the traditional method to divide the pmas is the optimal catchment area identified based on the threshold recommended by dem and geographic information system therefore the identified of pmas are not conducive to the implementation of structural bmps by most studies because the scale of structural bmps generally do not exceed 1 km2 it can be seen from table 1 that if the watershed with area greater than 2000 km2 is divided into subwatersheds the area of the pmas is generally 46 380 km2 dong et al 2018 ou and wang 2008 ou and wang 2008 in this study the top pmas was re downscaled on the basis of traditional methods and considering the implementation of bmps a watershed of 2422 km2 was divided twice by the framework the area of the top pmas decreased from 254 km2 to 17 km2 and the maximum tp contribution intensity increased from 59 3 kg km2 to 84 3 kg km2 after the re downscaling the top pmas the area of the region with the tp contribution intensity greater 59 3 kg km2 was 107 km2 which was accounted for 4 44 of the whole watershed area fig 3 although some large watersheds can reach 1 20 km2 after divided into grid scale ding et al 2020 behera and panda 2006 the whole watershed is divided into grid scale greatly reduces the simulation efficiency the framework can improve the identification efficiency of pmas which is reflected in the increase of pollution contribution intensity by 29 66 and the increase of the area of pmas with the maximum pollution contribution intensity by 34 41 after re downscaling the key pollution source area the control area of nps becomes more dispersed the area of one region is smaller and the pollution contribution intensity is larger the identification of pmas concentrates the areas with serious nps pollution and the management based on pmas can greatly reduce the area of treatment ding et al 2020 dong et al 2018 liu et al 2016 niraula et al 2013 ou and wang 2008 ou and wang 2008 the framework can further reduce the nps management area compared with the first identified pmas the contribution rate of assessment point was taken as the reduction target when the reduction target is less than 54 73 the nps management area after re downscaling the pmas is smaller than that based on pmas especially when the reduction target is 38 00 the advantage of the framework is most obvious the reduced area accounts for 2 46 of the watershed area fig 5 when the reduction target is small only small area need to be treated the framework shows the advantages of concentrating nps in small areas as the increase of the reduction target the ranking bottom regions which has little nps pollution with large area need to be treated the advantage of framework was decreased 4 2 uncertainty of the framework the pmas identified in this paper are mainly located in the west many studies choose the daning river basin as the study area and the location of pmas is basically consistent between this study and other studies shen et al 2015 chen et al 2014 wang et al 2016 therefore the framework can accurately identify the pmas the factors affecting the identification of pmas include rainfall pollutant type identification method of pmas etc seo et al 2021 showed that as large amounts of rainfall occurred in the midstream and downstream area of the nakdong river the distribution of high ranking critical source areas csas are the same with rainfall chen et al 2014 showed that the area of tn pmas was 2 42 times that of tp pmas rudra et al 2020 showed that both simple index based methods and detailed hwq models to determine csas are limited in canadian conditions it is recommended to consider a variety of methods to identify csas ouyang et al 2008 took pollution load intensity as the evaluation indicator of pmas in this study when the pollution load intensity is greater than 40 kg km2 as the standard of pmas the nps management area is 777 km2 accounting for 32 08 of the whole watershed area chen et al 2014 took the contribution intensity of pollutants to key sections as the identification indicator of pmas to consider the reduction effect of rivers if the impact of assessment points is considered in this study pmas need the contribution of subwatersheds to the assessment points to be greater than 10 and the pollution load intensity is greater than 40 kg km2 the nps management area is reduced by 257 km2 accounting for 10 61 of the whole watershed the chemical and physical reactions of pollutants with other substances in the process of river migration will greatly reduce the load liu et al 2020 the reduced area is mainly affected by the distance from the assessment point it is suggested to increase the number of assessment points which can not only reduce the uncertainty of the framework but also can understand the interactions between multiple river points chen et al 2014 in order to effectively protect watershed with multiple water functional zones shen et al 2015 identified the pmas with the consideration of water quality if the impact of water quality is considered in this study regions with tp pollution index greater than 12 and pollution load intensity greater than 40 kg km2 can become pmas the nps management area is reduced by 461 km2 accounting for 19 03 of the whole watershed the reduced areas have relatively low water quality targets and they were not to be focused when the water quality target of the region is low it has greater water environmental capacity and it can accommodate more pollution maximum pollution load intensity changed from 38 8 kg km2 in dry years to 50 3 kg km2 in wet years maximum pollution contribution intensity changed from 27 6 kg km2 in dry years to 59 3 kg km2 in wet years the nps management area increased by 647 km2 from wet to normal and dry years without considering pmas identified by pollution index which accounts for 26 71 of the whole watershed area hydrological period has great influence on the occurrence and transmission of nps pollution cheng et al 2019 when rainfall increases it will wash more pesticides fertilizers dust and other pollutants into the river resulting in increased nps pollution however the maximum pollution index was 14 3 in dry and wet years without change although heavy rainfall led to heavy pollution loads the flow also increased which dilutes pollutants at a certain level and reduces their concentrations chang et al 2005 the management of pmas should be considered based on hydrological periods more cost is invested in nps treatment in wet year and the treatment can be reduced in the dry year wei et al 2017 compared with tp with light pollution tn with heavy pollution can get more reduction 3 of the area was treated can get 20 reduction of tp however if the water quality target at the assessment point is 0 5 mg l tn cannot meet the target even if 90 of the watershed is treated when the treatment goal is high only the top pmas treated cannot meet the requirements and the ranking bottom regions needed to be treated the pollution load of the ranking bottom regions is lower than the average level of the whole watershed so the efficiency of the framework is continuously reduced until the results of the framework treatment and the whole watershed management are the same giri et al 2012 it is suggested that the identified pmas with the most serious pollution and relatively large area should be implemented the framework again the reason is that after all subwatersheds are treated the top pmas still have large nps pollution compared with other subwatersheds 5 conclusions this study constructs a new framework for nps pollution management based on scale transformation the advantage and uncertainty of the framework were explored the maximum tp load intensity increased by 29 66 after the re downscaling of the top pmas the nps control area decreased after re downscaling the pmas especially 38 00 is set as the reduction target the reduced area accounts for 2 46 of the watershed area the uncertainty of the framework is mainly affected by water quality target assessment points and hydrological periods the consideration of water quality target and assessment point reduced the nps control area accounting for 19 03 and 10 61 of the watershed area from dry to wet years the increased nps control area accounts for 26 71 of the watershed area when the pmas is re downscaled the system error is caused due to the refinement of the river transmission process in some subwatersheds in future more precise data should be obtained through field research to reduce systematic errors in the implementation of the framework credit
