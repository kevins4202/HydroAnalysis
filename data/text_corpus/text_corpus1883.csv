determine the yield response factor ky of maize under drip irrigation with without biochar and inorganic fertilizer application ii determine if soil hydrophysical and chemical properties affect the response of maize to water stress under biochar and inorganic fertilizer applications and iii determine the possible mechanism by which biochar improves yield and water use efficiency of maize under deficit irrigation field experiments were carried out using a factorial design two rates of biochar application 0 and 20 t ha two levels of fertilizer 0 and 300 kg ha were adopted under three water management strategies 100 of full irrigation treatment fit 80 fit and 60 fit using drip irrigation the crop evapotranspiration was determined using the soil water budget method while the grain yields were measured at harvest soil samples were collected at harvest and analyzed for chemical and physical properties the relationship between maize yield soil properties and ky were determined using correlation analysis results from the study showed that the sensitivity of maize crops to water stress was greater than one 1 but reduced in soil treated with biochar compared to those without biochar ky under the unamended plot was 1 64 and reduced to 1 52 when applied with biochar ky was 1 45 in soil amended with only inorganic fertilizer and reduced to 1 27 when co applied with biochar biochar decreased water depletion by maize with the highest reduction in soil water depletion occurring in treatments that received the least water a significant p 0 05 correlation between ky and the soil

factor ky evaluates the relationship between yield and water ky is calculated based on the slope of the linear function between yield and water stress for the entire crop growth season or a particular

different levels and application timing abbasi et al 2013 berenguer et al 2009 gheysari et al 2009 however very few studies investigated the influence of sustainable soil amendments like biochar on ky biochar is a by product of pyrolysis thermal decomposition of an organic material in the absence of oxygen leading to the formation of liquid gases and solid material pandey 2009 the solid material is called biochar it is a highly reactive carbonaceous char oguntunde et al 2004 uzoma et al 2011 biochar is a charcoal like material that is composed of biomass it is frequently used to amend the soil and is advantageous to the environment in multiple dimensions it improves soil fertility protects water quality and improves carbon sequestration in soils brick 2010 several studies indicated that applying biochar to soil is favourable for forming water stable aggregate decreasing soil bulk density and increasing soil aeration laird et al 2010 moreover the application of the biochar could improve soil cation exchange capacity cec laird et al 2010 cause alteration in the base saturation influence soil ph van zwieten et al 2010 prevent leaching of soil nutrients to enhance the efficiency

soil lehmann et al 2011 based on the aforementioned beneficial impact of biochar in soils numerous studies have suggested an increased yield of crops when combined with inorganic fertilizer and water stress faloye et al 2017 recently researchers have found that soil water retention is increased by adding biochar to soil agbna et al 2017 consequently the addition would allow soils to retain more water from rain or irrigation increasing agricultural production in non irrigated and irrigated arid regions jeffery et al 2011 novak et al 2009a in comparison to treatments receiving a higher amount of water biochar has reportedly improved crop productivity under drought conditions and water use efficiency under di faloye et al 2019 hence there is a need to investigate the mechanism supporting the higher water use efficiency moreso there is a need to adopt a mechanistic approach by estimating ky to fully establish the relationship that exist between crop evapotranspiration and maize yield as influenced by biochar and inorganic fertilizer applications which has been scarcely investigated in addition the specific soil properties that could be related to the alteration of ky upon biochar addition must be investigated presently the combined impacts of biochar inorganic fertilizer on ky and water stress of maize under drip irrigation are poorly documented globally accordingly the objectives of the study were to i determine the influence of water stress biochar and inorganic fertilizer on the yield response factor ky for maize grown under drip irrigation ii determine the possible soil properties responsible for the alteration of ky upon biochar and inorganic fertilizer applications and iii determine the possible mechanism by which biochar improved crop yield and water use efficiency under deficit irrigation 1 1 theoretical background of the empirical approach empirically doorenbos and kassam 1979 fundamentally expressed yield and et deficits in relative terms which is based on maximum crop yield ymax actual crop yield yact and the observed corresponding crop evapotranspiration et the slope of the graph of the crop evapotranspiration and yield reductions represent the yield response factor ky the yield response factor ky is important for planning and operation of irrigation systems under deficit and fully irrigated scenarios thus evaluating the plant response to water the application of this empirical relationship between crop evapotranspiration and yield of crop has not been fully and extensively used in soil amended with biochar 2 materials and method we conducted field experiments at the teaching and research farm of the department of agricultural engineering federal university of technology akure during the dry seasons of 2017 february may

the wind speed were 0 51 and 0 40 ms 1 for 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons while the sum of the rainfall totals was 304 3 and 3 13 mm for the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons the rainfall distribution during the 2017 2018 growing seasons is as given in fig 1 below the reference evapotranspiration ranged between 3 6 and 3 8 mm day during the growing seasons the lower temperature observed during the 2017 2018 growing season is as a result of harmattan faloye et al 2019 at the beginning of the experiment samples of soil were initially collected at random locations around the site soil depth of 20 cm table 2 composite soil samples were formed by mixing them thoroughly and dividing them into sub samples particle size distributions of soil were determined using these soil samples the soil texture at the experimental site is classified as sandy clay loam soil survey staff 2006 the hydro physical properties of the site are illustrated in table 2 biomass procurement biochar production and characterization are described in our previous publications faloye et al 2019 2020 after the pyrolysis process the biochar was ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve so that biochar would have the same particle size as the soil texture in the experimental site table 3 presents the properties of the biochar used in this study the biochar properties were determined using international biochar initiative ibi approach 2 1 field experimentation field experimentations were carried out for two 2 consecutive dry seasons the field was conventionally tilled ploughed and harrowed before the commencement of each experiment thirty six seedbeds were formed in the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons respectively the size of each plot was 2 2 m wide and 2 5 m long before planting maize biochar was thoroughly mixed with the soil and incorporated into the top 0 15 m soil during the growing seasons biochar was mixed with the soil at two rates 0 and 20 t ha inorganic fertilizer npk was also applied at 0 and 300 kg ha 15 15 15 these factors biochar and inorganic fertilizer were combined with water applications at three levels 60 80 and 100 full irrigation treatment fit water was applied in the full irrigation treatment when about 50 of the field capacity soil water has been depleted the scheduling of the irrigation was achieved with the use of an installed tensiometer in the control plot the moisture content at tensiometer reading of 10kpa marcos et al 2009 was used as the field capacity irrigation water was applied at the rate of 4 3 mm h 1 irrigation water was applied at 100 fit until the soil field capacity had been attained to determine the irrigation time gross irrigation was divided by the emitter discharge rate therefore a total of 12 treatments were formed these treatments include the following 1 f0b01100 control 2 f0b0180 3 f0b0160 4 f0b201100 5 f0b20180 6 f0b20160 7 f300b01100 8 f300b0180 9 f300b0160 10 f300b201100 11 f300b20180 12 f300b20160 table 4 the variety of maize seeds zea mays l planted was suwan sr obtained from the international institute of tropical agriculture iita ibadan nigeria it is an improved variety the maize seeds were manually sown in holes at a spacing of 60 cm by 90 cm the plant population is within the recommended value of 37 000 in nigeria enujeke 2013 irrigation water from overhead tanks at 2 m was released to the field via the drip emitters before the commencement of the experiment irrigation was applied to all the experimental plots to aid maize germination subsequently irrigation was applied when about 10 mm of water had been depleted in the soil untreated with biochar fertilizer unamended the scheduling was based on the readings from tensiometers installed at the maize rooting depths soil moisture contents were determined gravimetrically in each plot bi weekly throughout the experiment and measured at the soil depth of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm for an accurate estimate of the crop water use the field crop evapotranspiration was estimated in each treatment using the following water balance eq 2 2 etc p i c d r δs where etc is actual crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is water applied by irrigation mm d is drainage deep percolation water mm deep percolation was assumed negligible since the experiment was carried out in dry season and the required amount of water was applied over irrigation that could lead to deep percolation avoided r is the runoff mm was determined from a runoff collector installed on the field as described in igbadun et al 2012 and δs is the change in soil water storage mm the capillary rise was assumed negligible since the soil depth of 0 60 cm considered in this study is far from the water table the soil water depletion was estimated as the difference between the moisture content at field capacity and soil moisture content at the time of measurement at maturity maize plants were hand harvested to determine the grain yield weight of the above ground biomass in replicating each treatment the total maize crop yield was the addition of the maize cobs grain stem and leaves crop water production functions the relationship between maize yield and evapotranspiration of maize was analyzed empirically stewart and hagan 1973 otarola et al 2020 the empirical models are of two types one relating crop yield to etc hiler and clark 1971 hanks 1974 stewart and hagan 1973 otarola et al 2020 eq 3 3 y f e t the other model enables the determination of the yield response factor eq 3 seasonal values of the yield response factor ky for the entire growing season were determined following the procedure described by doorenbos and kassam 1979 eq 4 4 1 y a c t y max k y 1 e t a c t e t max where ymax is the maximum yield obtained from treatment

and the unamended plots for the full and deficit irrigation to determine the yield response factor ky the water use efficiencies irrigation water use efficiency iwue and crop water use efficiency cwue were determined as the ratio of yield to irrigation water applied and the ratio of yield to the crop water use faloye et al 2019 2 2 soil laboratory analysis the standard method of laboratory analyses adopted in the experiment are itemized in table 5 for the selected soil fertility indices soil ph total nitrogen n available p available k cation exchange capacity cec 2 3 statistical analysis regression analysis between the crop evapotranspiration and maize yield was performed using excel version 2013 pearson correlation analysis was carried out to determine the relationship between soil properties as influenced by the soil amendments and yield response factor using minitab software version 17 0 3 results 3 1 influence of biochar and inorganic fertilizers on soil water depletion during irrigation the average soil moisture content measured during the growing seasons showed that biochar increased soil water content in soil depths ranging from 0 to 60 cm figs a1 and a2 supplementary data the soil water depletion regarding growth stages is depicted in figs 2 and 3 for the 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons during the 2017 growing season water depletion mainly was more during the vegetative stage than other stages of growth water depletion became severe as irrigation water decreased and was mainly highest in treatment treated with inorganic fertilizer a similar observation was observed in the 2018 growing season with water depletion becoming more severe as deficit irrigation increases also the addition of biochar mostly decreased water depletion in all the growth stages on average average of soil water depletion in both growing seasons when soil water depletion values obtained at f0b0 were compared to those obtained at f0b20 biochar application decreased soil water depletion by 9 62 7 67 and 4 88 in irrigation treatment of 100 60 and 40 fit respectively similarly when soil water depletion values obtained at f300b0 were compared to those obtained at f300b20 biochar application decreased soil water depletion by 13 96 11 97 and 10 37 in irrigation treatments of 100 60 and 40 fit respectively the highest reduction in soil water depletion by biochar mainly occurred in soil applied with inorganic fertilizer in addition during the 2017 2018 growing season soil water depletion mainly was highest at the flowering and maturity stages the maturity stage defines the period of grain infilling these stages are sensitive to the growth and productivity of the maize crop the differences in the soil water depletion values concerning the growth stages in the two growing seasons could be attributed to different weather scenarios as observed during the growing seasons for example the 2017 growing season was drier with little rainfall of 3 13 mm while the 2018 growing season was wetter with an average rainfall of 304 5 mm 3 2 yield water use of maize as influenced by the soil amendments the water use by the maize increased as inorganic fertilizer and biochar applications increased fig 4a and b and table 6 the highest crop water use crop evapotranspiration occurred in treatment where inorganic fertilizer and biochar were used together followed by treatment where biochar was applied the least crop water use and yield were recorded in the treatment where the least amount of water was received the total amount of water received at 60 80 and 100 fit were 376 8 401 and 425 1 mm for 2017 growing season while in 2017 2018 a total of 220 21 292 57 and 364 93 mm of water were received and recorded the relationship between the maize crop yield and water use was strong in all the treatments with the coefficient of determination r2 ranging between 0 78 and 0 87 the result of the relationship establishes the significant p 0 05 effect of crop water use on the maize yield in all treatment plots in the unamended plot for every 1 mm increase in crop evaporation maize crop yield increased by 0 049 0 052 0 057 and 0 061 t ha in treatments f0b0 f0b20 f300b0 and f300b20 respectively the positive slope was obtained in the relationship between evapotranspiration and maize crop yield increased in the order f0b0 f0b20 f300b0 f300b20 a significant linear relationship exists between the yield of maize and water use across all treatments fig 5a d the irrigation and crop water use efficiency results are presented as supplementary data tables a1 and a2 the highest irrigation and crop water use efficiencies were recorded mostly in treatment that received the least water particularly where biochar and inorganic fertilizer were co applied 3 3 yield response factor of maize as influenced by biochar and inorganic fertilizer combined yield and evapotranspiration data from both 2017 and 2017 2018 for the determination of maize yield reduction versus evapotranspiration of maize reduction showed that biochar decreased yield response factor ky in both unamended f0b0 and inorganic fertilizer amended plot f300b0 the ky values obtained for f0b0 f0b20 f300b0 and f300b20 were 1 64 1 52 1 45 and 1 27 respectively fig 6a d the result showed that compared to f0b0 biochar application reduced the yield response factor by 7 32 in the f0b20 treatment plot similarly in the inorganic fertilized plot f300b0 biochar application reduced ky by 13 10 in this study the ky values consistently decreased from f0b0 to f0b20 and from f300b0 to f300b20 when the yield evapotranspiration data were combined the result therefore indicates that increased biochar application amounts led to a greater sensitivity of maize yield to water stress 3 4 soil hydrophysical and chemical properties and their correlation with the yield response factor the soil physico chemical properties tables a3 supplementary data were higher in soil co applied with biochar and inorganic fertilizer compared to the unamended plots and soil individually treated with inorganic fertilizer the correlation table 7 showed that the soil s chemical properties correlated significantly with the yield response of maize to water stress the negative correlation between the soil chemical properties and the yield response factor implies that as the soil chemical properties potassium nitrogen and phosphorus increase the yield response of maize crops to water stress decreases or reduces the insignificant p 0 05 correlation between the soil hydrophysical properties moisture content and organic matter showed that they have minimal effects on the yield response factor of maize when biochar and inorganic fertilizer are applied 4 discussion several researchers agbna et al 2017 faloye et al 2019 have investigated and reported the most decisive influence of biochar on the water use efficiency of different crops in treatment receiving the least or medium amount of water but these studies attributed the overall improvement to increased water and nutrient retention without separately investigating the mechanism or why the highest value of water use efficiency is obtained in the treatment receiving the least or medium amount of water according to this study soil water depletion reduces as the water stress imposed increases in the amended biochar soil compared to the untreated treatment soil this outcome emphasizes the effectiveness and efficacy of biochar in drought prone areas and its choice for effective usefulness in the climate change scenario to combat climate change s effect on crops this is because biochar is expected to enhance the water use efficiency of crops in extreme water scenarios as evidenced in this work since the highest water use efficiency is obtained in treatment receiving the least amount of water generally the sensitivity of the maize crop to water stress which has been evaluated by estimating the maize response factor ky for the entire period of growth slightly differs from the conclusion of allen et al 1998 who reported a value of 1 51 the ky values obtained in this study is also significantly lower and close to the value of 2 15 and 1 56 reported by andrioli and sentelhas 2009 for maize of different genotypes these researchers argued that the ky of maize is highly dependent on genotype the value of ky reported here in all treatments is also lower than the value of 1 90 reported by igbadun et al 2012 in a research conducted in the northern part of nigeria some researchers dehghanisanij et al 2009 kiziloglu et al 2009 also reported that ky values are growth stages dependent in an instance dehghanisanij et al 2009 showed that when the water stress occurred in the flowering stage ky values between 1 03 and 1 46 were reported these ranges are consistent with those reported in our study similarly to dehghanisanij et al 2009 we observed more pronounced water depletions during our study s vegetative and flowering stages in this study applying inorganic fertilizer resulted in a high leaf area and root architecture or structure faloye et al 2019 the high value of leaf area increased and intensified the requirement for more water for transpiration therefore the amount of biomass increased in the treatment that received inorganic fertilizer as a result of the need to meet the transpiration demands soil treated with inorganic fertilizer became more sensitive to water stress which was reduced by biochar application the need to develop strategies that would increase crop evapotranspiration to improve crop yield was evident in this study a significant and positive slope was observed in the relationship between maize yield and crop evapotranspiration upon biochar addition gheysari et al 2015 observed a similar observation the study investigated the influence of crop evapotranspiration on maize yield across soil treated with nitrogen in general the variation in ky values mentioned above may depend on the severity of water stress imposed on the crop maize genotype root development climatic conditions structure architecture and soil distributions furthermore this may depend on the soil management practice as evidenced in this study the reduction in sensitivity of maize crop to water stress in soil treated with co application of inorganic fertilizer and biochar f300b20 compared to those applied with only inorganic fertilizer f300b0 is attributable to the reduction in soil water depletion a similar reduction in ky value was observed when the ky value recorded in f0b20 was compared to f0b0 this reduction can also be explained by a decrease in water depletion upon biochar addition overall gencoglan and yazar 1999 also reported similar ky values recorded in this study 1 08 1 61 the higher crop response factor values obtained at f300b0 and f0b0 compared to f300b20 and f0b20 respectively indicate low moisture stress resistance or severe moisture stresses of the maize crop in the former treatments igbadun et al 2008 therefore since the ky obtained for maize crop grown in this study is greater than 1 ky 1 this means that maize yield loss is of more significance than crop evapotranspiration et deficit for the whole growing season of growth the ky values greater than one 1 showed that the relative yield decrease for a given et deficit is proportionately greater than the relative decrease in et doorenbos and kassam 1979 kirda et al 1999 the loss in the maize yield which is critical under the varying water applications was reduced by the biochar application primarily due to biochar s capacity to maintain soil nutrients major et al 2010 mete et al 2015 the soil s chemical properties notably the nitrogen phosphorus and potassium were negatively correlated with the yield response factor ky this implies as the chemical properties were increasing ky was reducing their significant effect explains the profound influence of the chemical properties on ky depicting the major role they played in lowering the ky of maize in soil amended with biochar high coefficient of correlation of the soil nutrients with the ky values showed that soil nutrients are essential factors to be considered in determining or predicting ky of maize in soil amended with biochar therefore the knowledge of maize sensitivity to water stress over a growing season or during a specific growth stage has to be widely considered in studies where the objective is to develop deficit irrigation strategies to combat climate change effect on crops or drought prone areas by applying biochar furthermore as investigated in this study these functions must be determined for at least two 2 years to consider the effects of varying climatic conditions in a particular region 5 conclusion this work focused on the response of maize yield to water stress under varying soil management with the application of inorganic fertilizer and biochar here we have shown from the empirical relationship between maize yield and crop evapotranspiration that biochar reduced the response of maize to water stress which was achieved by soil nutrient retention by biochar moreso biochar reduced the amount of water depletion under deficit irrigation di to record the highest water use efficiency in soil receiving the least or medium amount of water this is particularly crucial in regions where water is severely limiting or under changing climate globally affecting crop productivity therefore in this study we have demonstrated the need to develop strategies like biochar application in which crop evapotranspiration is improved and consequently increases crop yield declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a supporting information supplementary data associated

the wind speed were 0 51 and 0 40 ms 1 for 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons while the sum of the rainfall totals was 304 3 and 3 13 mm for the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons the rainfall distribution during the 2017 2018 growing seasons is as given in fig 1 below the reference evapotranspiration ranged between 3 6 and 3 8 mm day during the growing seasons the lower temperature observed during the 2017 2018 growing season is as a result of harmattan faloye et al 2019 at the beginning of the experiment samples of soil were initially collected at random locations around the site soil depth of 20 cm table 2 composite soil samples were formed by mixing them thoroughly and dividing them into sub samples particle size distributions of soil were determined using these soil samples the soil texture at the experimental site is classified as sandy clay loam soil survey staff 2006 the hydro physical properties of the site are illustrated in table 2 biomass procurement biochar production and characterization are described in our previous publications faloye et al 2019 2020 after the pyrolysis process the biochar was ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve so that biochar would have the same particle size as the soil texture in the experimental site table 3 presents the properties of the biochar used in this study the biochar properties were determined using international biochar initiative ibi approach 2 1 field experimentation field experimentations were carried out for two 2 consecutive dry seasons the field was conventionally tilled ploughed and harrowed before the commencement of each experiment thirty six seedbeds were formed in the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons respectively the size of each plot was 2 2 m wide and 2 5 m long before planting maize biochar was thoroughly mixed with the soil and incorporated into the top 0 15 m soil during the growing seasons biochar was mixed with the soil at two rates 0 and 20 t ha inorganic fertilizer npk was also applied at 0 and 300 kg ha 15 15 15 these factors biochar and inorganic fertilizer were combined with water applications at three levels 60 80 and 100 full irrigation treatment fit water was applied in the full irrigation treatment when about 50 of the field capacity soil water has been depleted the scheduling of the irrigation was achieved with the use of an installed tensiometer in the control plot the moisture content at tensiometer reading of 10kpa marcos et al 2009 was used as the field capacity irrigation water was applied at the rate of 4 3 mm h 1 irrigation water was applied at 100 fit until the soil field capacity had been attained to determine the irrigation time gross irrigation was divided by the emitter discharge rate therefore a total of 12 treatments were formed these treatments include the following 1 f0b01100 control 2 f0b0180 3 f0b0160 4 f0b201100 5 f0b20180 6 f0b20160 7 f300b01100 8 f300b0180 9 f300b0160 10 f300b201100 11 f300b20180 12 f300b20160 table 4 the variety of maize seeds zea mays l planted was suwan sr obtained from the international institute of tropical agriculture iita ibadan nigeria it is an improved variety the maize seeds were manually sown in holes at a spacing of 60 cm by 90 cm the plant population is within the recommended value of 37 000 in nigeria enujeke 2013 irrigation water from overhead tanks at 2 m was released to the field via the drip emitters before the commencement of the experiment irrigation was applied to all the experimental plots to aid maize germination subsequently irrigation was applied when about 10 mm of water had been depleted in the soil untreated with biochar fertilizer unamended the scheduling was based on the readings from tensiometers installed at the maize rooting depths soil moisture contents were determined gravimetrically in each plot bi weekly throughout the experiment and measured at the soil depth of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm for an accurate estimate of the crop water use the field crop evapotranspiration was estimated in each treatment using the following water balance eq 2 2 etc p i c d r δs where etc is actual crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is water applied by irrigation mm d is drainage deep percolation water mm deep percolation was assumed negligible since the experiment was carried out in dry season and the required amount of water was applied over irrigation that could lead to deep percolation avoided r is the runoff mm was determined from a runoff collector installed on the field as described in igbadun et al 2012 and δs is the change in soil water storage mm the capillary rise was assumed negligible since the soil depth of 0 60 cm considered in this study is far from the water table the soil water depletion was estimated as the difference between the moisture content at field capacity and soil moisture content at the time of measurement at maturity maize plants were hand harvested to determine the grain yield weight of the above ground biomass in replicating each treatment the total maize crop yield was the addition of the maize cobs grain stem and leaves crop water production functions the relationship between maize yield and evapotranspiration of maize was analyzed empirically stewart and hagan 1973 otarola et al 2020 the empirical models are of two types one relating crop yield to etc hiler and clark 1971 hanks 1974 stewart and hagan 1973 otarola et al 2020 eq 3 3 y f e t the other model enables the determination of the yield response factor eq 3 seasonal values of the yield response factor ky for the entire growing season were determined following the procedure described by doorenbos and kassam 1979 eq 4 4 1 y a c t y max k y 1 e t a c t e t max where ymax is the maximum yield obtained from treatment

and the unamended plots for the full and deficit irrigation to determine the yield response factor ky the water use efficiencies irrigation water use efficiency iwue and crop water use efficiency cwue were determined as the ratio of yield to irrigation water applied and the ratio of yield to the crop water use faloye et al 2019 2 2 soil laboratory analysis the standard method of laboratory analyses

regression analysis between the crop evapotranspiration and maize yield was performed using excel version 2013 pearson correlation analysis was carried out to determine the relationship between soil properties as influenced by the soil amendments and yield response factor using minitab software version 17 0 3 results 3 1 influence of biochar and inorganic fertilizers on soil water depletion during irrigation the average soil moisture content measured during the growing seasons showed that biochar increased soil water content in soil depths ranging from 0 to 60 cm figs a1 and a2 supplementary data the soil water depletion regarding growth stages is depicted in figs 2 and 3 for the 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons during the 2017 growing season water depletion mainly was more during the vegetative stage than other stages of growth water depletion became severe as irrigation water decreased and was mainly highest in treatment treated with inorganic fertilizer a similar observation was observed in the 2018 growing season with water depletion becoming more severe as deficit irrigation increases also the addition of biochar mostly decreased water depletion in all the growth stages on average average of soil water depletion in both growing seasons when soil water depletion values obtained at f0b0 were compared to those obtained at f0b20 biochar application decreased soil water depletion by 9 62 7 67 and 4 88 in irrigation treatment of 100 60 and 40 fit respectively similarly when soil water depletion values obtained at f300b0 were compared to those obtained at f300b20 biochar application decreased soil water depletion by 13 96 11 97 and 10 37 in irrigation treatments of 100 60 and 40 fit respectively the highest reduction in soil water depletion by biochar mainly occurred in soil applied with inorganic fertilizer in addition during the 2017 2018 growing season soil water depletion mainly was highest at the flowering and maturity stages the maturity stage defines the period of grain infilling these stages are sensitive to the growth and productivity of the maize crop the differences in the soil water depletion values concerning the growth stages in the two growing seasons could be attributed to different weather scenarios as observed during the growing seasons for example the 2017 growing season was drier with little rainfall of 3 13 mm while the 2018 growing season was wetter with an average rainfall of 304 5 mm 3 2 yield water use of maize as influenced by the soil amendments the water use by the maize increased as inorganic fertilizer and biochar applications increased fig 4a and b and table 6 the highest crop water use crop evapotranspiration occurred in treatment where inorganic fertilizer and biochar were used together followed by treatment where biochar was applied the least crop water use and yield were recorded in the treatment where the least amount of water was received the total amount of water received at 60 80 and 100 fit were 376 8 401 and 425 1 mm for 2017 growing season while in 2017 2018 a total of 220 21 292 57 and 364 93 mm of water were received and recorded the relationship between the maize crop yield and water use was strong in all the treatments with the coefficient of determination r2 ranging between 0 78 and 0 87 the result of the relationship establishes the significant p 0 05 effect of crop water use on the maize yield in all treatment plots in the unamended plot for every 1 mm increase in crop evaporation maize crop yield increased by 0 049 0 052 0 057 and 0 061 t ha in treatments f0b0 f0b20 f300b0 and f300b20 respectively the positive slope was obtained in the relationship between evapotranspiration and maize crop yield increased in the order f0b0 f0b20 f300b0 f300b20 a significant linear relationship exists between the yield of maize and water use across all treatments fig 5a d the irrigation and crop water use efficiency results are presented as supplementary data tables a1 and a2 the highest irrigation and crop water use efficiencies were recorded mostly in treatment that received the least water particularly where biochar and inorganic fertilizer were co applied 3 3 yield response factor of maize as influenced by biochar and inorganic fertilizer combined yield and evapotranspiration data from both 2017 and 2017 2018 for the determination of maize yield reduction versus evapotranspiration of maize reduction showed that biochar decreased yield response factor ky in both unamended f0b0 and inorganic fertilizer amended plot f300b0 the ky values obtained for f0b0 f0b20 f300b0 and f300b20 were 1 64 1 52 1 45 and 1 27 respectively fig 6a d the result showed that compared to f0b0 biochar application reduced the yield response factor by 7 32 in the f0b20 treatment plot similarly in the inorganic fertilized plot f300b0 biochar application reduced ky by 13 10 in this study the ky values consistently decreased from f0b0 to f0b20 and from f300b0 to f300b20 when the yield evapotranspiration data were combined the result therefore indicates that increased biochar application amounts led to a greater sensitivity of maize yield to water stress 3 4 soil hydrophysical and chemical properties and their correlation with the yield response factor the soil physico chemical properties tables a3 supplementary data were higher in soil co applied with biochar and inorganic fertilizer compared to the unamended plots and soil individually treated with inorganic fertilizer the correlation table 7 showed that the soil s chemical properties correlated significantly with the yield response of maize to water stress the negative correlation between the soil chemical properties and the yield response factor implies that as the soil chemical properties potassium nitrogen and phosphorus increase the yield response of maize crops to water stress decreases or reduces the insignificant p 0 05 correlation between the soil hydrophysical properties moisture content and organic matter showed that they have minimal effects on the yield response factor of maize when biochar and inorganic fertilizer are applied 4 discussion several researchers agbna et al 2017 faloye et al 2019 have investigated and reported the most decisive influence of biochar on the water use efficiency of different crops in treatment receiving the least or medium amount of water but these studies attributed the overall improvement to increased water and nutrient retention without separately investigating the mechanism or why the highest value of water use efficiency is obtained in the treatment receiving the least or medium amount of water according to this study soil water depletion reduces as the water stress imposed increases in the amended biochar soil compared to the untreated treatment soil this outcome emphasizes the effectiveness and efficacy of biochar in drought prone areas and its choice for effective usefulness in the climate change scenario to combat climate change s effect on crops this is because biochar is expected to enhance the water use efficiency of crops in extreme water scenarios as evidenced in this work since the highest water use efficiency is obtained in treatment receiving the least amount of water generally the sensitivity of the maize crop to water stress which has been evaluated by estimating the maize response factor ky for the entire period of growth slightly differs from the conclusion of allen et al 1998 who reported a value of 1 51 the ky values obtained in this study is also significantly lower and close to the value of 2 15 and 1 56 reported by andrioli and sentelhas 2009 for maize of different genotypes these researchers argued that the ky of maize is highly dependent on genotype the value of ky reported here in all treatments is also lower than the value of 1 90 reported by igbadun et al 2012 in a research conducted in the northern part of nigeria some researchers dehghanisanij et al 2009 kiziloglu et al 2009 also reported that ky values are growth stages dependent in an instance dehghanisanij et al 2009 showed that when the water stress occurred in the flowering stage ky values between 1 03 and 1 46 were reported these ranges are consistent with those reported in our study similarly to dehghanisanij et al 2009 we observed more pronounced water depletions during our study s vegetative and flowering stages in this study applying inorganic fertilizer resulted in a high leaf area and root architecture or structure faloye et al 2019 the high value of leaf area increased and intensified the requirement for more water for transpiration therefore the amount of biomass increased in the treatment that received inorganic fertilizer as a result of the need to meet the transpiration demands soil treated with inorganic fertilizer became more sensitive to water stress which was reduced by biochar application the need to develop strategies that would increase crop evapotranspiration to improve crop yield was evident in this study a significant and positive slope was observed in the relationship between maize yield and crop evapotranspiration upon biochar addition gheysari et al 2015 observed a similar observation the study investigated the influence of crop evapotranspiration on maize yield across soil treated with nitrogen in general the variation in ky values mentioned above may depend on the severity of water stress imposed on the crop maize genotype root development climatic conditions structure architecture and soil distributions furthermore this may depend on the soil management practice as evidenced in this study the reduction in sensitivity of maize crop to water stress in soil treated with co application of inorganic fertilizer and biochar f300b20 compared to those applied with only inorganic fertilizer f300b0 is attributable to the reduction in soil water depletion a similar reduction in ky value was observed when the ky value recorded in f0b20 was compared to f0b0 this reduction can also be explained by a decrease in water depletion upon biochar addition overall gencoglan and yazar 1999 also reported similar ky values recorded in this study 1 08 1 61 the higher crop response factor values obtained at f300b0 and f0b0 compared to f300b20 and f0b20 respectively indicate low moisture stress resistance or severe moisture stresses of the maize crop in the former treatments igbadun et al 2008 therefore since the ky obtained for maize crop grown in this study is greater than 1 ky 1 this means that maize yield loss is of more significance than crop evapotranspiration et deficit for the whole growing season of growth the ky values greater than one 1 showed that the relative yield decrease for a given et deficit is proportionately greater than the relative decrease in et doorenbos and kassam 1979 kirda et al 1999 the loss in the maize yield which is critical under the varying water applications was reduced by the biochar application primarily due to biochar s capacity to maintain soil nutrients major et al 2010 mete et al 2015 the soil s chemical properties notably the nitrogen phosphorus and potassium were negatively correlated with the yield response factor ky this implies as the chemical properties were increasing ky was reducing their significant effect explains the profound influence of the chemical properties on ky depicting the major role they played in lowering the ky of maize in soil amended with biochar high coefficient of correlation of the soil nutrients with the ky values showed that soil nutrients are essential factors to be considered in determining or predicting ky of maize in soil amended with biochar therefore the knowledge of maize sensitivity to water stress over a growing season or during a specific growth stage has to be widely considered in studies where the objective is to develop deficit irrigation strategies to combat climate change effect on crops or drought prone areas by applying biochar furthermore as investigated in this study these functions must be determined for at least two 2 years to consider the effects of varying climatic conditions in a particular region 5 conclusion this work focused on the response of maize yield to water stress under varying soil management with the application of inorganic fertilizer and biochar here we have shown from the empirical relationship between maize yield and crop evapotranspiration that biochar reduced the response of maize to water stress which was achieved by soil nutrient retention by biochar moreso biochar reduced the amount of water depletion under deficit irrigation di to record the highest water use efficiency in soil receiving the least or medium amount of water this is particularly crucial in regions where water is severely limiting or under changing climate globally affecting crop productivity therefore in this study we have demonstrated the need to develop strategies like biochar application in which crop evapotranspiration is improved and consequently increases crop yield declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a supporting information supplementary data associated

9416,environmental risk assessment of impacts due to agricultural subsurface drainage practices can benefit from information on drainage system outlet locations along ditches and streams unmanned aerial vehicle uav thermal infrared tir surveys may provide a means through thermal response recognition to map these subsurface drainage system pipe outlets consequently the objective of this research was to provide a preliminary feasibility assessment on the applicability of uav tir imagery for locating these drainage system outlets drainage outlet detection with uav tir surveys was tested at five sites in ohio u s a with a range of waterway sizes from drainage ditch to small and larger streams there were four key findings from this preliminary study 1 the uav tir surveys detected the ditch stream water thermal responses associated with drainage system pipe outlets at both a drainage ditch and a small stream this thermal response is characterized by a ditch stream water change in apparent radiant temperature t rad from upgradient of the outlet to downgradient of the outlet 2 as shown by one example in this study the outlet thermal response in cold winter months when detectable is likely the reverse of that obtained during warmer periods of the year 3 the detected thermal response is rather subtle exhibiting around a 1 c ditch stream water t rad change from upgradient of the outlet to downgradient of the outlet 4 the uav tir surveys did not detect thermal responses associated with drainage system pipe outlets at three sites with larger sized streams since other factors in drainage ditches and streams may produce water t rad variations that are of the same magnitude of a drainage system pipe outlet thermal response the use of uav tir imagery as a means to map drainage system outlet locations might not be completely practical however more investigation is certainly warranted keywords agricultural subsurface drainage systems drainage outlet mapping unmanned aerial vehicles uavs thermal infrared tir imagery 1 introduction the widespread adoption of subsurface drainage practices to remove excess soil water has enabled the midwest u s a to become one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world a 1985 economic survey showed that several states within this region illinois indiana iowa ohio minnesota michigan missouri and wisconsin had by that year approximately 12 5 million ha containing subsurface drainage systems with cropland accounting for the vast majority of areas having buried drainage pipes pavelis 1987 in more recent years a substantial amount of additional agricultural drainage pipe has been installed in the midwest u s a valayamkunnath et al 2020 although these agricultural subsurface drainage systems provide farmers an economic benefit through increased crop yields they also have adverse environmental consequences subsurface drainage practices can release substantial amounts of nitrate no3 and dissolved reactive phosphorous drp from farm fields into adjacent waterways daigh et al 2015 sims et al 1998 this subsurface drainage discharge of no3 and drp in turn causes degradation of surface water bodies at local regional and national scales in particular no3 and drp release from agricultural subsurface drainage systems are a leading cause of the hypoxic zone in the gulf of mexico and eutrophication of waterbodies in the midwest u s a where in all cases there is a substantial negative impact on aquatic life hoorman et al 2008 scavia and donnelly 2007 risk assessment of this environmental concern particularly from a watershed perspective calls for knowledge of which farm fields have these drainage systems and the characteristics of each drainage system i e drain line pattern spacing distance between drain lines drainage pipe depth etc risk assessment can be further improved with information regarding geographic coordinates of the drainage system pipe outlets in local waterways due to economic and environmental considerations farm field drainage maps are certainly needed drainage system design construction records are however usually unavailable and the current methods of finding drainage pipe i e tile probes and trenching equipment tend to be tedious time consuming and cause damage so there is a definite demand for effective efficient and nondestructive drainage pipe detection methods consequently over the past twenty years a substantial amount of research has focused on using proximal and remote sensing technologies for mapping farm field subsurface drainage systems ground penetrating radar gpr a proximal soil sensing method has proven capable in many instances of locating buried drainage pipes under a range of soil conditions allred et al 2004 2005 2018a allred and redman 2010 allred 2013 koganti et al 2020 koganti et al 2021 however gpr is somewhat inefficient for providing detailed maps of subsurface drainage systems in large farm fields recent studies have shown remote sensing technologies especially imagery obtained by manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs are capable of mapping subsurface drainage systems in large farm fields allred et al 2018b 2020 2021 freeland et al 2019 koganti et al 2021 kratt et al 2020 tlapáková et al 2017 williamson et al 2019 in the study by allred et al 2020 uav surveys with visible color vis c multispectral ms and thermal infrared tir cameras were carried out at 29 farm fields across the midwest u s a and overall results showed that vis c ms and tir imagery detected at least some of the drainage pipe present at 48 59 and 69 of the sites respectively additional investigation by those conducting research on this topic will eventually lead to development of site condition i e soil texture time of day year wetness dryness surface characteristics etc and equipment multirotor vs fixed wing uavs camera type etc based guidelines as to when and where uav surveys can be successfully deployed to map farm field subsurface drainage systems as previously mentioned watershed scale assessment of environmental risks associated with agricultural drainage practices would benefit not only from farm field subsurface drainage system maps across the watershed but also from information regarding drainage system pipe outlet locations where subsurface drainage waters are discharged into watershed ditches and streams locations of drainage system pipe outlets in ditches and streams are at present typically undocumented so methods are needed for mapping pipe outlet geographic coordinates thermal variations in ditch and stream waters may provide an indication of these pipe outlet locations the soil temperature at drainage pipe depths 1 m and in turn drainage water discharge temperatures tend to be more moderated having far less daily and seasonal variability than the air temperature above the ground surface hillel 1980 zajíĉek et al 2011 while drainage water discharge temperatures are likely to be most influenced by the soil temperature at 1 m depth the temperature of water resident in a ditch or stream channel is strongly impacted by both air temperature and direct solar radiation caissie 2006 consequently water temperature in a ditch or stream directly upgradient of a drainage system pipe outlet may be different than the ditch or stream water temperature adjacent and directly downgradient of the outlet whether the ditch or stream water temperature upgradient of the outlet is greater or less than the water temperature adjacent and directly downgradient to the outlet will depend largely on time of year and or weather patterns during previous days weeks the downgradient extent of this water temperature response i e abrupt change in ditch or stream water temperature adjacent to pipe outlet might even provide some insight on the subsurface drainage discharge magnitude at a pipe outlet channel location relative to the overall ditch stream flow the ditch or stream water temperature response associated with a subsurface drainage system outlet can potentially be detected with a radiometric thermal infrared camera a radiometric thermal infrared camera measures apparent radiant temperature t rad k which is a function of emissivity dimensionless and true kinetic temperature t kin k as expressed by the following equation kuenzer and dech 2013 1 t rad ε 0 25 t kin consequently deploying uavs with radiometric thermal infrared cameras to fly ditch or stream corridors may be a viable means for mapping subsurface drainage system outlets a number of studies have used tir imagery to detect locations of groundwater discharge i e springs entering a waterway briggs et al 2013 deitchman and loheide 2009 prinds et al 2019 demonstrated the utility of uav thermal infrared tir imagery for mapping subsurface drainage pipe outlets in denmark in this study the pipe outlets were located well upslope 10 s of meters away from a stream channel with discharge water flowing over the ground surface downwards to the stream this situation is different from the typical approach in the midwest u s a where the subsurface drainage outlets are located in the channel bank and water discharged directly into the ditch or stream further research is therefore warranted on uav tir drainage outlet mapping under conditions common to the midwest u s a consequently based on an objective to provide preliminary feasibility assessment on applicability of uav tir imagery for locating drainage system outlets under conditions common to the midwest u s a a study was initiated at five sites in ohio u s a the best times of year to conduct such a uav survey in the midwest u s a and great lakes region is likely during spring when subsurface drainage outflows are greatest brouder et al 2005 macrae et al 2007 accordingly the uav tir surveys for this research were carried out in the months from late winter to early summer i e late february through early july in the years of 2020 and 2021 this project s research hypothesis can be stated as follows subsurface drainage system pipe outlets in ditches and streams of the midwest u s a can be successfully mapped with uav tir imagery 2 materials and methods 2 1 uav equipment and image data processing this research used much the same unmanned aerial vehicle uav equipment and data processing procedures as described by allred et al 2020 2021 a sensefly sa cheseaux sur lausanne switzerland ebee plus rtk ppk fixed wing drone with s o d a and thermomap cameras was employed to carry out the uav surveys for this study the uav and s o d a camera combination had real time kinematic rtk global navigation satellite system gnss functionality and was used to obtain positionally accurate high resolution visible color vis c images the uav surveys conducted with the s o d a camera were flown approximately 54 64 m 180 210 ft above the ground which provided an image resolution of 1 3 1 5 cm px 0 5 0 6 in px the thermal infrared tir uav surveys were carried out with a sensefly sa thermomap radiometric camera which captured images in a wavelength range of 8 5 11 5 µm 10 µm center wavelength the thermomap camera has an apparent radiant temperature t rad resolution of 0 1 c the uav surveys with the thermomap camera were flown approximately 49 64 m 160 210 ft above the ground surface with a resolution of 9 1 11 9 cm px 3 6 4 7 in px the s o d a imagery was utilized to improve positional accuracy of the thermomap imagery pix4d sa prilly switzerland software pix4dmapper pro was employed for initial data processing particularly stitching together of the individual overlapping camera images obtained during a uav survey the end product of this stitching process was a set of vis c and tir georeferenced orthomosaic image maps of the site area over which the uav surveys were flown for the tir imagery based on using an emissivity of 1 0 pix4dmapper pro also converted absolute temperature represented by pixel brightness to t rad in celsius by the following relationship 2 temperature in c pixel brightness value 100 100 orthomosaic maps were then post processed using arcmap 10 2 desktop software environmental systems research institute redlands california u s a where annotations were added and the image then saved in a manageable format size further processing was accomplished using the public access gnu image manipulation program gimp 2 10 10 image editor which allowed for adjustment and enhancement of exposure sharpness size and resolution of the orthomosaic maps the vis c orthomosaic maps are a stitched color image of the site as would be seen from above with the human eye with respect to the stitched tir imagery blue to red color scale orthomosaic maps were generated in which blue colors represent lower t rad values and red colors represent higher t rad values 2 2 ground based vis c and tir cameras beginning in 2021 hand held cameras were employed to acquire ground level vis c and tir photos concurrently with each uav tir survey these photos were obtained for the purpose of documenting close up the conditions of the subsurface drainage system pipe outlet and adjacent ditch stream a canon inc tokyo japan powershot sx280 hs digital camera was used for the ground level vis c photos a perfectprime hong kong china ir0005 thermal imaging camera with emissivity set at 1 0 was used for the ground level tir photos for this study these tir photos are presented as a blue to red color scale images with blue colors indicating low values of t rad while red colors indicating high t rad values 2 3 site information the uav surveys for this research were carried out in 2020 and 2021 only in the months from late winter to early summer when subsurface drainage system outflows were expected to be greatest aerial images of the sites are provided in fig 1 the aerial images of sites 1 3 4 and 5 fig 1a 1c 1d and 1e respectively are orthomosaics generated from the uav s o d a vis c surveys a stitched orthomosaic could not be generated from the site 2 uav s o d a vis c survey so the fig 1b aerial image of site 2

sized is somewhat arbitrary and based on water surface width values provided in table 1 as indicated by the table 1 water surface width values flow volume on days of the uav surveys were much less for the site1 small stream and site 2 drainage ditch as compared to the moderate or large sized streams at sites 3 4 and 5 3 results and discussion results from site 1 on may 10 2021 are depicted in fig 2 there had been substantial site rainfall in the week prior 5 cm see table 1 fig 2a is a ground level color photo taken at the top of the north bank of ackerman run just east of the subsurface drainage system pipe outlet view is to the west ackerman run is considered a small waterway based on average water surface width measurements 0 76 0 93 m see table 1 the stream flow direction in fig 2a is indicated by the pointed white dashed lines fig 2a shows that there was a substantial amount of water discharged from the pipe outlet into the stream on may 10 2021 fig 2b is a ground level thermal infrared tir photo taken close to the same position and time as the fig 2a color photo at the top of the north bank of ackerman run just east of the pipe outlet view is to the west blue colors in the fig 2b tir photo indicate lower values of apparent radiant temperature t rad while red colors represent higher t rad values the stream flow direction in fig 2b as with fig 2a is indicated by the pointed white dashed lines fig 2b in conjunction with fig 2a provides ground level confirmation of a stream water thermal response associated with discharge from the pipe outlet as shown in fig 2b the colder drainage outlet discharge dark blue in color flows down a gully and into the stream channel to mix with water already in the stream upgradient of the point where the drainage discharge enters the channel the stream water is somewhat warmer lighter blue color than the stream water downgradient of this point darker blue color at the same time during the day the unmanned aerial vehicle uav tir survey likewise detected this stream water thermal response i e change from warmer stream water upgradient of outlet to colder water downgradient the full orthomosaic map from this uav tir survey covering a large reach of ackermann run is shown in fig 2c again by convention blue colors in fig 2c indicate lower t rad values while red colors represent higher t rad values the drainage pipe outlet is located along the stream segment within the black bars depicted in fig 2c and an enlargement of the tir orthomosaic for this stream segment is shown in fig 2d the pointed dashed black line in fig 2d indicates steam flow direction generally west to east based on the tir orthomosaic color scale the fig 2d stream water t rad just upgradient of the outlet is a little warmer somewhat lighter blue than the stream water downgradient of the outlet somewhat darker blue which is emphasized by the further enlarged fig 2d inset image with outlet location indicated by black dot near the arrowhead tip the actual stream water t rad values provided in fig 2d further confirm the uav measured thermal response associated with the pipe outlet the t rad of the drainage discharge as it pours into the small channel bank gully is 14 93 c where the drainage discharge enters the channel and mixes in with the stream the stream water t rad is 15 54 c upgradient in the stream from this point t rad values are warmer 16 79 16 85 and 16 98 c while downgradient t rad values stay somewhat colder 15 40 16 07 and 16 11 c consequently for site 1 on this day even though the drainage outlet associated stream water thermal response was rather subtle 1 c it was still detectable with uav tir imagery two additional site 1 uav tir surveys were previously carried out in 2020 fig 3 shows enlarged portions of tir orthomosaics for the same stream segment as depicted in fig 2d one from feb 28 2020 fig 3a and the other from mar 5 2020 fig 3b there was significant rainfall 2 cm the week prior to feb 28 2020 drainage outlet flow confirmed via visual inspection and average air temperature was near freezing table 1 the average air temperature on feb 28 2020 was 3 7 c due to above ground temperature conditions the drainage discharge temperature was greater than the temperature of water that had resided in the stream for some period as a result the fig 3a thermal response associated with the pipe outlet is reversed from the one depicted in fig 2d in fig 3a based on the color scale alone stream water t rad just upgradient of the outlet is a little colder somewhat lighter red than the stream water downgradient of the outlet somewhat darker red which is emphasized by the further enlarged fig 3a inset image with outlet location indicated by black dot near the arrowhead tip the actual t rad values provided in fig 3a further confirm the uav measured thermal response associated with the pipe outlet where there were lower t rad stream values upgradient of the outlet 5 11 4 51 and 4 68 c compared to the drainage discharge and stream water downgradient of the outlet 5 39 5 29 5 35 c there was a substantial amount of rainfall 3 6 cm the week prior to mar 5 2020 drainage outlet flow confirmed via visual inspection and average air temperature was well above freezing table 1 the average air temperature on mar 5 2020 was 5 8 c due to warmer above ground temperature conditions on mar 5 2020 as compared to a week earlier on feb 28 2020 the drainage discharge temperature was now less than the temperature of water that had resided in the stream for some period as a result of fairly equivalent rainfall and temperature conditions on mar 5 2020 and may 10 2021 table 1 it is not too surprising that the fig 3b thermal response associated with the pipe outlet is very similar in appearance to the one depicted in fig 2d in fig 3b just like fig 2d and based solely on the color scale stream water t rad just upgradient of the outlet is a little warmer somewhat lighter blue than the stream water downgradient of the outlet somewhat darker blue which is emphasized by the further enlarged fig 3b inset image with outlet location indicated by black dot near the arrowhead tip the stream water t rad values provided in fig 3b further confirm the uav measured thermal response associated with the pipe outlet the t rad of the drainage discharge as it pours into the channel bank gully is 9 71 c where the drainage discharge enters the channel and mixes in with the stream the stream water t rad is 10 47 c upgradient in the stream from this point t rad values are warmer 11 53 11 54 11 70 c while downgradient t rad values stay somewhat colder 10 82 10 87 and 11 09 c the results from the site 1 uav tir surveys on feb 28 2020 and mar 5 2020 like those obtained on may 10 2021 further emphasizes that for this particular site even though the drainage outlet associated stream water thermal response may be rather subtle 1 c it can still be detected with uav tir imagery the fig 3a orthomosaic showed that with colder above ground temperature there was a change from colder stream water upgradient of the outlet to warmer water downgradient while figs 2d and 3b showed that with warmer above ground temperature there was a change from warmer stream water upgradient of the outlet to colder water downgradient therefore most importantly fig 3 demonstrates that during cold times of year the uav measured stream water thermal response associated with a subsurface drainage system outlet may be reversed from what is obtained during a warmer time of year results from site 2 on jul 12 2021 are depicted in fig 4 there had been a modest amount of rainfall 1 cm at this site the week prior to this date and air temperatures were fairly mild table 1 fig 4a is a ground level color photo taken at the top of the west bank of the drainage ditch just across from the subsurface drainage system pipe outlet located on the east bank view is to the east the upper left inset photo in fig 4a view to the southeast gives perspective on the size of the drainage ditch and channel flow conditions the site 2 drainage ditch is a small waterway based on average water surface width measurements 0 80 m see table 1 the ditch water flow direction in fig 4a is indicated by the pointed white dashed line fig 4a shows that there was a moderate amount of water discharged from the pipe outlet into the drainage ditch on jul 12 2021 fig 4b is a ground level tir photo taken close to the same position and time as the fig 4a color photo at the top of the west bank of the drainage ditch just across the pipe outlet on the east bank view is to the east blue colors in the fig 4b tir photo again indicate lower values of apparent radiant temperature t rad while red colors represent higher t rad values the ditch water flow direction in fig 4b as with fig 4a is indicated by the pointed white dashed line fig 4b in conjunction with fig 4a provides ground level confirmation of a ditch water thermal response associated with discharge from the pipe outlet as shown in fig 4b the colder drainage outlet discharge dark blue in color flows directly into the ditch channel to mix with water already in the ditch the ditch channel water at this point of mixing is also relatively cold dark blue in color upgradient of this drainage and ditch water mixing point the ditch water as indicted by fig 4b is definitely warmer green and yellow colors than the ditch water downgradient of the mixing point light blue and green colors near the same time the fig 4a and b photos were taken the uav tir survey likewise detected this ditch water thermal response i e coldest water at drainage ditch water mixing point with ditch water upgradient of mixing point warmer in comparison to ditch water downgradient of mixing point the full orthomosaic map from this uav tir survey covering a large reach of the drainage ditch is shown in fig 4c again by convention blue colors in fig 4c indicate lower t rad values while red colors represent higher t rad values the drainage pipe outlet is located along the drainage ditch segment within the black bars depicted in fig 4c and an enlargement of the tir orthomosaic for this drainage ditch segment is shown in fig 4d the pointed dashed black line in fig 4d indicates drainage ditch water flow direction generally south to north based just on the tir orthomosaic color scale the fig 4d ditch water t rad just upgradient of the outlet is a little warmer somewhat lighter blue than the ditch water downgradient of the outlet somewhat darker blue which is emphasized by the further enlarged fig 4d inset image with outlet location indicated by black dot near the arrowhead tip the actual uav measured ditch water t rad values provided in fig 4d further confirm the thermal response associated with the pipe outlet where the drainage discharge enters the ditch and mixes with water already there the ditch water t rad is only 21 77 c upgradient in the ditch from this point t rad values are warmer 25 15 24 28 and 24 10 c while directly downgradient t rad values are somewhat colder 23 85 23 61 23 89 c consequently for site 2 on this day just as with site 1 on three different occasions a ditch stream water thermal response was detectable with uav tir imagery even though the response was rather subtle 1 c the uav tir survey results for sites 3 4 and 5 are provided in figs 5 and 6 fig 5a is an enlarged portion of the site 3 tir orthomosaic depicting the section of apple creek along which the investigated subsurface drainage system outlet is located the inset color photo in fig 5a view to the north shows the drainage pipe outlet and adjacent stream on may 11 2021 the day the uav tir stream corridor survey was carried out apple creek is considered a moderate sized stream based on average water surface width measurements 5 20 m see table 1 there was quite a large amount of rainfall the prior week at this site 7 cm and air temperatures had been well above freezing table 1 the pipe outlet was partially submerged on may 11 2021 see fig 5a color photo inset however onsite visual inspection indicated that there was outflow from the pipe outlet into the stream close examination of the fig 5a tir orthomosaic reveals no stream water thermal response associated with the subsurface drainage system pipe outlet in particular the fig 5a tir orthomosaic exhibits no discernable color i e t rad change in the stream from upgradient to downgradient of the pipe outlet and actual t rad values in the stream upgradient adjacent and down gradient to the pipe outlet are very similar furthermore a ground level tir photo taken this day fig 6a provides a only a slight indication of cold water discharged from the pipe outlet which then merges with similarly cold stream water fig 5b is an enlarged portion of the site 4 tir orthomosaic depicting the section of oldtown run along which two investigated subsurface drainage system pipe outlets are located oldtown run is a moderate sized stream based on average water surface width measurements 5 35 m see table 1 inset color photos in fig 5b taken on mar 29 2021 near the same time the uav tir survey was conducted show the stream upgradient of the north pipe outlet top left photo view to the north the north drainage pipe outlet exhibiting outflow bottommost photo on left view to the north and stream downgradient with south pipe outlet bottom right photo view to the south there was a modest amount of rainfall the prior week at this site 1 4 cm and air temperatures had been well above freezing table 1 the north pipe outlet was above the stream water level while the south pipe outlet was partially submerged visual inspection indicated that there was some outflow into the stream from both pipe outlets close examination of the fig 5b tir orthomosaic reveals no stream water thermal responses associated with the two subsurface drainage system pipe outlets specifically the fig 5b tir orthomosaic exhibits no discernable color change in the stream from upgradient to downgradient of the two pipe outlets and actual t rad values in the stream upgradient adjacent and downgradient to the pipe outlets are generally similar ground level tir photos were not obtained on the is day so uav tir results could not be confirmed via this method fig 5c is an enlarged portion of the site 5 tir orthomosaic depicting the section of deer creek along which the investigated subsurface drainage system outlet is located the inset color photo in fig 5c view to the northeast shows the drainage pipe outlet and adjacent stream on may 12 2021 the day the uav tir stream corridor survey was carried out deer creek is considered a rather large stream based on average water surface width measurements 14 92 m see table 1 there was a substantial amount of rainfall the prior week at this site 5 cm and air temperatures had been well above freezing table 1 the pipe outlet was partially submerged on may 12 2021 see fig 5c color photo inset however onsite visual inspection indicated that there was some outflow from the pipe outlet into the stream close examination of the fig 5c tir orthomosaic reveals no stream water thermal response associated with the subsurface drainage system pipe outlet in particular the fig 5c tir orthomosaic exhibits no discernable color i e t rad change in the stream from upgradient to downgradient of the pipe outlet and actual t rad values in the stream upgradient adjacent and down gradient to the pipe outlet are very similar in addition ground level tir photos taken this day fig 6b is an example clearly showed cold water discharged from the pipe outlet which then quickly merged and mixed with similarly cold stream water therefore at sites 3 4 and 5 uav tir surveys were unable to distinguish steam water thermal responses associated with any of the subsurface drainage system pipe outlets that were present at sites 1 and 2 which were respectively a lower flow volume small stream and drainage ditch water surface width values of only 0 76 0 93 m see table 1 the uav tir surveys detected waterway thermal responses associated with drainage system pipe outlets conversely at sites 3 4 and 5 which were higher flow volume moderate or large streams water surface width values between 5 20 and 14 92 m see table 1 the uav tir surveys were unsuccessful at detecting these stream water thermal responses a possible explanation for the site 3 4 and 5 results is that the thermal response associated with a subsurface drainage system pipe outlet might not develop to the extent recognizable with uav tir imagery in cases of moderate and large streams where discharge from a particular drainage system pipe outlet is exceedingly small by comparison to the flow in the adjacent stream channel given this scenario drainage outlet detection with uav tir imagery becomes even more difficult if the t rad difference between the drainage discharge and upgradient stream water is minimal fig 6a and b furthermore unlike sites 1 and 2 three of the four drainage pipe outlets present at sites 3 4 and 5 were partially submerged and this partial submergence may in turn play a role at these three sites in preventing uav tir detection of pipe outlet associated stream water thermal responses the uav tir detected thermal responses of the ditch stream pipe outlets at sites 1 and 2 were quite subtle the t rad change from ditch stream water directly upgradient of the pipe outlet compared to the ditch stream water directly downgradient of the pipe outlet was only around 1 c at these two sites ditch and stream water t rad variations of this magnitude might easily be caused by other factors such as changes in channel width depth bed roughness affecting turbulence water turbidity and groundwater discharge i e seeps and springs apparent radiant temperature is a function of emissivity eq 1 and factors effecting emissivity such as exposed periphyton and other biological materials at the water surface can therefore also cause t rad variability in ditch and stream waters cardenas et al 2008 consequently with all these potential causes of ditch stream water t rad variations the use of uav tir imagery to map pipe outlet locations might not be completely realistic for situations typical of the midwest u s a where subsurface drainage system pipe outlets are installed within a ditch stream channel bank as examples to further emphasis this argument fig 7 shows uav tir orthomosaics for a reach of the small stream well upgradient from the site 1 pipe outlet fig 7a and a reach of the drainage ditch well upgradient from site 2 pipe outlet fig 7b there were no drainage system outlets within or directly upgradient the stream or ditch reaches shown in the fig 7a and b tir orthomosaics the t rad variations of approximately 1 c in these stream ditch reaches exhibited by rather abrupt color variations between lighter to darker blue are therefore not due to the presence of drainage outlets but some other mechanism as discussed in the paragraph above fig 7 thereby confirms that distinct waterway t rad changes of around 1 c are not necessarily indicative drainage outlet presence however since this is strictly a preliminary study more research is warranted focused on defining the constraints associated with using uav tir imagery for subsurface drainage outlet detection 4 conclusions drainage system outlet detection capabilities with unmanned aerial vehicle uav thermal infrared tir surveys were tested at five sites in ohio u s a with a range of waterway sizes from a drainage ditch and small stream to moderate and large sized streams the key findings of this preliminary study are listed as follows 1 the uav tir surveys detected the ditch stream water thermal responses associated with drainage system pipe outlets at both a drainage ditch and a small stream this thermal response is characterized by a ditch stream water apparent radiant temperature t rad change from upgradient of the outlet to downgradient of the outlet 2 when detectable this thermal response in cold winter months may be the reverse of that obtained during warmer periods of the year in cold winter months the ditch stream water upgradient of the outlet may be colder than downgradient while during warmer periods of the year the ditch steam water upgradient of the outlet may be warmer than downgradient 3 the thermal response when detectable is rather subtle exhibiting around a 1 c ditch stream water t rad change from upgradient of the outlet to downgradient of the outlet 4 the uav tir surveys did not detect thermal responses associated with drainage system pipe outlets at three sites with larger sized streams this finding for the larger streams in this study may be due to discharge from the drainage system pipe outlet being exceeding small by comparison to the flow in the adjacent stream channel which in turn prevents development of the thermal response to the extent necessary for recognition by uav tir imagery somewhat similar t rad values for drainage discharge and upgradient steam water along with pipe outlet submergence might also have played a role in the uav tir surveys not detecting an associated pipe outlet thermal response in these larger streams other factors in drainage ditches and streams i e channel width depth bed roughness affecting turbulence water turbidity and groundwater seeps springs may produce water t rad variations that are of the same magnitude of a subsurface drainage system pipe outlet thermal response consequently the use of uav tir imagery as a means to map pipe outlet locations might not be totally feasible for situations typical of the midwest u s a however more research is certainly warranted before making any final conclusions on the other hand where pipe outlet locations are known to produce a detectable thermal response uav tir surveys conducted over time could provide valuable insight regarding the overall impact of a subsurface drainage system pipe outlet on a ditch stream hydrology this potential use of uav tir imagery for qualitative quantitative evaluation throughout the year regarding hydrologic impacts of drainage system outlets on ditches streams is definitely a promising avenue for future research declaration of competing interest the

9416,environmental risk assessment of impacts due to agricultural subsurface drainage practices can benefit from information on drainage system outlet locations along ditches and streams unmanned aerial vehicle uav thermal infrared tir surveys may provide a means through thermal response recognition to map these subsurface drainage system pipe outlets consequently the objective of this research was to provide a preliminary feasibility assessment on the applicability of uav tir imagery for locating these drainage system outlets drainage outlet detection with uav tir surveys was tested at five sites in ohio u s a with a range of waterway sizes from drainage ditch to small and larger streams there were four key findings from this preliminary study 1 the uav tir surveys detected the ditch stream water thermal responses associated with drainage system pipe outlets at both a drainage ditch and a small stream this thermal response is characterized by a ditch stream water change in apparent radiant temperature t rad from upgradient of the outlet to downgradient of the outlet 2 as shown by one example in this study the outlet thermal response in cold winter months when detectable is likely the reverse of that obtained during warmer periods of the year 3 the detected thermal response is rather subtle exhibiting around a 1 c ditch stream water t rad change from upgradient of the outlet to downgradient of the outlet 4 the uav tir surveys did not detect thermal responses associated with drainage system pipe outlets at three sites with larger sized streams since other factors in drainage ditches and streams may produce water t rad variations that are of the same magnitude of a drainage system pipe outlet thermal response the use of uav tir imagery as a means to map drainage system outlet locations might not be completely practical however more investigation is certainly warranted keywords agricultural subsurface drainage systems drainage outlet mapping unmanned aerial vehicles uavs thermal infrared tir imagery 1 introduction the widespread adoption of subsurface drainage practices to remove excess soil water has enabled the midwest u s a to become one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world a 1985 economic survey showed that several states within this region illinois indiana iowa ohio minnesota michigan missouri and wisconsin had by that year approximately 12 5 million ha containing subsurface drainage systems with cropland accounting for the vast majority of areas having buried drainage pipes pavelis 1987 in more recent years a substantial amount of additional agricultural drainage pipe has been installed in the midwest u s a valayamkunnath et al 2020 although these agricultural subsurface drainage systems provide farmers an economic benefit through increased crop yields they also have adverse environmental consequences subsurface drainage practices can release substantial amounts of nitrate no3 and dissolved reactive phosphorous drp from farm fields into adjacent waterways daigh et al 2015 sims et al 1998 this subsurface drainage discharge of no3 and drp in turn causes degradation of surface water bodies at local regional and national scales in particular no3 and drp release from agricultural subsurface drainage systems are a leading cause of the hypoxic zone in the gulf of mexico and eutrophication of waterbodies in the midwest u s a where in all cases there is a substantial negative impact on aquatic life hoorman et al 2008 scavia and donnelly 2007 risk assessment of this environmental concern particularly from a watershed perspective calls for knowledge of which farm fields have these drainage systems and the characteristics of each drainage system i e drain line pattern spacing distance between drain lines drainage pipe depth etc risk assessment can be further improved with information regarding geographic coordinates of the drainage system pipe outlets in local waterways due to economic and environmental considerations farm field drainage maps are certainly needed drainage system design construction records are however usually unavailable and the current methods of finding drainage pipe i e tile probes and trenching equipment tend to be tedious time consuming and cause damage so there is a definite demand for effective efficient and nondestructive drainage pipe detection methods consequently over the past twenty years a substantial amount of research has focused on using proximal and remote sensing technologies for mapping farm field subsurface drainage systems ground penetrating radar gpr a proximal soil sensing method has proven capable in many instances of locating buried drainage pipes under a range of soil conditions allred et al 2004 2005 2018a allred and redman 2010 allred 2013 koganti et al 2020 koganti et al 2021 however gpr is somewhat inefficient for providing detailed maps of subsurface drainage systems in large farm fields recent studies have shown remote sensing technologies especially imagery obtained by manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs are capable of mapping subsurface drainage systems in large farm fields allred et al 2018b 2020 2021 freeland et al 2019 koganti et al 2021 kratt et al 2020 tlapáková et al 2017 williamson et al 2019 in the study by allred et al 2020 uav surveys with visible color vis c multispectral ms and thermal infrared tir cameras were carried out at 29 farm fields across the midwest u s a and overall results showed that vis c ms and tir imagery detected at least some of the drainage pipe present at 48 59 and 69 of the sites respectively additional investigation by those conducting research on this topic will eventually lead to development of site condition i e soil texture time of day year wetness dryness surface characteristics etc and equipment multirotor vs fixed wing uavs camera type etc based guidelines as to when and where uav surveys can be successfully deployed to map farm field subsurface drainage systems as previously mentioned watershed scale assessment of environmental risks associated with agricultural drainage practices would benefit not only from farm field subsurface drainage system maps across the watershed but also from information regarding drainage system pipe outlet locations where subsurface drainage waters are discharged into watershed ditches and streams locations of drainage system pipe outlets in ditches and streams are at present typically undocumented so methods are needed for mapping pipe outlet geographic coordinates thermal variations in ditch and stream waters may provide an indication of these pipe outlet locations the soil temperature at drainage pipe depths 1 m and in turn drainage water discharge temperatures tend to be more moderated having far less daily and seasonal variability than the air temperature above the ground surface hillel 1980 zajíĉek et al 2011 while drainage water discharge temperatures are likely to be most influenced by the soil temperature at 1 m depth the temperature of water resident in a ditch or stream channel is strongly impacted by both air temperature and direct solar radiation caissie 2006 consequently water temperature in a ditch or stream directly upgradient of a drainage system pipe outlet may be different than the ditch or stream water temperature adjacent and directly downgradient of the outlet whether the ditch or stream water temperature upgradient of the outlet is greater or less than the water temperature adjacent and directly downgradient to the outlet will depend largely on time of year and or weather patterns during previous days weeks the downgradient extent of this water temperature response i e abrupt change in ditch or stream water temperature adjacent to pipe outlet might even provide some insight on the subsurface drainage discharge magnitude at a pipe outlet channel location relative to the overall ditch stream flow the ditch or stream water temperature response associated with a subsurface drainage system outlet can potentially be detected with a radiometric thermal infrared camera a radiometric thermal infrared camera measures apparent radiant temperature t rad k which is a function of emissivity dimensionless and true kinetic temperature t kin k as expressed by the following equation kuenzer and dech 2013 1 t rad ε 0 25 t kin consequently deploying uavs with radiometric thermal infrared cameras to fly ditch or stream corridors may be a viable means for mapping subsurface drainage system outlets a number of studies have used tir imagery to detect locations of groundwater discharge i e springs entering a waterway briggs et al 2013 deitchman and loheide 2009 prinds et al 2019 demonstrated the utility of uav thermal infrared tir imagery for mapping subsurface drainage pipe outlets in denmark in this study the pipe outlets were located well upslope 10 s of meters away from a stream channel with discharge water flowing over the ground surface downwards to the stream this situation is different from the typical approach in the midwest u s a where the subsurface drainage outlets are located in the channel bank and water discharged directly into the ditch or stream further research is therefore warranted on uav tir drainage outlet mapping under conditions common to the midwest u s a consequently based on an objective to provide preliminary feasibility assessment on applicability of uav tir imagery for locating drainage system outlets under conditions common to the midwest u s a a study was initiated at five sites in ohio u s a the best times of year to conduct such a uav survey in the midwest u s a and great lakes region is likely during spring when subsurface drainage outflows are greatest brouder et al 2005 macrae et al 2007 accordingly the uav tir surveys for this research were carried out in the months from late winter to early summer i e late february through early july in the years of 2020 and 2021 this project s research hypothesis can be stated as follows subsurface drainage system pipe outlets in ditches and streams of the midwest u s a can be successfully mapped with uav tir imagery 2 materials and methods 2 1 uav equipment and image data processing this research used much the same unmanned aerial vehicle uav equipment and data processing procedures as described by allred et al 2020 2021 a sensefly sa cheseaux sur lausanne switzerland ebee plus rtk ppk fixed wing drone with s o d a and thermomap cameras was employed to carry out the uav surveys for this study the uav and s o d a camera combination had real time kinematic rtk global navigation satellite system gnss functionality and was used to obtain positionally accurate high resolution visible color vis c images the uav surveys conducted with the s o d a camera were flown approximately 54 64 m 180 210 ft above the ground which provided an image resolution of 1 3 1 5 cm px 0 5 0 6 in px the thermal infrared tir uav surveys were carried out with a sensefly sa thermomap radiometric camera which captured images in a wavelength range of 8 5 11 5 µm 10 µm center wavelength the thermomap camera has an apparent radiant temperature t rad resolution of 0 1 c the uav surveys with the thermomap camera were flown approximately 49 64 m 160 210 ft above the ground surface with a resolution of 9 1 11 9 cm px 3 6 4 7 in px the s o d a imagery was utilized to improve positional accuracy of the thermomap imagery pix4d sa prilly switzerland software pix4dmapper pro was employed for initial data processing particularly stitching together of the individual overlapping camera images obtained during a uav survey the end product of this stitching process was a set of vis c and tir georeferenced orthomosaic image maps of the site area over which the uav surveys were flown for the tir imagery based on using an emissivity of 1 0 pix4dmapper pro also converted absolute temperature represented by pixel brightness to t rad in celsius by the following relationship 2 temperature in c pixel brightness value 100 100 orthomosaic maps were then post processed using arcmap 10 2 desktop software environmental systems research institute redlands california u s a where annotations were added and the image then saved in a manageable format size further processing was accomplished using the public access gnu image manipulation program gimp 2 10 10 image editor which allowed for adjustment and enhancement of exposure sharpness size and resolution of the orthomosaic maps the vis c orthomosaic maps are a stitched color image of the site as would be seen from above with the human eye with respect to the stitched tir imagery blue to red color scale orthomosaic maps were generated in which blue colors represent lower t rad values and red colors represent higher t rad values 2 2 ground based vis c and tir cameras beginning in 2021 hand held cameras were employed to acquire ground level vis c and tir photos concurrently with each uav tir survey these photos were obtained for the purpose of documenting close up the conditions of the subsurface drainage system pipe outlet and adjacent ditch stream a canon inc tokyo japan powershot sx280 hs digital camera was used for the ground level vis c photos a perfectprime hong kong china ir0005 thermal imaging camera with emissivity set at 1 0 was used for the ground level tir photos for this study these tir photos are presented as a blue to red color scale images with blue colors indicating low values of t rad while red colors indicating high t rad values 2 3 site information the uav surveys for this research were carried out in 2020 and 2021 only in the months from late winter to early summer when subsurface drainage system outflows were expected to be greatest aerial images of the sites are provided in fig 1 the aerial images of sites 1 3 4 and 5 fig 1a 1c 1d and 1e respectively are orthomosaics generated from the uav s o d a vis c surveys a stitched orthomosaic could not be generated from the site 2 uav s o d a vis c survey so the fig 1b aerial image of site 2

sized is somewhat arbitrary and based on water surface width values provided in table 1 as indicated by the table 1 water surface width values flow volume on days of the uav surveys were much less for the site1 small stream and site 2 drainage ditch as compared to the moderate or large sized streams at sites 3 4 and 5 3 results and discussion results from site 1 on may 10 2021 are depicted in fig 2 there had been substantial site rainfall in the week prior 5 cm see table 1 fig 2a is a ground level color photo taken at the top of the north bank of ackerman run just east of the subsurface drainage system pipe outlet view is to the west ackerman run is considered a small waterway based on average water surface width measurements 0 76 0 93 m see table 1 the stream flow direction in fig 2a is indicated by the pointed white dashed lines fig 2a shows that there was a substantial amount of water discharged from the pipe outlet into the stream on may 10 2021 fig 2b is a ground level thermal infrared tir photo taken close to the same position and time as the fig 2a color photo at the top of the north bank of ackerman run just east of the pipe outlet view is to the west blue colors in the fig 2b tir photo indicate lower values of apparent radiant temperature t rad while red colors represent higher t rad values the stream flow direction in fig 2b as with fig 2a is indicated by the pointed white dashed lines fig 2b in conjunction with fig 2a provides ground level confirmation of a stream water thermal response associated with discharge from the pipe outlet as shown in fig 2b the colder drainage outlet discharge dark blue in color flows down a gully and into the stream channel to mix with water already in the stream upgradient of the point where the drainage discharge enters the channel the stream water is somewhat warmer lighter blue color than the stream water downgradient of this point darker blue color at the same time during the day the unmanned aerial vehicle uav tir survey likewise detected this stream water thermal response i e change from warmer stream water upgradient of outlet to colder water downgradient the full orthomosaic map from this uav tir survey covering a large reach of ackermann run is shown in fig 2c again by convention blue colors in fig 2c indicate lower t rad values while red colors represent higher t rad values the drainage pipe outlet is located along the stream segment within the black bars depicted in fig 2c and an enlargement of the tir orthomosaic for this stream segment is shown in fig 2d the pointed dashed black line in fig 2d indicates steam flow direction generally west to east based on the tir orthomosaic color scale the fig 2d stream water t rad just upgradient of the outlet is a little warmer somewhat lighter blue than the stream water downgradient of the outlet somewhat darker blue which is emphasized by the further enlarged fig 2d inset image with outlet location indicated by black dot near the arrowhead tip the actual stream water t rad values provided in fig 2d further confirm the uav measured thermal response associated with the pipe outlet the t rad of the drainage discharge as it pours into the small channel bank gully is 14 93 c where the drainage discharge enters the channel and mixes in with the stream the stream water t rad is 15 54 c upgradient in the stream from this point t rad values are warmer 16 79 16 85 and 16 98 c while downgradient t rad values stay somewhat colder 15 40 16 07 and 16 11 c consequently for site 1 on this day even though the drainage outlet associated stream water thermal response was rather subtle 1 c it was still detectable with uav tir imagery two additional site 1 uav tir surveys were previously carried out in 2020 fig 3 shows enlarged portions of tir orthomosaics for the same stream segment as depicted in fig 2d one from feb 28 2020 fig 3a and the other from mar 5 2020 fig 3b there was significant rainfall 2 cm the week prior to feb 28 2020 drainage outlet flow confirmed via visual inspection and average air temperature was near freezing table 1 the average air temperature on feb 28 2020 was 3 7 c due to above ground temperature conditions the drainage discharge temperature was greater than the temperature of water that had resided in the stream for some period as a result the fig 3a thermal response associated with the pipe outlet is reversed from the one depicted in fig 2d in fig 3a based on the color scale alone stream water t rad just upgradient of the outlet is a little colder somewhat lighter red than the stream water downgradient of the outlet somewhat darker red which is emphasized by the further enlarged fig 3a inset image with outlet location indicated by black dot near the arrowhead tip the actual t rad values provided in fig 3a further confirm the uav measured thermal response associated with the pipe outlet where there were lower t rad stream values upgradient of the outlet 5 11 4 51 and 4 68 c compared to the drainage discharge and stream water downgradient of the outlet 5 39 5 29 5 35 c there was a substantial amount of rainfall 3 6 cm the week prior to mar 5 2020 drainage outlet flow confirmed via visual inspection and average air temperature was well above freezing table 1 the average air temperature on mar 5 2020 was 5 8 c due to warmer above ground temperature conditions on mar 5 2020 as compared to a week earlier on feb 28 2020 the drainage discharge temperature was now less than the temperature of water that had resided in the stream for some period as a result of fairly equivalent rainfall and temperature conditions on mar 5 2020 and may 10 2021 table 1 it is not too surprising that the fig 3b thermal response associated with the pipe outlet is very similar in appearance to the one depicted in fig 2d in fig 3b just like fig 2d and based solely on the color scale stream water t rad just upgradient of the outlet is a little warmer somewhat lighter blue than the stream water downgradient of the outlet somewhat darker blue which is emphasized by the further enlarged fig 3b inset image with outlet location indicated by black dot near the arrowhead tip the stream water t rad values provided in fig 3b further confirm the uav measured thermal response associated with the pipe outlet the t rad of the drainage discharge as it pours into the channel bank gully is 9 71 c where the drainage discharge enters the channel and mixes in with the stream the stream water t rad is 10 47 c upgradient in the stream from this point t rad values are warmer 11 53 11 54 11 70 c while downgradient t rad values stay somewhat colder 10 82 10 87 and 11 09 c the results from the site 1 uav tir surveys on feb 28 2020 and mar 5 2020 like those obtained on may 10 2021 further emphasizes that for this particular site even though the drainage outlet associated stream water thermal response may be rather subtle 1 c it can still be detected with uav tir imagery the fig 3a orthomosaic showed that with colder above ground temperature there was a change from colder stream water upgradient of the outlet to warmer water downgradient while figs 2d and 3b showed that with warmer above ground temperature there was a change from warmer stream water upgradient of the outlet to colder water downgradient therefore most importantly fig 3 demonstrates that during cold times of year the uav measured stream water thermal response associated with a subsurface drainage system outlet may be reversed from what is obtained during a warmer time of year results from site 2 on jul 12 2021 are depicted in fig 4 there had been a modest amount of rainfall 1 cm at this site the week prior to this date and air temperatures were fairly mild table 1 fig 4a is a ground level color photo taken at the top of the west bank of the drainage ditch just across from the subsurface drainage system pipe outlet located on the east bank view is to the east the upper left inset photo in fig 4a view to the southeast gives perspective on the size of the drainage ditch and channel flow conditions the site 2 drainage ditch is a small waterway based on average water surface width measurements 0 80 m see table 1 the ditch water flow direction in fig 4a is indicated by the pointed white dashed line fig 4a shows that there was a moderate amount of water discharged from the pipe outlet into the drainage ditch on jul 12 2021 fig 4b is a ground level tir photo taken close to the same position and time as the fig 4a color photo at the top of the west bank of the drainage ditch just across the pipe outlet on the east bank view is to the east blue colors in the fig 4b tir photo again indicate lower values of apparent radiant temperature t rad while red colors represent higher t rad values the ditch water flow direction in fig 4b as with fig 4a is indicated by the pointed white dashed line fig 4b in conjunction with fig 4a provides ground level confirmation of a ditch water thermal response associated with discharge from the pipe outlet as shown in fig 4b the colder drainage outlet discharge dark blue in color flows directly into the ditch channel to mix with water already in the ditch the ditch channel water at this point of mixing is also relatively cold dark blue in color upgradient of this drainage and ditch water mixing point the ditch water as indicted by fig 4b is definitely warmer green and yellow colors than the ditch water downgradient of the mixing point light blue and green colors near the same time the fig 4a and b photos were taken the uav tir survey likewise detected this ditch water thermal response i e coldest water at drainage ditch water mixing point with ditch water upgradient of mixing point warmer in comparison to ditch water downgradient of mixing point the full orthomosaic map from this uav tir survey covering a large reach of the drainage ditch is shown in fig 4c again by convention blue colors in fig 4c indicate lower t rad values while red colors represent higher t rad values the drainage pipe outlet is located along the drainage ditch segment within the black bars depicted in fig 4c and an enlargement of the tir orthomosaic for this drainage ditch segment is shown in fig 4d the pointed dashed black line in fig 4d indicates drainage ditch water flow direction generally south to north based just on the tir orthomosaic color scale the fig 4d ditch water t rad just upgradient of the outlet is a little warmer somewhat lighter blue than the ditch water downgradient of the outlet somewhat darker blue which is emphasized by the further enlarged fig 4d inset image with outlet location indicated by black dot near the arrowhead tip the actual uav measured ditch water t rad values provided in fig 4d further confirm the thermal response associated with the pipe outlet where the drainage discharge enters the ditch and mixes with water already there the ditch water t rad is only 21 77 c upgradient in the ditch from this point t rad values are warmer 25 15 24 28 and 24 10 c while directly downgradient t rad values are somewhat colder 23 85 23 61 23 89 c consequently for site 2 on this day just as with site 1 on three different occasions a ditch stream water thermal response was detectable with uav tir imagery even though the response was rather subtle 1 c the uav tir survey results for sites 3 4 and 5 are provided in figs 5 and 6 fig 5a is an enlarged portion of the site 3 tir orthomosaic depicting the section of apple creek along which the investigated subsurface drainage system outlet is located the inset color photo in fig 5a view to the north shows the drainage pipe outlet and adjacent stream on may 11 2021 the day the uav tir stream corridor survey was carried out apple creek is considered a moderate sized stream based on average water surface width measurements 5 20 m see table 1 there was quite a large amount of rainfall the prior week at this site 7 cm and air temperatures had been well above freezing table 1 the pipe outlet was partially submerged on may 11 2021 see fig 5a color photo inset however onsite visual inspection indicated that there was outflow from the pipe outlet into the stream close examination of the fig 5a tir orthomosaic reveals no stream water thermal response associated with the subsurface drainage system pipe outlet in particular the fig 5a tir orthomosaic exhibits no discernable color i e t rad change in the stream from upgradient to downgradient of the pipe outlet and actual t rad values in the stream upgradient adjacent and down gradient to the pipe outlet are very similar furthermore a ground level tir photo taken this day fig 6a provides a only a slight indication of cold water discharged from the pipe outlet which then merges with similarly cold stream water fig 5b is an enlarged portion of the site 4 tir orthomosaic depicting the section of oldtown run along which two investigated subsurface drainage system pipe outlets are located oldtown run is a moderate sized stream based on average water surface width measurements 5 35 m see table 1 inset color photos in fig 5b taken on mar 29 2021 near the same time the uav tir survey was conducted show the stream upgradient of the north pipe outlet top left photo view to the north the north drainage pipe outlet exhibiting outflow bottommost photo on left view to the north and stream downgradient with south pipe outlet bottom right photo view to the south there was a modest amount of rainfall the prior week at this site 1 4 cm and air temperatures had been well above freezing table 1 the north pipe outlet was above the stream water level while the south pipe outlet was partially submerged visual inspection indicated that there was some outflow into the stream from both pipe outlets close examination of the fig 5b tir orthomosaic reveals no stream water thermal responses associated with the two subsurface drainage system pipe outlets specifically the fig 5b tir orthomosaic exhibits no discernable color change in the stream from upgradient to downgradient of the two pipe outlets and actual t rad values in the stream upgradient adjacent and downgradient to the pipe outlets are generally similar ground level tir photos were not obtained on the is day so uav tir results could not be confirmed via this method fig 5c is an enlarged portion of the site 5 tir orthomosaic depicting the section of deer creek along which the investigated subsurface drainage system outlet is located the inset color photo in fig 5c view to the northeast shows the drainage pipe outlet and adjacent stream on may 12 2021 the day the uav tir stream corridor survey was carried out deer creek is considered a rather large stream based on average water surface width measurements 14 92 m see table 1 there was a substantial amount of rainfall the prior week at this site 5 cm and air temperatures had been well above freezing table 1 the pipe outlet was partially submerged on may 12 2021 see fig 5c color photo inset however onsite visual inspection indicated that there was some outflow from the pipe outlet into the stream close examination of the fig 5c tir orthomosaic reveals no stream water thermal response associated with the subsurface drainage system pipe outlet in particular the fig 5c tir orthomosaic exhibits no discernable color i e t rad change in the stream from upgradient to downgradient of the pipe outlet and actual t rad values in the stream upgradient adjacent and down gradient to the pipe outlet are very similar in addition ground level tir photos taken this day fig 6b is an example clearly showed cold water discharged from the pipe outlet which then quickly merged and mixed with similarly cold stream water therefore at sites 3 4 and 5 uav tir surveys were unable to distinguish steam water thermal responses associated with any of the subsurface drainage system pipe outlets that were present at sites 1 and 2 which were respectively a lower flow volume small stream and drainage ditch water surface width values of only 0 76 0 93 m see table 1 the uav tir surveys detected waterway thermal responses associated with drainage system pipe outlets conversely at sites 3 4 and 5 which were higher flow volume moderate or large streams water surface width values between 5 20 and 14 92 m see table 1 the uav tir surveys were unsuccessful at detecting these stream water thermal responses a possible explanation for the site 3 4 and 5 results is that the thermal response associated with a subsurface drainage system pipe outlet might not develop to the extent recognizable with uav tir imagery in cases of moderate and large streams where discharge from a particular drainage system pipe outlet is exceedingly small by comparison to the flow in the adjacent stream channel given this scenario drainage outlet detection with uav tir imagery becomes even more difficult if the t rad difference between the drainage discharge and upgradient stream water is minimal fig 6a and b furthermore unlike sites 1 and 2 three of the four drainage pipe outlets present at sites 3 4 and 5 were partially submerged and this partial submergence may in turn play a role at these three sites in preventing uav tir detection of pipe outlet associated stream water thermal responses the uav tir detected thermal responses of the ditch stream pipe outlets at sites 1 and 2 were quite subtle the t rad change from ditch stream water directly upgradient of the pipe outlet compared to the ditch stream water directly downgradient of the pipe outlet was only around 1 c at these two sites ditch and stream water t rad variations of this magnitude might easily be caused by other factors such as changes in channel width depth bed roughness affecting turbulence water turbidity and groundwater discharge i e seeps and springs apparent radiant temperature is a function of emissivity eq 1 and factors effecting emissivity such as exposed periphyton and other biological materials at the water surface can therefore also cause t rad variability in ditch and stream waters cardenas et al 2008 consequently with all these potential causes of ditch stream water t rad variations the use of uav tir imagery to map pipe outlet locations might not be completely realistic for situations typical of the midwest u s a where subsurface drainage system pipe outlets are installed within a ditch stream channel bank as examples to further emphasis this argument fig 7 shows uav tir orthomosaics for a reach of the small stream well upgradient from the site 1 pipe outlet fig 7a and a reach of the drainage ditch well upgradient from site 2 pipe outlet fig 7b there were no drainage system outlets within or directly upgradient the stream or ditch reaches shown in the fig 7a and b tir orthomosaics the t rad variations of approximately 1 c in these stream ditch reaches exhibited by rather abrupt color variations between lighter to darker blue are therefore not due to the presence of drainage outlets but some other mechanism as discussed in the paragraph above fig 7 thereby confirms that distinct waterway t rad changes of around 1 c are not necessarily indicative drainage outlet presence however since this is strictly a preliminary study more research is warranted focused on defining the constraints associated with using uav tir imagery for subsurface drainage outlet detection 4 conclusions drainage system outlet detection capabilities with unmanned aerial vehicle uav thermal infrared tir surveys were tested at five sites in ohio u s a with a range of waterway sizes from a drainage ditch and small stream to moderate and large sized streams the key findings of this preliminary study are listed as follows 1 the uav tir surveys detected the ditch stream water thermal responses associated with drainage system pipe outlets at both a drainage ditch and a small stream this thermal response is characterized by a ditch stream water apparent radiant temperature t rad change from upgradient of the outlet to downgradient of the outlet 2 when detectable this thermal response in cold winter months may be the reverse of that obtained during warmer periods of the year in cold winter months the ditch stream water upgradient of the outlet may be colder than downgradient while during warmer periods of the year the ditch steam water upgradient of the outlet may be warmer than downgradient 3 the thermal response when detectable is rather subtle exhibiting around a 1 c ditch stream water t rad change from upgradient of the outlet to downgradient of the outlet 4 the uav tir surveys did not detect thermal responses associated with drainage system pipe outlets at three sites with larger sized streams this finding for the larger streams in this study may be due to discharge from the drainage system pipe outlet being exceeding small by comparison to the flow in the adjacent stream channel which in turn prevents development of the thermal response to the extent necessary for recognition by uav tir imagery somewhat similar t rad values for drainage discharge and upgradient steam water along with pipe outlet submergence might also have played a role in the uav tir surveys not detecting an associated pipe outlet thermal response in these larger streams other factors in drainage ditches and streams i e channel width depth bed roughness affecting turbulence water turbidity and groundwater seeps springs may produce water t rad variations that are of the same magnitude of a subsurface drainage system pipe outlet thermal response consequently the use of uav tir imagery as a means to map pipe outlet locations might not be totally feasible for situations typical of the midwest u s a however more research is certainly warranted before making any final conclusions on the other hand where pipe outlet locations are known to produce a detectable thermal response uav tir surveys conducted over time could provide valuable insight regarding the overall impact of a subsurface drainage system pipe outlet on a ditch stream hydrology this potential use of uav tir imagery for qualitative quantitative evaluation throughout the year regarding hydrologic impacts of drainage system outlets on ditches streams is definitely a promising avenue for future research declaration of competing interest the

were then measured the leaf area was calculated by multiplying the measured leaf length and broadest leaf cross section with a constant coefficient of 0 72 0 01 daughtry and hollinger 1984 at the harvest of the silage 1 5 m of the plant rows was harvested and dried in the oven for 48 h at 75 c water productivity was calculated fernández et al 2020 in exp 1 the root zone depth was 60 cm at 55 days after planting about 80 of maize roots were located in the top 30 cm of soil and at 100 days after planting about 70 of maize roots were located in the top 30 cm of soil amiri et al 2021 the soil samples were obtained at 2 5 7 5 12 5 17 5 and 27 5 32 5 cm distances from the plant row and the depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm for soil no3 n concentration on 67 and 91 dap during the growing season soil water content for the different irrigation and fertilizer treatments were measured with a pr2 6 profile probe delta t devices ltd uk at depths of 10 20 30 40 60 cm the mv output data converted to square root of permittivity ɛ with the polynomial equation eq 1 delta t devices 2008 1 ɛ 1 125 5 53 v 67 17 v 2 234 42 v 3 413 56 v 4 356 68 v 5 121 53 v 6 where ɛ is the permittivity and

the volumetric soil moisture at different depths was measured by gravimetric method n 30 in order to calibrate the device and adjust the coefficients a0 and a1 dhakal et al 2019 in addition the pr2 6

constant parameters table 3 an illustration of the relationship between measured vwc and calculated vwc by the pr2 6 profile probe using default delta t parameters and optimized delta t parameters is shown in fig s1 after calibration relation between measured vwc and calculated vwc was close to line 1 1 additionally during the growing season soil moisture content was measured by hand auger several times before irrigation from 0 to 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil depths at full irrigation level to determine soil nitrate soil samples were taken from the same locations where plants were sampled for biomass measurement during the tassel stage and harvest of forage soil samples were taken after scraping the maize plants in exp 3 the soil samples were taken in three spacings of 2 5 10 2 12 5 20 2 and 27 5 35 2 cm from the plant row and at soil depths of 5 12 7 25 32 7 and45 52 7 cm for soil no3 n concentration on 84 and 109 dap also on 109 dap soil samples were taken at soil depths of 65 72 7 and 85 92 7 cm also soil moisture was measured with an auger sampler during the growing season prior to the application of irrigation for all treatments the nitrogen uptake nu was measured using the semi micro kjeldahl technique bremner and mulvaney 1982 soil no3 n concentration was then measured using the colorimetric method by trans nitration of salicylic acid vendrell and zupancic 1990 in the 410 nm wavelength by a spectrophotometer hach dr6000 loveland co usa 2 3 crop modeling data in this study the cropping system model csm ceres maize of dssat version 4 7 5 was used to simulate the growth development and yield of maize and soil no3 n hoogenboom a b et al 2019 for each field daily weather data such as tmin and tmax mean relative humidity rhmean precipitation pc sunshine hours ss and mean wind speed ws were used with the dssat weatherman tool to create the weather files wth file the field soil information i e percent of silt clay sand and gravel bulk density fc and pwp were used to create soil files using the sbuild tool the experimental and farmer field data i e maize cultivar planting date plant density soil initial n and moisture date and the amounts of water and fertilizer applied for each treatment were used to create the individual crop management file xfile the net irrigation depth entered into the irrigation section of xfile is shown in fig s2 initial soil nitrogen nitrate as well as nitrogen nitrates in irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer supplied were used as a n source for modelling for each field individual input data was imported into xfile and saved as mzx files in the next step the genotype s coefficients were calibrated by using afile data phenology dates maximum tb and gy and maximum lai as well as the model evaluated with tfile data measured tb gy nu and sm throughout the growing season as well as soil no3 n and statistical parameters rmse nrmse d and mbe figs 1 and 2 the calibration of the csm ceres maize was based on the trial and error process for correcting p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint genetic coefficients while ctcnp2 coefficient of n stress for concentration changes as a function of growth stage was modified for n stress the values for the genetic coefficients were calibrated until the simulated date of anthesis and physiological maturity maximum lai laix tb grain yield gy and n uptake nu were similar to the measured values based on the statistical criteria tsuji et al 1998 the values for the six cultivar coefficients of the model were obtained by minimizing the error between simulated and observed data in order to obtain a high r2 and the lowest rmse and nrmse the model was calibrated for two hybrids of maize based on the comparison of the simulated data with observed data tsuji et al 1998 thus the values for six cultivar coefficients were determined by using no water and nitrogen stress treatments and then the ctcnp2 was modified for the n treatments the data used for calibration were the laix tb and gy n uptake and the flowering and maturity dates for no water and n stress treatments during model calibration only data on nu and tb at forage harvest stage gy of harvested stage and laix were used when evaluating the model lai tb and soil water content data taken several times during the growing period n uptake and soil no3 n from two sampling dates and etc and wp for silage harvest stage were utilized the actual evapotranspiration of maize etc was calculated using the soil water balance method gheysari et al 2015 for the hybrid sc704 two treatments with no water and nitrogen stress f2w4 and f3w3 of exp 1 were selected for calibration while the remaining treatments of exp 1 ten treatments and all treatments of exp 2 were used for model evaluation table s2 for the hybrid sc606 we used data from treatments nfali3 and nseqi3 in exp 3 for calibration of genotype specific coefficients table s2 and four remaining nfali1 nfali2 nseqi1 nseqi2 treatments in exp 3 and final total biomass in two farmer fields were used for evaluation the soil sampling depth in exp 1 was different from the soil layers that were used in the model so we used the weighted average for the simulated values as follows 3 c i 1 n c i z i i 1 n z i where c is the weighted average of soil no3 n ci is the simulated no3 n in the soil depth of the layer i and zi is the soil depth of the layer i for the evapotranspiration method we used the default method of the model priestley taylor the ritchie ceres method was utilized to estimate soil evaporation ritchie 1998 soil conservation service and ritchie water balance methods were used for infiltration and hydrology calculation respectively the radiation use efficiency rue was used to simulate photosynthesis the century based som module was used to simulate residual soil nitrogen hoogenboom et al 2019b 2 4 model statistics the ceres maize model was evaluated using four statistical parameters the accuracy of the model was calculated with root

2016 was 63 9 mm for 2017 was 46 9 mm and for 2019 was 132 mm however there was no effective rain i e precipitation greater than 5 mm from june to september during each growing season of the three years of this study the daily average air temperature during the maize growing season ranged from 17 7 to 30 4 c in 2016 18 6 28 2 c in 2017 and 21 6 31 0 c in 2019 table s3 the lowest daily minimum air temperature and the highest daily maximum air temperature during the growing season until the date for the silage harvest were 10 2 c and 38 2 c in 2016 10 0 c and 36 3 c in 2017 and 15 8 c and 38 8 c in 2019 respectively the average relative humidity during the growing season was between 20 3 and 20 9 for the three experiments conducted in 2016 and 2017 and it ranged from 18 2 to 23 0 for two studies conducted in the farmer s field in 2017 and 2019 fig 3 3 2 model calibration the genotype coefficients in ceres maize describe specific properties of cultivars related to their growth and development after trial and error process the thermal time from seedling emergence to the end of the juvenile phase p1 was 300 c day for sc704 and 280 4 c day for sc606 the days delaying the development with photoperiod above 12 5 h p2 was 0 5 for sc704 and 0 209 for sc606 the thermal time from silking to physiological maturity for sc704 was 790 c day and 550 c day for sc606 kernel filling rate g3 was 8 mg day 1 for sc704 and 9 79 mg day 1 for sc606 the phylochron interval was estimated at 53 45 c for sc704 and 53 78 c for sc606 as an improvement for the simulation of nitrogen uptake the nitrogen stress coefficient ctcnp2 defined in the species file was modified and set to 0 16 for sc704 and 0 163 for sc606 tables 4 and 5 other researchers have also modified the nitrogen stress coefficient to improve model accuracy for simulation of crop growth and nitrogen uptake liu et al 2012 yakoub et al 2017 calibration of the phenology date for the flowering and maturity date for sc704 and sc606 matched well to the observed data with nrmse 3 08 0 85 for sc704 and 3 39 2 00 for sc606 table 5 tb was predicted to be 22231 kg ha 1 for sc704 with the nrmse of 5 23 while for the hybrid sc606 it was predicted to be 21844 kg ha 1 with the nrmse of 4 94 the grain yield was estimated with a nrmse of 10 22 for sc704 and 6 75 for sc606 the nrmse for laix was 9 15 for sc704 while it was 2 28 for sc606 the nrmse for nitrogen uptake was 0 43 for sc704 while it was 17 15 for sc606 table 5 these performance indexes showed that the csm ceres maize model could be calibrated for both hybrids sc704 and sc606 under different soil wetted widths of the drip tape irrigation system 3 3 model evaluation 3 3 1 total biomass and leaf area index the simulated tb matched well with the observed data in the applied n fertilizer treatments f2 and f3 for all four irrigation levels in exp 1 and all treatments of exp 2 for the hybrid sc704 with a nrmse between 7 17 and 21 91 and a d index between 0 969 and 0 997 fig 4 there was a similar response for all irrigation treatments for the hybrid sc606 with a nrmse between 11 46 and 15 81 and a d index between 0 984 and 0 991 fig 4 thus the ceres maize model was able to predict yield accurately however there was more discrepancy between the simulated and observed tb for the no nitrogen fertilizer treatments 14 08 nrmse 33 61 in sc704 for exp 1 overall for all three experiments and two farmer s field studies the model evaluation confirmed the ability of the model to simulate the maize tb with a nrmse of less than 16 90 for full irrigation management and less than 17 98 for deficit irrigation for the applied n fertilizer treatments fig 4 however the model accuracy was less for the no n fertilizer treatments 14 08 nrmse 33 61 for limited wetting width under the drip tape irrigation system in agreement with our results the previous research showed that the accuracy of the model was lower in no nitrogen fertilizer conditions as compared to the applied n levels li et al 2015 the difference between simulated and observed tb for the no n fertilizer treatments could be due to possibly nitrogen mineralization and accuracy of the input data for initial soil nitrogen in this study we measured no3 n as initial soil nitrogen and nh4 n was not measured also it might be due to the dssat crop model s sensitivity to nitrogen stress as opposed to real crop growth without fertilizer n li et al 2015 in exp 3 the treatments consisting of irrigation at different soil suction thresholds included 20 and 40 kpa which all thresholds were reasonably good for the maize growth hoffman et al 2007 the irrigation depth for all three irrigation treatments was calculated based on the amount of water required to replenish soil water depletion to the fc point as a result there was no water stress for all three irrigation treatments remarkably field measured data showed that tb was affected by these three irrigation treatments under drip tape irrigation however the ceres maize model could not distinguish the differences in value of silage tb for the applied soil suction thresholds in this study it may be caused by the tipping bucket method boote et al 2008 used in the ceres maize model for balancing soil water in which water movements in the soil are one dimensional while the movement of water in soil under drip irrigation is two dimensional the simulated lai agreed with the observed values for all four irrigation levels of exp 1 and exp 2 with the nrmse being between 8 99 and 20 16 and a d index between 0 813 and 0 972 for all n treatments for the hybrid sc704 however the nrmse was between 30 70 and 37 62 and the d index was between 0 703 and 0 832 for the no fertilizer treatment fig 5 simulated lai was close to the observed lai for the hybrid sc606 with a nrmse of 8 37 15 30 and a d index of 0 805 0 964 in all irrigation levels fig 5 for lai the model gave an nrmse of less than 20 16 for all experiments and for the farmer s field studies for all irrigation levels deficit to over irrigation and the n fertilizer treatments fig 5 the rmse for simulating lai reported between 0 66 and 1 18 under drip irrigation saseendran et al 2014 overall the model accuracy for simulating tb and lai was good for both the deficit and over irrigation levels with limited and unlimited wetting widths for the dti system we could however not find any specific trend for model accuracy among the different irrigation levels and n fertilizer treatments in the farmer s fields f2 and f3 in exp 1 and the experimental treatments of exp 2 and exp 3 however the model was more accurate in exp 3 as compared to exp 1 and exp 2 which could be due to the unlimited wetted width in exp 3 for the no n fertilizer application treatment with the limited wetting width under dti the model performance was less possibly due to model initialization at the start of the simulation and som mineralization 3 3 2 soil moisture the results of evaluation of soil moisture content for three soil layers and the entire soil profile for four irrigation levels in exp 1 table 6 and all treatments in exp 3 are presented in table 7 nrmse value and d index value for the severe deficit irrigation level w1 were 27 61 and 0 71 for layer 1 22 12 and 0 80 for layer 2 and 18 33 and 0 81 for layer 3 respectively table 6 although nrmse values for moderate deficit irrigation were similar to those of w1 the model gave a lower nrmse in layers 1 24 96 layer 2 17 53 and layers 3 13 47 than those seen in w1 the d index value was 0 7 in layer 1 0 8 in layer 2 and 0 54 in layer 3 in the full irrigation level the nrmse and d index for the first layer were 23 38 and 0 62 whereas for the second layer they were 25 84 and 0 42 the nrmse value for the third layer was 15 36 and the d index was 0 78 the nrmse value and d index for over irrigation treatment were 24 73 and 0 72 in layer 1 27 45 and 0 62 in layer 2 and 15 13 and 0 62 in layer 3 totally layer s accuracy was within acceptable limits nrmse 30 but it can be concluded that the accuracy of model in first layer was the lowest and in the deeper layer model has more accurate using sprinkler irrigation dokoohaki et al 2017 reported a lower level of soil moisture accuracy in the top layer in the case of sprinkler irrigation the model has a higher accuracy 7 77 nrmse 16 1 than when drip irrigation was used with deficit irrigation 13 47 nrmse 27 61 which is possibly due to the similarity of the pattern of water distribution in the soil in the sprinkler irrigation system one dimensional with the method of water movement in soil the tipping bucket used in the dssat model in exp 3 the model s accuracy was evaluated for two soil water layers 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm and the complete soil profile 0 40 cm table 7 for the nfali1 treatment the nrmse was less than 7 48 for layer 1 and 16 90 for layer 2 with soil moisture predicted well for both layers for the nseqi1 treatment the nrmse was less than 20 6 12 59 and 20 55 for soil moisture the model accuracy for the nseqi1 treatment was less than for the nfali1 treatment for the nfali2 treatment the nrmse value in layer 1 was 11 48 and for layer 2 was 10 44 while in nseqi2 it was 10 28 for layer 1 and 14 94 for layer 2 the d index value in two layers and two treatments was less than 0 50 0 41 0 50 which means that simulated soil moisture had a poor to moderate agreement with the observed soil moisture the nrmse value for the entire profile 0 40 cm for the nfal and nseq treatments was 10 31 and 5 75 respectively and indicated a good simulation and the d index values of 0 36 and 0 72 indicated a moderate agreement for the simulation in nfali3 the nrmse value was less than 9 46 and the d index was 0 57 for layer 1 for the second layer the nrmse was 8 62 and the d index was 0 58 for the nseqi3 treatment the nrmse was 11 90 and 11 37 and the d index was 0 49 and 0 59 for layer 1 and layer 2 respectively there was moderate agreement between simulated and observed soil moisture for these treatments the average soil moisture for complete soil profile 0 40 cm model was more accurate in nfal 5 82 nrmse 10 31 than nseq 5 75 nrmse 13 03 overall considering the entire profile the d index was higher for the deficit irrigation levels 0 75 0 77 compare to full and over irrigation 0 54 and 0 70 the nrmse value was 17 87 in severe deficit irrigation 14 11 in moderate deficit irrigation 14 82 in full irrigation and 17 98 in over irrigation exp 3 was a fully irrigated experiment with varying allowable soil water thresholds as previously mentioned overall for the entire soil profile the accuracy of the model was higher for i3 i2 and i1 with nrmses of 6 99 8 03 and 11 17 respectively the d index was higher for i1 0 63 i3 0 61 and i2 0 54 respectively the accuracy of the dssat for simulation of soil moisture was reported under surface irrigation hammad et al 2018 sprinkler irrigation dokoohaki et al 2017 or drip irrigation anothai et al 2013 in all of these studies the ceres maize model has shown to be accurate in simulating soil moisture content and using this model in semi arid regions hammad et al 2018 with precipitation greater than 150 mm has been acknowledged as a good tool in estimating soil moisture according to amiri et al 2022 the model is very accurate in sm simulation in full irrigation management and it has less accurate in deficit irrigation our results in the whole soil profile in full irrigation treatments of exp 1 and exp 3 showed that the nrmse of the soil moisture simulation under dti in fw 100 5 75 nrmse 13 03 was more accurate than limited wetted width 14 11 nrmse 17 98 in an arid area with no precipitation during the growing season it appears that using different irrigation systems with well irrigated results in a better match between simulation and measured soil moisture but when drip irrigation was used with deficit management it decreased accuracy since the movement of water was not 1 d and did not follow tipping bucket method 3 3 3 actual maize evapotranspiration etc and water productivity wp the calculated etc in exp 1 was 516 9 15 9 mm for f2w1 565 3 17 9 mm for f2w2 616 1 25 8 mm for f2w3 and 653 6 24 1 mm for f2w4 in exp 3 etc for all three full irrigation managements ranged between 552 and 599 mm 573 7 7 8 mm in i1 552 7 8 9 mm in i2 and 599 3 20 9 mm in i3 fig 6 the simulated and observed cumulative etc was compared showing a good agreement for exp 1 rmse was 28 81 mm and nrmse was 4 90 for all four irrigation levels and three n fertilizer treatments for exp 3 rmse was 46 41 mm while nrmse was 8 60 for all six combinations of irrigation managements and the initial soil n fig 6a and 6c the negative mbe confirmed that the simulated etc was lower than the observed etc in exp 1 and exp 3 the nrmse and the d index for etc simulation showed that the ceres maize model s performance was better for exp 1 with a nrmse of 4 90 and a d index of 0 85 than for exp 3 with a nrmse of 8 60 and the d index of 0 46 fig 6 the higher value of the nrmse lower accuracy in exp 1 as compared to exp 3 for etc simulation could be due to the existence of a combination of three n fertilizers and four irrigation levels overall the model had a good performance for simulating etc under limited fw 70 compared to unlimited wetting widths fw 100 for the full irrigation level under dti in another study the nrmse of etc was reported to be near 10 anothai et al 2013 similar to our results dejonge et al 2011 reported that the simulated etc was lower than the observed value for deficict and full irrigation levels under sprinkler irrigation the model simulated wp fairly well for fw 70 exp 1 as shown by a nrmse of 13 26 also the estimated wp was very good for fw 100 exp 3 with a nrmse of 6 31 figs 6b and 6d this difference in wp simulation could be due to deficit irrigation levels and n stress in the experiment fw 70 it may also be related to the soil wetted width in fw 70 for the applied n fertilizer treatments f2 and f3 there was a good agreement between simulated and observed wp under full and over irrigation levels fig 6 evett and tolk 2009 also mentioned the crop model could simulate wp acceptably when the treatments were without stress the overestimated etc and the underestimated yield in water stress treatments made the simulation of wp for these treatments less accurate this is noted that in areas with limited water resources deficit irrigation may be a better option for managing water resources however previous studies suggest that this is not true for all irrigated cropping systems rodrigues et al 2013 oktem et al 2008 we observed the highest water productivity in full and over irrigated treatments this could be due to climate soil moisture storage and irrigation system in the study area rainfall is less than 130 mm per year and soil moisture storage to a depth of 150 cm reaches pwp value in drip tape irrigation on the other hand only a portion of the soil is wetted and deficit irrigation requires very careful management practically due to the investment made in irrigation systems farmers are not interested in reducing yield due to deficit irrigation a few farmers even use a little more irrigation water in drip tape irrigation systems to increase physical and economic productivity 3 3 4 soil no3 n the simulated soil nitrogen concentration was compared with field data collected twice during the growing season the results of the evaluation for exp 1 are shown in figs 7 and 8 the results of the comparison in exp 3 are also shown in figs 9 and 10 in the following section the trend of soil nitrogen for exp 1 and exp 3 is discussed individually 3 3 4 1 experiment 1 underwater stress and limited wetting width fw 70 in the tasseling stage 67 dap for all three fertilizer levels the results confirmed that the simulated no3 n was less than the measured value in all irrigation levels for the two soil layers of 0 20 and 20 40 cm fig 7 on average for all irrigation levels the model accuracy in predicting no3 n was higher for f2 with a rmse of 7 42 mg n kg 1 soil f1 with a rmse of 7 77 mg n kg 1 soil and f3 with a rmse of 8 64 mg n kg 1 soil overall for three nitrogen fertilizer levels the model s accuracy was higher for w4 w1 w3 and w2 with a rmse of 7 04 7 26 7 99 and 9 47 mg n kg 1 soil respectively fig 8 the date at which maize was harvested for silage fig 8 on average for all irrigation levels the model s accuracy for simulating no3 n was higher for the f2 f3 and f1 treatments with a rmse of 4 54 4 99 and 6 53 mg n kg 1 soil respectively considering all three nitrogen fertilizer levels the model s accuracy was higher for the w4 w3 w1 and w2 treatments with a rmse of 3 28 4 93 5 57 7 63 mg n kg 1 soil fig 8 the model s accuracy was very good for all soil layers for f2 and f3 treatments with 253 and 297 kg total available n n fertilizer initial soil n no3 n of irrigation water per hectare for all four irrigation levels several studies have shown that the model has a better performance for soil nitrogen simulation under n fertilizer treatments than for no n fertilizer treatment under rainfed li et al 2015 and irrigated he et al 2011 jing et al 2016 conditions for the f2 and f3 treatments the accuracy of the model was high for the 20 40 cm soil layer as compared to 0 20 and 40 60 cm soil layers under deficit irrigation levels also the accuracy of the model was high for the 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil layer as compared to 0 20 cm soil layers under full and over irrigation levels fig 8 which could be due to the soil wetting front under the drip tape irrigation system which influenced soil n distribution the accumulation of nitrate concentration in the edge of the wetting pattern has been reported by li et al 2003 in the field for the topsoil layer the model s accuracy was improved with increasing the n fertilizer for each irrigation level this difference in the accuracy of the model for the simulation of the soil n in the soil layer has also been reported by malik et al 2019 under the sprinkler system limited wetting width and deficit irrigation treatments have intensified the difference between simulated and observed soil no3 n concentration in dti water is distributed in a three dimensional pattern grecco et al 2019 kilic 2019 and nutrients move with the wetting pattern li and liu 2011 our finding is in accordance with the scientific support of the model reporting that the csm ceres maize model does not consider horizontal movement for water and solutes in the soil because by default the soil water and nitrogen balance are simulated for a one dimensional soil profile porter et al 2010 the measured field data of no3 n in the silage harvest date had a higher standard division as compared to the tassel stage it could be due to the intensity of the effect of nitrogen and water levels on the maize growth and maize root development with the subsequent effect being on water and nitrogen uptake from the soil profile 3 3 4 2 experiment 3 full irrigation and no limited wetting width fw 100 in exp 3 fw 100 the trend of the simulated no3 n in the soil profile was similar to that of the observed data at the first sampling date 84 dap on average for all irrigation levels the model s accuracy for the prediction of no3 n was higher for nseq with the rmse of 1 48 mg n kg 1 soil and nfal with rmse 2 03 mg n kg 1 soil on average for two initial nitrogen conditions nseq and nfal the model s accuracy was better in i3 with the rmse of 1 15 mg n kg 1 soil than in i2 with the rmse of 2 03 mg n kg 1 soil and i1 with the rmse of 2 08 mg n kg 1 soil fig 9 at 109 dap in nfal the rmse was 2 67 1 78 and 1 96 mg n kg 1 soil for i1 i2 and i3 respectively in nseq the rmse was 0 66 mg n kg 1 for i1 0 63 mg n kg 1 for i2 and 0 92 mg n kg 1 for i3 fig 10 the value of the measured soil no3 n varied for different soil layers water and n treatments as well as for different experiments these higher mean values could be due to the different initial soil n time and amount of fertigation and irrigation levels other researchers have also reported that irrigation level n rate and initial soil n have a significant effect on the nitrate distribution in the soil tirado corbal et al 2019 singh et al 2002 the model s accuracy for both experiments was higher for the second sampling date which could be due to the root growth development and enough time after the last fertigation for both sampling dates the rmse was in the range of 2 73 9 52 mg kg 1 soil for full and over irrigation levels in exp 1 while it varied from 0 63 to 2 69 mg kg 1 soil for all full irrigation management in exp 3 figs 8 and 10 the model s accuracy was higher for exp 3 as compared to exp 1 fw 70 for the same irrigation levels which could be due to percent of wetting pattern under drip tape irrigation system recall exp 3 treatments involved complete irrigation with the 100 wetting pattern so this condition could be appropriate to consider the one dimensional movement of water in the soil simulation as defined in the csm ceres maize model porter et al 2010 overall in exp 1 for all three n levels and four irrigation levels the rmse was between 2 73 and 10 21 mg n kg 1 soil and between 0 63 and 2 69 mg n kg 1 soil in exp 3 the difference in the rmse value in the simulated soil nitrogen between exp 1 and exp 3 could be due to different wetting widths and different irrigation and n levels similar to our results soil nitrogen was simulated under maize drip irrigation with rmse 4 8 mg n kg 1 soil for the sufficient n and full irrigation treatment bai and gao 2021 in our study there was no n leaching however the effect of soil water on mineralization amouzou et al 2018 may have led to an underestimation of soil no3 n 3 3 5 nitrogen uptake the simulated nitrogen uptake in exp 1 for the no fertilizer level was much lower than shown by the measured data with a rmse being between 49 1 and 82 1 kg ha 1 table 8 the rmse for the n uptake simulation ranged from 5 6 to 32 0 kg ha 1 for the f2 treatment and from 3 9 to 37 5 kg ha 1 for the f3 treatment with the nrmse 9 2 except f2w4 and f3w4 was below 15 3 in exp 3 on all irrigation levels the simulated nitrogen uptake was in agreement with the measured data with the rmse between 8 6 and 16 7 kg ha 1 the nrmse was between 3 6 and 5 1 and the d index was between 0 84 and 0 95 in nfal fig 11 in nseq the statistical parameters were in a good range for the nitrogen uptake simulation with the rmse between 13 3 and 16 7 kg ha 1 the nrmse was in the range of 6 5 8 3 and the d index was in the range of 0 60 0 88 the negative mbe parameter in nfali1 and nfali3 showed a less simulated value in comparison to the measured one the positive mbe parameter showed a greater simulated value when compared to the measured value in other treatments these results correspond to the accuracy of the model in the soil no3 n prediction as mentioned before the model s accuracy was low for the no n fertilizer treatment overall for all irrigation levels and two nitrogen fertilizer levels f2 and f3 in exp 1 the nrmse for n uptake was between 1 9 and 15 3 and nrmse in all treatments of exp 3 was less than 9 6 so the model s accuracy was very good for nitrogen uptake simulation under sufficient n fertilizer application and irrigation of maize in the drip tape irrigation system with the different soil wetted width the low model s accuracy in the simulation of nu for no n treatments under different irrigation levels in this study has also been supported by salmerón et al 2014 reporting that the ceres maize model simulated plant n concentrations at harvest 57 less than that by the measured data 4 conclusion for both maize varieties the ceres maize model was calibrated and six genotypes coefficients of p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint as well as nitrogen stress coefficient of ctcnp2 were adjusted in terms of soil moisture prediction overall for all soil layers we concluded that the accuracy of the model was higher for full irrigation levels in unlimited wetting widths than for full irrigation level in limited wetting widths deficit irrigation levels and over irrigation level accuracy of model accuracy was good for etc in limited wetting widths and was good for wp for unlimited wetting widths the model s accuracy in wp simulation was higher for no water stress treatments the amount of the simulated soil no3 n content was affected by irrigation and n levels as well as the soil wetted width under the dti system there were no specific trends for the model accuracy in simulating soil no3 n among different levels of water and nitrogen in the tassel stage and the date for the silage harvest generally the variation in the predicted no3 n inside the soil layers was higher for full and over irrigation levels as compared to the deficit irrigation levels under the drip tape irrigation system we concluded the cerec maize model was accurate for tb lai sm etc wp soil no3 n and nu simulation under additional nitrogen and no water stress levels for soil nitrogen and nu model accuracy is better for full and over irrigation than deficit irrigation for limited wetting width the model s accuracy regarding dti for sm wp soil no3 n and nu were higher for unlimited wetting width than under limited wetting width for full irrigation levels in an arid area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9417,nutrients and nitrate move to the boundary of the wetted zone under drip tape irrigation dti of row crops so irrigation depth wetted width and irrigation frequency are the most important factors in managing the wetting front and keeping n in the root zone many farmers in arid regions who have changed their irrigation systems to dti but they are still applying n in two splits as they are used for surface and sprinkler irrigation crop models can be used to optimize the timing and amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to minimize both n leaching and the amount of n remaining in the soil

measured at three distances from the planting row and three soil depths in exp 1 and exp 3 during two maize growth stages the fraction of the wetted width fw along drip tape was 70 in exp 1 and 100 in exp 3 referred to as fw 70 and fw 100 respectively the results showed good performance of the model for simulating tb and lai with nrmse 21 9 for the two hybrids in the applied n fertilizer treatments the accuracy of the simulation of sm and wp in fw 100 was better than that of fw 70 simulated no3 n followed the observed trend for fw 100 while model performance varied for the different irrigation and n levels in fw 70 model accuracy for soil no3 n prediction decreased for the high n fertilizer application under deficit irrigation management these differences were related to the wetting pattern volume the distribution of n in the soil profile and accumulation of soil n under dti overall the model can simulate tb and nu with high accuracy sm with good accuracy and soil no3 n with an acceptable accuracy under dti the accuracy of the model was also higher for the unlimited wetting width as compared to the limited one this study showed that the csm ceres maize model can be used for

semi micro kjeldahl technique bremner and mulvaney 1982 soil no3 n concentration was then measured using the colorimetric method by trans nitration of salicylic acid vendrell and zupancic 1990 in the 410 nm wavelength by a spectrophotometer hach dr6000 loveland co usa 2 3 crop modeling data in this study the cropping system model csm ceres maize of dssat version 4 7 5 was used to simulate the growth development and yield of maize and soil no3 n hoogenboom a b et al 2019 for each field daily weather data such as tmin and tmax mean relative humidity rhmean precipitation pc sunshine hours ss and mean wind speed ws were used with the dssat weatherman tool to create the weather files wth file the field soil information i e percent of silt clay sand and gravel bulk density fc and pwp were used to create soil files using the sbuild tool the experimental and farmer field data i e maize cultivar planting date plant density soil initial n and moisture date and the amounts of water and

tfile data measured tb gy nu and sm throughout the growing season as well as soil no3 n and statistical parameters rmse nrmse d and mbe figs 1 and 2 the calibration of the csm ceres maize was based on the trial and error process for correcting p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint genetic coefficients while ctcnp2 coefficient of n stress for concentration changes as a function of growth stage was modified for n stress the values for the genetic coefficients were calibrated until the simulated date of anthesis and physiological maturity maximum lai laix tb grain yield gy and n uptake nu were similar to the measured values based on the statistical criteria tsuji et al 1998 the values for the six cultivar coefficients of the model were obtained by minimizing the error between simulated and observed data in order to obtain a high r2 and the lowest rmse and nrmse the model was calibrated for two hybrids of maize based on the comparison of the simulated data with observed data tsuji et al 1998 thus the values for six cultivar coefficients were determined by using no water and nitrogen stress treatments and then the ctcnp2 was modified for the n treatments the data used for calibration were the laix tb and gy n uptake and the flowering and maturity dates for no water and n stress treatments during model calibration only data on nu and tb at forage harvest stage gy of harvested stage and laix were used when evaluating the model lai tb and soil water content data taken several times during the growing period n uptake and soil no3 n from two sampling dates and etc and wp for silage harvest stage were utilized the actual evapotranspiration of maize etc was calculated using the soil water balance method gheysari et al 2015 for the hybrid sc704 two treatments with no water and nitrogen stress f2w4 and f3w3 of exp 1 were selected for calibration while the remaining treatments of exp 1 ten treatments and all treatments of exp 2 were used for model evaluation table s2 for the hybrid sc606 we used data from treatments nfali3 and nseqi3 in exp 3 for calibration of genotype specific coefficients table s2 and four remaining nfali1 nfali2 nseqi1 nseqi2 treatments in exp 3 and final total biomass in two farmer fields were used for evaluation the soil sampling depth in exp 1 was different from the soil layers that were used in the model so we used the weighted average for the simulated values as follows 3 c i 1 n c i z i i 1 n z i where c is the weighted average of soil no3 n ci is the simulated no3 n in the soil depth of the layer i and zi is the soil depth of the layer i for the evapotranspiration method we used the default method of the model priestley taylor the ritchie ceres method was utilized to estimate soil evaporation ritchie 1998 soil conservation service and ritchie water balance methods were used for infiltration and hydrology calculation respectively the radiation use efficiency rue was used to simulate photosynthesis the century based som module was used to simulate residual soil nitrogen hoogenboom et al 2019b 2 4 model statistics the ceres maize model was evaluated using four statistical parameters the accuracy of the model was calculated with root

2016 was 63 9 mm for 2017 was 46 9 mm and for 2019 was 132 mm however there was no effective rain i e precipitation greater than 5 mm from june to september during each growing season of the three years of this study the daily average air temperature during the maize growing season ranged from 17 7 to 30 4 c in 2016 18 6 28 2 c in 2017 and 21 6 31 0 c in 2019 table s3 the lowest daily minimum air temperature and the highest daily maximum air temperature during the growing season until the date for the silage harvest were 10 2 c and 38 2 c in 2016 10 0 c and 36 3 c in 2017 and 15 8 c and 38 8 c in 2019 respectively the average relative humidity during the growing season was between 20 3 and 20 9 for the three experiments conducted in 2016 and 2017 and it ranged from 18 2 to 23 0 for two studies conducted in the farmer s field in 2017 and 2019 fig 3 3 2 model calibration the genotype coefficients in ceres maize describe specific properties of cultivars related to their growth and development after trial and error process the thermal time from seedling emergence to the end of the juvenile phase p1 was 300 c day for sc704 and 280 4 c day for sc606 the days delaying the development with photoperiod above 12 5 h p2 was 0 5 for sc704 and 0 209 for sc606 the thermal time from silking to physiological maturity for sc704 was 790 c day and 550 c day for sc606 kernel filling rate g3 was 8 mg day 1 for sc704 and 9 79 mg day 1 for sc606 the phylochron interval was estimated at 53 45 c for sc704 and 53 78 c for sc606 as an improvement for the simulation of nitrogen uptake the nitrogen stress coefficient ctcnp2 defined in the species file was modified and set to 0 16 for sc704 and 0 163 for sc606 tables 4 and 5 other researchers have also modified the nitrogen stress coefficient to improve model accuracy for simulation of crop growth and nitrogen uptake liu et al 2012 yakoub et al 2017 calibration of the phenology date for the flowering and maturity date for sc704 and sc606 matched well to the observed data with nrmse 3 08 0 85 for sc704 and 3 39 2 00 for sc606 table 5 tb was predicted to be 22231 kg ha 1 for sc704 with the nrmse of 5 23 while for the hybrid sc606 it was predicted to be 21844 kg ha 1 with the nrmse of 4 94 the grain yield was estimated with a nrmse of 10 22 for sc704 and 6 75 for sc606 the nrmse for laix was 9 15 for sc704 while it was 2 28 for sc606 the nrmse for nitrogen uptake was 0 43 for sc704 while it was 17 15 for sc606 table 5 these performance indexes showed that the csm ceres maize model could be calibrated for both hybrids sc704 and sc606 under different soil wetted widths of the drip tape irrigation system 3 3 model evaluation 3 3 1 total biomass and leaf area index the simulated tb matched well with the observed data in the applied n fertilizer treatments f2 and f3 for all four irrigation levels in exp 1 and all treatments of exp 2 for the hybrid sc704 with a nrmse between 7 17 and 21 91 and a d index between 0 969 and 0 997 fig 4 there was a similar response for all irrigation treatments for the hybrid sc606 with a nrmse between 11 46 and 15 81 and a d index between 0 984 and 0 991 fig 4 thus the ceres maize model was able to predict yield accurately however there was more discrepancy between the simulated and observed tb for the no nitrogen fertilizer treatments 14 08 nrmse 33 61 in sc704 for exp 1 overall for all three experiments and two farmer s field studies the model evaluation confirmed the ability of the model to simulate the maize tb with a nrmse of less than 16 90 for full irrigation management and less than 17 98 for deficit irrigation for the applied n fertilizer treatments fig 4 however the model accuracy was less for the no n fertilizer treatments 14 08 nrmse 33 61 for limited wetting width under the drip tape irrigation system in agreement with our results the previous research showed that the accuracy of the model was lower in no nitrogen fertilizer conditions as compared to the applied n levels li et al 2015 the difference between simulated and observed tb for the no n fertilizer treatments could be due to possibly nitrogen mineralization and accuracy of the input data for initial soil nitrogen in this study we measured no3 n as initial soil nitrogen and nh4 n was not measured also it might be due to the dssat crop model s sensitivity to nitrogen stress as opposed to real crop growth without fertilizer n li et al 2015 in exp 3 the treatments consisting of irrigation at different soil suction thresholds included 20 and 40 kpa which all thresholds were reasonably good for the maize growth hoffman et al 2007 the irrigation depth for all three irrigation treatments was calculated based on the amount of water required to replenish soil water depletion to the fc point as a result there was no water stress for all three irrigation treatments remarkably field measured data showed that tb was affected by these three irrigation treatments under drip tape irrigation however the ceres maize model could not distinguish the differences in value of silage tb for the applied soil suction thresholds in this study it may be caused by the tipping bucket method boote et al 2008 used in the ceres maize model for balancing soil water in which water movements in the soil are one dimensional while the movement of water in soil under drip irrigation is two dimensional the simulated lai agreed with the observed values for all four irrigation levels of exp 1 and exp 2 with the nrmse being between 8 99 and 20 16 and a d index between 0 813 and 0 972 for all n treatments for the hybrid sc704 however the nrmse was between 30 70 and 37 62 and the d index was between 0 703 and 0 832 for the no fertilizer treatment fig 5 simulated lai was close to the observed lai for the hybrid sc606 with a nrmse of 8 37 15 30 and a d index of 0 805 0 964 in all irrigation levels fig 5 for lai the model gave an nrmse of less than 20 16 for all experiments and for the farmer s field studies for all irrigation levels deficit to over irrigation and the n fertilizer treatments fig 5 the rmse for simulating lai reported between 0 66 and 1 18 under drip irrigation saseendran et al 2014 overall the model accuracy for simulating tb and lai was good for both the deficit and over irrigation levels with limited and unlimited wetting widths for the dti system we could however not find any specific trend for model accuracy among the different irrigation levels and n fertilizer treatments in the farmer s fields f2 and f3 in exp 1 and the experimental treatments of exp 2 and exp 3 however the model was more accurate in exp 3 as compared to exp 1 and exp 2 which could be due to the unlimited wetted width in exp 3 for the no n fertilizer application treatment with the limited wetting width under dti the model performance was less possibly due to model initialization at the start of the simulation and som mineralization 3 3 2 soil moisture the results of evaluation of soil moisture content for three soil layers and the entire soil profile for four irrigation levels in exp 1 table 6 and all treatments in exp 3 are presented in table 7 nrmse value and d index value for the severe deficit irrigation level w1 were 27 61 and 0 71 for layer 1 22 12 and 0 80 for layer 2 and 18 33 and 0 81 for layer 3 respectively table 6 although nrmse values for moderate deficit irrigation were similar to those of w1 the model gave a lower nrmse in layers 1 24 96 layer 2 17 53 and layers 3 13 47 than those seen in w1 the d index value was 0 7 in layer 1 0 8 in layer 2 and 0 54 in layer 3 in the full irrigation level the nrmse and d index for the first layer were 23 38 and 0 62 whereas for the second layer they were 25 84 and 0 42 the nrmse value for the third layer was 15 36 and the d index was 0 78 the nrmse value and d index for over irrigation treatment were 24 73 and 0 72 in layer 1 27 45 and 0 62 in layer 2 and 15 13 and 0 62 in layer 3 totally layer s accuracy was within acceptable limits nrmse 30 but it can be concluded that the accuracy of model in first layer was the lowest and in the deeper layer model has more accurate using sprinkler irrigation dokoohaki et al 2017 reported a lower level of soil moisture accuracy in the top layer in the case of sprinkler irrigation the model has a higher accuracy 7 77 nrmse 16 1 than when drip irrigation was used with deficit irrigation 13 47 nrmse 27 61 which is possibly due to the similarity of the pattern of water distribution in the soil in the sprinkler irrigation system one dimensional with the method of water movement in soil the tipping bucket used in the dssat model in exp 3 the model s accuracy was evaluated for two soil water layers 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm and the complete soil profile 0 40 cm table 7 for the nfali1 treatment the nrmse was less than 7 48 for layer 1 and 16 90 for layer 2 with soil moisture predicted well for both layers for the nseqi1 treatment the nrmse was less than 20 6 12 59 and 20 55 for soil moisture the model accuracy for the nseqi1 treatment was less than for the nfali1 treatment for the nfali2 treatment the nrmse value in layer 1 was 11 48 and for layer 2 was 10 44 while in nseqi2 it was 10 28 for layer 1 and 14 94 for layer 2 the d index value in two layers and two treatments was less than 0 50 0 41 0 50 which means that simulated soil moisture had a poor to moderate agreement with the observed soil moisture the nrmse value for the entire profile 0 40 cm for the nfal and nseq treatments was 10 31 and 5 75 respectively and indicated a good simulation and the d index values of 0 36 and 0 72 indicated a moderate agreement for the simulation in nfali3 the nrmse value was less than 9 46 and the d index was 0 57 for layer 1 for the second layer the nrmse was 8 62 and the d index was 0 58 for the nseqi3 treatment the nrmse was 11 90 and 11 37 and the d index was 0 49 and 0 59 for layer 1 and layer 2 respectively there was moderate agreement between simulated and observed soil moisture for these treatments the average soil moisture for complete soil profile 0 40 cm model was more accurate in nfal 5 82 nrmse 10 31 than nseq 5 75 nrmse 13 03 overall considering the entire profile the d index was higher for the deficit irrigation levels 0 75 0 77 compare to full and over irrigation 0 54 and 0 70 the nrmse value was 17 87 in severe deficit irrigation 14 11 in moderate deficit irrigation 14 82 in full irrigation and 17 98 in over irrigation exp 3 was a fully irrigated experiment with varying allowable soil water thresholds as previously mentioned overall for the entire soil profile the accuracy of the model was higher for i3 i2 and i1 with nrmses of 6 99 8 03 and 11 17 respectively the d index was higher for i1 0 63 i3 0 61 and i2 0 54 respectively the accuracy of the dssat for simulation of soil moisture was reported under surface irrigation hammad et al 2018 sprinkler irrigation dokoohaki et al 2017 or drip irrigation anothai et al 2013 in all of these studies the ceres maize model has shown to be accurate in simulating soil moisture content and using this model in semi arid regions hammad et al 2018 with precipitation greater than 150 mm has been acknowledged as a good tool in estimating soil moisture according to amiri et al 2022 the model is very accurate in sm simulation in full irrigation management and it has less accurate in deficit irrigation our results in the whole soil profile in full irrigation treatments of exp 1 and exp 3 showed that the nrmse of the soil moisture simulation under dti in fw 100 5 75 nrmse 13 03 was more accurate than limited wetted width 14 11 nrmse 17 98 in an arid area with no precipitation during the growing season it appears that using different irrigation systems with well irrigated results in a better match between simulation and measured soil moisture but when drip irrigation was used with deficit management it decreased accuracy since the movement of water was not 1 d and did not follow tipping bucket method 3 3 3 actual maize evapotranspiration etc and water productivity wp the calculated etc in exp 1 was 516 9 15 9 mm for f2w1 565 3 17 9 mm for f2w2 616 1 25 8 mm for f2w3 and 653 6 24 1 mm for f2w4 in exp 3 etc for all three full irrigation managements ranged between 552 and 599 mm 573 7 7 8 mm in i1 552 7 8 9 mm in i2 and 599 3 20 9 mm in i3 fig 6 the simulated and observed cumulative etc was compared showing a good agreement for exp 1 rmse was 28 81 mm and nrmse was 4 90 for all four irrigation levels and three n fertilizer treatments for exp 3 rmse was 46 41 mm while nrmse was 8 60 for all six combinations of irrigation managements and the initial soil n fig 6a and 6c the negative mbe confirmed that the simulated etc was lower than the observed etc in exp 1 and exp 3 the nrmse and the d index for etc simulation showed that the ceres maize model s performance was better for exp 1 with a nrmse of 4 90 and a d index of 0 85 than for exp 3 with a nrmse of 8 60 and the d index of 0 46 fig 6 the higher value of the nrmse lower accuracy in exp 1 as compared to exp 3 for etc simulation could be due to the existence of a combination of three n fertilizers and four irrigation levels overall the model had a good performance for simulating etc under limited fw 70 compared to unlimited wetting widths fw 100 for the full irrigation level under dti in another study the nrmse of etc was reported to be near 10 anothai et al 2013 similar to our results dejonge et al 2011 reported that the simulated etc was lower than the observed value for deficict and full irrigation levels under sprinkler irrigation the model simulated wp fairly well for fw 70 exp 1 as shown by a nrmse of 13 26 also the estimated wp was very good for fw 100 exp 3 with a nrmse of 6 31 figs 6b and 6d this difference in wp simulation could be due to deficit irrigation levels and n stress in the experiment fw 70 it may also be related to the soil wetted width in fw 70 for the applied n fertilizer treatments f2 and f3 there was a good agreement between simulated and observed wp under full and over irrigation levels fig 6 evett and tolk 2009 also mentioned the crop model could simulate wp acceptably when the treatments were without stress the overestimated etc and the underestimated yield in water stress treatments made the simulation of wp for these treatments less accurate this is noted that in areas with limited water resources deficit irrigation may be a better option for managing water resources however previous studies suggest that this is not true for all irrigated cropping systems rodrigues et al 2013 oktem et al 2008 we observed the highest water productivity in full and over irrigated treatments this could be due to climate soil moisture storage and irrigation system in the study area rainfall is less than 130 mm per year and soil moisture storage to a depth of 150 cm reaches pwp value in drip tape irrigation on the other hand only a portion of the soil is wetted and deficit irrigation requires very careful management practically due to the investment made in irrigation systems farmers are not interested in reducing yield due to deficit irrigation a few farmers even use a little more irrigation water in drip tape irrigation systems to increase physical and economic productivity 3 3 4 soil no3 n the simulated soil nitrogen concentration was compared with field data collected twice during the growing season the results of the evaluation for exp 1 are shown in figs 7 and 8 the results of the comparison in exp 3 are also shown in figs 9 and 10 in the following section the trend of soil nitrogen for exp 1 and exp 3 is discussed individually 3 3 4 1 experiment 1 underwater stress and limited wetting width fw 70 in the tasseling stage 67 dap for all three fertilizer levels the results confirmed that the simulated no3 n was less than the measured value in all irrigation levels for the two soil layers of 0 20 and 20 40 cm fig 7 on average for all irrigation levels the model accuracy in predicting no3 n was higher for f2 with a rmse of 7 42 mg n kg 1 soil f1 with a rmse of 7 77 mg n kg 1 soil and f3 with a rmse of 8 64 mg n kg 1 soil overall for three nitrogen fertilizer levels the model s accuracy was higher for w4 w1 w3 and w2 with a rmse of 7 04 7 26 7 99 and 9 47 mg n kg 1 soil respectively fig 8 the date at which maize was harvested for silage fig 8 on average for all irrigation levels the model s accuracy for simulating no3 n was higher for the f2 f3 and f1 treatments with a rmse of 4 54 4 99 and 6 53 mg n kg 1 soil respectively considering all three nitrogen fertilizer levels the model s accuracy was higher for the w4 w3 w1 and w2 treatments with a rmse of 3 28 4 93 5 57 7 63 mg n kg 1 soil fig 8 the model s accuracy was very good for all soil layers for f2 and f3 treatments with 253 and 297 kg total available n n fertilizer initial soil n no3 n of irrigation water per hectare for all four irrigation levels several studies have shown that the model has a better performance for soil nitrogen simulation under n fertilizer treatments than for no n fertilizer treatment under rainfed li et al 2015 and irrigated he et al 2011 jing et al 2016 conditions for the f2 and f3 treatments the accuracy of the model was high for the 20 40 cm soil layer as compared to 0 20 and 40 60 cm soil layers under deficit irrigation levels also the accuracy of the model was high for the 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil layer as compared to 0 20 cm soil layers under full and over irrigation levels fig 8 which could be due to the soil wetting front under the drip tape irrigation system which influenced soil n distribution the accumulation of nitrate concentration in the edge of the wetting pattern has been reported by li et al 2003 in the field for the topsoil layer the model s accuracy was improved with increasing the n fertilizer for each irrigation level this difference in the accuracy of the model for the simulation of the soil n in the soil layer has also been reported by malik et al 2019 under the sprinkler system limited wetting width and deficit irrigation treatments have intensified the difference between simulated and observed soil no3 n concentration in dti water is distributed in a three dimensional pattern grecco et al 2019 kilic 2019 and nutrients move with the wetting pattern li and liu 2011 our finding is in accordance with the scientific support of the model reporting that the csm ceres maize model does not consider horizontal movement for water and solutes in the soil because by default the soil water and nitrogen balance are simulated for a one dimensional soil profile porter et al 2010 the measured field data of no3 n in the silage harvest date had a higher standard division as compared to the tassel stage it could be due to the intensity of the effect of nitrogen and water levels on the maize growth and maize root development with the subsequent effect being on water and nitrogen uptake from the soil profile 3 3 4 2 experiment 3 full irrigation and no limited wetting width fw 100 in exp 3 fw 100 the trend of the simulated no3 n in the soil profile was similar to that of the observed data at the first sampling date 84 dap on average for all irrigation levels the model s accuracy for the prediction of no3 n was higher for nseq with the rmse of 1 48 mg n kg 1 soil and nfal with rmse 2 03 mg n kg 1 soil on average for two initial nitrogen conditions nseq and nfal the model s accuracy was better in i3 with the rmse of 1 15 mg n kg 1 soil than in i2 with the rmse of 2 03 mg n kg 1 soil and i1 with the rmse of 2 08 mg n kg 1 soil fig 9 at 109 dap in nfal the rmse was 2 67 1 78 and 1 96 mg n kg 1 soil for i1 i2 and i3 respectively in nseq the rmse was 0 66 mg n kg 1 for i1 0 63 mg n kg 1 for i2 and 0 92 mg n kg 1 for i3 fig 10 the value of the measured soil no3 n varied for different soil layers water and n treatments as well as for different experiments these higher mean values could be due to the different initial soil n time and amount of fertigation and irrigation levels other researchers have also reported that irrigation level n rate and initial soil n have a significant effect on the nitrate distribution in the soil tirado corbal et al 2019 singh et al 2002 the model s accuracy for both experiments was higher for the second sampling date which could be due to the root growth development and enough time after the last fertigation for both sampling dates the rmse was in the range of 2 73 9 52 mg kg 1 soil for full and over irrigation levels in exp 1 while it varied from 0 63 to 2 69 mg kg 1 soil for all full irrigation management in exp 3 figs 8 and 10 the model s accuracy was higher for exp 3 as compared to exp 1 fw 70 for the same irrigation levels which could be due to percent of wetting pattern under drip tape irrigation system recall exp 3 treatments involved complete irrigation with the 100 wetting pattern so this condition could be appropriate to consider the one dimensional movement of water in the soil simulation as defined in the csm ceres maize model porter et al 2010 overall in exp 1 for all three n levels and four irrigation levels the rmse was between 2 73 and 10 21 mg n kg 1 soil and between 0 63 and 2 69 mg n kg 1 soil in exp 3 the difference in the rmse value in the simulated soil nitrogen between exp 1 and exp 3 could be due to different wetting widths and different irrigation and n levels similar to our results soil nitrogen was simulated under maize drip irrigation with rmse 4 8 mg n kg 1 soil for the sufficient n and full irrigation treatment bai and gao 2021 in our study there was no n leaching however the effect of soil water on mineralization amouzou et al 2018 may have led to an underestimation of soil no3 n 3 3 5 nitrogen uptake the simulated nitrogen uptake in exp 1 for the no fertilizer level was much lower than shown by the measured data with a rmse being between 49 1 and 82 1 kg ha 1 table 8 the rmse for the n uptake simulation ranged from 5 6 to 32 0 kg ha 1 for the f2 treatment and from 3 9 to 37 5 kg ha 1 for the f3 treatment with the nrmse 9 2 except f2w4 and f3w4 was below 15 3 in exp 3 on all irrigation levels the simulated nitrogen uptake was in agreement with the measured data with the rmse between 8 6 and 16 7 kg ha 1 the nrmse was between 3 6 and 5 1 and the d index was between 0 84 and 0 95 in nfal fig 11 in nseq the statistical parameters were in a good range for the nitrogen uptake simulation with the rmse between 13 3 and 16 7 kg ha 1 the nrmse was in the range of 6 5 8 3 and the d index was in the range of 0 60 0 88 the negative mbe parameter in nfali1 and nfali3 showed a less simulated value in comparison to the measured one the positive mbe parameter showed a greater simulated value when compared to the measured value in other treatments these results correspond to the accuracy of the model in the soil no3 n prediction as mentioned before the model s accuracy was low for the no n fertilizer treatment overall for all irrigation levels and two nitrogen fertilizer levels f2 and f3 in exp 1 the nrmse for n uptake was between 1 9 and 15 3 and nrmse in all treatments of exp 3 was less than 9 6 so the model s accuracy was very good for nitrogen uptake simulation under sufficient n fertilizer application and irrigation of maize in the drip tape irrigation system with the different soil wetted width the low model s accuracy in the simulation of nu for no n treatments under different irrigation levels in this study has also been supported by salmerón et al 2014 reporting that the ceres maize model simulated plant n concentrations at harvest 57 less than that by the measured data 4 conclusion for both maize varieties the ceres maize model was calibrated and six genotypes coefficients of p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint as well as nitrogen stress coefficient of ctcnp2 were adjusted in terms of soil moisture prediction overall for all soil layers we concluded that the accuracy of the model was higher for full irrigation levels in unlimited wetting widths than for full irrigation level in limited wetting widths deficit irrigation levels and over irrigation level accuracy of model accuracy was good for etc in limited wetting widths and was good for wp for unlimited wetting widths the model s accuracy in wp simulation was higher for no water stress treatments the amount of the simulated soil no3 n content was affected by irrigation and n levels as well as the soil wetted width under the dti system there were no specific trends for the model accuracy in simulating soil no3 n among different levels of water and nitrogen in the tassel stage and the date for the silage harvest generally the variation in the predicted no3 n inside the soil layers was higher for full and over irrigation levels as compared to the deficit irrigation levels under the drip tape irrigation system we concluded the cerec maize model was accurate for tb lai sm etc wp soil no3 n and nu simulation under additional nitrogen and no water stress levels for soil nitrogen and nu model accuracy is better for full and over irrigation than deficit irrigation for limited wetting width the model s accuracy regarding dti for sm wp soil no3 n and nu were higher for unlimited wetting width than under limited wetting width for full irrigation levels in an arid area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9418,improvement in seed vigor and yield of hybrid maize is required to ensure food security optimal planting density and irrigation depth are critical for hybrid maize seed production in arid areas using data from 2012 to 2017 a new integrated model optimized planting density and border irrigation depth for achieving high yield and seed vigor of hybrid maize under limited water availability for field experiments a planting density of 9 75 plants m 2 under full irrigation was in the control treatment the results showed that water deficit decreased yield evapotranspiration and aboveground biomass per plant the highest yield was obtained for the planting density of 12 75 plants m 2 under full irrigation the single crop coefficient and crop water production function models were modified to simulate evapotranspiration and yield respectively using kernel number per plant and plant growth rate during the flowering stage a kernel weight model was established the maximum yield and minimum irrigation depth were weighted and kernel weight was constrained three minimum relative kernel weight rkwmin options were considered option 1 with rkwmin 1 00 control option 2 with rkwmin 0 unconstrained and option 3 with rkwmin ranged from 0 60 to 0 90 in option 1 the optimal irrigation depth during the growing season under control planting density decreased by 24 3 39 4 compared to the conventional practices in option 2 yield increased but average kernel weight decreased by 25 than control in the option 3 average yield and water use efficiency increased by 9 2 and 6 5 compared to option 1 respectively the average planting density decreased by 10 2 yield reduced by 2 0 and water use efficiency reduced by 1 7 but kernel weight increased by 9 compared to option 2 thus option 3 can be recommended for hybrid maize seed production with limited water availability in arid regions of northwest china our research provided a new theoretical method to improve yield and ensure seed

at the ith growth stage 1 introduction global maize production in 2018 was 1 12 billion tons which was highly dependent on the development of hybrid maize seed production industry jiang et al 2020 hexi corridor located in the arid areas of northwestern china has suitable natural isolation conditions and abundant light and heat resources the area used for hybrid maize seed production is 86700 hm2 and produces over 13 of the total hybrid maize seeds in the world arisnabarreta and solari 2017 wang et al 2017 maize inbred lines have become the main irrigated crop in the region which have large evapotranspiration approximately 500 mm during the growing season jiang et al 2016 border irrigation under mulch is widely used to maintain soil temperature and water content however the climate of the area is arid and the production of hybrid maize seeds is limited by water availability guo et al 2018 wang et al 2020 therefore increasing the production of hybrid maize seeds under limited water availability in arid areas could play an important role in ensuring food and water security kang et al 2017 irrigation is important for increasing crop yield and agriculture consumes 70 of available water resources in the world li et al 2020 it is predicted that food production will increase by 60 by 2050 fao 2011 and deficit irrigation would be an important strategy to improve water use efficiency and to ensure water security a mild water stress at the early growth stage of maize can promote plant growth stimulate root activity improve plant acclimatization and increase grain yield kang et al 2000 harb et al 2010 chai et al 2016 however a severe water stress can inhibit cell division and differentiation reduce photosynthesis rate break enzyme system balance and decrease grain yield pandey et al 2000 çakir 2004 yuan et al 2019 increasing planting density is one of the main cultivation techniques to increase maize yield which increases resources use efficiency to a certain extent assefa et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 however high plant density increases competition among plants for resources and reduces grain yield therefore optimizing the effects of water deficit and planting density on seeds yield is important for sustainable maize production in arid areas in previous researches relationships among yield planting density and irrigation depths were used to optimize the planting density and depth of irrigation for maize ben et al 2016 guo et al 2021 in addition peake et al 2008 used the apsim model to optimize plant population and irrigation strategies for maize in a farm in queensland little information is available about optimal planting densities under deficit irrigation of hybrid maize seed seed vigor may influence crop yield by emergence rate seedling vigor and uniformity ghassemi golezani and dalil 2014 which are positively correlated with kernel weight ambika et al 2014 researches have shown that increasing planting density and reducing irrigation depth decreases seed vigor by reducing kernel weight ghassemi golezani and soltani 1997 takele and farrant 2010 miya et al 2017 eskandari et al 2018 lafta and chilab 2019 thus the desired kernel weight should be guaranteed when optimizing planting density and irrigation schedule for hybrid maize seed production crop models play important roles in obtaining efficient and reasonable agricultural management zhang et al 2019 the crop coefficient reference evapotranspiration is a simple and useful method to estimate actual evapotranspiration and crop coefficient can be derived from single and dual crop coefficient methods jiang et al 2014 in the single crop coefficient method the basal crop and soil evaporation coefficients are combined and a stress coefficient is added allen et al 1998 water production functions can quantify the relationship between crop yield and evapotranspiration with the integration of soil salinity and nitrogen in recent years he et al 2016 hu et al 2020 wang et al 2021 in addition maize kernel weight can be calculated by yield and kernel number and kernel number is closely related to the plant growth rate around flowering gambín et al 2006 2008 borrás and gambín 2010 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the response of crop evapotranspiration and growth of hybrid maize to different irrigation and planting densities 2 establish crop models to predict evapotranspiration yield and kernel weight of hybrid maize seeds under different irrigation and planting density strategies 3 optimize planting density and border irrigation depth to save water improve yield and ensure seed vigor of hybrid maize under limited water availability 2 material and methods 2 1 field experiments 2 1 1 experimental site field

basal fertilizers and soil surface was partially covered with polyethylene transparent plastic film 0 015 mm thick and 1 2 m wide and 0 4 m width of bare soil between two strips of plastic film mulch fig a1 top dressing of 364 kg n hm 2 was made at the vegetative stage the cultivars of hybrid maize the proportion of male and female plants and planting and harvest dates were the same as local standard practice during 2012 and 2017 table 1 the two inbred male batches were planted in the same rows with six plants each from the first and second batches placed in an alternating pattern and the inbred female lines were detasseled before tassel emergence weeding and pest control measures followed local practices the study consisted of three experiments of which exp i was a single factor experiment of planting density exp ii was a single factor experiment of irrigation and exp iii was a two factor coupling experiment of planting density and irrigation the experimental designs in different seasons are presented in table 1 all treatments had the same row spacing of 40 cm each year and the irrigation method was border irrigation the data of exp i and exp ii have been published in previous research jiang et al 2014 2018 wang et al 2017 2019 in exp i five planting densities total of male and female inbreds of 6 75 d1 8 25 d2 9 75 d3 11 25 d4 and 12 75 d5 plants m 2 were used

farmers use a planting density of 9 75 plants m 2 d3 which in this study was the control treatment according to conventional practices maize was irrigated 4 5 times during the season and total irrigation applied was 400 500 mm in exp ii three irrigation levels full irrigation labeled as ck 1 2 of full irrigation labeled as 1 2 and no irrigation labeled as 0 were applied at the vegetative v flowering f grain filling g and ripening r stages planting density was 9 75 plants m 2 spacing of 25 6 cm nine irrigations were applied in 2014 and 11 in 2015 in the control treatment vckfck the lower and upper irrigation limits were 70 2 and 100 of field water capacity respectively the irrigation depths of different treatments at each growth stage are presented in table a2 in exp iii there were 12 treatments in 2015 with different combinations of three irrigation levels full irrigation wck 2 3 of full irrigation w2 3 and 1 3 of full irrigation w1 3 during the growing season and four planting densities 8 25 d2 9 75 d3 11 25 d4 and 12 75 d5 plants m 2 were used in 2016 the w1 3 was replaced by 1 2 of full irrigation w1 2 but other irrigation levels were consistent with 2015 there were six treatments in 2017 with different combinations of three irrigation levels full irrigation wck 2 3 of full irrigation w2 3 and 2 3 of full irrigation except for full irrigation at the flowering stage w2 3 and two planting densities 9 75 d3 and 12 75 d5 plants m 2 were applied the irrigation depths of all treatments were calculated according to the control treatment wckd3 under wckd3 the lower and upper irrigation limits were 75 2 and 100 of field water capacity respectively the design of planting spacing was consistent with exp i the area of each experimental plot was 9 6 m 7 0 m in 2015 and 2016 and 22 0 m 6 4 m in 2017 the irrigation depths for different treatments at each growth stage are presented in table a3 the experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replicates per treatment in both years a buffer area about 1 m wide separated different treatments all the experiments were common in some experimental and field management aspects and all the irrigation events in the different treatments were consistent with control 2 1 3 leaf area index every 5 7 d five plants per plot were chosen to measure leaf length and the maximum width using a ruler the leaf area was determined by the product of length the maximum width and an adjustment factor of 0 74 li et al 2008 the leaf area index was obtained by the ratio of leaf area per plant and land area per plant 2 1 4 soil water content and crop evapotranspiration the soil water content was measured by the diviner 2000 sentek pty ltd adelaide australia every 3 5 d as well as before and after irrigation and rain at a depth of 1 m with vertical interval of 10 cm in each plot two pvc tubes were installed below the bare soil and mulch and the measurements were calibrated by the gravimetric method crop evapotranspiration was estimated using the soil water balance method as follow 1 et a ep iw sr dd cr δ sf δ sw where et a is actual evapotranspiration mm ep is effective precipitation mm iw is the irrigation water depth mm sr is surface runoff mm dd is deep drainage mm cr is capillary rise from a shallow water table towards the root zone mm sf is difference between subsurface flow in

total precipitation per event mm sf was minor and can be ignored allen et al 1998 cr can also be negligible because the groundwater level is below 25 m from surface according to the observational data dd can be ignored because soil water content at the 90 100 cm layer remained unchanged after irrigation and rainfall events jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2019 in addition sr was zero as the experimental site is flat and the intensity of precipitation was low eq 1 was simplified as follow 3 et a ep iw δ sw 2 1 5 aboveground biomass and yield at the end of each growth stage six female plants from each treatment were oven dried at 85 c to constant weight to obtain the aboveground biomass at least 20 female plants at the center of each plot were chosen randomly and dried at 75 c to obtain the yield per plant and kernel weight yield per plant and kernel weight were normalized to a kernel water content of 13 and kernel number per plant was calculated by dividing the yield per plant by kernel weight final yield was the product of yield per plant and planting density 2 1 6 weather data meteorological data were obtained using an automatic weather station hobo onset computer corp bourne ma usa the meteorological data of different growth stages in each year are presented in table a4 2 2 models description 2 2 1 evapotranspiration model the evapotranspiration of hybrid maize seed

model rao et al 1988 16 y a y m i 1 n 1 r i 1 et a i et m i where y a is actual yield g m 2 y m is the maximum yield that can be obtained when water is not limited g m 2 n is the number of growth stages r i is the water sensitivity index at the ith growth stage and et mi is the evapotranspiration at the ith growth stage of full irrigation mm we made the following modifications to rao model 17 y a y ck b d i 1 n 1 r i d 1 et a i et i full d where y ck is yield of d ck g m 2 b d is a planting density effect function and r i d is the modified water sensitive index at the ith growth stage considering planting density b d is assumed to be a quadratic function of planting density 18 b d c d d ck 2 d d d ck e where c d and e are fitting parameters referring to the modified water nitrogen productivity function wang et al 2021 r i d is determined as follow 19 r i d r w i d d ck λ i where r wi is water sensitive index at the ith growth stage and λ i is the influence factor of planting density on water deficit at the ith growth stage 2 2 3 kernel weight model our previous study showed that the upper limit of relative kernel weight was 1 06 shi et al 2021 therefore the kernel weight can be obtained by y a and kernel number per plant and estimated by the following equation 20 kw min 1 06 kw ck y a 10 3 knp d where kw is kernel weight mg kwck is kw under control mg and knp is kernel number per plant kernels plant 1 a monomolecular model was used to simulate kernel number per plant 21 knp knp ck f e g rpgr f h where knpck is knp under control kernels plant 1 rpgrf is

growth rate during the flowering stage g plant 1 d 1 pgrfck is pgrf under control g plant 1 d 1 b f and b v are the aboveground biomass accumulation at the flowering and vegetative stages respectively g m 2 and b fck and b vck are b f and b v under control respectively g m 2 a logistic equation is usually used to describe the relationship between aboveground biomass accumulation and transpiration

27 max u 1 001 y a 0 001 i 1 n iw i 2 3 2 constraints 2 3 2 1 evapotranspiration constraint the maximum allowable water deficit was set at 50 at each growth stage rao et al 1988 doorenbos and kassam 1996 domínguez et al 2012 grové 2019 and the following equation is used to constrain relative evapotranspiration to be more than 0 5 28 0 5 et i full et a i et i full 2 3 2 2 planting density constraint because models were established based on experimental data the actual planting density should meet following constraint 29 6 75 plants m 2 d 14 25 plants m 2 2 3 2 3 soil water depth constraint to simplify the calculation process the soil water depth at the end of each growth stage was subjected to the following constraint 30 1000 h θ wp sw 1000 h θ fc 2 3 2 4 soil water balance

is added to the optimization system as a constraint 33 rkw kw kw ck rkw min where rkw is relative kernel weight and rkwmin is the minimum relative kernel weight 2 4 data analysis the sas 9 3 sas institute cary usa was used for non linear fitting and two factor variance analysis lingo 11 0 software lindo system inc chicago usa was used to obtain the optimal solution we calibrated models using the data of exp i in 2012 and 2013 exp ii in 2014 and exp iii in 2015 and validated using the remaining data the regression coefficient r coefficient of determination r 2 relative root mean square error rrmse average relative error are modeling efficiency ef nash and sutclffe 1970 and agreement index d ia willmott 1981 were used to evaluate the performance of models 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of planting density and water deficit on evapotranspiration aboveground biomass and yield actual evapotranspiration aboveground biomass per plant sb and actual yield under different treatments of exp iii are presented in table 2 in 2015 2016 and 2017 et a ranged 304 6 501 1 mm 334 5 498 4 mm and 363 9 520 9 mm respectively water deficit had a significant effect on et a p 0 01 during both years farré and faci 2006 igbadun et al 2008 ran et al 2017 wang et al 2021 et a increased significantly with increasing planting density in 2017 p 0 05 in contrast barbieri et al 2012 suggested that planting density did not influence et a and ren et al 2016 highlighted that the response of et a to planting density depended on the hydrological year et a was not influenced by planting density in extremely dry years dry years and mild wet years while increased with increasing planting density in the normal and extremely wet years jia et al 2018 indicated that et a decreased with increasing planting density in the late growth stage in 2015 2016 and 2017 sb ranged 171 05 235 86 g plant 1 176 05 235 84 g plant 1 and 159 38 188 60 g plant 1 respectively sb decreased significantly with decreasing irrigation depth in both years p 0 05 it is reported that water deficit at the vegetative stage inhibits the growth of vegetative organs and reduces biomass accumulation in addition water deficit at the reproductive stage reduced kernel number decreased grain filling rate increased leaf senescence and eventually decreased photosynthate çakir 2004 wang et al 2019 shi et al 2021 increasing planting density decreased sb significantly in 2015 and 2016 p 0 05 but no effect in 2017 the interplant competition under high planting density limits nutrient supply water availability and light interception and decreases photosynthate and growth rate per plant zhang et al 2018 in 2015 2016 and 2017 y a ranged 381 680 g m 2 486 794 g m 2 and 417 556 g m 2 respectively the highest yield was obtained by wckd5 in both years compared to control yield increased by 20 1 8 5 and 18 0 in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively water deficit and planting density had significant effects on y a during both years p 0 01 the two way water deficit planting density interaction for y a was significant at p 0 05 level in 2015 and 2017 and similar results can be found in other studies dordas et al 2018 hao et al 2019 guo et al 2021 3 2 models calibration and validation 3 2 1 parameters calibration the results of calibration of the evapotranspiration model parameters presented in table 3 used the data of exp i in 2012 and 2013 γ i ranged from 0 1996 to 0 6347 which indicated that the evapotranspiration at each growth stage increased with increasing planting density r 2 and rrmse ranged 0 92 0 99 and 0 014 0 050 respectively a quadratic relationship between relative actual yield and relative planting density are shown in fig 1 for the relative planting density of 1 33 the maximum relative actual yield was 1 12 it means that actual yield improved by 12 when planting density was 12 97 plants m 2 luo et al 2020 reported that maximum maize yield was obtained when planting density ranged from 8 0 to 10 5 plants m 2 across major maize regions of china because parent lines of hybrid maize seed were short without heterosis facilitating more tolerant to crowding stress the planting density of the maximum yield in our study was much higher than commercial maize the results of calibration using the data of exp ii in 2014 and exp iii in 2015 of the yield model parameters are presented in table 4 because no irrigation treatments were applied at the seedling stage the water sensitivity index of this stage was not calculated in our study the yield of hybrid maize seeds is most sensitive to water deficit at the flowering stage followed by vegetative grain filling and ripening stages kernel number is more closely correlated to maize yield than kernel weight maddonni et al 1998 alvarez et al 2013 and water deficit at the flowering stage decreases kernel number dramatically wang et al 2018 in most research igbadun et al 2007 domínguez et al 2012 zhang and guo 2016 grové 2019 water sensitive index of the grain filling stage was higher than vegetative stage the pollen number in hybrid maize seed production is less than commercial maize which is only provided by inbred female lines in addition wang et al 2017 indicated that 50 of full irrigation and no irrigation at the vegetative stage decreased kernel number of hybrid maize seed production by 17 9 and 34 7 respectively therefore the yield of hybrid maize seeds was more sensitive to water deficit at the vegetative stage than grain filling stage λ i ranged 1 7277 1 1344 the negative values at the vegetative flowering and grain filling stages indicated that water sensitivity decreased with increasing planting density high planting densities with more female parents to provide pollen guarantee more kernels although water deficit occurred at the vegetative and flowering stages wang et al 2018 because kernel number has been determined at the grain filling and ripening stages kernel weight accounted for the main variation in yield many studies suggested that kernel weight under low planting density was susceptible to water stress at the grain filling stage liang et al 2018 guo et al 2021 at the ripening stage the grain filling rate is low and with increasing plant population senescence rate increases borrás et al 2003 which results in high sensitivity to water deficit larson and clegg 1999 changes in assimilate production by vegetative organs affect assimilate availability to form kernels by increasing the pressure difference of photosynthate transport gambín et al 2008 fig 2a indicates that relative kernel number per plant increased with increasing relative plant growth rate during flowering kiniry et al 1997 suggested kernel number increased linearly with plant growth rate in fact when the assimilate availability approaches saturation the kernel number reaches its maximum therefore rectangular hyperbolic tollenaar et al 1992 cerrudo et al 2020 and monomolecular echarte et al 2004 hernán et al 2021 models were used to describe this relationship the relationship between relative population biomass and relative planting density is shown in fig 2b although high density causes resource limitation at the plant scale it increases resource use efficiency at the population scale the results of calibration of the kernel weight model using the data of exp i in 2012 and 2013 exp ii in 2014 and exp iii in 2015 are given in table 5 with r 2 of 0 82 and rrmse of 0 210 the value of δ in this study is lower than that reported in a previous study ran et al 2019 because crop transpiration was replaced by evapotranspiration in eq 24 and b 0ck is close to the aboveground biomass at the seedling stage of hybrid maize seed production ran et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 ma et al 2022 3 2 2 models validation using the data of exp i in 2014 and 2015 exp ii in 2015 and exp iii in 2016 and 2017 the results of validation of evapotranspiration yield and kernel weight models are presented in fig 3 the values of r r 2 are rrmse ef and d ia ranged 0 97 1 01 0 74 0 92 0 059 0 095 0 076 0 154 0 593 0 922 and 0 906 0 980 respectively the validation results showed that models predicted well the evapotranspiration yield and kernel weight and can be used to optimize planting density and irrigation depth of hybrid maize because the cultivars were different during different growing seasons the relative values were used to build models that can also be applied to other genotypes the proposed integrated model can estimate evapotranspiration yield and kernel weight based on the single crop coefficient method in the original evapotranspiration model allen et al 1998 water stress coefficient requires a daily water balance calculation in this study water stress coefficient was calculated with increasing growth stage which increased simulation accuracy according to the pre analysis the rao model performed better in predicting yield under different water regimes than other water productivity functions data not shown considering the parabolic relationship between yield and planting density as well as the influence of planting density on water sensitivity coefficient the modified rao model underestimated yield by 3 but performed well in predicting yield over a wide range 119 794 g m 2 compared with other yield models such as dssat tsuji et al 1994 apsim mccown et al 1996 wnmm li et al 2007 and aquacrop steduto et al 2009 the modified rao model employs less number of parameters with clear physiological meaning in the kernel weight model the maximum relative kernel weight was limited to 1 06 according to tetio kagho and gardner 1988 kernel weight of hybrid maize was very close to 253 mg when planting density increased to 16 plants m 2 wang et al 2019 showed that the kernel weight of hybrid maize seed production ranged from 155 6 to 178 4 mg when post flowering biomass gain was zero there is no doubt that the above hypotheses were based on kernel formation at the flowering stage therefore the applicability of this model at higher planting densities and the lower limit of kernel weight need to be further investigated in the future 3 3 optimization of different options integrating the evapotranspiration yield kernel weight models objective function and constraints the planting density and irrigation depth of hybrid maize seed production were optimized to save water and improve yield and kernel weight the parameters used in the optimization model are given in tables 3 to 5 a5 and figs 1 2 data in table a5 is derived from the measured average values of field experiments three minimum relative kernel weight rkwmin options were considered and five available water wa scenarios from 150 mm to 350 mm at 50 mm increments were used in each option in the option 1 kernel weight was consistent with control rkwmin 1 00 in the option 2 kernel weight was not constrained rkwmin 0 in the option 3 the values of rkwmin were different under different water availability rkwmin 0 60 0 90 the optimization results of option 1 are presented in table 6 because the initial soil water depth was high no irrigation was required during the seedling stage no irrigation was applied during the ripening stage according to the conventional irrigation schedule when wa 303 0 mm the full irrigation requirement with a planting density of 9 75 plants m 2 was satisfied which was the optimized control the evapotranspiration at the seedling vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages were 33 2 123 7 133 1 142 6 and 45 8 mm respectively irrigation depths at the vegetative flowering and grain filling stages were 60 1 105 9 and 137 0 mm respectively the optimal irrigation depth during the growing season decreased by 24 3 39 4 compared to the conventional practices when water availability decreases reduction in planting density is a viable agronomic measure to improve kernel weight guo et al 2021 when wa was 250 mm planting density evapotranspiration and yield decreased by 19 1 8 9 and 19 1 respectively there were no feasible solutions to meet the kernel weight constraint when wa 238 0 mm in the optimization model this option is suitable for a high seed vigor requirement under limited water availability the results for option 2 are presented in table 7 in this option kernel weight was not constrained and the maximum yield and minimum irrigation depth were weighted for wa 349 2 mm the optimal planting density was 12 93 plants m 2 and the irrigation depths at the vegetative flowering and grain filling stages were 102 3 110 9 and 136 0 mm respectively yield and water use efficiency improved by 10 8 and 1 6 than control respectively but kernel weight decreased by 17 when wa was 300 mm the full irrigation requirement with a planting density of 12 02 plants m 2 could not be satisfied and water deficit occurred at the grain filling and ripening stages compared to et ifull data not shown the yield and water use efficiency improved by 4 7 and 3 1 respectively but kernel weight decreased by 15 than control when wa was 250 mm water deficit occurred at the grain filling and ripening stages the yield decreased by 2 1 and kernel weight decreased by 24 than control under a planting density of 12 62 plants m 2 similar results were found in the scenario of wa of 200 mm for wa of 150 mm water deficit occurred at the vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages the constraints were not satisfied when wa 69 mm in the optimization model planting densities under deficit irrigation was high because plants were short and leaf area was small jia et al 2017 although maximum yield was obtained in option 2 the average water use efficiency improved by 3 3 but average kernel weight was 25 lower compared to control on the other hand average planting density increased by 26 2 and the cost associated with agronomic practices increased under high planting density such as seed labor thinning tasseling and harvest pest control and fertilizer costs increase in planting density by 1 plant m 2 increases the cost by 6 5 li 2014 therefore kernel weight of hybrid maize under optimal option must be constrained to increase kernel weight and decrease planting density shi et al 2020 suggested that the relative standard germination percentage of hybrid maize was greater than 0 9 when relative kernel weight was greater than 0 6 therefore the values of rkwmin were adjusted from 0 60 to 0 90 based upon option 2 to improve kernel weight decrease planting density and ensure yield the optimization results of option 3 are presented in table 8 in this option the optimal planting density ranged from 10 03 to 11 86 plants m 2 yield ranged from 434 to 671 g m 2 and water use efficiency ranged from 1 24 to 1 33 kg m 3 and evapotranspiration at the seedling vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages ranged 33 8 37 6 mm 88 4 131 5 mm 124 0 138 4 mm 72 9 150 4 mm and 24 8 50 2 mm respectively the average yield and water use efficiency reduced by only 2 0 and 1 7 respectively but average kernel weight increased by 9 compared to option 2 in addition the average planting density 11 05 plants m m 2 decreased by 10 2 jiang et al 2018 reported similar optimal planting density of 11 25 plants m 2 for the hybrid maize seed under full irrigation in summary the option 3 is recommended for hybrid maize seed production with limited water availability in arid regions of northwest china 4 conclusions this study was conducted to investigate the effects of water deficit and planting density on yield evapotranspiration and aboveground biomass of hybrid maize seed and to optimize irrigation depth and planting density based on crop models results showed that water deficit decreased yield evapotranspiration and aboveground biomass the highest yield was obtained for the planting density of 12 75 plants m 2 under full irrigation based on the modified single crop coefficient and rao models as well as the relationship between kernel number per plant and plant growth rate during the flowering stage the optimization model utilized the maximum yield reduced irrigation depth and constrained the kernel weight when kernel weight was not limited option 2 yield increased but the average kernel weight decreased by 25 than control which may cause a large decreases in seed vigor in the option 3 average yield reduced by only 2 0 water use efficiency reduced by 1 7 kernel weight increased by 9 and planting density decreased by 10 2 compared to option 2

9418,improvement in seed vigor and yield of hybrid maize is required to ensure food security optimal planting density and irrigation depth are critical for hybrid maize seed production in arid areas using data from 2012 to 2017 a new integrated model optimized planting density and border irrigation depth for achieving high yield and seed vigor of hybrid maize under limited water availability for field experiments a planting density of 9 75 plants m 2 under full irrigation was in the control treatment the results showed that water deficit decreased yield evapotranspiration and aboveground biomass per plant the highest yield was obtained for the planting density of 12 75 plants m 2 under full irrigation the single crop coefficient and crop water production function models were modified to simulate evapotranspiration and yield respectively using kernel number per plant and plant growth rate during the flowering stage a kernel weight model was established the maximum yield and minimum irrigation depth were weighted and kernel weight was constrained three minimum relative kernel weight rkwmin options were considered option 1 with rkwmin 1 00 control option 2 with rkwmin 0 unconstrained and option 3 with rkwmin ranged from 0 60 to 0 90 in option 1 the optimal irrigation depth during the growing season under control planting density decreased by 24 3 39 4 compared to the conventional practices in option 2 yield increased but average kernel weight decreased by 25 than control in the option 3 average yield and water use efficiency increased by 9 2 and 6 5 compared to option 1 respectively the average planting density decreased by 10 2 yield reduced by 2 0 and water use efficiency reduced by 1 7 but kernel weight increased by 9 compared to option 2 thus option 3 can be recommended for hybrid maize seed production with limited water availability in arid regions of northwest china our research provided a new theoretical method to improve yield and ensure seed

at the ith growth stage 1 introduction global maize production in 2018 was 1 12 billion tons which was highly dependent on the development of hybrid maize seed production industry jiang et al 2020 hexi corridor located in the arid areas of northwestern china has suitable natural isolation conditions and abundant light and heat resources the area used for hybrid maize seed production is 86700 hm2 and produces over 13 of the total hybrid maize seeds in the world arisnabarreta and solari 2017 wang et al 2017 maize inbred lines have become the main irrigated crop in the region which have large evapotranspiration approximately 500 mm during the growing season jiang et al 2016 border irrigation under mulch is widely used to maintain soil temperature and water content however the climate of the area is arid and the production of hybrid maize seeds is limited by water availability guo et al 2018 wang et al 2020 therefore increasing the production of hybrid maize seeds under limited water availability in arid areas could play an important role in ensuring food and water security kang et al 2017 irrigation is important for increasing crop yield and agriculture consumes 70 of available water resources in the world li et al 2020 it is predicted that food production will increase by 60 by 2050 fao 2011 and deficit irrigation would be an important strategy to improve water use efficiency and to ensure water security a mild water stress at the early growth stage of maize can promote plant growth stimulate root activity improve plant acclimatization and increase grain yield kang et al 2000 harb et al 2010 chai et al 2016 however a severe water stress can inhibit cell division and differentiation reduce photosynthesis rate break enzyme system balance and decrease grain yield pandey et al 2000 çakir 2004 yuan et al 2019 increasing planting density is one of the main cultivation techniques to increase maize yield which increases resources use efficiency to a certain extent assefa et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 however high plant density increases competition among plants for resources and reduces grain yield therefore optimizing the effects of water deficit and planting density on seeds yield is important for sustainable maize production in arid areas in previous researches relationships among yield planting density and irrigation depths were used to optimize the planting density and depth of irrigation for maize ben et al 2016 guo et al 2021 in addition peake et al 2008 used the apsim model to optimize plant population and irrigation strategies for maize in a farm in queensland little information is available about optimal planting densities under deficit irrigation of hybrid maize seed seed vigor may influence crop yield by emergence rate seedling vigor and uniformity ghassemi golezani and dalil 2014 which are positively correlated with kernel weight ambika et al 2014 researches have shown that increasing planting density and reducing irrigation depth decreases seed vigor by reducing kernel weight ghassemi golezani and soltani 1997 takele and farrant 2010 miya et al 2017 eskandari et al 2018 lafta and chilab 2019 thus the desired kernel weight should be guaranteed when optimizing planting density and irrigation schedule for hybrid maize seed production crop models play important roles in obtaining efficient and reasonable agricultural management zhang et al 2019 the crop coefficient reference evapotranspiration is a simple and useful method to estimate actual evapotranspiration and crop coefficient can be derived from single and dual crop coefficient methods jiang et al 2014 in the single crop coefficient method the basal crop and soil evaporation coefficients are combined and a stress coefficient is added allen et al 1998 water production functions can quantify the relationship between crop yield and evapotranspiration with the integration of soil salinity and nitrogen in recent years he et al 2016 hu et al 2020 wang et al 2021 in addition maize kernel weight can be calculated by yield and kernel number and kernel number is closely related to the plant growth rate around flowering gambín et al 2006 2008 borrás and gambín 2010 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the response of crop evapotranspiration and growth of hybrid maize to different irrigation and planting densities 2 establish crop models to predict evapotranspiration yield and kernel weight of hybrid maize seeds under different irrigation and planting density strategies 3 optimize planting density and border irrigation depth to save water improve yield and ensure seed vigor of hybrid maize under limited water availability 2 material and methods 2 1 field experiments 2 1 1 experimental site field

fig a1 top dressing of 364 kg n hm 2 was made at the vegetative stage the cultivars of hybrid maize the proportion of male and female plants and planting and harvest dates were the same as local standard practice during 2012 and 2017 table 1 the two inbred male batches were planted in the same rows with six plants each from the first and second batches placed in an alternating pattern and the inbred female lines were detasseled before tassel emergence weeding and pest control measures followed local practices the study consisted of three experiments of which exp i was a single factor experiment of planting density exp ii was a single factor experiment of irrigation and exp iii was a two factor coupling experiment of planting density and irrigation the experimental designs in different seasons are presented in table 1 all treatments had the same row spacing of 40 cm each year and the irrigation method was border irrigation the data of exp i and exp ii have been published

farmers use a planting density of 9 75 plants m 2 d3 which in this study was the control treatment according to conventional practices maize was irrigated 4 5 times during the season and total irrigation applied was 400 500 mm in exp ii three irrigation levels full irrigation labeled as ck 1 2 of full irrigation labeled as 1 2 and no irrigation labeled as 0 were applied at the vegetative v flowering f grain filling g and ripening r stages planting density was 9 75 plants m 2 spacing of 25 6 cm nine irrigations were applied in 2014 and 11 in 2015 in the control treatment vckfck the lower and upper irrigation limits were 70 2 and 100 of field water capacity respectively the irrigation depths of different treatments at each growth stage are presented in table a2 in exp iii there were 12 treatments in 2015 with different combinations of three irrigation levels full irrigation wck 2 3 of full irrigation w2 3 and 1 3 of full irrigation w1 3 during the growing season and four planting densities 8 25 d2 9 75 d3 11 25 d4 and 12 75 d5 plants m 2 were used in 2016 the w1 3 was replaced by 1 2 of full irrigation w1 2 but other irrigation levels were consistent with 2015 there were six treatments in 2017 with different combinations of three irrigation levels full irrigation wck 2 3 of full irrigation w2 3 and 2 3 of full irrigation except for full irrigation at the flowering stage w2 3 and two planting densities 9 75 d3 and 12 75 d5 plants m 2 were applied the irrigation depths of all treatments were calculated according to the control treatment wckd3 under wckd3 the lower and upper irrigation limits were 75 2 and 100 of field water capacity respectively the design of planting spacing was consistent with exp i the area of each experimental plot was 9 6 m 7 0 m in 2015 and 2016 and 22 0 m 6 4 m in 2017 the irrigation depths for different treatments at each growth stage are presented in table a3 the experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replicates per treatment in both years a buffer area about 1 m wide separated different treatments all the experiments were common in some experimental and field management aspects and all the irrigation events in the different treatments were consistent with control 2 1 3 leaf area index every 5 7 d five plants per plot were chosen to measure leaf length and the maximum width using a ruler the leaf area was determined by the product of length the maximum width and an adjustment factor of 0 74 li et al 2008 the leaf area index was obtained by the ratio of leaf area per plant and land area per plant 2 1 4 soil water content and crop evapotranspiration the soil water content was measured by the diviner 2000 sentek pty ltd adelaide australia every 3 5 d as well as before and after irrigation and rain at a depth of 1 m with vertical interval of 10 cm in each plot two pvc tubes were installed below the bare soil and mulch and the measurements were calibrated by the gravimetric method crop evapotranspiration was estimated using the soil water balance method as follow 1 et a ep iw sr dd cr δ sf δ sw where et a is actual evapotranspiration mm ep is effective precipitation mm

total precipitation per event mm sf was minor and can be ignored allen et al 1998 cr can also be negligible because the groundwater level is below 25 m from surface according to the observational data dd can be ignored because soil water content at the 90 100 cm layer remained unchanged after irrigation and rainfall events jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2019 in addition sr was zero as the experimental site is flat and the intensity of precipitation was low eq 1 was simplified as follow 3 et a ep iw δ sw 2 1 5 aboveground biomass and yield at the end of each growth stage six female plants from each treatment were oven dried at 85 c to constant weight to obtain the aboveground biomass at least 20 female plants at the center of each plot were chosen randomly and dried at 75 c to obtain the yield per plant and kernel weight yield per plant and kernel weight were normalized to a kernel water content of 13 and kernel number per plant was calculated by dividing the yield per plant by kernel weight final yield was the product of yield per plant and planting density 2 1 6 weather data meteorological data were obtained using an automatic weather station hobo onset computer corp bourne ma usa the meteorological data of different growth stages in each year are presented in table a4 2 2 models description 2 2 1 evapotranspiration model the evapotranspiration of hybrid maize seed

institute cary usa was used for non linear fitting and two factor variance analysis lingo 11 0 software lindo system inc chicago usa was used to obtain the optimal solution we calibrated models using the data of exp i in 2012 and 2013 exp ii in 2014 and exp iii in 2015 and validated using the remaining data the regression coefficient r coefficient of determination r 2 relative root mean square

effect of planting density and water deficit on evapotranspiration aboveground biomass and yield actual evapotranspiration aboveground biomass per plant sb and actual yield under different treatments of exp iii are presented in table 2 in 2015 2016 and 2017 et a ranged 304 6 501 1 mm 334 5 498 4 mm and 363 9 520 9 mm respectively water deficit had a significant effect on et a p 0 01 during both years farré and faci 2006 igbadun et al 2008 ran et al 2017 wang et al 2021 et a increased significantly with increasing planting density in 2017 p 0 05 in contrast barbieri et al 2012 suggested that planting density did not influence et a and ren et al 2016 highlighted that the response of et a to planting density depended on the hydrological year et a was not influenced by planting density in extremely dry years dry years and mild wet years while increased with increasing planting density in the normal and extremely wet years jia et al 2018 indicated that et a decreased with increasing planting density in the late growth stage in 2015 2016 and 2017 sb ranged 171 05 235 86 g plant 1 176 05 235 84 g plant 1 and 159 38 188 60 g plant 1 respectively sb decreased significantly with decreasing irrigation depth in both years p 0 05 it is reported that water deficit at the vegetative stage inhibits the growth of vegetative organs and reduces biomass accumulation in addition water deficit at the reproductive stage reduced kernel number decreased grain filling rate increased leaf senescence and eventually decreased photosynthate çakir 2004 wang et al 2019 shi et al 2021 increasing planting density decreased sb significantly in 2015 and 2016 p 0 05 but no effect in 2017 the interplant competition under high planting density limits nutrient supply water availability and light interception and decreases photosynthate and growth rate per plant zhang et al 2018 in 2015 2016 and 2017 y a ranged 381 680 g m 2 486 794 g m 2 and 417 556 g m 2 respectively the highest yield was obtained by wckd5 in both years compared to control yield increased by 20 1 8 5 and 18 0 in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively water deficit and planting density had significant effects on y a during both years p 0 01 the two way water deficit planting density interaction for y a was significant at p 0 05 level in 2015 and 2017 and similar results can be found in other studies dordas et al 2018 hao et al 2019 guo et al 2021 3 2 models calibration and validation 3 2 1 parameters calibration the results of calibration of the evapotranspiration model parameters presented in table 3 used the data of exp i in 2012 and 2013 γ i ranged from 0 1996 to 0 6347 which indicated that the evapotranspiration at each growth stage increased with increasing planting density r 2 and rrmse ranged 0 92 0 99 and 0 014 0 050 respectively a quadratic relationship between relative actual yield and relative planting density are shown in fig 1 for the relative planting density of 1 33 the maximum relative actual yield was 1 12 it means that actual yield improved by 12 when planting density was 12 97 plants m 2 luo et al 2020 reported that maximum maize yield was obtained when planting density ranged from 8 0 to 10 5 plants m 2 across major maize regions of china because parent lines of hybrid maize seed were short without heterosis facilitating more tolerant to crowding stress the planting density of the maximum yield in our study was much higher than commercial maize the results of calibration using the data of exp ii in 2014 and exp iii in 2015 of the yield model parameters are presented in table 4 because no irrigation treatments were applied at the seedling stage the water sensitivity index of this stage was not calculated in our study the yield of hybrid maize seeds is most sensitive to water deficit at the flowering stage followed by vegetative grain filling and ripening stages kernel number is more closely correlated to maize yield than kernel weight maddonni et al 1998 alvarez et al 2013 and water deficit at the flowering stage decreases kernel number dramatically wang et al 2018 in most research igbadun et al 2007 domínguez et al 2012 zhang and guo 2016 grové 2019 water sensitive index of the grain filling stage was higher than vegetative stage the pollen number in hybrid maize seed production is less than commercial maize which is only provided by inbred female lines in addition wang et al 2017 indicated that 50 of full irrigation and no irrigation at the vegetative stage decreased kernel number of hybrid maize seed production by 17 9 and 34 7 respectively therefore the yield of hybrid maize seeds was more sensitive to water deficit at the vegetative stage than grain filling stage λ i ranged 1 7277 1 1344 the negative values at the vegetative flowering and grain filling stages indicated that water sensitivity decreased with increasing planting density high planting densities with more female parents to provide pollen guarantee more kernels although water deficit occurred at the vegetative and flowering stages wang et al 2018 because kernel number has been determined at the grain filling and ripening stages kernel weight accounted for the main variation in yield many studies suggested that kernel weight under low planting density was susceptible to water stress at the grain filling stage liang et al 2018 guo et al 2021 at the ripening stage the grain filling rate is low and with increasing plant population senescence rate increases borrás et al 2003 which results in high sensitivity to water deficit larson and clegg 1999 changes in assimilate production by vegetative organs affect assimilate availability to form kernels by increasing the pressure difference of photosynthate transport gambín et al 2008 fig 2a indicates that relative kernel number per plant increased with increasing relative plant growth rate during flowering kiniry et al 1997 suggested kernel number increased linearly with plant growth rate in fact when the assimilate availability approaches saturation the kernel number reaches its maximum therefore rectangular hyperbolic tollenaar et al 1992 cerrudo et al 2020 and monomolecular echarte et al 2004 hernán et al 2021 models were used to describe this relationship the relationship between relative population biomass and relative planting density is shown in fig 2b although high density causes resource limitation at the plant scale it increases resource use efficiency at the population scale the results of calibration of the kernel weight model using the data of exp i in 2012 and 2013 exp ii in 2014 and exp iii in 2015 are given in table 5 with r 2 of 0 82 and rrmse of 0 210 the value of δ in this study is lower than that reported in a previous study ran et al 2019 because crop transpiration was replaced by evapotranspiration in eq 24 and b 0ck is close to the aboveground biomass at the seedling stage of hybrid maize seed production ran et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 ma et al 2022 3 2 2 models validation using the data of exp i in 2014 and 2015 exp ii in 2015 and exp iii in 2016 and 2017 the results of validation of evapotranspiration yield and kernel weight models are presented in fig 3 the values of r r 2 are rrmse ef and d ia ranged 0 97 1 01 0 74 0 92 0 059 0 095 0 076 0 154 0 593 0 922 and 0 906 0 980 respectively the validation results showed that models predicted well the evapotranspiration yield and kernel weight and can be used to optimize planting density and irrigation depth of hybrid maize because the cultivars were different during different growing seasons the relative values were used to build models that can also be applied to other genotypes the proposed integrated model can estimate evapotranspiration yield and kernel weight based on the single crop coefficient method in the original evapotranspiration model allen et al 1998 water stress coefficient requires a daily water balance calculation in this study water stress coefficient was calculated with increasing growth stage which increased simulation accuracy according to the pre analysis the rao model performed better in predicting yield under different water regimes than other water productivity functions data not shown considering the parabolic relationship between yield and planting density as well as the influence of planting density on water sensitivity coefficient the modified rao model underestimated yield by 3 but performed well in predicting yield over a wide range 119 794 g m 2 compared with other yield models such as dssat tsuji et al 1994 apsim mccown et al 1996 wnmm li et al 2007 and aquacrop steduto et al 2009 the modified rao model employs less number of parameters with clear physiological meaning in the kernel weight model the maximum relative kernel weight was limited to 1 06 according to tetio kagho and gardner 1988 kernel weight of hybrid maize was very close to 253 mg when planting density increased to 16 plants m 2 wang et al 2019 showed that the kernel weight of hybrid maize seed production ranged from 155 6 to 178 4 mg when post flowering biomass gain was zero there is no doubt that the above hypotheses were based on kernel formation at the flowering stage therefore the applicability of this model at higher planting densities and the lower limit of kernel weight need to be further investigated in the future 3 3 optimization of different options integrating the evapotranspiration yield kernel weight models objective function and constraints the planting density and irrigation depth of hybrid maize seed production were optimized to save water and improve yield and kernel weight the parameters used in the optimization model are given in tables 3 to 5 a5 and figs 1 2 data in table a5 is derived from the measured average values of field experiments three minimum relative kernel weight rkwmin options were considered and five available water wa scenarios from 150 mm to 350 mm at 50 mm increments were used in each option in the option 1 kernel weight was consistent with control rkwmin 1 00 in the option 2 kernel weight was not constrained rkwmin 0 in the option 3 the values of rkwmin were different under different water availability rkwmin 0 60 0 90 the optimization results of option 1 are presented in table 6 because the initial soil water depth was high no irrigation was required during the seedling stage no irrigation was applied during the ripening stage according to the conventional irrigation schedule when wa 303 0 mm the full irrigation requirement with a planting density of 9 75 plants m 2 was satisfied which was the optimized control the evapotranspiration at the seedling vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages were 33 2 123 7 133 1 142 6 and 45 8 mm respectively irrigation depths at the vegetative flowering and grain filling stages were 60 1 105 9 and 137 0 mm respectively the optimal irrigation depth during the growing season decreased by 24 3 39 4 compared to the conventional practices when water availability decreases reduction in planting density is a viable agronomic measure to improve kernel weight guo et al 2021 when wa was 250 mm planting density evapotranspiration and yield decreased by 19 1 8 9 and 19 1 respectively there were no feasible solutions to meet the kernel weight constraint when wa 238 0 mm in the optimization model this option is suitable for a high seed vigor requirement under limited water availability the results for option 2 are presented in table 7 in this option kernel weight was not constrained and the maximum yield and minimum irrigation depth were weighted for wa 349 2 mm the optimal planting density was 12 93 plants m 2 and the irrigation depths at the vegetative flowering and grain filling stages were 102 3 110 9 and 136 0 mm respectively yield and water use efficiency improved by 10 8 and 1 6 than control respectively but kernel weight decreased by 17 when wa was 300 mm the full irrigation requirement with a planting density of 12 02 plants m 2 could not be satisfied and water deficit occurred at the grain filling and ripening stages compared to et ifull data not shown the yield and water use efficiency improved by 4 7 and 3 1 respectively but kernel weight decreased by 15 than control when wa was 250 mm water deficit occurred at the grain filling and ripening stages the yield decreased by 2 1 and kernel weight decreased by 24 than control under a planting density of 12 62 plants m 2 similar results were found in the scenario of wa of 200 mm for wa of 150 mm water deficit occurred at the vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages the constraints were not satisfied when wa 69 mm in the optimization model planting densities under deficit irrigation was high because plants were short and leaf area was small jia et al 2017 although maximum yield was obtained in option 2 the average water use efficiency improved by 3 3 but average kernel weight was 25 lower compared to control on the other hand average planting density increased by 26 2 and the cost associated with agronomic practices increased under high planting density such as seed labor thinning tasseling and harvest pest control and fertilizer costs increase in planting density by 1 plant m 2 increases the cost by 6 5 li 2014 therefore kernel weight of hybrid maize under optimal option must be constrained to increase kernel weight and decrease planting density shi et al 2020 suggested that the relative standard germination percentage of hybrid maize was greater than 0 9 when relative kernel weight was greater than 0 6 therefore the values of rkwmin were adjusted from 0 60 to 0 90 based upon option 2 to improve kernel weight decrease planting density and ensure yield the optimization results of option 3 are presented in table 8 in this option the optimal planting density ranged from 10 03 to 11 86 plants m 2 yield ranged from 434 to 671 g m 2 and water use efficiency ranged from 1 24 to 1 33 kg m 3 and evapotranspiration at the seedling vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages ranged 33 8 37 6 mm 88 4 131 5 mm 124 0 138 4 mm 72 9 150 4 mm and 24 8 50 2 mm respectively the average yield and water use efficiency reduced by only 2 0 and 1 7 respectively but average kernel weight increased by 9 compared to option 2 in addition the average planting density 11 05 plants m m 2 decreased by 10 2 jiang et al 2018 reported similar optimal planting density of 11 25 plants m 2 for the hybrid maize seed under full irrigation in summary the option 3 is recommended for hybrid maize seed production with limited water availability in arid regions of northwest china 4 conclusions this study was conducted to investigate the effects of water deficit and planting density on yield evapotranspiration and aboveground biomass of hybrid maize seed and to optimize irrigation depth and planting density based on crop models results showed that water deficit decreased yield evapotranspiration and aboveground biomass the highest yield was obtained for the planting density of 12 75 plants m 2 under full irrigation based on the modified single crop coefficient and rao models as well as the relationship between kernel number per plant and plant growth rate during the flowering stage the optimization model utilized the maximum yield reduced irrigation depth and constrained the kernel weight when kernel weight was not limited option 2 yield increased but the average kernel weight decreased by 25 than control which may cause a large decreases in seed vigor in the option 3 average yield reduced by only 2 0 water use efficiency reduced by 1 7 kernel weight increased by 9 and planting density decreased by 10 2 compared to option 2 therefore option 3 which can be recommended for hybrid maize seed production with limited water availability in arid regions of northwest china our research provided a new mathematical method to

9419,over the last two decades participatory modeling has been advocated as an effective method towards integrated adaptive and collaborative water resources management however in developing countries such as pakistan its adaptation is limited due to high cost time and technical skills of stakeholders the proposed research aims to develop a stepwise participatory modeling framework with special focus to the problem of groundwater depletion in the faizpur distributary of bari doab basin pakistan currently due to absence of a well define groundwater management policy together with low social awareness level groundwater sustainability is at risk in term of its quality and quantity for participatory modeling individual causal loop diagrams were developed with potential stakeholders followed by a merged causal loop diagram to represent a holistic view of the complete system the final merged diagram helps in understanding different system processes and allows for a more comprehensive qualitative assessment of stakeholder proposed policies among other proposed policies e g revise cropping pattern gray water reuse and construction of dams water pricing is found to be the most effective policy this policy proved to be helpful in improving irrigation efficiency and hence helps in reducing groundwater extraction the policy may face resistance from upstream farmers due to excessive and cheap availability of irrigation water in their area but can help in water reallocation and shift traditional methods of farming to more advanced techniques the results point to social economic aspects of groundwater management that have not been considered by other modeling studies to date moreover this approach can improve the role of local stakeholder in decision making processes concerning socio environmental regulation and climate change mitigation policies keywords participatory modelling socio environmental causal loop diagrams groundwater management bari doab data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in pakistan groundwater generally contributes more than 75 of the agricultural water demand qureshi et al 2003 according to an estimate pakistan is the 3rd largest groundwater extractor in the world qureshi et al 2010b pakistan utilize 10 of its groundwater resources annually qureshi et al 2010b the average annual groundwater depletion rate is about 0 5 m per year shakoor et al 2018 the main causes of groundwater depletion are frequent groundwater abstractions due to increase in cropping intensity poor management practices declination in surface water supplies due to climate change and lack of social awareness in pakistan due to the lack of any effective groundwater management tubewell installation policy stakeholders such as farmers industries and domestic users consider groundwater as public property and utilize it without considering any future environmental impacts hargrove and heyman 2020 groundwater management issues starts in 1960 s with the establishment of salinity control and reclamation projects scarp large capacity scarp tubewells approximately 0 084 0 14 m3 sec were installed with prime objective of subsurface drainage qureshi et al 2003 additional irrigation supplies from these wells cause an increase in cropping intensity and hence results an exponential increase in number of tubewells during this period number of tubewells increased from 37000 to 84000 qureshi et al 2003 in 1980 s the government of pakistan proposed a policy to license tubewell installation in critical groundwater areas however this could not be implemented due to poor awareness and complexity of process qureshi et al 2010a the current rates of groundwater exploitation are unsustainable mangrio et al 2015 and due to excessive drawdown the irrigating cost from tubewells are 30 times higher than that of surface irrigation the situation demands the social awareness of the issue together with formulation of sustainable management policies the current study helps in the development of participatory modeling framework to increase social awareness and critically evaluating the stakeholder proposed polices according to an estimate in punjab pakistan groundwater levels are depleting at average rate of 0 91 m per year raza et al 2017 which clearly indicate excessive depletion as compared to country level historical trends showed a sharp decrease in groundwater level together with an increase in total dissolve salts tds in the lower bari doab basin of pakistan latif and ahmad 2009 which highlights that the groundwater sustainability is at risk and demands an urgent need of a methodological framework for sustainable groundwater management through stakeholder engagement coupled with future environmental impacts irrigation water supplies the reliance on groundwater supplies has amplified with the concurrent increase in population urban migration and industrialization in lower bari doab study area of research the low canal water supplies and rainfall intensities compel farmers to meet their agriculture water demands through groundwater resources large groundwater discharge with low recharge cause groundwater depletion with mining of resources and ultimately cause adverse effects on the economic condition of farmers by limiting subsurface water supplies due to high pumping cost basharat and tariq 2015 past groundwater management studies in the bari doab region basharat and tariq 2014 kijne 2003 qureshi et al 2010a tanwir et al 2003 highlight the need of sustainable groundwater management through stakeholder proposed policy implementation considering hydrogeological appraisal of escalating groundwater exploitation khan et al 2008 conduct a hydro geological study in rechna doab rd a neighbor catchment of bari doab to asses future groundwater trend scenario analysis of the study indicate that in next 25 years under current dry condition with business as usual scenario there is a risk of approximately 2 3 m drawdown in groundwater levels khan et al 2008 with recent changes in surface water trend due to climate change groundwater sustainability got paramount importance strategic use of stakeholder built local scale models with regional scale analyses can help in highlighting main management issues along with social awareness of the problem regional scale analyses includes water stress assessments for better understanding of groundwater flow dynamic complexities associated with irrigated agricultural systems and governance of groundwater use alley et al 2018 past researchers conduct many physical modeling studies to formulate groundwater management policies however these studies were conducted without the engagement of potential stakeholder and also didn t consider the socio economic conditions of the study area hence failed to address the issue of groundwater overexploitation elshall et al 2020 van steenbergen and oliemans 2002 stakeholder participation is a process of engaging potential parties groups who are under direct indirect impact of poor groundwater management and have the direct interest in the formation of policies for the sustainable management of groundwater according to halbe et al 2013 stakeholder involvement can help in the effective policy making currently in pakistan there is very limited stakeholder participation in the resource management and policy formulation past researcher studies qureshi et al 2003 bourne and walker 2005 halbe et al 2013 showed that engagement of potential stakeholder such as research institute ngos local farmer and government department can help in effective policy development the current manuscript approach will help to address the issues of stakeholder engagement in developing countries such as pakistan stakeholder participation in developed world is well understood and many research studies were conducted in this regards to develop effective methods frameworks castilla rho et al 2017 developed an agent based model of irrigated agriculture the model was based on the principles of cooperation collective action and quantitatively sourced via the world values survey wave 6 n 90 350 they studied three major socio agro hydro systems against unsustainable resource demands the study discovered several tipping points at which social norms shifts groundwater conservation abruptly in response to small changes in cultural values monitoring stipulations and enforcement provisions many authors basco carrera et al 2017 ducrot et al 2014 massuel and riaux 2017 explored the concept of stakeholder participation together with physical environmental assessments however none of these directly engage key stakeholders to study their preferred policies with the assessment of systems dynamics on a holistic scale the present study involves the utilization of an innovative qualitative modeling tool i e causal loop diagrams clds for evaluating stakeholder defined policy scenarios and sustainable groundwater management inam et al 2015 this involves interviewing stakeholder groups for their preferred policy options the methodology proposed in this study focuses directly on addressing limitations of past studies and allows evaluation of stakeholder proposed policies causal loop diagram technique is known as system thinking approach and is used to describe the casual relationship between system components it can help in understanding the dynamic feedback of a system on holistic scale clds also provides help in understanding the impacts of policy decision on system behavior binder et al 2013 the present research outlines a participatory modeling approach that involve the engagement of stakeholders having limited technical skills and financial support stakeholder engagement in policy decision has enormous benefits inam et al 2015 such as social awareness unbiased solutions inclusion of local views in system study bridging communication gaps between different institutes etc however in developing countries such as pakistan stakeholder holder engagement is still on initial stages due to limited skills and resources the research will help in improving stakeholder engagement in resource management and will primarily focus on 1 developing a participatory qualitative system dynamic model for the study area and 2 qualitative assessment and evaluation of stakeholder proposed management policies with special reference to groundwater sustainability the study will helps in the assessment of stakeholder proposed management policies to address groundwater problem identification of agriculture related groundwater depletion issues and solutions as well as an improved understanding of holistic system behavior and governing processes in past clds helps studying the dynamics of different system such as climate change food security coivd 19 pandemic soil salinity and water scarcity adamowski et al 2009 halbe et al 2013 halbe and adamowski 2011 richards et al 2021 sahin et al 2020 on holistic scale however these studies were done individually by the researcher or with experts without the involvement of local stakeholders current study will help in bridging this communication gap this study involve views policy option of local stakeholder by building individual causal loop diagrams and combining them to represent on holistic merged model moreover this study will help in exploring the cooperative management of groundwater which was never explore before this study will be first of its kind in collaboration dealing with groundwater management issues to provide guidelines and monitoring framework which may help in the formulation of sustainable management options 2 study area the faizpur distributary lies in bari doab basin of pakistan it originates from the multan branch with full supply discharge of 8 72 m3 sec faizpur distributary divides in three minors i e qasba minor haveli circle canal hcc 55 a rana minor hcc 56 a and rana minor hcc 59 a the study area lies between 29 770 n and 29 930 n latitude and 71 420 e and 71 470 e longitude fig 1 indicates location and excessive depletion of groundwater resources within the study area the average annual groundwater depth varies from 19 7 to 21 7 m currently 30 of the area show excessive depletion with groundwater depth more than 21 7 m this indicates the need of more financial resources for groundwater extraction due to this fact farmers entirely depend on surface water supplies of faizpur distributary for irrigating their crops in future the surface water supplies may reduce due to climate change and thus impacts the agriculture sustainability of the area the average annual temperature is 24 79 c june is the warmest month with temperatures averaging 32 25 c january is the coldest month with an average temperature of 17 33 c as demonstrated in fig 2 the average annual precipitation is about 217 53 mm october is the driest month with 2 mm of average rainfall majority of rainfall occurs in the month of july with an average of 50 mm the rainfall fluctuates 48 mm between the driest and wettest months throughout the year temperatures varied approximately by 22 3 c with the increase and decrease in temperature reference evapotranspiration eto and relative humidity varies accordingly as shown in fig 2 the downstream area of faizpur distributary is located in the agroecological zones of punjab sugarcane saccharum officinarum l cotton gossypium hirsutum and wheat triticum aestivum l are main crops grown in this region wheat is grown as main crop covering approximately 80 of the area this area also encompasses 20 of pakistan s mono cropping culture the upstream area is located in the agroclimatic zone where cotton gossypium hirsutum is common the total culturable command area cca of the site is 184 08 km2 and the gross command area gca is 184 22 km2 according to one estimate hasan et al 2020 approximately 13 000 tubewells were installed in the catchment area see appendix i large number of tubewells leads to excessive groundwater thus cause groundwater depletion in the area large number of tubewells are dry which inversely effects crop yields punjab is the most productive province of pakistan therefore decrease in agricultural production is adversely affects the economy of the country this demands an urgent need to identify the main causes and consequences of groundwater problem and address it in an efficient manner the groundwater issues of the site were examined at two places i e upstream and downstream faizpur distributary has an upstream discharge more than 95 of the authorized design discharge and the downstream has less than 30 of authorized tail discharge punjab irrigation department 2019 which highlights the management issue at institutional level faizpur distributary seems as the most promising area of search since its groundwater is declining at a steep rate of 1 289 m per year which is higher than another canal command area in pakistan secondly the study area lies in the agro environmental zone and the policies and solutions suggested through this study can be applied in similar areas facing groundwater management issues 3 methodology the collaboration of stakeholders for development of participatory model is well recognize reed provides a comprehensive view of different stakeholder engagement techniques reed et al 2009 the main problem faced during the interview process is the low number of stakeholders are interested in giving the interviews and becoming a part of the meetings it has been observed that the stakeholders of developing countries have less interest in group meetings and interviews thoradeniya and maheshwari 2017 one of the reasons may be the pressure from higher authorities the suggested approach in this research was developed to entail less time and economic resources by excluding large group interviews and gatherings the overall process is presented as flowchart in fig 3 is based on five steps the 1st step involves defining of problem variable the 2nd step includes the enlisting of stakeholders the 3rd step involves the interviews of stakeholders for the development of causal loop diagrams of individual stakeholders i e expressing stakeholders perspectives in the form of clds using vensim software the 4th step involves the merging of all clds i e views of all stakeholders and the 5th step involves evaluation of stakeholder proposed policies and methods 3 1 problem variable problem analysis is paramount important for the stakeholder evaluation and causal loop diagrams modeling phases it is carried out by the first author of this case study through discussion with local stakeholder s in depth literature review and exploration of the problem the success of whole participatory modeling process relies on the transparent formulation of the problem considering stakeholders interests problem definition affects the choice of stakeholders in the modeling procedure proper management is required to interlink the problem variable to the stakeholders requirements sterman 2000 the steps in the analysis of problem variables includes 1 specify the problem variable 2 time horizon 3 interpretation of model boundaries and 4 initial stakeholders list the problem variable analysis is an iterative process the problem variable can be re define if stakeholder seems it necessary and new stakeholder list can be created 3 2 stakeholder analysis after defining the problem variable it is important to filter the stakeholders whose can plays an important role in the modeling process the stakeholder analysis is divided in 2 stages 1 classification stakeholders are classified into different groups based on their influence on the management of problem 2 prioritization this stage involve prioritizing the stakeholders on the bases of their attributes i e power proximity legitimacy and urgency elias et al 2002 the listing of stakeholders can be accomplished using different sources such as reports research papers literature reviews etc the listing of stakeholders is indirectly taken through brainstorming brainstorming is free thinking or enlists something without restriction bezzi 2011 the enlisting process is the first step of study the formulated list can be modified during the stakeholder interviews after the list finalization stakeholders are categories into four major groups such as experts decision makers implementers and most importantly users such classification helps in identifying any missing stakeholders stakeholder group composition may change over time new stakeholders can join and old ones can move out from the system with time their attributes can also change which should be considered in the process these changes can be referred as stakeholder dynamics this study is complemented through bryson and crosby 2015 who describe a power vs interest grid final list of stakeholders were selected who are associated with four attributes of power legitimacy urgency and interest 3 3 causal loop diagrams clds of individual stakeholders after the stakeholder analysis potential stakeholders were approached and stakeholder interviews were conducted for constructing individual clds the stepwise construction procedure of cld is shown in fig 4 clds have been used widely for policymaking water resource management and sustainable resources development mirchi 2013 inam et al 2014 the primary purpose of causal loop diagrams is to provide comprehensive detail of system structure kiani et al 2009 clds are helpful in representing the mental models of different stakeholders for understanding the primary causes of the problem and qualitative analysis of stakeholder proposed policies a cld represents the causal effect between the variables by linking them through arrows a causal link indicates the effect of one variable on another variable a positive link or relationship indicates the direct relationship between variables i e the increase in one variable will cause an increase in the effect variable while the negative link and relationship indicate an inverse relationship between variables closed loops are key in the consideration of clds there are two types of loops reinforcing and balancing a reinforcing loop is a cycle in which variables pass on and come back to a variable with the same sign as the initial one while a balancing loop is a cycle in which variables pass on and come back to a variable with the sign opposite to the initial one interviews were conducted individually with each stakeholder so that they could build their clds without any biases some steps help the process of cld development first define the goal and method of sketching a casual loop diagram using a simple example for the implementation sticky notes and charts were provided to the stakeholder to develop their clds stakeholders attach the sticky note of the problem in the center of the chart then the stakeholder affixes the stick notes of causes on the left side of the chart then these causes are linked to the problem through a causal link arrow in the next step direct and indirect causes are connected through casual links or connections then the direct and indirect consequences are affixed on the right side of the chart like causes consequences are also connected through the casual loop arrows with the help of a pencil eventually causes and consequences are interlinked through a feedback loop the questions that were asked during the stakeholder interview are 1 when did the problem originate time horizon 2 what is the main issue you are tackling now a days 3 what are the effects of the problem variable 4 what are the causes of the problem 5 what is the key feedback proceeding 6 what type of policies and strategies can be acquired for resolving the problem 7 what do you think about which elements or factors can be used for future improvement in the water system moreover the loops are labeled concerning the process they indicated i e surface loop groundwater depletion loop etc for fast reference after each stakeholder cld is completed an extensive tool for modeling vensim software is utilized for incorporating the paper based clds into the dynamic computer system in following step individual clds are merged to develop a holistic qualitative model of the system 3 4 establishment of merged cld the main purpose of the merged model is to represent the distinct prospects and mental models of all individual stakeholders merged cld represents holistic model of the system related to the problem variable its causes its effects feedback loops and possible policies to address the problem variable merged model of current study is shown in fig 10 and will be discussed in detail under section 4 5 of this manuscript in the first step of group model development the most inclusive individual cld model is selected and variables from other stakeholders models are then added different stakeholder may have diversified views during the cld development process their controversies diversified views were marked on the preliminary merged cld and addressed during a follow up group meeting with all stakeholders fig 5 explains the merging process by considering the example of two stakeholder built models represented as model 1 model 2 in order to deal with diversified views of stakeholders the complete merging process can be divided into five categories i e agreement controversary type 1 controversary type 2 controversary type 3 and comprehensive as shown in fig 5 and discussed below 1 agreement if there is a satisfactory agreement between stakeholder constructed models row 1 e g both agreed that variable x has the same impact on variable y then in the merged model variable x casually linked with variable y 2 controversary type 1 if both stakeholders think opposite to each other row 2 for example stakeholder 1 think x as independent variable impacts y as dependent variable while second stakeholder thinks y as independent variable impacts x as dependent variable then both are interlinked in the merged diagram with double arrow but tagged with the star as a controversy 3 controversary type 2 if the 1st stakeholder thinks that x affects y and z and y further affect z while the 2nd stakeholder thinks x impact y and z only then as detailing causal link between y and z is added in the merged model row 3 4 controversary type 3 if the 1st stakeholder thinks that x influences the y and z but the 2nd stakeholder thinks that x only influences y then causal link between both x and y is added and mark as controversary of type 3 row 4 5 comprehensive the view of the stakeholder with more explanation is incorporated in the merged model row 5 all diversified views and controversies were marked on the preliminary merged model diagram for future discussions with all stakeholders stakeholders were asked to attend one follow up group meeting to finalize the merged cld wide ranging discussions regarding the group s opinions on the details of the merged cld and any controversies were encouraged during this meeting this process also allowed stakeholders to share their ideas the preliminary merged diagram i e the overall cld generated by moderators and marked with controversies was presented to stakeholders to elicit their opinions regarding the overall model preliminary merged cld was finalized by addressing all controversies in the light of stakeholders discussion the final merged cld model includes the views of all stakeholders the merging technique worked well in the qualitative modeling of the complete system the application detail of merging process along with practical example are provided in inam et al 2015 4 results the issue of groundwater depletion through participatory modeling was analyzed in faizpur distributary bari doab basin pakistan it took 4 months to develop mental models of stakeholders in the form of clds in the first month problem definition and stakeholder analysis were carried out followed by another month for data collection and definition of project boundaries finally in the last two months stakeholders were contacted and interviews were carried out in the form of qualitative models i e cld initially a demonstration exercise was conducted to familiarize the stakeholders with the cld development process this exercise helped the stakeholders to understand the process for developing their own cld diagrams 4 1 problem variable change in groundwater in the study area over time from the literature review and the feedback of stakeholders and experts it was determined that groundwater depletion was the main issue in the study area considering climate change risks and future water scarcity challenges stakeholders emphasized the importance of finding immediate solutions and considered it mandatory that the problem be solved through stakeholder participation stakeholders further pointed out the need to formulate a sustainable management policy of groundwater abstracts currently there is no management policy and as a result farmers have continued the installation of tube wells even in the saline zone as shown in figure a 1 which results in groundwater depletion and secondary salinization as shown in fig 6 the figure shows spatial pattern of groundwater depletion from 2005 to 2019 it can be noted that the depletion is increasing temporality at the rate of 1 289 m year qureshi and ashraf 2019 4 2 stakeholder analysis identification of the problem helps in defining project boundaries and time domains the next step is deciding whom to contact for the participatory modeling exercise i e stakeholder analysis initially a stakeholder list was produced through a brainstorming process the literature review and expert judgment pointed out the provisional irrigation dept and land reclamation department as two main stakeholders the provincial irrigation department agricultural extension local farmers and farmer s organizations were considered as potential stakeholders since they have a significant role in water supply and use the department of agricultural engineering and its sub departments such as water management well drilling management and on farm water operations were considered as other potential stakeholders other relevant stakeholders were the environmental protection department local governments indigenous communities and consultants the list provided in fig 7 a addresses stakeholder dynamics and is further filtered based on stakeholder roles such as experts decision makers implementers and users the stakeholder list is finalize based on stakeholder dynamics and their roles at this stage finalized stakeholders were contacted and asked for any missing stakeholders groups most of the stakeholders were satisfied with the list and ensured that all important stakeholders had been included in the list further the final stakeholder list was prioritized based on their power verses interest attributes fig 7 b eventually on the basis of stakeholder dynamics analysis power interest diagram and stakeholder suggestion the irrigation department agricultural extension local farmers land reclamation department ngos indigenous communities and farmers organization were considered as potential stakeholders and were involved in the qualitative modeling exercise 4 3 stakeholder interviews and individual cld modeling exercise after stakeholder analysis potential stakeholders were contacted for preparing their mental maps in the form of clds the first author of the paper acted as a moderator whereas the other co authors acted as facilitators to help stakeholders in the preparation of the cld diagrams this included interviewing the potential stakeholders considering groundwater depletion in the study area as a potential issue the stakeholders indicated that they were self assured and confident with diagrams and modeling process at the initialization phase of casual loop diagram development the stakeholders shared information about the problem some of them identified the problem as low production due to limited supply of canal water while the majority specified the main cause as groundwater depletion all stakeholders mentioned that the groundwater depletion can be controlled by improving surface water distribution limited controlled abstraction of groundwater low level management practices improving awareness about rainwater harvesting proper irrigation scheduling revised cropping pattern conservation tillage dam construction water utilization laser land leveling and use of drip and sprinkler technology however all these management practices options need to be properly evaluated through qualitative modeling of system on holistic scale following proper identification of problem variable the next step was to add causes direct and indirect on the left hand side of problem variable the added causes represented what the stakeholders considered as major processes factors that may increase decrease the problem the flexibility of the dynamic modeling technique allowed the inclusion of variables from different domain such as socio economic and environmental domain this important strengths of this system dynamics modeling made it a good candidate for participatory modeling framework in second step consequences were added on the right side of problem variable in the very last level the constructed model dynamics were exceptionally examined for any feedback relationships among the causes and concequences a simplified example of exceptional policies e g govt subsidies or water availability is presented in fig 8 groundwater depletion is first noted as a problem variable in this case boring depth cropping intensity agriculture system development and technological efficiency were marked as direct and indirect causes whereas govt subsidies tubewell installation and advance irrigation technologies were added as direct and indirect consequences linking tube well installation with boring depth represents a feedback loop an exceptional policy for controlling groundwater depletion is represented by a reinforcing loop water availability loop reinforcing loop represent a reinforcing effect such as giving more government subsidies for tubewell installation may lead to further depletion of groundwater resources hence impact groundwater sustainability in an adverse direction therefore the priority should primarily be on investing in new technologies which improves the productivity of the surface water supply and hence decreases pressure on further exploitation of groundwater resources 4 4 individual cld following the methodology presented in section 4 3 punjab irrigation department land reclamation department agriculture extension department water management department and farmers communities were visited to develop clds every cld consists of some causes consequences and feedback loops a representative sample of an individual cld is shown in fig 9 4 5 merged cld following the individual cld development of five stakeholder group list provided in section 4 4 a stakeholder group meeting was arrange to develop final merged cld ten loops were identified in the final merged cld as shown in fig 10 due to limited length of manuscript only few important loops are discussed here loop 1 irrigation loop contains causes such as groundwater pumping growth yield barren land and cropland use and consequences e g cropping intensity and recharge owing to a lack of groundwater fallow barren land has increased in multan as illustrated in the figure a 2 of appendix a and the total sown area has also decreased shown in the figure a 3 of appendix a cropping intensity is also changing at a constant rate as shown in figure a 4 of appendix a due to an increase in the un irrigated area loop 1 is reinforced loop and indicate a reinforcing impact on groundwater with an increase in cropping intensity loop 3 is the economic growth loop and the main effective cause is the installation of tubewells the area that is irrigated by tubewells shows a descending trend as can be seen in figure a 3 and the main consequence is the country s economy the share of agriculture in the country s gdp is quite high as shown in figure a 5 due to the high production of crops in punjab agriculture has a significant share in the gdp of pakistan punjab s gni demonstrates how much revenue it generate after exporting commodities from punjab hence consider as the main source of income is agriculture as illustrated in figure a 5 this is a balancing loop which highlight the impact of increase in financial resource on groundwater resources improvement in financial stability at farm level may trigger tubewell installation hence may impact groundwater resources adversely loop 5 is the cropping intensity loop the dominant cause and consequence are brackish water and water availability respectively with the passage of time water availability is decreasing and wells are getting dry as exemplified in figure a 4 increasing depth of groundwater may impact its quality and may cause secondary salinization limited availability of water may compel farmers to revise their cropping pattern as per water availability loop 9 is the technology loop shown in the fig 10 it contains causes such as barren land and salt contamination and consequences such as the adaptation of technology and drip irrigation development this loop is reinforced which indicate that with an increase in improved technologies the extent of barren land can be controlled and surface water supplies can be improved which may have positive impact on groundwater resources in fig 10 loop 10 is the crop productivity loop the main causes are domestic use and deforestation domestic use of water has a 3 share in the depletion of groundwater as mentioned in figure a 7 urbanization e g dha multan may changing the future land use and hence the crop productivity as illustrated in figure a 8 loop 10 is a reinforced loop and indicate that with a decrease in cropping intensity stress on groundwater resources may decrease 4 6 policies and methods reinforced loops showing their impact on groundwater depletion were critically evaluated stakeholders proposed solutions were analyzed through merged qualitative cld their potential to resolve groundwater management problems were ranked it was observed that loop 1 loop 3 loop 5 loop 9 and loop 10 were associated with management policies some stakeholders emphasized the need of adequate resources to increase social awareness regarding water wastage this soft solution may reduce groundwater depletion and may result for a sustainable future fig 11 loop 9 farmers organization social groups may run awareness campaign to monitor groundwater on regular basis and timely recommend formulate strategies in case of excessive depleting government organization can assist locals in this regard on the other hand it is also felt that locals should be able to predict socio economic impact on their earning due to change in cropping pattern adoptability of advance techniques such as laser land leveling drip and sprinkler technologies have been recognized as short term policies fig 11 loop 5 whilst construction of large potential dams and pollution control in the canal were taken as long term policies monitoring irrigation distribution systems warabandi systems and managing them at the local level is a way to control groundwater depletion many farmers endorsed this policy but unfortunately they did not have enough awareness of this according to them they already were taking all kinds of precautions on their behalf to conserve water however it was clear from the discussion that there was a lack of awareness previously punjab irrigation and drainage authority pida now punjab khal panchayat authority pkpa established to help farmers with their problems at their own level by involving their participation further changes to the act and strict implementation of the rules are needed awareness campaigns are highly required at this stage to assist farmers to perform their duties effectively fig 11 loop 1 however some stakeholders from the research and development department indicated that marginal and small farmers would not be able adopt new technology for their fields as their production is lower and they can hardly afford their current crop expenses they further highlight the risk involve in losing their investment made in development of new technology due to non adoptability at farm level the research and development highlight the role of govt departments and emphasis that the government may provide soft loans and subsidies to the farmers so that farmers may implement modern technology a few stakeholders also suggested water reuse fig 11 loop 10 they highlight the need to treat domestic water to some extent and use it for fulfill the water requirements of the crop to some extent fig 11 loop 1 it can also help to reduce groundwater pumping fig 11 loop 1 however other stakeholder considering the volume of domestic water reject this policy and consider it will have an insignificant impact another serve issue observed in the area was discharging of industrial effluent in canal water only few industries have their own water treatment plant stakeholder were on the view that government should impose some fine to the industries adding untreated industrial water into the canals this is the prevailing strategy as the distributary s water has been significantly affected by the industrial waste of the pak arab fertilizer industry the industry is discharging its waste into the nobahar canal multan branch which is highly damaging to crops natural habitats and human health it was observed during the visit of downstream farms that farmers were facing unhygienic issues odor and allergies they were even saying that the irrigation department should close this distributary or they were willing to sell their lands so as to save themselves from different health hazards most downstream farmers believed the government should take strict action against these unsanitary conditions to control groundwater depletion another option was the groundwater metering system water pricing fig 11 loop 3 during the interviews upstream stakeholders opposed this policy since they think it may limit their water availability however this policy may help in improve canal water distribution at farm level in the areas where the water level is much lower the public might install artificial recharging wells by mutual funding or receiving a subsidy from the government to save themselves from the drought for this purpose awareness campaigns are necessary and this may help to bring the groundwater level up in general stakeholder proposed improving water footprint water pricing revised cropping pattern distributary s water management practices cleaning distributary after a specific time recharging wells construction dry farming cultivation of drought tolerance crops reuse of surface water soil and water sensors for improving irrigation efficiency weather trickling and mini chromosomal technology are the methods that can be used to preserve groundwater a great deal of action might be taken to adapt these strategies e g awareness campaigns the establishment of research centers subsidies and loans from the government different stakeholder purposed policies were evaluated as the matter of fact all the possible policies are interconnected to each other that is why it was tough to select one the groundwater monitoring at the local level participatory management of groundwater with the collaboration of farmers was found to be the most effective policy on which government and policymakers may take swift action farmers are primarily responsible for the problem so the solution also belongs to them farmers rely on traditional methods and are hesitant to move toward the use of technology and the latest methods for the production and irrigation of their crops however as aforementioned traditional methods of irrigation may lead to the exploitation of groundwater resources section 1 the participatory management of groundwater with the collaboration of farmers can help to solve this problem different stakeholder proposed policies as mention above were evaluated qualitatively through participatory modeling exercise the main aim of this exercise was to identify stakeholder proposed management polices considering local socio economic and environmental conditions however in the absence of a quantitative model it is difficult to optimize or select the most appropriate policy a system dynamics model will be developed for quantitative analysis of this policy in a follow up study different simulation scenarios evaluating the impact of individual policy as well as their combinations will be carried out the policy will be examined for its overall socio economic and environmental impact on a holistic system scale 5 discussion past studies basharat and tariq 2014 identified faizpur region as a groundwater stress red zone area where groundwater has been depleted excessively other studies alam and olsthoorn 2011 latif and ahmad 2009 qureshi et al 2003 have concluded groundwater scarcity is due to excessive pumping of water and can be solved through good management practices the first phase of this research focus on the development of a qualitative system dynamics modeling using system thinking approach which helps in stakeholders engagement through stakeholder participation actual problem in the context of local issues and the stakeholder proposed solutions can be easily identified taking these as policies the main purpose of the paper was to develop clds through mental map of stakeholders that elucidates the importance of groundwater and its availability in the study area following individual clds merged cld holistic model of the system was developed the merge diagram helped in representing the views of different stakeholders in a single frame at this point the conflicting views of stakeholder were marked on preliminary merged clds which later prioritize ranked in a group workshop after removing conflicting view the final merged cld was developed the third phase of the analysis was the identification of policies for addressing the primary problem of groundwater depletion as well as methods for applying those policies in practice in past studies and research this problem has been solely identified on the bases of collected data by researchers the purpose of the present study was the stakeholders participation in identifying and better understanding the real problems of the area and then by their own collaboration devising policies as the solutions cld modeling activities have been very helpful for improving social knowledge as well as interpretation of the various components of the research stakeholders discussed each issue in detail in general they were very disappointed by the government and irrigation department and they were not satisfied by the canal water distribution as canal water was not enough to fulfill their demands stakeholders in downstream areas were facing more issues compared to upstream residents the participating stakeholders felt very comfortable while sharing their problems and appreciated the transparency of the process the stakeholders highlighted their issues requirements policies and methods of better management through the application of suggested policies the approach in this research is cost and time effective which makes it easy to understand and adaptable in developing countries the groundwater depletion model developed in this study considered socio economic and physical parameters it is dynamics in nature and was developed with the assistance of stakeholders therefore current research is quite different from past research based on physical modeling of the area only the stakeholder build clds were very helpful for the development of a quantitative model of the system to study it holistically for the use of functional and integrative expertise traditional and nontraditional coupling methods are required this will be explored in the second phase of research 6 conclusion this paper suggested a stepwise approach for the initialization of stakeholder engagement in groundwater management from an agricultural perspective using qualitative causal loop models built under time and cost constraints this research is the first of its type aimed at evaluating the issue of groundwater depletion in the faizpur distributary with the active involvement of stakeholders the outcomes of the case imply that causal loop diagrams are a powerful and easy approach to initialize stakeholder involvement within the development of qualitative participatory models aimed towards addressing complicated issues related to groundwater management clds are the ideal tools for understanding feedback between environmental processes they help key stakeholders from various organizations and communities to share their perspectives and learn from each other while gaining a more in depth and systematic interpretation of the specific framework they are pursuing the merged group cld model with policies and methods described in this study outline critical aspects relating to the problem from land use modifications to socio monetary conditions in faizpur distributary area pakistan in the qualitative cld modeling method stakeholders recommended several policies with specific regard for economic social and technical steps all stakeholders agreed that the problem of groundwater depletion in the faizpur distributary is attributable to the inequitable distribution of canal water sources frequent pumping of water poor management high agricultural needs and lack of awareness all stakeholders spotlighted the desire for a consciousness marketing campaign dealing with rainwater harvesting irrigation scheduling crop selection according to the area conservation tillage metering systems pollution control in canals water re utilization laser land leveling and drip and sprinkler technology all voluntary case study respondents were pleased with the participatory model that they had created and highlighted the need to follow this approach on different agricultural issues as well as to amplify social awareness among stakeholders declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

9419,over the last two decades participatory modeling has been advocated as an effective method towards integrated adaptive and collaborative water resources management however in developing countries such as pakistan its adaptation is limited due to high cost time and technical skills of stakeholders the proposed research aims to develop a stepwise participatory modeling framework with special focus to the problem of groundwater depletion in the faizpur distributary of bari doab basin pakistan currently due to absence of a well define groundwater management policy together with low social awareness level groundwater sustainability is at risk in term of its quality and quantity for participatory modeling individual causal loop diagrams were developed with potential stakeholders followed by a merged causal loop diagram to represent a holistic view of the complete system the final merged diagram helps in understanding different system processes and allows for a more comprehensive qualitative assessment of stakeholder proposed policies among other proposed policies e g revise cropping pattern gray water reuse and construction of dams water pricing is found to be the most effective policy this policy proved to be helpful in improving irrigation efficiency and hence helps in reducing groundwater extraction the policy may face resistance from upstream farmers due to excessive and cheap availability of irrigation water in their area but can help in water reallocation and shift traditional methods of farming to more advanced techniques the results point to social economic aspects of groundwater management that have not been considered by other modeling studies to date moreover this approach can improve the role of local stakeholder in decision making processes concerning socio environmental regulation and climate change mitigation policies keywords participatory modelling socio environmental causal loop diagrams groundwater management bari doab data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in pakistan groundwater generally contributes more than 75 of the agricultural water demand qureshi et al 2003 according to an estimate pakistan is the 3rd largest groundwater extractor in the world qureshi et al 2010b pakistan utilize 10 of its groundwater resources annually qureshi et al 2010b the average annual groundwater depletion rate is about 0 5 m per year shakoor et al 2018 the main causes of groundwater depletion are frequent groundwater abstractions due to increase in cropping intensity poor management practices declination in surface water supplies due to climate change and lack of social awareness in pakistan due to the lack of any effective groundwater management tubewell installation policy stakeholders such as farmers industries and domestic users consider groundwater as public property and utilize it without considering any future environmental impacts hargrove and heyman 2020 groundwater management issues starts in 1960 s with the establishment of salinity control and reclamation projects scarp large capacity scarp tubewells approximately 0 084 0 14 m3 sec were installed with prime objective of subsurface drainage qureshi et al 2003 additional irrigation supplies from these wells cause an increase in cropping intensity and hence results an exponential increase in number of tubewells during this period number of tubewells increased from 37000 to 84000 qureshi et al 2003 in 1980 s the government of pakistan proposed a policy to license tubewell installation in critical groundwater areas however this could not be implemented due to poor awareness and complexity of process qureshi et al 2010a the current rates of groundwater exploitation are unsustainable mangrio et al 2015 and due to excessive drawdown the irrigating cost from tubewells are 30 times higher than that of surface irrigation the situation demands the social awareness of the issue together with formulation of sustainable management policies the current study helps in the development of participatory modeling framework to increase social awareness and critically evaluating the stakeholder proposed polices according to an estimate in punjab pakistan groundwater levels are depleting at average rate of 0 91 m per year raza et al 2017 which clearly indicate excessive depletion as compared to country level historical trends showed a sharp decrease in groundwater level together with an increase in total dissolve salts tds in the lower bari doab basin of pakistan latif and ahmad 2009 which highlights that the groundwater sustainability is at risk and demands an urgent need of a methodological framework for sustainable groundwater management through stakeholder engagement coupled with future environmental impacts irrigation water supplies the reliance on groundwater supplies has amplified with the concurrent increase in population urban migration and industrialization in lower bari doab study area of research the low canal water supplies and rainfall intensities compel farmers to meet their agriculture water demands through groundwater resources large groundwater discharge with low recharge cause groundwater depletion with mining of resources and ultimately cause adverse effects on the economic condition of farmers by limiting subsurface water supplies due to high pumping cost basharat and tariq 2015 past groundwater management studies in the bari doab region basharat and tariq 2014 kijne 2003 qureshi et al 2010a tanwir et al 2003 highlight the need of sustainable groundwater management through stakeholder proposed policy implementation considering hydrogeological appraisal of escalating groundwater exploitation khan et al 2008 conduct a hydro geological study in rechna doab rd a neighbor catchment of bari doab to asses future groundwater trend scenario analysis of the study indicate that in next 25 years under current dry condition with business as usual scenario there is a risk of approximately 2 3 m drawdown in groundwater levels khan et al 2008 with recent changes in surface water trend due to climate change groundwater sustainability got paramount importance strategic use of stakeholder built local scale models with regional scale analyses can help in highlighting main management issues along with social awareness of the problem regional scale analyses includes water stress assessments for better understanding of groundwater flow dynamic complexities associated with irrigated agricultural systems and governance of groundwater use alley et al 2018 past researchers conduct many physical modeling studies to formulate groundwater management policies however these studies were conducted without the engagement of potential stakeholder and also didn t consider the socio economic conditions of the study area hence failed to address the issue of groundwater overexploitation elshall et al 2020 van steenbergen and oliemans 2002 stakeholder participation is a process of engaging potential parties groups who are under direct indirect impact of poor groundwater management and have the direct interest in the formation of policies for the sustainable management of groundwater according to halbe et al 2013 stakeholder involvement can help in the effective policy making currently in pakistan there is very limited stakeholder participation in the resource management and policy formulation past researcher studies qureshi et al 2003 bourne and walker 2005 halbe et al 2013 showed that engagement of potential stakeholder such as research institute ngos local farmer and government department can help in effective policy development the current manuscript approach will help to address the issues of stakeholder engagement in developing countries such as pakistan stakeholder participation in developed world is well understood and many research studies were conducted in this regards to develop effective methods frameworks castilla rho et al 2017 developed an agent based model of irrigated agriculture the model was based on the principles of cooperation collective action and quantitatively sourced via the world values survey wave 6 n 90 350 they studied three major socio agro hydro systems against unsustainable resource demands the study discovered several tipping points at which social norms shifts groundwater conservation abruptly in response to small changes in cultural values monitoring stipulations and enforcement provisions many authors basco carrera et al 2017 ducrot et al 2014 massuel and riaux 2017 explored the concept of stakeholder participation together with physical environmental assessments however none of these directly engage key stakeholders to study their preferred policies with the assessment of systems dynamics on a holistic scale the present study involves the utilization of an innovative qualitative modeling tool i e causal loop diagrams clds for evaluating stakeholder defined policy scenarios and sustainable groundwater management inam et al 2015 this involves interviewing stakeholder groups for their preferred policy options the methodology proposed in this study focuses directly on addressing limitations of past studies and allows evaluation of stakeholder proposed policies causal loop diagram technique is known as system thinking approach and is used to describe the casual relationship between system components it can help in understanding the dynamic feedback of a system on holistic scale clds also provides help in understanding the impacts of policy decision on system behavior binder et al 2013 the present research outlines a participatory modeling approach that involve the engagement of stakeholders having limited technical skills and financial support stakeholder engagement in policy decision has enormous benefits inam et al 2015 such as social awareness unbiased solutions inclusion of local views in system study bridging communication gaps between different institutes etc however in developing countries such as pakistan stakeholder holder engagement is still on initial stages due to limited skills and resources the research will help in improving stakeholder engagement in resource management and will primarily focus on 1 developing a participatory qualitative system dynamic model for the study area and 2 qualitative assessment and evaluation of stakeholder proposed management policies with special reference to groundwater sustainability the study will helps in the assessment of stakeholder proposed management policies to address groundwater problem identification of agriculture related groundwater depletion issues and solutions as well as an improved understanding of holistic system behavior and governing processes in past clds helps studying the dynamics of different system such as climate change food security coivd 19 pandemic soil salinity and water scarcity adamowski et al 2009 halbe et al 2013 halbe and adamowski 2011 richards et al 2021 sahin et al 2020 on holistic scale however these studies were done individually by the researcher or with experts without the involvement of local stakeholders current study will help in bridging this communication gap this study involve views policy option of local stakeholder by building individual causal loop diagrams and combining them to represent on holistic merged model moreover this study will help in exploring the cooperative management of groundwater which was never explore before this study will be first of its kind in collaboration dealing with groundwater management issues to provide guidelines and monitoring framework which may help in the formulation of sustainable management options 2 study area the faizpur distributary lies in bari doab basin of pakistan it originates from the multan branch with full supply discharge of 8 72 m3 sec faizpur distributary divides in three minors i e qasba minor haveli circle canal hcc 55 a rana minor hcc 56 a and rana minor hcc 59 a the study area lies between 29 770 n and 29 930 n latitude and 71 420 e and 71 470 e longitude fig 1 indicates location and excessive depletion of groundwater resources within the study area the average annual groundwater depth varies from 19 7 to 21 7 m currently 30 of the area show excessive depletion with groundwater depth more than 21 7 m this indicates the need of more financial resources for groundwater extraction due to this fact farmers entirely depend on surface water supplies of faizpur distributary for irrigating their crops in future the surface water supplies may reduce due to climate change and thus impacts the agriculture sustainability of the area the average annual temperature is 24 79 c june is the warmest month with temperatures averaging 32 25 c january is the coldest month with an average temperature of 17 33 c as demonstrated in fig 2 the average annual precipitation is about 217 53 mm october is the driest month with 2 mm of average rainfall majority of rainfall occurs in the month of july with an average of 50 mm the rainfall fluctuates 48 mm between the driest and wettest months throughout the year temperatures varied approximately by 22 3 c with the increase and decrease in temperature reference evapotranspiration eto and relative humidity varies accordingly as shown in fig 2 the downstream area of faizpur distributary is located in the agroecological zones of punjab sugarcane saccharum officinarum l cotton gossypium hirsutum and wheat triticum aestivum l are main crops grown in this region wheat is grown as main crop covering approximately 80 of the area this area also encompasses 20 of pakistan s mono cropping culture the upstream area is located in the agroclimatic zone where cotton gossypium hirsutum is common the total culturable command area cca of the site is 184 08 km2 and the gross command area gca is 184 22 km2 according to one estimate hasan et al 2020 approximately 13 000 tubewells were installed in the catchment area see appendix i large number of tubewells leads to excessive groundwater thus cause groundwater depletion in the area large number of tubewells are dry which inversely effects crop yields punjab is the most productive province of pakistan therefore decrease in agricultural production is adversely affects the economy of the country this demands an urgent need to identify the main causes and consequences of groundwater problem and address it in an efficient manner the groundwater issues of the site were examined at two places i e upstream and downstream faizpur distributary has an upstream discharge more than 95 of the authorized design discharge and the downstream has less than 30 of authorized tail discharge punjab irrigation department 2019 which highlights the management issue at institutional level faizpur distributary seems as the most promising area of search since its groundwater is declining at a steep rate of 1 289 m per year which is higher than another canal command area in pakistan secondly the study area lies in the agro environmental zone and the policies and solutions suggested through this study can be applied in similar areas facing groundwater management issues 3 methodology the collaboration of stakeholders for development of participatory model is well recognize reed provides a comprehensive view of different stakeholder engagement techniques reed et al 2009 the main problem faced during the interview process is the low number of stakeholders are interested in giving the interviews and becoming a part of the meetings it has been observed that the stakeholders of developing countries have less interest in group meetings and interviews thoradeniya and maheshwari 2017 one of the reasons may be the pressure from higher authorities the suggested approach in this research was developed to entail less time and economic resources by excluding large group interviews and gatherings the overall process is presented as flowchart in fig 3 is based on five steps the 1st step involves defining of problem variable the 2nd step includes the enlisting of stakeholders the 3rd step involves the interviews of stakeholders for the development of causal loop diagrams of individual stakeholders i e expressing stakeholders perspectives in the form of clds using vensim software the 4th step involves the merging of all clds i e views of all stakeholders and the 5th step involves evaluation of stakeholder proposed policies and methods 3 1 problem variable problem analysis is paramount important for the stakeholder evaluation and causal loop diagrams modeling phases it is carried out by the first author of this case study through discussion with local stakeholder s in depth literature review and exploration of the problem the success of whole participatory modeling process relies on the transparent formulation of the problem considering stakeholders interests problem definition affects the choice of stakeholders in the modeling procedure proper management is required to interlink the problem variable to the stakeholders requirements sterman 2000 the steps in the analysis of problem variables includes 1 specify the problem variable 2 time horizon 3 interpretation of model boundaries and 4 initial stakeholders list the problem variable analysis is an iterative process the problem variable can be re define if stakeholder seems it necessary and new stakeholder list can be created 3 2 stakeholder analysis after defining the problem variable it is important to filter the stakeholders whose can plays an important role in the modeling process the stakeholder analysis is divided in 2 stages 1 classification stakeholders are classified into different groups based on their influence on the management of problem 2 prioritization this stage involve prioritizing the stakeholders on the bases of their attributes i e power proximity legitimacy and urgency elias et al 2002 the listing of stakeholders can be accomplished using different sources such as reports research papers literature reviews etc the listing of stakeholders is indirectly taken through brainstorming brainstorming is free thinking or enlists something without restriction bezzi 2011 the enlisting process is the first step of study the formulated list can be modified during the stakeholder interviews after the list finalization stakeholders are categories into four major groups such as experts decision makers implementers and most importantly users such classification helps in identifying any missing stakeholders stakeholder group composition may change over time new stakeholders can join and old ones can move out from the system with time their attributes can also change which should be considered in the process these changes can be referred as stakeholder dynamics this study is complemented through bryson and crosby 2015 who describe a power vs interest grid final list of stakeholders were selected who are associated with four attributes of power legitimacy urgency and interest 3 3 causal loop diagrams clds of individual stakeholders after the stakeholder analysis potential stakeholders were approached and stakeholder interviews were conducted for constructing individual clds the stepwise construction procedure of cld is shown in fig 4 clds have been used widely for policymaking water resource management and sustainable resources development mirchi 2013 inam et al 2014 the primary purpose of causal loop diagrams is to provide comprehensive detail of system structure kiani et al 2009 clds are helpful in representing the mental models of different stakeholders for understanding the primary causes of the problem and qualitative analysis of stakeholder proposed policies a cld represents the causal effect between the variables by linking them through arrows a causal link indicates the effect of one variable on another variable a positive link or relationship indicates the direct relationship between variables i e the increase in one variable will cause an increase in the effect variable while the negative link and relationship indicate an inverse relationship between variables closed loops are key in the consideration of clds there are two types of loops reinforcing and balancing a reinforcing loop is a cycle in which variables pass on and come back to a variable with the same sign as the initial one while a balancing loop is a cycle in which variables pass on and come back to a variable with the sign opposite to the initial one interviews were conducted individually with each stakeholder so that they could build their clds without any biases some steps help the process of cld development first define the goal and method of sketching a casual loop diagram using a simple example for the implementation sticky notes and charts were provided to the stakeholder to develop their clds stakeholders attach the sticky note of the problem in the center of the chart then the stakeholder affixes the stick notes of causes on the left side of the chart then these causes are linked to the problem through a causal link arrow in the next step direct and indirect causes are connected through casual links or connections then the direct and indirect consequences are affixed on the right side of the chart like causes consequences are also connected through the casual loop arrows with the help of a pencil eventually causes and consequences are interlinked through a feedback loop the questions that were asked during the stakeholder interview are 1 when did the problem originate time horizon 2 what is the main issue you are tackling now a days 3 what are the effects of the problem variable 4 what are the causes of the problem 5 what is the key feedback proceeding 6 what type of policies and strategies can be acquired for resolving the problem 7 what do you think about which elements or factors can be used for future improvement in the water system moreover the loops are labeled concerning the process they indicated i e surface loop groundwater depletion loop etc for fast reference after each stakeholder cld is completed an extensive tool for modeling vensim software is utilized for incorporating the paper based clds into the dynamic computer system in following step individual clds are merged to develop a holistic qualitative model of the system 3 4 establishment of merged cld the main purpose of the merged model is to represent the distinct prospects and mental models of all individual stakeholders merged cld represents holistic model of the system related to the problem variable its causes its effects feedback loops and possible policies to address the problem variable merged model of current study is shown in fig 10 and will be discussed in detail under section 4 5 of this manuscript in the first step of group model development the most inclusive individual cld model is selected and variables from other stakeholders models are then added different stakeholder may have diversified views during the cld development process their controversies diversified views were marked on the preliminary merged cld and addressed during a follow up group meeting with all stakeholders fig 5 explains the merging process by considering the example of two stakeholder built models represented as model 1 model 2 in order to deal with diversified views of stakeholders the complete merging process can be divided into five categories i e agreement controversary type 1 controversary type 2 controversary type 3 and comprehensive as shown in fig 5 and discussed below 1 agreement if there is a satisfactory agreement between stakeholder constructed models row 1 e g both agreed that variable x has the same impact on variable y then in the merged model variable x casually linked with variable y 2 controversary type 1 if both stakeholders think opposite to each other row 2 for example stakeholder 1 think x as independent variable impacts y as dependent variable while second stakeholder thinks y as independent variable impacts x as dependent variable then both are interlinked in the merged diagram with double arrow but tagged with the star as a controversy 3 controversary type 2 if the 1st stakeholder thinks that x affects y and z and y further affect z while the 2nd stakeholder thinks x impact y and z only then as detailing causal link between y and z is added in the merged model row 3 4 controversary type 3 if the 1st stakeholder thinks that x influences the y and z but the 2nd stakeholder thinks that x only influences y then causal link between both x and y is added and mark as controversary of type 3 row 4 5 comprehensive the view of the stakeholder with more explanation is incorporated in the merged model row 5 all diversified views and controversies were marked on the preliminary merged model diagram for future discussions with all stakeholders stakeholders were asked to attend one follow up group meeting to finalize the merged cld wide ranging discussions regarding the group s opinions on the details of the merged cld and any controversies were encouraged during this meeting this process also allowed stakeholders to share their ideas the preliminary merged diagram i e the overall cld generated by moderators and marked with controversies was presented to stakeholders to elicit their opinions regarding the overall model preliminary merged cld was finalized by addressing all controversies in the light of stakeholders discussion the final merged cld model includes the views of all stakeholders the merging technique worked well in the qualitative modeling of the complete system the application detail of merging process along with practical example are provided in inam et al 2015 4 results the issue of groundwater depletion through participatory modeling was analyzed in faizpur distributary bari doab basin pakistan it took 4 months to develop mental models of stakeholders in the form of clds in the first month problem definition and stakeholder analysis were carried out followed by another month for data collection and definition of project boundaries finally in the last two months stakeholders were contacted and interviews were carried out in the form of qualitative models i e cld initially a demonstration exercise was conducted to familiarize the stakeholders with the cld development process this exercise helped the stakeholders to understand the process for developing their own cld diagrams 4 1 problem variable change in groundwater in the study area over time from the literature review and the feedback of stakeholders and experts it was determined that groundwater depletion was the main issue in the study area considering climate change risks and future water scarcity challenges stakeholders emphasized the importance of finding immediate solutions and considered it mandatory that the problem be solved through stakeholder participation stakeholders further pointed out the need to formulate a sustainable management policy of groundwater abstracts currently there is no management policy and as a result farmers have continued the installation of tube wells even in the saline zone as shown in figure a 1 which results in groundwater depletion and secondary salinization as shown in fig 6 the figure shows spatial pattern of groundwater depletion from 2005 to 2019 it can be noted that the depletion is increasing temporality at the rate of 1 289 m year qureshi and ashraf 2019 4 2 stakeholder analysis identification of the problem helps in defining project boundaries and time domains the next step is deciding whom to contact for the participatory modeling exercise i e stakeholder analysis initially a stakeholder list was produced through a brainstorming process the literature review and expert judgment pointed out the provisional irrigation dept and land reclamation department as two main stakeholders the provincial irrigation department agricultural extension local farmers and farmer s organizations were considered as potential stakeholders since they have a significant role in water supply and use the department of agricultural engineering and its sub departments such as water management well drilling management and on farm water operations were considered as other potential stakeholders other relevant stakeholders were the environmental protection department local governments indigenous communities and consultants the list provided in fig 7 a addresses stakeholder dynamics and is further filtered based on stakeholder roles such as experts decision makers implementers and users the stakeholder list is finalize based on stakeholder dynamics and their roles at this stage finalized stakeholders were contacted and asked for any missing stakeholders groups most of the stakeholders were satisfied with the list and ensured that all important stakeholders had been included in the list further the final stakeholder list was prioritized based on their power verses interest attributes fig 7 b eventually on the basis of stakeholder dynamics analysis power interest diagram and stakeholder suggestion the irrigation department agricultural extension local farmers land reclamation department ngos indigenous communities and farmers organization were considered as potential stakeholders and were involved in the qualitative modeling exercise 4 3 stakeholder interviews and individual cld modeling exercise after stakeholder analysis potential stakeholders were contacted for preparing their mental maps in the form of clds the first author of the paper acted as a moderator whereas the other co authors acted as facilitators to help stakeholders in the preparation of the cld diagrams this included interviewing the potential stakeholders considering groundwater depletion in the study area as a potential issue the stakeholders indicated that they were self assured and confident with diagrams and modeling process at the initialization phase of casual loop diagram development the stakeholders shared information about the problem some of them identified the problem as low production due to limited supply of canal water while the majority specified the main cause as groundwater depletion all stakeholders mentioned that the groundwater depletion can be controlled by improving surface water distribution limited controlled abstraction of groundwater low level management practices improving awareness about rainwater harvesting proper irrigation scheduling revised cropping pattern conservation tillage dam construction water utilization laser land leveling and use of drip and sprinkler technology however all these management practices options need to be properly evaluated through qualitative modeling of system on holistic scale following proper identification of problem variable the next step was to add causes direct and indirect on the left hand side of problem variable the added causes represented what the stakeholders considered as major processes factors that may increase decrease the problem the flexibility of the dynamic modeling technique allowed the inclusion of variables from different domain such as socio economic and environmental domain this important strengths of this system dynamics modeling made it a good candidate for participatory modeling framework in second step consequences were added on the right side of problem variable in the very last level the constructed model dynamics were exceptionally examined for any feedback relationships among the causes and concequences a simplified example of exceptional policies e g govt subsidies or water availability is presented in fig 8 groundwater depletion is first noted as a problem variable in this case boring depth cropping intensity agriculture system development and technological efficiency were marked as direct and indirect causes whereas govt subsidies tubewell installation and advance irrigation technologies were added as direct and indirect consequences linking tube well installation with boring depth represents a feedback loop an exceptional policy for controlling groundwater depletion is represented by a reinforcing loop water availability loop reinforcing loop represent a reinforcing effect such as giving more government subsidies for tubewell installation may lead to further depletion of groundwater resources hence impact groundwater sustainability in an adverse direction therefore the priority should primarily be on investing in new technologies which improves the productivity of the surface water supply and hence decreases pressure on further exploitation of groundwater resources 4 4 individual cld following the methodology presented in section 4 3 punjab irrigation department land reclamation department agriculture extension department water management department and farmers communities were visited to develop clds every cld consists of some causes consequences and feedback loops a representative sample of an individual cld is shown in fig 9 4 5 merged cld following the individual cld development of five stakeholder group list provided in section 4 4 a stakeholder group meeting was arrange to develop final merged cld ten loops were identified in the final merged cld as shown in fig 10 due to limited length of manuscript only few important loops are discussed here loop 1 irrigation loop contains causes such as groundwater pumping growth yield barren land and cropland use and consequences e g cropping intensity and recharge owing to a lack of groundwater fallow barren land has increased in multan as illustrated in the figure a 2 of appendix a and the total sown area has also decreased shown in the figure a 3 of appendix a cropping intensity is also changing at a constant rate as shown in figure a 4 of appendix a due to an increase in the un irrigated area loop 1 is reinforced loop and indicate a reinforcing impact on groundwater with an increase in cropping intensity loop 3 is the economic growth loop and the main effective cause is the installation of tubewells the area that is irrigated by tubewells shows a descending trend as can be seen in figure a 3 and the main consequence is the country s economy the share of agriculture in the country s gdp is quite high as shown in figure a 5 due to the high production of crops in punjab agriculture has a significant share in the gdp of pakistan punjab s gni demonstrates how much revenue it generate after exporting commodities from punjab hence consider as the main source of income is agriculture as illustrated in figure a 5 this is a balancing loop which highlight the impact of increase in financial resource on groundwater resources improvement in financial stability at farm level may trigger tubewell installation hence may impact groundwater resources adversely loop 5 is the cropping intensity loop the dominant cause and consequence are brackish water and water availability respectively with the passage of time water availability is decreasing and wells are getting dry as exemplified in figure a 4 increasing depth of groundwater may impact its quality and may cause secondary salinization limited availability of water may compel farmers to revise their cropping pattern as per water availability loop 9 is the technology loop shown in the fig 10 it contains causes such as barren land and salt contamination and consequences such as the adaptation of technology and drip irrigation development this loop is reinforced which indicate that with an increase in improved technologies the extent of barren land can be controlled and surface water supplies can be improved which may have positive impact on groundwater resources in fig 10 loop 10 is the crop productivity loop the main causes are domestic use and deforestation domestic use of water has a 3 share in the depletion of groundwater as mentioned in figure a 7 urbanization e g dha multan may changing the future land use and hence the crop productivity as illustrated in figure a 8 loop 10 is a reinforced loop and indicate that with a decrease in cropping intensity stress on groundwater resources may decrease 4 6 policies and methods reinforced loops showing their impact on groundwater depletion were critically evaluated stakeholders proposed solutions were analyzed through merged qualitative cld their potential to resolve groundwater management problems were ranked it was observed that loop 1 loop 3 loop 5 loop 9 and loop 10 were associated with management policies some stakeholders emphasized the need of adequate resources to increase social awareness regarding water wastage this soft solution may reduce groundwater depletion and may result for a sustainable future fig 11 loop 9 farmers organization social groups may run awareness campaign to monitor groundwater on regular basis and timely recommend formulate strategies in case of excessive depleting government organization can assist locals in this regard on the other hand it is also felt that locals should be able to predict socio economic impact on their earning due to change in cropping pattern adoptability of advance techniques such as laser land leveling drip and sprinkler technologies have been recognized as short term policies fig 11 loop 5 whilst construction of large potential dams and pollution control in the canal were taken as long term policies monitoring irrigation distribution systems warabandi systems and managing them at the local level is a way to control groundwater depletion many farmers endorsed this policy but unfortunately they did not have enough awareness of this according to them they already were taking all kinds of precautions on their behalf to conserve water however it was clear from the discussion that there was a lack of awareness previously punjab irrigation and drainage authority pida now punjab khal panchayat authority pkpa established to help farmers with their problems at their own level by involving their participation further changes to the act and strict implementation of the rules are needed awareness campaigns are highly required at this stage to assist farmers to perform their duties effectively fig 11 loop 1 however some stakeholders from the research and development department indicated that marginal and small farmers would not be able adopt new technology for their fields as their production is lower and they can hardly afford their current crop expenses they further highlight the risk involve in losing their investment made in development of new technology due to non adoptability at farm level the research and development highlight the role of govt departments and emphasis that the government may provide soft loans and subsidies to the farmers so that farmers may implement modern technology a few stakeholders also suggested water reuse fig 11 loop 10 they highlight the need to treat domestic water to some extent and use it for fulfill the water requirements of the crop to some extent fig 11 loop 1 it can also help to reduce groundwater pumping fig 11 loop 1 however other stakeholder considering the volume of domestic water reject this policy and consider it will have an insignificant impact another serve issue observed in the area was discharging of industrial effluent in canal water only few industries have their own water treatment plant stakeholder were on the view that government should impose some fine to the industries adding untreated industrial water into the canals this is the prevailing strategy as the distributary s water has been significantly affected by the industrial waste of the pak arab fertilizer industry the industry is discharging its waste into the nobahar canal multan branch which is highly damaging to crops natural habitats and human health it was observed during the visit of downstream farms that farmers were facing unhygienic issues odor and allergies they were even saying that the irrigation department should close this distributary or they were willing to sell their lands so as to save themselves from different health hazards most downstream farmers believed the government should take strict action against these unsanitary conditions to control groundwater depletion another option was the groundwater metering system water pricing fig 11 loop 3 during the interviews upstream stakeholders opposed this policy since they think it may limit their water availability however this policy may help in improve canal water distribution at farm level in the areas where the water level is much lower the public might install artificial recharging wells by mutual funding or receiving a subsidy from the government to save themselves from the drought for this purpose awareness campaigns are necessary and this may help to bring the groundwater level up in general stakeholder proposed improving water footprint water pricing revised cropping pattern distributary s water management practices cleaning distributary after a specific time recharging wells construction dry farming cultivation of drought tolerance crops reuse of surface water soil and water sensors for improving irrigation efficiency weather trickling and mini chromosomal technology are the methods that can be used to preserve groundwater a great deal of action might be taken to adapt these strategies e g awareness campaigns the establishment of research centers subsidies and loans from the government different stakeholder purposed policies were evaluated as the matter of fact all the possible policies are interconnected to each other that is why it was tough to select one the groundwater monitoring at the local level participatory management of groundwater with the collaboration of farmers was found to be the most effective policy on which government and policymakers may take swift action farmers are primarily responsible for the problem so the solution also belongs to them farmers rely on traditional methods and are hesitant to move toward the use of technology and the latest methods for the production and irrigation of their crops however as aforementioned traditional methods of irrigation may lead to the exploitation of groundwater resources section 1 the participatory management of groundwater with the collaboration of farmers can help to solve this problem different stakeholder proposed policies as mention above were evaluated qualitatively through participatory modeling exercise the main aim of this exercise was to identify stakeholder proposed management polices considering local socio economic and environmental conditions however in the absence of a quantitative model it is difficult to optimize or select the most appropriate policy a system dynamics model will be developed for quantitative analysis of this policy in a follow up study different simulation scenarios evaluating the impact of individual policy as well as their combinations will be carried out the policy will be examined for its overall socio economic and environmental impact on a holistic system scale 5 discussion past studies basharat and tariq 2014 identified faizpur region as a groundwater stress red zone area where groundwater has been depleted excessively other studies alam and olsthoorn 2011 latif and ahmad 2009 qureshi et al 2003 have concluded groundwater scarcity is due to excessive pumping of water and can be solved through good management practices the first phase of this research focus on the development of a qualitative system dynamics modeling using system thinking approach which helps in stakeholders engagement through stakeholder participation actual problem in the context of local issues and the stakeholder proposed solutions can be easily identified taking these as policies the main purpose of the paper was to develop clds through mental map of stakeholders that elucidates the importance of groundwater and its availability in the study area following individual clds merged cld holistic model of the system was developed the merge diagram helped in representing the views of different stakeholders in a single frame at this point the conflicting views of stakeholder were marked on preliminary merged clds which later prioritize ranked in a group workshop after removing conflicting view the final merged cld was developed the third phase of the analysis was the identification of policies for addressing the primary problem of groundwater depletion as well as methods for applying those policies in practice in past studies and research this problem has been solely identified on the bases of collected data by researchers the purpose of the present study was the stakeholders participation in identifying and better understanding the real problems of the area and then by their own collaboration devising policies as the solutions cld modeling activities have been very helpful for improving social knowledge as well as interpretation of the various components of the research stakeholders discussed each issue in detail in general they were very disappointed by the government and irrigation department and they were not satisfied by the canal water distribution as canal water was not enough to fulfill their demands stakeholders in downstream areas were facing more issues compared to upstream residents the participating stakeholders felt very comfortable while sharing their problems and appreciated the transparency of the process the stakeholders highlighted their issues requirements policies and methods of better management through the application of suggested policies the approach in this research is cost and time effective which makes it easy to understand and adaptable in developing countries the groundwater depletion model developed in this study considered socio economic and physical parameters it is dynamics in nature and was developed with the assistance of stakeholders therefore current research is quite different from past research based on physical modeling of the area only the stakeholder build clds were very helpful for the development of a quantitative model of the system to study it holistically for the use of functional and integrative expertise traditional and nontraditional coupling methods are required this will be explored in the second phase of research 6 conclusion this paper suggested a stepwise approach for the initialization of stakeholder engagement in groundwater management from an agricultural perspective using qualitative causal loop models built under time and cost constraints this research is the first of its type aimed at evaluating the issue of groundwater depletion in the faizpur distributary with the active involvement of stakeholders the outcomes of the case imply that causal loop diagrams are a powerful and easy approach to initialize stakeholder involvement within the development of qualitative participatory models aimed towards addressing complicated issues related to groundwater management clds are the ideal tools for understanding feedback between environmental processes they help key stakeholders from various organizations and communities to share their perspectives and learn from each other while gaining a more in depth and systematic interpretation of the specific framework they are pursuing the merged group cld model with policies and methods described in this study outline critical aspects relating to the problem from land use modifications to socio monetary conditions in faizpur distributary area pakistan in the qualitative cld modeling method stakeholders recommended several policies with specific regard for economic social and technical steps all stakeholders agreed that the problem of groundwater depletion in the faizpur distributary is attributable to the inequitable distribution of canal water sources frequent pumping of water poor management high agricultural needs and lack of awareness all stakeholders spotlighted the desire for a consciousness marketing campaign dealing with rainwater harvesting irrigation scheduling crop selection according to the area conservation tillage metering systems pollution control in canals water re utilization laser land leveling and drip and sprinkler technology all voluntary case study respondents were pleased with the participatory model that they had created and highlighted the need to follow this approach on different agricultural issues as well as to amplify social awareness among stakeholders declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
