18405,an energy recovery technique using a high current bi directional dc dc converter for membrane capacitive de ionization mcdi of brackish waters is described and it s performance assessed in a pilot scale prototype the energy recovery system is shown to reduce the energy consumption of the pilot scale mcdi unit powered by photovoltaics and with battery storage by between 30 and 40 use of a stopped flow process also enables water recovery of up to 87 the contributions to energy consumption in the system are quantified with the insights gained from this analysis enabling the selection of an optimum voltage range for desorption termination that maximizes the daily recovered energy the experimental results demonstrate that energy usage by the mcdi process of lower than 0 4 kwh m3 is achievable with almost 40 of the energy supplied by the batteries recovered graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane capacitive deionization bi directional dc dc converter energy recovery renewable energy 1 introduction membrane capacitive de ionization m cdi water treatment is an increasingly popular technique for the desalination of brackish feed waters with total dissolved solids tds content lower than 4000 mg l cdi involves the electrostatic adsorption of charged species from a stream of water onto charged electrodes with this process resulting in a product with reduced salt concentration the addition of ion exchange membranes iem in mcdi greatly increases the performance of cdi by minimizing co ion repulsion biesheuvel et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 suggested that the low energy consumption of m cdi renders it competitive as an alternative to reverse osmosis ro for desalination as well as for the removal and or recovery of specific ions however m cdi has yet to achieve widespread market adoption and in recent years research to improve the technology has accelerated of particular relevance to the work described here has been the advances in understanding of the opportunity to recover electrical energy capacitively stored in the electrodes and the effects of numerous operational parameters during the electrode discharging process on overall performance the m cdi electrode stores electrical energy during the adsorption stage as anions and cations are attracted to the charged electrodes with the accumulation of ions of opposite charge creating an electrostatic field in a manner similar to a capacitor this stored energy can be recovered during desorption when the ions are released to a brine stream and the electrodes are electrically discharged using a bidirectional power supply typically a dc dc converter the energy recovered can either be directly used to charge another electrode or as is the case in the study described here to charge an energy storage device a battery in this case which is also used to store energy from a photovoltaic system that provides the primary energy source for the system the energy recovery achieved by directing current during discharge to the battery reduces the overall energy required for de ionization długołęcki and van der wal 2013 were the first to describe energy recovery for mcdi although the energy recovery scheme developed by these investigators transferred the energy to an external load rather than to a storage component that enabled reuse of the recovered energy similar work in which discharge to an external load at low currents 1 a was used has been described by chen et al 2018 with the conclusion that use of higher current will increase the power loss which is in agreement with basic electrical principles since the possibility of energy recovery from m cdi was identified research has been performed to develop electronic circuits to achieve the necessary electrical transfers so far most of the circuitry topologies developed for this purpose are of the buck boost dc dc converter type alkuran et al 2008 álvarez gonzález et al 2016 kang et al 2016 pernia et al 2013 seleym and elshafei 2017 with the load either a super capacitor or another m cdi cell for example alkuran et al 2008 used a buck boost converter to recover the energy stored in the electrode to a super capacitor with the super capacitor charged only when the inductor current reached a pre set peak value using this approach the energy in the cdi cell can be fully released such that recovered energy is maximised álvarez gonzález et al 2016 and pernia et al 2013 used buck boost converters to cascade multiple cdi stages so that the energy released from a desorbing electrode was used by an adsorbing electrode while sequential charging is possible and multiple electrodes can be cascaded compensation of the energy loss during charge transfer increases the complexity of the control systems the same group also assessed energy recovery to an external load investigating the trade off between conduction and conversion losses of the converter operating at various currents pernía et al 2012 as well as the internal properties of the electrode the number of electrodes and ion concentration of the spacer channel solution pernía et al 2014 in regards to operating conditions garcía quismondo et al 2016 showed that lower current efficiencies were obtained in cdi systems operating at higher discharge currents kim et al 2015 found that charge efficiency and energy usage are diminished at relatively low discharge voltages during desorption with this effect attributed to limited improvements in salt adsorption with extended depth of discharge other investigators have reported that flushing the electrode during regeneration with a brine stream of higher concentration resulted in improved energy efficiency water recovery and ion desorption rate garcía quismondo et al 2016 hemmatifar et al 2016 alternatively the feed flow rate during desorption could be varied to improve water recovery and thermodynamic efficiency ramachandran et al 2019 however there are limits to these benefits as excessively high spacer channel concentrations and or low flow rates will negatively impact ion transport and flow efficiency hassanvand et al 2017 hawks et al 2019 ion concentrations are also known to affect ionic and electric resistances in cdi systems and in turn the energy consumption of the process dykstra et al 2016 interestingly assessment of the performance of m cdi systems with a product rate above 1 m3 day has rarely been reported biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 dlugolecki et al 2016 mossad and zou 2012 tan et al 2018 and of these none have implemented energy recovery researchers often perform experiments based on lab scale prototypes and tend to ignore two of the major challenges confronting energy recovery in full scale units that the energy stored in an m cdi electrode may be over tens of kilojoules and that the charge discharge current required may be in the order of 100s of amperes if high treatment capacity and production rate are to be achieved the first factor raises issues regarding the large number of super capacitors required to store the recovered energy thereby rendering the system bulky and costly the second factor requires careful engineering of the high current dc dc converter and the sections of the electrical system that carry these high currents for example the conductors connecting the power supply to the cdi electrodes should be short with a large cross sectional area xsa in order to minimize ohmic energy loss apart from the employment of dc dc converters a potentially simple low cost method to recover energy is to connect two electrodes together one charged and the other discharged with the purpose of transferring energy between electrodes with such an arrangement the current between the electrodes will be unregulated when they are connected together with the peak currents being in excess of the currents typically used to charge the electrodes the peak current depends on the differential voltage between the electrodes and the loop resistance approximately half the stored energy in the electrode would be dissipated in the loop resistance and the associated high peak currents will reduce the life time of the high current relay which links the electrodes in addition process control is difficult as the timing of the adsorption and desorption stages are dependent on each other as a result this method does not suit large scale mcdi operation in view of the low voltages required to induce capacitive deionization typically 1 3 v mcdi is well suited to being powered by the output of photovoltaic pv modules seleym and elshafei 2017 undertook a theoretical analysis of the feasibility of a cdi system with a dc dc converter featuring max power point tracking mppt to pv panels to avoid the adoption of batteries however no experimental results were provided this approach reduces the capital cost but constrains the operation of the system to within day light hours tan et al 2018 designed an mcdi system powered by solar energy with battery storage enabling 24 h operation but used a uni directional dc dc converter and a short circuit stage for desorption with the result that energy stored in the mcdi electrode at the end of the adsorption step was dissipated as ohmic heating while short circuiting the electrode terminals can rapidly discharge the mcdi module essentially consuming the stored energy to hasten electrode discharge the currents are extraordinarily high over 400 a thereby increasing the cost of the system as the circuit has to be engineered to safely conduct these high currents a bi directional dc dc converter allows for energy flow in both directions between a dc source and the mcdi electrode in the system described here a battery bank provides energy for treating brackish water with each mcdi electrode linked to the battery bank via a bidirectional dc dc converter this allows independent control of individual mcdi electrodes as the individual electrodes are electrically decoupled from each other this approach reduces the complexity in the control and piping design and enhances system reliability energy recovery is realized with a pilot scale mcdi system capable of producing around 4 m3 day of product per mcdi cell the loss distribution is investigated experimentally with the implementation of two different desorption methods namely constant flow and stopped flow in addition an optimum desorption voltage window for the mcdi electrode used in this study is proposed 2 pilot scale mcdi system 2 1 configuration of pilot scale mcdi system the electrical configuration of the pilot scale mcdi system in tan et al 2018 is shown in fig 1 with a bi directional buck converter replacing the uni directional converter in the uni directional system the high current relay was used for discharging the electrode during desorption and required a peak current rating higher than 400 a consequently the life time of this relay is much reduced by the cyclical heat generation during discharge stages negatively impacting the reliability of the system in long term operation the bi directional converter system dispenses with the relay because during desorption the current is controlled by the converter which recovers the energy in the electrode to the batteries such that shunting the cell is no longer a necessary operational stage of the process 2 2 bi directional dc dc converter for energy recovery a bi directional dc dc buck converter is capable of power flow between two power sources in both directions such a converter was designed and constructed to charge and discharge the mcdi electrode with the discharge facility providing the energy recovery capability for the pilot scale single electrode mcdi system a simplified schematic of the converter is shown in the lower part of fig 1 the nominal charge discharge current of the converter is set at 150 a with a maximum continuous output of 180 a the cross section area of the copper rods of the mcdi cell is 38 5 mm2 resulting in current density within the copper rods of 1 3 a mm2 when the output current is 150 a the charge and discharge currents can be individually set to provide process control flexibility the input of the converter is from a lead acid battery with an output voltage that varies from 14 4 v to 10 5 v depending on the state of charge a modular design was adopted for the converter as this provides the flexibility of adjusting output current capability to suit different sized electrodes each module employs two power semiconductor switches metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor mosfet labelled as s up i and s dn i infineon bsc009ne2ls5iatma1 in order to reduce losses two mosfets are paralleled together to form each switch s up i and s dn i as is the current sensing resistor r sns a texas instruments digital signal processor dsp tms320f28379d is used to perform the real time control of the bidirectional converter including the pulse width modulation of the mosfets via their gate drivers the inductor current of each module is sampled by the dsp via its analog to digital converter adc module and a proportional integral compensator closes the feedback loop and provides the current control of the charge and the discharge current of the mcdi electrodes typically a constant current a photograph of a prototype of the converter is shown in fig s1 this configuration provides two significant advantages 1 in a system of multiple mcdi cells each cell is linked to the battery with a bi directional converter such that each electrode can be operated independently from the other electrodes this allows different adsorption and desorption timings charge and discharge currents and electrode limit voltage thresholds all of which are useful in balancing and compensating for differences in hydraulic performance between electrodes 2 the dc dc converters can be installed on the cells so as to minimize the length of the high current connections this not only reduces ohmic loss in the conductors but also gives design flexibility in locating the mcdi electrodes to balance hydraulic performance in this paper the auxiliary equipment and the feed pump are identical to those described by tan et al 2018 thereby enabling comparison of the energy consumption of the pilot scale mcdi system with uni and bi directional converters a simplified process and instrument diagram p id with modifications to the system introduced by tan et al 2018 is shown in fig 2 a bypass valve is added to implement stopped flow during desorption for enhanced water recovery an option that was first reported by biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 instead of reversing voltage polarity of the mcdi cell as this consumes extra energy in desorption a constant current is used to recover energy from the cell as aforementioned this will be detailed in section 3 2 3 materials and procedures 3 1 equipment and components the electrodes used in the pilot scale system are manufactured by voltea b v model c 17 22 fcld rg the diameter of each cell is 28 cm and the height is 70 cm the internal volume of the mcdi cell is approximately 11 l with an estimated 1 l volume in the spacer channel between the electrode pairs the internal design is proprietary to voltea and commercially sensitive the rated input current is 400 a max the feed flow ranges from 0 1 to 1 3 m3 hr and the maximum pressure is 10 bar one valve regulated lead acid gel battery endurogel 12 eg 300 with nominal voltage of 12 v and capacity of 300 ah was used as the battery powers the mcdi module it is a node in the circuit that can be used to determine the total energy consumption of the mcdi electrode plus the bi directional converter a 12 v dc diaphragm pump from seaflo model sfdp1 050 060 51 provides feed water to the mcdi cell with a nominal open flow rate of 18 9 l min in the experiments this pump is powered by a 240 v ac to 0 16 v dc converter in order to separate its energy usage from that of the mcdi cell the flow rate is controlled by adjusting the input current of the pump following the feed pump is a pre treatment filtration train composed of two 5 μm polymer filters and one activated carbon filter analytical grade sodium chloride nacl sigma aldrich and 18 mω cm milli q water millipore were used for the preparation of the feed stream the specifications of the lab designed bi directional dc dc converter were introduced in section 2 1 in order to reduce the external ohmic loss at high output currents copper busbars with a cross sectional area xsa of 45 mm2 15 mm by 3 mm were used at the output of the converter fig s1 the xsa of the cables joining the mcdi electrode and the converter was 33 6 mm2 awg 2 3 2 desorption methods and operational stages two desorption methods with different flow rates are investigated in this paper the first is a conventional constant flow method hereinafter cf in which the flow rate is maintained constant throughout all stages the second is a stopped flow method hereinafter sf in which a bypass valve is opened and the product valve and waste valve are closed when the electrode is discharged such that the solution remains in the electrode until the end of desorption and ions expelled from the membranes accumulate in this solution since only a limited volume is used for desorption the water recovery of the system is greatly improved for both flow regimes desorption involves the electrical discharge of the electrode at a constant current of 150 a the effect of the two operational modes on energy recovery is assessed a full cycle of mcdi operation comprises four stages 1 charge adsorption stage the dc dc converter delivers positive constant current 150 a to the mcdi electrode and energy is transferred from the battery to the electrode the converter stops charging the mcdi cell when the cell voltage reaches 1 3 v 2 standby stage 1 the converter stops charging the cell in this stage which follows the charge stage enabling residual clean water in the cell to flow out of the mcdi cell the duration of this stage is fixed at 20 s such that 2 l of treated water passes through the cell for the flow rate studied 6 lpm 3 discharge desorption stage with energy recovery in this stage which follows standby stage 1 the dc dc converter delivers a negative constant current to the mcdi electrode thereby enabling energy to be recovered from the electrode to the battery during this stage in cf mode a waste brine stream is formed by the electrode as desorption occurs releasing the electrosorbed salt back into the spacer solution in sf mode product and waste valves are closed and a bypass valve is opened such that the salt released from the electrodes remains in the spacer solution of the cell this stage terminates when the cell voltage of the mcdi cell decreases to a predetermined level 4 standby stage 2 this stage commences after the end of the discharge stage with the current reduced to zero by the dc dc converter it allows the residual brine stream to flow out of the mcdi cell without continued salt release nor wasting additional electrical energy by desalinating the brine the duration of this stage is the same as that of standby stage 1 and is fixed at 20 s 3 3 experimental setup two conductivity probes con bta vernier corp usa were used to measure the influent and effluent tds conductivity probes were calibrated with nacl standard solutions and a voltage probe vp bta vernier corp usa was used to monitor the cell voltage of the mcdi electrode a lecroy waverunner 64xi oscilloscope was used to record the voltages and the currents of the battery and the mcdi electrode the energy consumption of each period was calculated using the post processing capabilities of the oscilloscope a high current probe lecroy cp500 was used to measure both the mcdi current and the battery current gmc i porsys cp35 measurements were recorded after the process entered steady state cycling by which stage each cycle was similar to adjacent cycles the data points presented were an average of the results of at least three steady state cycles in a previous study tan et al 2018 the relationship between charging current flow rate and change of conductivity was described although energy recovery was suggested as a method to improve the energy profile of the mcdi system no experimental results were provided in this study the tds of the feed water was approximately 1900 mg l the flow rate was maintained at 6 lpm and charge discharge current at 150 a in order to investigate the actual distribution of energy loss and recovery in the pilot scale plant 3 4 definitions of key parameters the water recovery is defined as 1 water recovery v p r o d v p r o d v w a s t e where v prod is the volume of product water and v waste is the volume of waste water the solution with tds lower than that of the feed stream is recognized as product otherwise the solution is regarded as waste this value describes the volume of product water produced per volume of input water energy consumption e is defined as 2 e t 1 t 2 u t i t d t where t 1 and t 2 are the start and the end times of a certain stage and u t and i t are the terminal voltage and input current of the mcdi electrode the calculation of e was performed by the oscilloscope the energy recovery ratio is defined as 3 e n e r g y r e c o v e r y r a t i o e r e c d i s c h e t o t a l c h where e rec disch is the total energy returned to the battery over a discharge stage and e total ch is the energy delivered by the battery during the charging cycle these energy figures were determined by capturing the voltage measured at the battery terminals or the mcdi electrode terminals and the current fed directly to the battery or the electrode since e rec disch is the recovered energy available for the next charge cycle the energy recovery ratio describes the energy recovery capability of the mcdi system the average converter efficiency is defined as 4 η e o u t e i n where e in and e out are the relevant input and output energies measured at the input terminals and output terminals of the bi directional converter over a period the average converter efficiency reflects the electrical performance of the bi directional converter in converting between potential differences the voltage conversion ratio of the dc dc converter is defined as 5 v o l t a g e c o n v e r s i o n r a t i o v o u t v i n where v out and v in are the output and the input voltage of the converter dc dc converters exhibit particular voltage conversion ratios that offer the best efficiencies with performance falling quickly on moving away from these optimal operating points when recovering energy in the discharging mode the bi directional dc dc converter operates in boost mode where the voltage conversion ratio is 10 or more this is a high conversion ratio and results in a poor efficiency the three different levels of terminating voltage for desorption used here 0 8 v high level 0 6 v medium level and 0 4 v low level allowing for exploration of different voltage conversion ratios and their effect on overall efficiency 4 results the tds of the treated stream and voltage as a function of time for a feed stream of tds around 1900 mg l and mcdi cell voltage set at 0 6 v during desorption for both continuous flow cf and stopped flow sf options during the desorption step are shown in fig 3 as expected a more highly concentrated brine stream was produced in sf mode fig 3a compared to cf mode fig 3b as the brine resides in the cell for a longer time in sf mode than in cf mode when a continuous stream is used for flushing as can be seen from fig 3 the effluent tds in sf mode was more than two times higher than that in cf mode and was nearly four times higher than that of the influent the ratio of effluent to feed tds was less than that reported by biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 as standby stage flushing of the electrodes was implemented in this current study additionally extra energy from external sources was used in their study to force more salt out of the porous carbon membranes during reverse voltage desorption the duration of desorption in sf mode was shorter than that in cf mode at the same terminating voltage level as shown in fig s2 the ions in solution and within the membranes form an equivalent resistor in parallel with the electrode capacitance the increasing concentration of ions increases the conductivity of the solution hence the equivalent parallel resistance decreases and the self discharge current of the electrode increases thereby shortening the desorption duration an example of voltage and current waveforms of the battery and the mcdi cell throughout the course of two cycles of charging standby and discharging stages is shown in fig s3 the charge and the discharge currents were 150 a the average discharge current with energy recovery as adopted here was lower than the average short circuit discharge current of the mcdi modules a lower production rate results when implementing energy recovery as a greater proportion of time is spent in discharging mode compared to the case when short circuit discharge is used tan et al 2018 in this example the discharging stage ended when the mcdi cell voltage fell to 0 6 v the current is defined as positive when it flows from the battery to the mcdi electrode charge and negative in the energy recovery discharge stage when current flows to the battery from the mcdi cell fig s3 shows that the battery current reversed during the discharge stage in standby stages the converter did not deliver current so the battery current was zero spikes observed on the trace of battery current during the standby stages 1 and 2 were caused by the need to periodically reset the current probes to avoid the sleep function fig s4 shows the traces obtained at different terminating voltages for the desorption stage since the charge current and the discharge current were identical although flowing in different directions the durations of the charge and the discharge stage were almost equal in each experimental set as were the rates of change of the electrode voltage in practical applications the current in these two stages can be set to different values depending on the condition of the influent stream power and energy reserves and users requirements with a lower desorption terminating voltage the charge and discharge periods are longer the impacts on recovered energy and losses are varied as will be demonstrated later fig 4 shows the durations of each stage per cycle fig 4a and the overall time allocation per day fig 4b since the charge and discharge currents were the same the charging time blue values shown above the markers and the discharging time red values shown below the markers were almost equal in each case the two standby stages took a combined 40 s over the course of a cycle for all voltage thresholds which was longer than either the charge or discharge durations for a minimum voltage of 0 8 v in this case the standby stages represented more than one third of the operational time being spent in a non treatment stage i e no active current at the mcdi terminals short charging and discharging stages result in more frequent standby stages which reduces the system production rate with an increase in the charging and discharging times the proportion of time spent in the standby stages is reduced so the system spends a longer time in a treatment stage more energy is used and greater production can be achieved a comparison of the two discharge flow regimes shows that with the same terminating voltage the sf method has shorter discharging stages than the cf method per cycle this is because the accumulation of ions released into the spacer channel effectively reduces the equivalent parallel resistance across the equivalent capacitance thereby increasing electrical self discharge and accelerating the discharging stage hemmatifar et al 2016 this difference is also reflected in the daily discharging time fig s5 shows the average converter efficiency of the dc dc converter during the adsorption and the desorption stages in sf and cf modes the input voltage and the output voltage were measured at the input and the output terminals of the converter and as such the voltage drop along connection cables are excluded from this figure since the charging current was fixed at 150 a the converter efficiencies of both methods in the adsorption stage were almost the same while the charging efficiencies are excellent 90 the lower efficiencies during desorption stages can be attributed to the high step up voltage required of the converter the efficiency of a boost converter usually peaks with step up voltage ratios below 10 whereas in this case the ratio is over 10 and as high as 30 for operation down to 0 4v the cell voltage of the mcdi electrode decreases as desorption continues and if the voltage drop across the high current conductor is also taken into consideration the real step up voltage ratio could be even higher than the theoretical value as such it is expected that excessively long desorption periods i e lower cell voltage at the end of desorption for the mcdi electrode will result in a reduction in the efficiency of the dc dc converter with a concomitant decrease in energy recovery in view of these considerations the discharge mode should not be terminated at low voltages if high energy recovery efficiency is to be achieved provided that the product rate requirement is satisfied the energy delivered from the battery can be categorised into three parts i external losses mainly attributed to the dc dc converter and the cables and contacts operating at the high electrode current ii internal loss in the mcdi cell and iii energy recovered back to the battery it should be noted that the mcdi electrode was not fully discharged in these experiments once steady state operation has been achieved the stored energy and salt remaining at the end of one cycle remains at the start of the subsequent cycle the energy loss in the mcdi cell can be envisaged as losses in the equivalent series and parallel resistors in the electrical circuit model of mcdi as described by hemmatifar et al 2016 fig 5 shows the distribution of energy consumption over a full cycle the x axis labels denote the desorption method and the terminating voltage during desorption in fig 5a the numbers above the bars represent the total energy from the batteries during the charge stage i e the sum of the recovered energy and all external and internal losses both desorption methods have similar trends as evident from fig 4 and fig s4 the lower the terminating voltage for desorption the longer the desorption time and consequently the greater the energy recovered it should be noted that the rate of recovering energy when the terminating voltage changes from 0 8 v to 0 4 v slows down from fig 5a when the terminating voltage changed from 0 8 v to 0 6 v an extra 3 99 kj was recovered in 59 3s and at a rate of 0 0673 kj s when the terminating voltage changed from 0 6 v to 0 4 v a further 1 89 kj was recovered in 53 9s and at a rate of 0 0351 kj s the rate of energy recovery in the last 53 9 s is almost halved compared to that in the first period of 59 3 s this trend was similarly observed in the sf method therefore energy cannot be recovered as efficiently with a low terminating voltage compared to the case at medium and high terminating voltages in terms of recovered energy operation in cf mode resultd in greater energy recovery than is the case in sf mode with this result mainly due to the different discharging durations the proportion of each energy loss component and energy recovery contribution for both operational modes is shown in fig 5b when the terminating voltage decreases the proportion of recovered energy actually drops and the proportion of energy lost increases the reasons for these effects are that 1 in constant current mode cable loss increases linearly with the duration 2 longer discharge times lead to longer charge times resulting in more energy used on ion movements and expended on mcdi internal losses hence the internal loss of mcdi increases 3 the converter is unable to boost the voltage efficiently at the high boost ratios associated with low output terminating voltages the energy flow through the converter effectively just dissipates energy in the converter the voltage conversion ratio from 0 8 v to 12 v is 15 whereas that of a transition from 0 4 v to 12 v is 30 these two voltage conversion ratios are beyond the range recognized to be appropriate for best efficiency consequently the greater voltage required to boost the lower average converter efficiency the converter will achieve the experimental results demonstrate that over a cycle 30 40 of the battery energy fed into the mcdi electrode during the adsorption step can be recovered 20 30 of the fed energy is lost in the mcdi electrode and 40 45 is lost externally on conductors contacts and dc dc converter losses the proportion of energy recovery between cf and sf modes are comparable while the observed absolute energy consumed and recovered in cf mode are consistently greater than for sf mode they are proportional therefore the flow regime during electrical discharge does not affect the percentage energy recovery and improvements in water recovery do not come at a cost to energy recovery energy use during a full day of operation is categorised in fig 6 again the x axis labels denote desorption modes and terminating voltage in fig 6a numbers in red represent the daily net energy supplied by the 12 v battery from top to bottom each part of the bar represents recovered energy internal loss of mcdi and the combined converter and cable losses respectively the external loss is the dominant component of net energy consumption with the decrease of terminating voltage both external and internal losses increases due to an increase in the desorption duration however recovered energy peaks at a terminating voltage of 0 6 v instead of 0 4 v this further demonstrates that low terminating voltages do not enhance energy recovery fig 6b shows that the total recovered energy top part of the bar in blue is about 35 of the energy expended by the battery during the adsorption stage the energy breakdown over a full cycle when the external resistance is changed is shown in fig 7 with these results highlighting the sensitivity of energy recovery to external circuit resistance the two cases on the left hand side of fig 7 are the sets reported in this paper i e cf and sf modes with terminating voltage of 0 4 v with the resistance of the high current cables at 1 1 mω 40 cm per cable american wire gauge awg 2 the two cases on the right side of fig 7 are for a system with longer cables 60 cm per cable and a smaller xsa 21 2 mm2 awg 4 where the measured resistance of the high current cables was 3 mω and the terminating voltage was adjusted to be close to 0 6 v with other experimental conditions remaining unchanged the results show the external loss in the case of 3 mω is about three times that of 1 1 mω and the recovered energy significantly decreased whereas the internal loss in the mcdi cell was largely unaffected consequently the total energy use increased dramatically as the connecting resistance increased this illustrates that in the pilot scale plant when a high current is applied a minor change in external resistance overwhelms the benefit of energy recovery from a higher terminating voltage therefore the electrical system should be carefully engineered to achieve high efficiency operation and enhanced energy recovery a summary of key experimental parameters is given in table 1 it can be seen that the tds of the treated stream for a terminating voltage of 0 8 v was significantly higher than that of the case at terminating voltages of 0 6 v and 0 4 v this is because the charge duration for the 0 8 v case is too short to enable production of enough treated water at a low steady tds level with the product tds of this case influenced by the short period at the beginning of the charge stage when the product tds is decreasing to a steady level in terms of daily production lowering the terminating voltage resulted in an increase in production due to the longer charging period additionally the use of sf mode discharge to achieve an improved water recovery came at the cost of a decrease in rate of production of desalinated water it can be seen from table 1 that production in sf mode is marginally lower than that achieved in cf mode the reason for this result is that the highly concentrated waste was not fully expelled from the mcdi cell over the 20 s of standby stage 2 consequently a few seconds at the beginning of the charging stage are used for desalting the yet to be expelled waste solution lowering the flow efficiency of the process hawks et al 2018 this suggests that more time should be allocated to standby stage 2 for expelling brine stream and further optimising the process especially with sf discharge cf and sf modes with a terminating voltage of 0 4 v produced the largest treated volume whereas their energy figures are higher than those of the other cases examined when water recovery is considered operation in sf mode with a terminating voltage of 0 6 v was the best condition for the pilot scale mcdi system with the proposed configuration and feedwater tds 5 discussion we have undertaken a comparison between discharge via short circuiting with stored energy lost as heat as reported by tan et al 2018 termed here the shunt case and discharging with energy recovery as described in this work with the results listed in table 2 δtds represents the difference of the feed tds and the average product tds as the flow rate used in the shunt case 5 22 lpm was lower than in the present study with energy recovery 6 0 lpm while the charging current remained the same 150 a the δtds of the former study was higher with a lower flow rate the pump energy consumption was also lower the cases reported in this paper reveal a significant reduction more than 50 of the daily energy consumption of the mcdi cell due to the implementation of energy recovery and improvements on high current cables and contacts as a consequence the total daily system energy usage is reduced by 20 7 sf 0 6v vs shunt case with this reduction in energy usage enabling use of either a lower battery capacity or solar panel power rating the production with energy recovery is reduced mainly due to the limitations on the discharge current since the mcdi cell is short circuited in the shunt case the discharge current is uncontrolled and the salt is quickly released to solution within a short time period but the energy stored in the electrode is thermally dissipated within the electrode and external circuit in the cases described in this paper a discharge current of 150 a during desorption is used with the result that energy efficiency is improved at the expense of the rate of salt release and thereby product volume this situation can be improved by using a higher discharge current for energy recovery or including cell short circuiting after energy recovery a trade off between production volume and energy efficiency should be assessed based on the proposed application of the mcdi system hawks et al 2019 wang et al 2019 wang and lin 2018 with the goal to satisfy the water treatment criteria in the most energy efficient and cost effective manner in addition in an actual system such as the pilot scale mcdi system described here baseline energy consumption by ancillary systems will also contribute to the minimum energy used with this representing a constraint on slow flow systems the results demonstrate that with energy recovery and the proposed configuration of battery converter mcdi cell the energy consumption of the mcdi cell can be lowered below 0 4 kwh m3 for one electrode with a δtds of 600 750 mg l and a feed tds of 1900 mg l if the xsa of the high current conductors is increased 50 mm2 or higher for 150a current and the length between converter and electrode terminals shortened the energy recovery will be further improved due to a lower ohmic loss in the conductor ideally the dc dc converter can be mounted directly across the electrode terminals to reduce the energy loss in the conductors carrying the charge discharge current 6 conclusions a pilot scale mcdi system capable of a production rate of about 4 m3 day has been developed with energy recovery using a prototype high efficiency bi directional dc dc converter use of the energy recovery system described here reduces the energy consumption of one electrode down to 60 70 of the case without energy recovery i e to below 0 4 kwh m3 with δtds of 700 mg l and feed flow rate of 6 lpm the analysis of energy distribution shows that nearly 40 of feed energy in the charging stage has been recovered and we predict that careful selection of high current conductors and improvement on the contacts will further increase the energy recovery to nearly 50 we have shown that for the configuration described here desorption should terminate when the electrode voltage falls to around 0 6 v in order to achieve a balance between energy consumption product tds and production volume this is because the bi directional converter becomes more inefficient when the step up voltage ratio increases during desorption two methods in the discharging stage have been investigated constant flow and stopped flow modes the constant flow mode has higher production rate however stopped flow can greatly improve water recovery as only a limited volume of solution is used during desorption of the electrode therefore stopped flow mode and a terminating voltage around 0 6v in desorption are the recommended operational combination for optimum operation of this pilot scale mcdi system the proposed configuration of an mcdi system comprised of a bi directional dc dc converter and an electrode is appropriate for practical applications where production rates are on the order of a few cubic metres per day at the pilot scale examined here energy recovery from the electrode further reduces the energy consumption of mcdi 0 4 kwh m3 by the mcdi electrode and about 1 1 kwh m3 by the complete pilot system and allows for the possibility of stand alone operation with the unit powered completely by renewable energy such as that provided by photovoltaic panels

18405,an energy recovery technique using a high current bi directional dc dc converter for membrane capacitive de ionization mcdi of brackish waters is described and it s performance assessed in a pilot scale prototype the energy recovery system is shown to reduce the energy consumption of the pilot scale mcdi unit powered by photovoltaics and with battery storage by between 30 and 40 use of a stopped flow process also enables water recovery of up to 87 the contributions to energy consumption in the system are quantified with the insights gained from this analysis enabling the selection of an optimum voltage range for desorption termination that maximizes the daily recovered energy the experimental results demonstrate that energy usage by the mcdi process of lower than 0 4 kwh m3 is achievable with almost 40 of the energy supplied by the batteries recovered graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane capacitive deionization bi directional dc dc converter energy recovery renewable energy 1 introduction membrane capacitive de ionization m cdi water treatment is an increasingly popular technique for the desalination of brackish feed waters with total dissolved solids tds content lower than 4000 mg l cdi involves the electrostatic adsorption of charged species from a stream of water onto charged electrodes with this process resulting in a product with reduced salt concentration the addition of ion exchange membranes iem in mcdi greatly increases the performance of cdi by minimizing co ion repulsion biesheuvel et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 suggested that the low energy consumption of m cdi renders it competitive as an alternative to reverse osmosis ro for desalination as well as for the removal and or recovery of specific ions however m cdi has yet to achieve widespread market adoption and in recent years research to improve the technology has accelerated of particular relevance to the work described here has been the advances in understanding of the opportunity to recover electrical energy capacitively stored in the electrodes and the effects of numerous operational parameters during the electrode discharging process on overall performance the m cdi electrode stores electrical energy during the adsorption stage as anions and cations are attracted to the charged electrodes with the accumulation of ions of opposite charge creating an electrostatic field in a manner similar to a capacitor this stored energy can be recovered during desorption when the ions are released to a brine stream and the electrodes are electrically discharged using a bidirectional power supply typically a dc dc converter the energy recovered can either be directly used to charge another electrode or as is the case in the study described here to charge an energy storage device a battery in this case which is also used to store energy from a photovoltaic system that provides the primary energy source for the system the energy recovery achieved by directing current during discharge to the battery reduces the overall energy required for de ionization długołęcki and van der wal 2013 were the first to describe energy recovery for mcdi although the energy recovery scheme developed by these investigators transferred the energy to an external load rather than to a storage component that enabled reuse of the recovered energy similar work in which discharge to an external load at low currents 1 a was used has been described by chen et al 2018 with the conclusion that use of higher current will increase the power loss which is in agreement with basic electrical principles since the possibility of energy recovery from m cdi was identified research has been performed to develop electronic circuits to achieve the necessary electrical transfers so far most of the circuitry topologies developed for this purpose are of the buck boost dc dc converter type alkuran et al 2008 álvarez gonzález et al 2016 kang et al 2016 pernia et al 2013 seleym and elshafei 2017 with the load either a super capacitor or another m cdi cell for example alkuran et al 2008 used a buck boost converter to recover the energy stored in the electrode to a super capacitor with the super capacitor charged only when the inductor current reached a pre set peak value using this approach the energy in the cdi cell can be fully released such that recovered energy is maximised álvarez gonzález et al 2016 and pernia et al 2013 used buck boost converters to cascade multiple cdi stages so that the energy released from a desorbing electrode was used by an adsorbing electrode while sequential charging is possible and multiple electrodes can be cascaded compensation of the energy loss during charge transfer increases the complexity of the control systems the same group also assessed energy recovery to an external load investigating the trade off between conduction and conversion losses of the converter operating at various currents pernía et al 2012 as well as the internal properties of the electrode the number of electrodes and ion concentration of the spacer channel solution pernía et al 2014 in regards to operating conditions garcía quismondo et al 2016 showed that lower current efficiencies were obtained in cdi systems operating at higher discharge currents kim et al 2015 found that charge efficiency and energy usage are diminished at relatively low discharge voltages during desorption with this effect attributed to limited improvements in salt adsorption with extended depth of discharge other investigators have reported that flushing the electrode during regeneration with a brine stream of higher concentration resulted in improved energy efficiency water recovery and ion desorption rate garcía quismondo et al 2016 hemmatifar et al 2016 alternatively the feed flow rate during desorption could be varied to improve water recovery and thermodynamic efficiency ramachandran et al 2019 however there are limits to these benefits as excessively high spacer channel concentrations and or low flow rates will negatively impact ion transport and flow efficiency hassanvand et al 2017 hawks et al 2019 ion concentrations are also known to affect ionic and electric resistances in cdi systems and in turn the energy consumption of the process dykstra et al 2016 interestingly assessment of the performance of m cdi systems with a product rate above 1 m3 day has rarely been reported biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 dlugolecki et al 2016 mossad and zou 2012 tan et al 2018 and of these none have implemented energy recovery researchers often perform experiments based on lab scale prototypes and tend to ignore two of the major challenges confronting energy recovery in full scale units that the energy stored in an m cdi electrode may be over tens of kilojoules and that the charge discharge current required may be in the order of 100s of amperes if high treatment capacity and production rate are to be achieved the first factor raises issues regarding the large number of super capacitors required to store the recovered energy thereby rendering the system bulky and costly the second factor requires careful engineering of the high current dc dc converter and the sections of the electrical system that carry these high currents for example the conductors connecting the power supply to the cdi electrodes should be short with a large cross sectional area xsa in order to minimize ohmic energy loss apart from the employment of dc dc converters a potentially simple low cost method to recover energy is to connect two electrodes together one charged and the other discharged with the purpose of transferring energy between electrodes with such an arrangement the current between the electrodes will be unregulated when they are connected together with the peak currents being in excess of the currents typically used to charge the electrodes the peak current depends on the differential voltage between the electrodes and the loop resistance approximately half the stored energy in the electrode would be dissipated in the loop resistance and the associated high peak currents will reduce the life time of the high current relay which links the electrodes in addition process control is difficult as the timing of the adsorption and desorption stages are dependent on each other as a result this method does not suit large scale mcdi operation in view of the low voltages required to induce capacitive deionization typically 1 3 v mcdi is well suited to being powered by the output of photovoltaic pv modules seleym and elshafei 2017 undertook a theoretical analysis of the feasibility of a cdi system with a dc dc converter featuring max power point tracking mppt to pv panels to avoid the adoption of batteries however no experimental results were provided this approach reduces the capital cost but constrains the operation of the system to within day light hours tan et al 2018 designed an mcdi system powered by solar energy with battery storage enabling 24 h operation but used a uni directional dc dc converter and a short circuit stage for desorption with the result that energy stored in the mcdi electrode at the end of the adsorption step was dissipated as ohmic heating while short circuiting the electrode terminals can rapidly discharge the mcdi module essentially consuming the stored energy to hasten electrode discharge the currents are extraordinarily high over 400 a thereby increasing the cost of the system as the circuit has to be engineered to safely conduct these high currents a bi directional dc dc converter allows for energy flow in both directions between a dc source and the mcdi electrode in the system described here a battery bank provides energy for treating brackish water with each mcdi electrode linked to the battery bank via a bidirectional dc dc converter this allows independent control of individual mcdi electrodes as the individual electrodes are electrically decoupled from each other this approach reduces the complexity in the control and piping design and enhances system reliability energy recovery is realized with a pilot scale mcdi system capable of producing around 4 m3 day of product per mcdi cell the loss distribution is investigated experimentally with the implementation of two different desorption methods namely constant flow and stopped flow in addition an optimum desorption voltage window for the mcdi electrode used in this study is proposed 2 pilot scale mcdi system 2 1 configuration of pilot scale mcdi system the electrical configuration of the pilot scale mcdi system in tan et al 2018 is shown in fig 1 with a bi directional buck converter replacing the uni directional converter in the uni directional system the high current relay was used for discharging the electrode during desorption and required a peak current rating higher than 400 a consequently the life time of this relay is much reduced by the cyclical heat generation during discharge stages negatively impacting the reliability of the system in long term operation the bi directional converter system dispenses with the relay because during desorption the current is controlled by the converter which recovers the energy in the electrode to the batteries such that shunting the cell is no longer a necessary operational stage of the process 2 2 bi directional dc dc converter for energy recovery a bi directional dc dc buck converter is capable of power flow between two power sources in both directions such a converter was designed and constructed to charge and discharge the mcdi electrode with the discharge facility providing the energy recovery capability for the pilot scale single electrode mcdi system a simplified schematic of the converter is shown in the lower part of fig 1 the nominal charge discharge current of the converter is set at 150 a with a maximum continuous output of 180 a the cross section area of the copper rods of the mcdi cell is 38 5 mm2 resulting in current density within the copper rods of 1 3 a mm2 when the output current is 150 a the charge and discharge currents can be individually set to provide process control flexibility the input of the converter is from a lead acid battery with an output voltage that varies from 14 4 v to 10 5 v depending on the state of charge a modular design was adopted for the converter as this provides the flexibility of adjusting output current capability to suit different sized electrodes each module employs two power semiconductor switches metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor mosfet labelled as s up i and s dn i infineon bsc009ne2ls5iatma1 in order to reduce losses two mosfets are paralleled together to form each switch s up i and s dn i as is the current sensing resistor r sns a texas instruments digital signal processor dsp tms320f28379d is used to perform the real time control of the bidirectional converter including the pulse width modulation of the mosfets via their gate drivers the inductor current of each module is sampled by the dsp via its analog to digital converter adc module and a proportional integral compensator closes the feedback loop and provides the current control of the charge and the discharge current of the mcdi electrodes typically a constant current a photograph of a prototype of the converter is shown in fig s1 this configuration provides two significant advantages 1 in a system of multiple mcdi cells each cell is linked to the battery with a bi directional converter such that each electrode can be operated independently from the other electrodes this allows different adsorption and desorption timings charge and discharge currents and electrode limit voltage thresholds all of which are useful in balancing and compensating for differences in hydraulic performance between electrodes 2 the dc dc converters can be installed on the cells so as to minimize the length of the high current connections this not only reduces ohmic loss in the conductors but also gives design flexibility in locating the mcdi electrodes to balance hydraulic performance in this paper the auxiliary equipment and the feed pump are identical to those described by tan et al 2018 thereby enabling comparison of the energy consumption of the pilot scale mcdi system with uni and bi directional converters a simplified process and instrument diagram p id with modifications to the system introduced by tan et al 2018 is shown in fig 2 a bypass valve is added to implement stopped flow during desorption for enhanced water recovery an option that was first reported by biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 instead of reversing voltage polarity of the mcdi cell as this consumes extra energy in desorption a constant current is used to recover energy from the cell as aforementioned this will be detailed in section 3 2 3 materials and procedures 3 1 equipment and components the electrodes used in the pilot scale system are manufactured by voltea b v model c 17 22 fcld rg the diameter of each cell is 28 cm and the height is 70 cm the internal volume of the mcdi cell is approximately 11 l with an estimated 1 l volume in the spacer channel between the electrode pairs the internal design is proprietary to voltea and commercially sensitive the rated input current is 400 a max the feed flow ranges from 0 1 to 1 3 m3 hr and the maximum pressure is 10 bar one valve regulated lead acid gel battery endurogel 12 eg 300 with nominal voltage of 12 v and capacity of 300 ah was used as the battery powers the mcdi module it is a node in the circuit that can be used to determine the total energy consumption of the mcdi electrode plus the bi directional converter a 12 v dc diaphragm pump from seaflo model sfdp1 050 060 51 provides feed water to the mcdi cell with a nominal open flow rate of 18 9 l min in the experiments this pump is powered by a 240 v ac to 0 16 v dc converter in order to separate its energy usage from that of the mcdi cell the flow rate is controlled by adjusting the input current of the pump following the feed pump is a pre treatment filtration train composed of two 5 μm polymer filters and one activated carbon filter analytical grade sodium chloride nacl sigma aldrich and 18 mω cm milli q water millipore were used for the preparation of the feed stream the specifications of the lab designed bi directional dc dc converter were introduced in section 2 1 in order to reduce the external ohmic loss at high output currents copper busbars with a cross sectional area xsa of 45 mm2 15 mm by 3 mm were used at the output of the converter fig s1 the xsa of the cables joining the mcdi electrode and the converter was 33 6 mm2 awg 2 3 2 desorption methods and operational stages two desorption methods with different flow rates are investigated in this paper the first is a conventional constant flow method hereinafter cf in which the flow rate is maintained constant throughout all stages the second is a stopped flow method hereinafter sf in which a bypass valve is opened and the product valve and waste valve are closed when the electrode is discharged such that the solution remains in the electrode until the end of desorption and ions expelled from the membranes accumulate in this solution since only a limited volume is used for desorption the water recovery of the system is greatly improved for both flow regimes desorption involves the electrical discharge of the electrode at a constant current of 150 a the effect of the two operational modes on energy recovery is assessed a full cycle of mcdi operation comprises four stages 1 charge adsorption stage the dc dc converter delivers positive constant current 150 a to the mcdi electrode and energy is transferred from the battery to the electrode the converter stops charging the mcdi cell when the cell voltage reaches 1 3 v 2 standby stage 1 the converter stops charging the cell in this stage which follows the charge stage enabling residual clean water in the cell to flow out of the mcdi cell the duration of this stage is fixed at 20 s such that 2 l of treated water passes through the cell for the flow rate studied 6 lpm 3 discharge desorption stage with energy recovery in this stage which follows standby stage 1 the dc dc converter delivers a negative constant current to the mcdi electrode thereby enabling energy to be recovered from the electrode to the battery during this stage in cf mode a waste brine stream is formed by the electrode as desorption occurs releasing the electrosorbed salt back into the spacer solution in sf mode product and waste valves are closed and a bypass valve is opened such that the salt released from the electrodes remains in the spacer solution of the cell this stage terminates when the cell voltage of the mcdi cell decreases to a predetermined level 4 standby stage 2 this stage commences after the end of the discharge stage with the current reduced to zero by the dc dc converter it allows the residual brine stream to flow out of the mcdi cell without continued salt release nor wasting additional electrical energy by desalinating the brine the duration of this stage is the same as that of standby stage 1 and is fixed at 20 s 3 3 experimental setup two conductivity probes con bta vernier corp usa were used to measure the influent and effluent tds conductivity probes were calibrated with nacl standard solutions and a voltage probe vp bta vernier corp usa was used to monitor the cell voltage of the mcdi electrode a lecroy waverunner 64xi oscilloscope was used to record the voltages and the currents of the battery and the mcdi electrode the energy consumption of each period was calculated using the post processing capabilities of the oscilloscope a high current probe lecroy cp500 was used to measure both the mcdi current and the battery current gmc i porsys cp35 measurements were recorded after the process entered steady state cycling by which stage each cycle was similar to adjacent cycles the data points presented were an average of the results of at least three steady state cycles in a previous study tan et al 2018 the relationship between charging current flow rate and change of conductivity was described although energy recovery was suggested as a method to improve the energy profile of the mcdi system no experimental results were provided in this study the tds of the feed water was approximately 1900 mg l the flow rate was maintained at 6 lpm and charge discharge current at 150 a in order to investigate the actual distribution of energy loss and recovery in the pilot scale plant 3 4 definitions of key parameters the water recovery is defined as 1 water recovery v p r o d v p r o d v w a s t e where v prod is the volume of product water and v waste is the volume of waste water the solution with tds lower than that of the feed stream is recognized as product otherwise the solution is regarded as waste this value describes the volume of product water produced per volume of input water energy consumption e is defined as 2 e t 1 t 2 u t i t d t where t 1 and t 2 are the start and the end times of a certain stage and u t and i t are the terminal voltage and input current of the mcdi electrode the calculation of e was performed by the oscilloscope the energy recovery ratio is defined as 3 e n e r g y r e c o v e r y r a t i o e r e c d i s c h e t o t a l c h where e rec disch is the total energy returned to the battery over a discharge stage and e total ch is the energy delivered by the battery during the charging cycle these energy figures were determined by capturing the voltage measured at the battery terminals or the mcdi electrode terminals and the current fed directly to the battery or the electrode since e rec disch is the recovered energy available for the next charge cycle the energy recovery ratio describes the energy recovery capability of the mcdi system the average converter efficiency is defined as 4 η e o u t e i n where e in and e out are the relevant input and output energies measured at the input terminals and output terminals of the bi directional converter over a period the average converter efficiency reflects the electrical performance of the bi directional converter in converting between potential differences the voltage conversion ratio of the dc dc converter is defined as 5 v o l t a g e c o n v e r s i o n r a t i o v o u t v i n where v out and v in are the output and the input voltage of the converter dc dc converters exhibit particular voltage conversion ratios that offer the best efficiencies with performance falling quickly on moving away from these optimal operating points when recovering energy in the discharging mode the bi directional dc dc converter operates in boost mode where the voltage conversion ratio is 10 or more this is a high conversion ratio and results in a poor efficiency the three different levels of terminating voltage for desorption used here 0 8 v high level 0 6 v medium level and 0 4 v low level allowing for exploration of different voltage conversion ratios and their effect on overall efficiency 4 results the tds of the treated stream and voltage as a function of time for a feed stream of tds around 1900 mg l and mcdi cell voltage set at 0 6 v during desorption for both continuous flow cf and stopped flow sf options during the desorption step are shown in fig 3 as expected a more highly concentrated brine stream was produced in sf mode fig 3a compared to cf mode fig 3b as the brine resides in the cell for a longer time in sf mode than in cf mode when a continuous stream is used for flushing as can be seen from fig 3 the effluent tds in sf mode was more than two times higher than that in cf mode and was nearly four times higher than that of the influent the ratio of effluent to feed tds was less than that reported by biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 as standby stage flushing of the electrodes was implemented in this current study additionally extra energy from external sources was used in their study to force more salt out of the porous carbon membranes during reverse voltage desorption the duration of desorption in sf mode was shorter than that in cf mode at the same terminating voltage level as shown in fig s2 the ions in solution and within the membranes form an equivalent resistor in parallel with the electrode capacitance the increasing concentration of ions increases the conductivity of the solution hence the equivalent parallel resistance decreases and the self discharge current of the electrode increases thereby shortening the desorption duration an example of voltage and current waveforms of the battery and the mcdi cell throughout the course of two cycles of charging standby and discharging stages is shown in fig s3 the charge and the discharge currents were 150 a the average discharge current with energy recovery as adopted here was lower than the average short circuit discharge current of the mcdi modules a lower production rate results when implementing energy recovery as a greater proportion of time is spent in discharging mode compared to the case when short circuit discharge is used tan et al 2018 in this example the discharging stage ended when the mcdi cell voltage fell to 0 6 v the current is defined as positive when it flows from the battery to the mcdi electrode charge and negative in the energy recovery discharge stage when current flows to the battery from the mcdi cell fig s3 shows that the battery current reversed during the discharge stage in standby stages the converter did not deliver current so the battery current was zero spikes observed on the trace of battery current during the standby stages 1 and 2 were caused by the need to periodically reset the current probes to avoid the sleep function fig s4 shows the traces obtained at different terminating voltages for the desorption stage since the charge current and the discharge current were identical although flowing in different directions the durations of the charge and the discharge stage were almost equal in each experimental set as were the rates of change of the electrode voltage in practical applications the current in these two stages can be set to different values depending on the condition of the influent stream power and energy reserves and users requirements with a lower desorption terminating voltage the charge and discharge periods are longer the impacts on recovered energy and losses are varied as will be demonstrated later fig 4 shows the durations of each stage per cycle fig 4a and the overall time allocation per day fig 4b since the charge and discharge currents were the same the charging time blue values shown above the markers and the discharging time red values shown below the markers were almost equal in each case the two standby stages took a combined 40 s over the course of a cycle for all voltage thresholds which was longer than either the charge or discharge durations for a minimum voltage of 0 8 v in this case the standby stages represented more than one third of the operational time being spent in a non treatment stage i e no active current at the mcdi terminals short charging and discharging stages result in more frequent standby stages which reduces the system production rate with an increase in the charging and discharging times the proportion of time spent in the standby stages is reduced so the system spends a longer time in a treatment stage more energy is used and greater production can be achieved a comparison of the two discharge flow regimes shows that with the same terminating voltage the sf method has shorter discharging stages than the cf method per cycle this is because the accumulation of ions released into the spacer channel effectively reduces the equivalent parallel resistance across the equivalent capacitance thereby increasing electrical self discharge and accelerating the discharging stage hemmatifar et al 2016 this difference is also reflected in the daily discharging time fig s5 shows the average converter efficiency of the dc dc converter during the adsorption and the desorption stages in sf and cf modes the input voltage and the output voltage were measured at the input and the output terminals of the converter and as such the voltage drop along connection cables are excluded from this figure since the charging current was fixed at 150 a the converter efficiencies of both methods in the adsorption stage were almost the same while the charging efficiencies are excellent 90 the lower efficiencies during desorption stages can be attributed to the high step up voltage required of the converter the efficiency of a boost converter usually peaks with step up voltage ratios below 10 whereas in this case the ratio is over 10 and as high as 30 for operation down to 0 4v the cell voltage of the mcdi electrode decreases as desorption continues and if the voltage drop across the high current conductor is also taken into consideration the real step up voltage ratio could be even higher than the theoretical value as such it is expected that excessively long desorption periods i e lower cell voltage at the end of desorption for the mcdi electrode will result in a reduction in the efficiency of the dc dc converter with a concomitant decrease in energy recovery in view of these considerations the discharge mode should not be terminated at low voltages if high energy recovery efficiency is to be achieved provided that the product rate requirement is satisfied the energy delivered from the battery can be categorised into three parts i external losses mainly attributed to the dc dc converter and the cables and contacts operating at the high electrode current ii internal loss in the mcdi cell and iii energy recovered back to the battery it should be noted that the mcdi electrode was not fully discharged in these experiments once steady state operation has been achieved the stored energy and salt remaining at the end of one cycle remains at the start of the subsequent cycle the energy loss in the mcdi cell can be envisaged as losses in the equivalent series and parallel resistors in the electrical circuit model of mcdi as described by hemmatifar et al 2016 fig 5 shows the distribution of energy consumption over a full cycle the x axis labels denote the desorption method and the terminating voltage during desorption in fig 5a the numbers above the bars represent the total energy from the batteries during the charge stage i e the sum of the recovered energy and all external and internal losses both desorption methods have similar trends as evident from fig 4 and fig s4 the lower the terminating voltage for desorption the longer the desorption time and consequently the greater the energy recovered it should be noted that the rate of recovering energy when the terminating voltage changes from 0 8 v to 0 4 v slows down from fig 5a when the terminating voltage changed from 0 8 v to 0 6 v an extra 3 99 kj was recovered in 59 3s and at a rate of 0 0673 kj s when the terminating voltage changed from 0 6 v to 0 4 v a further 1 89 kj was recovered in 53 9s and at a rate of 0 0351 kj s the rate of energy recovery in the last 53 9 s is almost halved compared to that in the first period of 59 3 s this trend was similarly observed in the sf method therefore energy cannot be recovered as efficiently with a low terminating voltage compared to the case at medium and high terminating voltages in terms of recovered energy operation in cf mode resultd in greater energy recovery than is the case in sf mode with this result mainly due to the different discharging durations the proportion of each energy loss component and energy recovery contribution for both operational modes is shown in fig 5b when the terminating voltage decreases the proportion of recovered energy actually drops and the proportion of energy lost increases the reasons for these effects are that 1 in constant current mode cable loss increases linearly with the duration 2 longer discharge times lead to longer charge times resulting in more energy used on ion movements and expended on mcdi internal losses hence the internal loss of mcdi increases 3 the converter is unable to boost the voltage efficiently at the high boost ratios associated with low output terminating voltages the energy flow through the converter effectively just dissipates energy in the converter the voltage conversion ratio from 0 8 v to 12 v is 15 whereas that of a transition from 0 4 v to 12 v is 30 these two voltage conversion ratios are beyond the range recognized to be appropriate for best efficiency consequently the greater voltage required to boost the lower average converter efficiency the converter will achieve the experimental results demonstrate that over a cycle 30 40 of the battery energy fed into the mcdi electrode during the adsorption step can be recovered 20 30 of the fed energy is lost in the mcdi electrode and 40 45 is lost externally on conductors contacts and dc dc converter losses the proportion of energy recovery between cf and sf modes are comparable while the observed absolute energy consumed and recovered in cf mode are consistently greater than for sf mode they are proportional therefore the flow regime during electrical discharge does not affect the percentage energy recovery and improvements in water recovery do not come at a cost to energy recovery energy use during a full day of operation is categorised in fig 6 again the x axis labels denote desorption modes and terminating voltage in fig 6a numbers in red represent the daily net energy supplied by the 12 v battery from top to bottom each part of the bar represents recovered energy internal loss of mcdi and the combined converter and cable losses respectively the external loss is the dominant component of net energy consumption with the decrease of terminating voltage both external and internal losses increases due to an increase in the desorption duration however recovered energy peaks at a terminating voltage of 0 6 v instead of 0 4 v this further demonstrates that low terminating voltages do not enhance energy recovery fig 6b shows that the total recovered energy top part of the bar in blue is about 35 of the energy expended by the battery during the adsorption stage the energy breakdown over a full cycle when the external resistance is changed is shown in fig 7 with these results highlighting the sensitivity of energy recovery to external circuit resistance the two cases on the left hand side of fig 7 are the sets reported in this paper i e cf and sf modes with terminating voltage of 0 4 v with the resistance of the high current cables at 1 1 mω 40 cm per cable american wire gauge awg 2 the two cases on the right side of fig 7 are for a system with longer cables 60 cm per cable and a smaller xsa 21 2 mm2 awg 4 where the measured resistance of the high current cables was 3 mω and the terminating voltage was adjusted to be close to 0 6 v with other experimental conditions remaining unchanged the results show the external loss in the case of 3 mω is about three times that of 1 1 mω and the recovered energy significantly decreased whereas the internal loss in the mcdi cell was largely unaffected consequently the total energy use increased dramatically as the connecting resistance increased this illustrates that in the pilot scale plant when a high current is applied a minor change in external resistance overwhelms the benefit of energy recovery from a higher terminating voltage therefore the electrical system should be carefully engineered to achieve high efficiency operation and enhanced energy recovery a summary of key experimental parameters is given in table 1 it can be seen that the tds of the treated stream for a terminating voltage of 0 8 v was significantly higher than that of the case at terminating voltages of 0 6 v and 0 4 v this is because the charge duration for the 0 8 v case is too short to enable production of enough treated water at a low steady tds level with the product tds of this case influenced by the short period at the beginning of the charge stage when the product tds is decreasing to a steady level in terms of daily production lowering the terminating voltage resulted in an increase in production due to the longer charging period additionally the use of sf mode discharge to achieve an improved water recovery came at the cost of a decrease in rate of production of desalinated water it can be seen from table 1 that production in sf mode is marginally lower than that achieved in cf mode the reason for this result is that the highly concentrated waste was not fully expelled from the mcdi cell over the 20 s of standby stage 2 consequently a few seconds at the beginning of the charging stage are used for desalting the yet to be expelled waste solution lowering the flow efficiency of the process hawks et al 2018 this suggests that more time should be allocated to standby stage 2 for expelling brine stream and further optimising the process especially with sf discharge cf and sf modes with a terminating voltage of 0 4 v produced the largest treated volume whereas their energy figures are higher than those of the other cases examined when water recovery is considered operation in sf mode with a terminating voltage of 0 6 v was the best condition for the pilot scale mcdi system with the proposed configuration and feedwater tds 5 discussion we have undertaken a comparison between discharge via short circuiting with stored energy lost as heat as reported by tan et al 2018 termed here the shunt case and discharging with energy recovery as described in this work with the results listed in table 2 δtds represents the difference of the feed tds and the average product tds as the flow rate used in the shunt case 5 22 lpm was lower than in the present study with energy recovery 6 0 lpm while the charging current remained the same 150 a the δtds of the former study was higher with a lower flow rate the pump energy consumption was also lower the cases reported in this paper reveal a significant reduction more than 50 of the daily energy consumption of the mcdi cell due to the implementation of energy recovery and improvements on high current cables and contacts as a consequence the total daily system energy usage is reduced by 20 7 sf 0 6v vs shunt case with this reduction in energy usage enabling use of either a lower battery capacity or solar panel power rating the production with energy recovery is reduced mainly due to the limitations on the discharge current since the mcdi cell is short circuited in the shunt case the discharge current is uncontrolled and the salt is quickly released to solution within a short time period but the energy stored in the electrode is thermally dissipated within the electrode and external circuit in the cases described in this paper a discharge current of 150 a during desorption is used with the result that energy efficiency is improved at the expense of the rate of salt release and thereby product volume this situation can be improved by using a higher discharge current for energy recovery or including cell short circuiting after energy recovery a trade off between production volume and energy efficiency should be assessed based on the proposed application of the mcdi system hawks et al 2019 wang et al 2019 wang and lin 2018 with the goal to satisfy the water treatment criteria in the most energy efficient and cost effective manner in addition in an actual system such as the pilot scale mcdi system described here baseline energy consumption by ancillary systems will also contribute to the minimum energy used with this representing a constraint on slow flow systems the results demonstrate that with energy recovery and the proposed configuration of battery converter mcdi cell the energy consumption of the mcdi cell can be lowered below 0 4 kwh m3 for one electrode with a δtds of 600 750 mg l and a feed tds of 1900 mg l if the xsa of the high current conductors is increased 50 mm2 or higher for 150a current and the length between converter and electrode terminals shortened the energy recovery will be further improved due to a lower ohmic loss in the conductor ideally the dc dc converter can be mounted directly across the electrode terminals to reduce the energy loss in the conductors carrying the charge discharge current 6 conclusions a pilot scale mcdi system capable of a production rate of about 4 m3 day has been developed with energy recovery using a prototype high efficiency bi directional dc dc converter use of the energy recovery system described here reduces the energy consumption of one electrode down to 60 70 of the case without energy recovery i e to below 0 4 kwh m3 with δtds of 700 mg l and feed flow rate of 6 lpm the analysis of energy distribution shows that nearly 40 of feed energy in the charging stage has been recovered and we predict that careful selection of high current conductors and improvement on the contacts will further increase the energy recovery to nearly 50 we have shown that for the configuration described here desorption should terminate when the electrode voltage falls to around 0 6 v in order to achieve a balance between energy consumption product tds and production volume this is because the bi directional converter becomes more inefficient when the step up voltage ratio increases during desorption two methods in the discharging stage have been investigated constant flow and stopped flow modes the constant flow mode has higher production rate however stopped flow can greatly improve water recovery as only a limited volume of solution is used during desorption of the electrode therefore stopped flow mode and a terminating voltage around 0 6v in desorption are the recommended operational combination for optimum operation of this pilot scale mcdi system the proposed configuration of an mcdi system comprised of a bi directional dc dc converter and an electrode is appropriate for practical applications where production rates are on the order of a few cubic metres per day at the pilot scale examined here energy recovery from the electrode further reduces the energy consumption of mcdi 0 4 kwh m3 by the mcdi electrode and about 1 1 kwh m3 by the complete pilot system and allows for the possibility of stand alone operation with the unit powered completely by renewable energy such as that provided by photovoltaic panels

18406,estimating the proportions of particulate organic carbon poc endmembers is essential to fully understand the carbon cycle the function of aquatic ecosystems and the migration of contaminants in eutrophic lakes there is currently no effective remote sensing optical algorithm in the literature to solve this problem in this study a poc source color index s poc was constructed based on the terrestrial and endogenous poc ratios calculated from field measured stable isotope δ13cpoc values the s poc algorithm traces the sources of poc by utilizing three spectral bands centered approximately at 560 nm 674 nm and 709 nm covering the intrinsic optical information of different poc sources at the same time the s poc algorithm shows good applicability to ocean and land color instrument olci medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and geostationary ocean color imager goci image data the poc sources estimated using the algorithm and monthly olci data showed that from march 2018 to january 2019 the poc at the surface of lake taihu was mainly terrigenous in addition due to multiple factors such as algal blooms plant physiology river transport regional rainfall and carbon cycling the distribution of poc sources exhibited strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity compared with other methods it is more convenient to use remote sensing to identify the proportion of poc in different endmembers which offers a more comprehensive understanding of the energy flows and material circulation in lakes graphical abstract image 1 keywords poc sources remote sensing stable isotope algal bloom carbon cycle 1 introduction particulate organic carbon poc plays a significant role in carbon and energy flows within lacustrine systems jiang et al 2015 stackpoole et al 2017 and governs to a large extent the transport of the macronutrients n and p metals and organic contaminants adams et al 2015 poc can have an array of allochthonous and autochthonous sources including terrestrial sources detritus from submersed macrophytes and plankton bianchi and argyrou 1997 derrien et al 2017 some terrestrial organic carbon and endogenous organic carbon are decomposed into co2 and ch4 in a relatively short period of time through heterotrophic action jan et al 2004 valier et al 2015 and approximately about 47 of terrigenous organic carbon is buried in sediments loh et al 2002 guillemette et al 2017 in lakes terrestrial inputs of organic carbon contribute to basal resource availability but can also reduce resource availability due to shading effects on phytoplankton and periphyton jones et al 2012 therefore the estimation of poc sources is critical to providing efficient resolution data for understanding material migration and transformation in lake biogeochemical processes collins et al 2009 lembi 2010 bouchez et al 2014 stable isotopes meyers 1994 bouchez et al 2014 radioisotopes druffel and williams 1990 buesseler et al 2006 chen et al 2018 c n ratios jiang and ji 2013 and lipid biomarkers n alkanes and fatty acids bianchi et al 2007 xu et al 2015 are reliable methods of discriminating the sources of poc of these stable isotopes are widely used due to their high accuracy in the discrimination of c sources raymond et al 2001 finlay and kendall 2008 based on the different mechanisms of co2 fixation taipale et al 2016 δ13c values have been widely used to differentiate between terrestrial c3 and c4 plants c3 plants usually produce 20 isotope fractionation while c4 plants only produce 7 meyers 1997 the δ13c endmember mixing model estimates the contribution rate of total organic carbon from terrigenous and autogenous organic carbon calder and parker 1968 however no matter which method is used to trace the sources of poc a large amount of in situ measurement data is required therefore it is very difficult to obtain large scale long term information from dynamic sources using these methods since the 1990s remote sensing inversion of marine poc has attracted increasing attention stramski et al 1999 remote sensing inversion models have been constructed to determine poc concentration by exploiting the correlation between poc and the particle backscattering coefficient b bp stramski et al 1999 chlorophyll a chl a concentration stramski et al 1999 particulate matter attenuation coefficient c p mishonov et al 2003 water diffuse attenuation coefficient k d mishonov et al 2003 and remote sensing reflectance r rs pabi and arrigo 2006 although these developments have significantly improved our understanding of poc dynamics they are unable to determine the sources and composition of poc by considering the main sources of poc poc concentration deriving models have been improved based on dominant poc sources in inland eutrophic lakes the ratios of r rs jie et al 2018 and the phytoplankton absorption coefficient a ph to debris particulate matter absorption a d jiang et al 2019 are used as the basis for distinguishing poc sources however the classification algorithm is based on the assumption that there is a single and uniformly distributed particulate component in the study waters that dominates the poc concentration jiang et al 2015 therefore although the accuracy of poc mapping has been improved it is hard to quantify the sources and composition dynamics of poc in eutrophic inland waters where the sources of poc change both temporally and spatially thus obtaining spatio temporal dynamic information of poc sources is essential to fully understand the function of aquatic ecosystems xu et al 2019 however the sources of poc in large eutrophic lakes have not been well delineated chen et al 2018 and there is no effective optical algorithm to achieve this lyu et al 2017 this study aimed to establish a remote sensing method capable of determining the proportion of poc end members in surface waters and to apply this to obtain spatiotemporal dynamic information of poc sources in lake taihu this method was based on the use of olci data for typical eutrophic lakes in china using a combination of stable isotope and remote sensing inversion for modeling and comparative analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and in situ sampling strategy two hydrographic cruises were conducted during may and august 2018 in lake taihu a large shallow eutrophic lake surface water area 2338 km2 and mean depth 1 9 m in southern china xiao et al 2017 fig 1 this lake is characterized as a meso eutrophic to hypertrophic lake with varying and complex optical properties lyu et al 2017 algal blooms have been a major problem in the lake since the 1980s niu et al 2011 the most eutrophic regions in lake taihu are meiliang bay and west taihu fig 1 the whole lake connects with 117 rivers and tributaries and contains a frequently occurring reverse flow field in each layer of the water column because of the high frequency of changes in wind direction leading to complex hydrology li et al 2017 the distribution of the sampling sites was not uniform and the changdou and chendong river channel sampling points were used to derive poc reference values for terrestrial endmembers fig 1 according to spatial variation in the aquatic environment lake taihu has been divided into meiliang bay gonghu bay east taihu south taihu west taihu and central taihu hu et al 2010 fig 1 the field measurements were made during the two hydrological voyages in spring and summer when 31 and 42 samples were obtained respectively fig 1 r rs λ measurements were obtained using a fieldspec spectroradiometer range 350 1050 nm sampling interval 1 nm asd usa full details of the measurement and calculation of r rs λ are provided by lei et al 2018 the optical properties of the samples including the absorption of phytoplankton a ph λ coloured dissolved organic matter a cdom and non algae particles a nap λ were measured by filtering and analyzed water samples with a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 3600 using the quantitative filter technique zheng et al 2016 the chl a concentrations were determined using the hot ethanol extraction method parsons 1984 shaohua et al 2020 the concentrations of total suspended matter spm were measured as the mass difference between pre combusted 550 c for 4 h and dried 105 c for 4 h glass fiber filters gf f 0 7 mm before and after the filtration of the water samples filter samples with acid treatments were washed with distilled water to adjust ph values 6 0 7 0 and were then dried in an oven at 55 c to eliminate any adverse effects on the detection of δ13c li et al 2018 a thermo flash analyzer was used to determine poc and δ13c achieving a standard deviation n 3 of less than 0 8 and 0 2 respectively 2 2 calculation of poc sources based on δ13c isotope ratios were reported in parts per million based on the following equation 1 δ 13 c poc r sample r std 1 1000 where rsample is the isotopic ratio of the sample and rstd is the isotopic ratios of the standard torres et al 2014 the 13c 12cvpdb ratio of vienna peedee belemnite vpdb was used as the standard for δ13cpoc lee et al 2011 generally the δ13cpoc values were higher than those of terrestrial poc but lower than those of algal derived poc table 1 this may have resulted from a natural mixing of two endmembers zhou et al 2006 thus the proportion of endogenous and terrestrial poc could be estimated based on a mass balance calculation raymond et al 2001 yuan et al 2017 this approach was based on the mixing model of shultz and calder 1976 assuming that the endmembers of δ13c were terrestrial and endogenous hu et al 2006 zhou et al 2006 for this study area 28 1 was taken as the background value for the terrestrial endmember based on δ13cpoc values in the changdou river and chengdong river fig 1 this value is close to that of c3 plants which is consistent with the paucity of c4 plants within the drainage basin likewise the δ13cpoc of microcystis occurring in surface blooms 20 5 was taken as the endogenous endmember for these calculations kluijver et al 2012 adopting the above endmember values the relative percentage of terrestrial derived organic carbon f in the upper waters of lake taihu was estimated based on the following mixing model shultz and calder 1976 hu et al 2006 zhou et al 2006

3 f 1 f and the concentration of endogenous poc and terrestrial poc was calculated as follows 4 endogenous poc concentration mg l poc f 5 terrestrial poc concentration mg l poc f 2 3 pre processing of olci imagery with special spectral configurations in the red and near infrared bands and high signal to noise ratios olci sentinel 3a is a very effective ocean color sensor designed for monitoring the water quality of optically complex coastal and inland waters olci images of lake taihu at a resolution of 300 m were obtained from the copernicus website geometric correction and atmospheric correction were conducted using seadas 7 2 software and the management unit mathematical model mumm atmospheric correction algorithm contained in seadas which is applicable to inland waters ruddick et al 2000 bi et al 2018 miao et al 2019 2 4 poc source algorithm based on remote sensing fig 2 shows the concept of the formulation of the poc source color index s poc for the simulated olci r rs of high terrestrial poc ratio waters fig 2a and high endogenous poc ratio waters fig 2b respectively both types of waters had a reflection peak at band 6 560 nm which formed a reflection valley at band 9 673 75 nm it was clear that under the influence of the weak absorption of chl a and carotenes and the scattering of cells there were differences in the morphology of endogenous and exogenous reflection peaks similarly due to the difference in c sources terrestrial poc ratio dominated water bodies had a much smaller reflection valley at the red band fig 2a considering that satellite derived r rs at the blue band may have relatively high uncertainties as caused by the strong scattering of aerosols in the short wave band a new method was proposed for calculating the absorption valley for this the calculation of s used r rs at 560 674 and 709 nm as follows 6 s p o c r r s 674 r r s 560 674 560 709 560 r r s 709 r r s 560 2 5 algorithm evaluation data for all 73 samples were sorted in ascending order according to their endogenous or terrestrial poc ratios and then every third site was omitted to test the algorithm as a result all data were divided into two parts a a validation dataset containing one third of the data used to validate the algorithm and b a modelling dataset including approximately two thirds of the data to calibrate the relevant coefficients the root mean square error rmse eq 7 and the mean absolute percentage error mape eq 8 were employed to assess the performance of the poc estimating algorithm 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y j 2 8 mape 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 where y i and y i are the measured and estimated values respectively and n is the sample size 3 results 3 1 δ13cpoc and poc sources δ13cpoc values in may and august ranged from 28 1 to 20 5 and 27 9 to 20 6 respectively fig 3 the endogenous and exogenous reference values showed strong internal and external symbiosis emerson and hedges 1988 in terms of the mean values δ13cpoc in may 24 6 was slightly higher than in august 25 1 showing a higher endogenous trend consistent with the higher chl a for may table 1 a large amount of terrestrial organic matter is transported by rivers into west taihu and south taihu li et al 2017 which explains why the mean δ13cpoc values here were significantly lower than in central taihu fig 4 shows the performance of the isotope model with respect to distinguishing the sources of poc in lake taihu as the background value of the terrestrial endmembers the proportion of terrestrial poc in rivers was 0 97 0 1 fig 4b this indicated a very small error in the use of isotopes to calculate the poc source in addition chl a can be used to characterize the stock of phytoplankton which is an important component of endogenous poc the endogenous poc concentration showed a very significant positive correlation with the chl a concentration r2 0 76 p 0 01 n 73 fig 4a which also indicated that the results of sources identification were reliable in may and august the average poc concentrations in lake taihu were almost the same at 4 35 mg l and 4 39 mg l respectively however poc concentration showed strong spatial heterogeneity fig 3 in may the region with the highest average concentration was south taihu while in august the highest concentrations were measured in central taihu for the source endmembers calculated using the isotope analyses the endogenous proportion was 0 42 in may compared to 0 37 in august for the whole lake the average value of terrestrial poc in may and august both exceeded 0 5 3 2 evaluation of the algorithm performance according to the method described in section 2 5 the sample sizes of the model data set and the independent verification data set were 49 and 24 respectively analysis of the 49 samples from the modelling data set showed a significant correlation between olci derived s poc values and endogenous or terrestrial poc ratios fig 5 a and b from equation 3 the sum of the endogenous and exogenous ratios was 1 which resulted in s poc and the two ratios having the same coefficient of determination r2 0 80 a validation dataset with 24 samples was used to validate the algorithm fig 5c the results of this validation showed that the rmse of the estimated terrestrial poc proportion and the measured values was 13 02 while the mape was only 20 82 fig 5c which indicated that s poc was effective at estimating the terrestrial source proportion similarly the endogenous ratio verification showed that the rmse of the estimated and measured values obtained using the s poc algorithm was 13 02 and the mape was 35 37 the s poc algorithm also had a high value in the estimation of the endogenous source proportion being affected by the inputs from a large number of exogenous rivers the concentration of terrestrial organic matter in lake taihu was generally high which gave the s poc algorithm greater robustness in estimating terrestrial sources overall s poc was effective at estimating the proportion of different poc endmembers 4 discussion 4 1 matching analysis of the s poc algorithm the s poc algorithm based on remote sensing reflected the proportion of endogenous and terrestrial poc in studied eutrophic waters well due to the cloud cover on may 9 2018 synchronous verification was performed using the august 5 2018 olci inversion values time window 4 h and the lake taihu measurements compared with the measured values both the terrestrial and endogenous rmse of the olci inversion was 14 07 fig 5d there was some limited overestimation of terrestrial poc ratios and an underestimation of endogenous poc ratios which might have been caused by common errors in satellite derived products e g imperfect atmospheric correction and temporal difference as far as atmospheric correction is concerned the s poc values were computed as the difference between r rs 674 and r rs 709 eq 6 miao et al 2019 showed that although the mumm atmospheric correction model is more suitable for lake taihu than the flaash the 6s and the bpac models there is still an overcorrection in the near infrared band in addition due to the influence of temporal difference the hydrodynamic changes induced by inflow and outflow rivers yacobi et al 2011 lake currents and wind waves exert a significant effect on poc behaviours in shallow lake ecosystems piirsoo et al 2018 4 2 spatio temporal dynamics of poc sources exploring different carbon sources in eutrophic lakes can help to enhance understanding of lake ecology and carbon cycling here the proportions of different sources in lake taihu from 2018 to 2019 excluding february 2019 due to a lack of suitable imagery were estimated using the s poc algorithm and monthly olci data fig 6 selected monthly olci images where the time interval was closest to 30 days were used to invert the spatiotemporal information of the poc source from april to september there were algal blooms in west taihu south taihu and central taihu the pixels containing algal blooms were removed where r rs 745 r rs 665 3 0 to avoid interference with source estimates simis et al 2005 the spatiotemporal dynamics of the poc sources showed that lake taihu was dominated by terrestrial sources from march 2018 to february 2019 fig 6 which is attributed to a short water exchange period of 300 days in the lake xu et al 2019 excluding the algal bloom areas the proportion of terrestrial poc in lake taihu was 69 1 which is close to the 66 surveyed in the sediment xu et al 2015 the area with the highest annual average terrestrial proportion was central taihu 0 74 and the area with the lowest proportion was meiliang bay 0 64 in the case of lake taihu the input of exogenous organic matter is mainly via river input caused by rainfall in the basin however there was large spatial and temporal heterogeneity between the amount of water entering the lake and the ratios of terrestrial poc according to the data from the lake taihu health bulletin http www tba gov cn the land areas corresponding to west taihu and south taihu are huxi and zhexi respectively and these two districts are where the largest amounts of water enter the lake fig 7 b however tthis was inconsistent with the situation in central taihu which had the highest ratio of terrestrial poc this may indicate that the external input of carbon was not the most important factor affecting the proportion of terrestrial poc endmembers conversely the terrestrial poc in central taihu may derive from sediments and wind speed was an important driver here similarly the monthly mean of the terrestrial ratios of west taihu and south taihu and rainfall in the corresponding areas suggest a similar problem fig 7a in summer and autumn the terrestrial ratio showed a weak negative correlation with rainfall p 0 05 n 12 while in spring and winter there was no significant correlation p 0 05 n 10 in fact poc produced by land leaching and human emissions passes through the entire lake bio pump process the organic carbon inputs from the river are converted into dissolved organic carbon doc co2 ch4 and other non living c by microbial decomposition some of which is permanently buried as c in the sediment phytoplankton and aquatic vegetation absorb co2 from water bodies through photosynthesis and bring land based poc into the new carbon cycle that is the end elements of the distribution of dominant poc source may have seasonal turnover the proportion of poc in different endmembers is physiologically related to phytoplankton and aquatic vegetation huang et al 2019 from a seasonal point of view higher endogenous proportions coincide with the timing of algal blooms and the decomposition of aquatic plants in this study due to the impact of algal blooms the dominant role of exogenous sources was weakened in summer and autumn similarly chl a concentration was highly significantly correlated with the endogenous ratio fig 8 on the one hand endogenous poc is mainly derived from the secretions of phytoplankton during metabolism jones et al 2012 and algae are mainly concentrated in the western part of lake taihu from april to november under the influence of the southeast monsoon lürling et al 2016 this makes it easier for algae driven endogenous poc to become concentrated around algal blooms from april to september fig 6 on the other hand east taihu contains 95 of the lake s aquatic vegetation biomass qin et al 2007 and given that poc and doc produced by the decomposition of vegetation during winter re enter the carbon cycle krembs et al 2002 the endogenous ratio in this part of the lake is increased 4 3 optical mechanism of the s poc algorithm although s poc is an empirical algorithm it can be applied to different sensors based on the conceptual model proposed in section 2 4 the simulated r rs data for the meris modis aqua and goci sensors were tested using an independent verification dataset there was good overall performance using the proposed algorithm for both the simulated meris and olci spectra table 2 which is to be expected given their similarity in band configuration liu et al 2018 the verification results based on modis and goci were comparatively poorer however because the longer nir band is used instead of the 708 nm band the r rs based s poc algorithm showed good performance when using different sensors which may be related to the relationship between s poc and multiple iops because changes in the absorption and scattering properties of waterbodies are ultimately reflected in the difference in the reflection spectrum ma et al 2006 some earlier studies have shown that organic particles may make a strong contribution to absorption but less of a contribution to the backscattering coefficient balch et al 1999 hunter et al 2008 fig 9 shows that three absorption coefficients for the internal and terrestrial source ratios were greater than 0 9 the a ph in the lake water that was dominated by endogenous poc was higher than that of terrestrial poc fig 9a and this difference was evident at 560 nm and 640 nm in general endogenous poc is mainly derived from phytoplanktonic metabolic secretions morán et al 1999 in comparison terrestrial poc is mainly derived from soil organic matter and its degradation products as well as from anthropogenic sources wei et al 2015 in eutrophic waters the primary productivity by phytoplankton contributes more than 80 to endogenous poc jones et al 2012 similarly the a nap in the waters dominated by the terrestrial poc was lower than for endogenous poc fig 9b since the s poc algorithm based on three bands contains optical information of various sources the algorithm showed good applicability the correlation between s poc and the absorption coefficient also illustrates this point fig 10 in the visible region a ph showed a good correlation with s poc which suggests that a ph is an effective indicator of poc sources the indication of a nap sources increased with wavelength and a cdom did not reflect the difference between internal and external sources fig 9c thus a cdom may not be a qualified indicator of the source fig 10 4 4 advantages and limitations of remote sensing for tracing poc sources compared to biochemistry based approaches the use of remote sensing to identify the proportion of poc endmembers is more convenient and efficient than using isotopes machiwa 2010 carbon nitrogen ratios thornton and mcmanus 1994 fatty acids xu et al 2015 and other molecular markers li et al 2018 it does however sacrifice a small amount of precision in this study the δ13c endmember mixing model was used to calculate the poc ratio of different sources phytoplankton based endogenous algae can use hco3 in water and co2 from the atmosphere as carbon sources during photosynthesis the δ13cpoc value of algae is therefore usually higher than that of the land emerson and hedges 1988 in addition aquatic plants also form part of the endogenous source because of their similar isotope fractionation mechanisms and isotope values to algae xu et al 2019 in lake taihu the δ13cpoc values for rivers and algal blooms showed the greatest level of consistency with the observations of mao et al 2012 and kluijver et al 2012 in situ measurements of δ13cpoc in may and august were higher than for terrestrial particulate matter but lower than algae particles which indicates that there was a terrestrial and endogenous mixture of poc in the surface waters during this period that is to say using remote sensing to trace poc sources can obtain a relatively accurate long term sequence more easily to inform understanding of large scale poc source dynamics it should be noted that the present approach was focused on optically complex case 2 waters thus further research is needed to validate and refine the approach for other water types indeed the remote sensing based method was affected by many factors such as satellite image quality and atmospheric correction consequently it cannot obtain more accurate source information than chemical analysis in theory it should be possible to combine the s poc algorithms with existing poc optical algorithm in other studies e g jiang et al 2015 jie et al 2018 to obtain concentration information for different endmembers however due to the optical complexity of inland waters there is some degree of error in optical poc concentration algorithms which makes it difficult to obtain information about different source concentrations 5 conclusions 1 the combination of δ13cpoc and remote sensing was shown to be effective for tracking the sources of poc in a eutrophic lake a s poc could be calculated as s p o c r r s 674 r r s 560 674 560 709 560 r r s 709 r r s 560 2 there was good overall performance using the s poc algorithm for both the simulated meris and olci spectra in the visible range both a ph and a nap provide some indication of the poc sources 3 between march 2018 and january 2019 lake taihu in southern china was dominated by terrestrial poc fluvial carbon inputs may not the most important factor affecting the proportions of terrestrial poc endmembers in this lake as a result of the monsoon exogenous poc in central taihu may mainly derive from sediments 4 there is potential to combine the developed s poc algorithm with existing poc

the algorithm and monthly olci data showed that from march 2018 to january 2019 the poc at the surface of lake taihu was mainly terrigenous in addition due to multiple factors such as algal blooms plant physiology river transport regional rainfall and carbon cycling the distribution of poc sources exhibited strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity compared with other methods it is more convenient to use remote sensing to identify the proportion of poc in different endmembers which offers a more comprehensive understanding of the energy flows and material circulation in lakes graphical abstract image 1 keywords poc sources remote sensing stable isotope algal bloom carbon cycle 1 introduction particulate organic carbon poc plays a significant role in carbon and energy flows within lacustrine systems jiang et al 2015 stackpoole et al 2017 and governs to a large extent the transport of the macronutrients n and p metals and organic contaminants adams et al 2015 poc can have an array of allochthonous and autochthonous sources including terrestrial sources detritus from submersed macrophytes and plankton bianchi and argyrou 1997 derrien et al 2017 some terrestrial organic carbon and endogenous organic carbon are decomposed into co2 and ch4 in a relatively short period of time through heterotrophic action jan et al 2004 valier et al 2015 and approximately about 47 of terrigenous organic carbon is buried in sediments loh et al 2002 guillemette et al 2017 in lakes terrestrial inputs of organic carbon contribute to basal resource availability but can also reduce resource availability due to shading effects on phytoplankton and periphyton jones et al 2012 therefore the estimation of poc sources is critical to providing efficient resolution data for understanding material migration and transformation in lake biogeochemical processes collins et al 2009 lembi 2010 bouchez et al 2014 stable isotopes meyers 1994 bouchez et al 2014 radioisotopes druffel and williams 1990 buesseler et al 2006 chen et al 2018 c n ratios jiang and ji 2013 and lipid biomarkers n alkanes and fatty acids bianchi et al 2007 xu et al 2015 are reliable methods of discriminating the sources of poc of these stable isotopes are widely used due to their high accuracy in the discrimination of c sources raymond et al 2001 finlay and kendall 2008 based on the different mechanisms of co2 fixation taipale et al 2016 δ13c values have been widely used to differentiate between terrestrial c3 and c4 plants c3 plants usually produce 20 isotope fractionation while c4 plants only produce 7 meyers 1997 the δ13c endmember mixing model estimates the contribution rate of total organic carbon from terrigenous and autogenous organic carbon calder and parker 1968 however no matter which method is used to trace the sources of poc a large amount of in situ measurement data is required therefore it is very difficult to obtain large scale long term information from dynamic sources using these methods since the 1990s remote sensing inversion of marine poc has attracted increasing attention stramski et al 1999 remote sensing inversion models have been constructed to determine poc concentration by exploiting the correlation between poc and the particle backscattering coefficient b bp stramski et al 1999 chlorophyll a chl a concentration stramski et al 1999 particulate matter attenuation coefficient c p mishonov et al 2003 water diffuse attenuation coefficient k d mishonov et al 2003 and remote sensing reflectance r rs pabi and arrigo 2006 although these developments have significantly improved our understanding of poc dynamics they are unable to determine the sources and composition of poc by considering the main sources of poc poc concentration deriving models have been improved based on dominant poc sources in inland eutrophic lakes the ratios of r rs jie et al 2018 and the phytoplankton absorption coefficient a ph to debris particulate matter absorption a d jiang et al 2019 are used as the basis for distinguishing poc sources however the classification algorithm is based on the assumption that there is a single and uniformly distributed particulate component in the study waters that dominates the poc concentration jiang et al 2015 therefore although the accuracy of poc mapping has been improved it is hard to quantify the sources and composition dynamics of poc in eutrophic inland waters where the sources of poc change both temporally and spatially thus obtaining spatio temporal dynamic information of poc sources is essential to fully understand the function of aquatic ecosystems xu et al 2019 however the sources of poc in large eutrophic lakes have not been well delineated chen et al 2018 and there is no effective optical algorithm to achieve this lyu et al 2017 this study aimed to establish a remote sensing method capable of determining the proportion of poc end members in surface waters and to apply this to obtain spatiotemporal dynamic information of poc sources in lake taihu this method was based on the use of olci data for typical eutrophic lakes in china using a combination of stable isotope and remote sensing inversion for modeling and comparative analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and in situ sampling strategy two hydrographic cruises were conducted during may and august 2018 in lake taihu a large shallow eutrophic lake surface water area 2338 km2 and mean depth 1 9 m in southern china xiao et al 2017 fig 1 this lake is characterized as a meso eutrophic to hypertrophic lake with varying and complex optical properties lyu et al 2017 algal blooms have been a major problem in the lake since the 1980s niu et al 2011 the most eutrophic regions in lake taihu are meiliang bay and west taihu fig 1 the whole lake connects with 117 rivers and tributaries and contains a frequently occurring reverse flow field in each layer of the water column because of the high frequency of changes in wind direction leading to complex hydrology li et al 2017 the distribution of the sampling sites was not uniform and the changdou and chendong river channel sampling points were used to derive poc reference values for terrestrial endmembers fig 1 according to spatial variation in the aquatic environment lake taihu has been divided into meiliang bay gonghu bay east taihu south taihu west taihu and central taihu hu et al 2010 fig 1 the field measurements were made during the two hydrological voyages in spring and summer when 31 and 42 samples were obtained respectively fig 1 r rs λ measurements were obtained using a fieldspec spectroradiometer range 350 1050 nm sampling interval 1 nm asd usa full details of the measurement and calculation of r rs λ are provided by lei et al 2018 the optical properties of the samples including the absorption of phytoplankton a ph λ coloured dissolved organic matter a cdom and non algae particles a nap λ were measured by filtering and analyzed water samples with a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 3600 using the quantitative filter technique zheng et al 2016 the chl a concentrations were determined using the hot ethanol extraction method parsons 1984 shaohua et al 2020 the concentrations of total suspended matter spm were measured as the mass difference between pre combusted 550 c for 4 h and dried 105 c for 4 h glass fiber filters gf f 0 7 mm before and after the filtration of the water samples filter samples with acid treatments were washed with distilled water to adjust ph values 6 0 7 0 and were then dried in an oven at 55 c to eliminate any adverse effects on the detection of δ13c li et al 2018 a thermo flash analyzer was used to determine poc and δ13c achieving a standard deviation n 3 of less than 0 8 and 0 2 respectively 2 2 calculation of poc sources based on δ13c isotope ratios were reported in parts per million based on the following equation 1 δ 13 c poc r sample r std 1 1000 where rsample is the isotopic ratio of the sample and rstd is the isotopic ratios of the standard torres et al 2014 the 13c 12cvpdb ratio of vienna peedee belemnite vpdb was used as the standard for δ13cpoc lee et al 2011 generally the δ13cpoc values were higher than those of terrestrial poc but lower than those of algal derived poc table 1 this may have resulted from a natural mixing of two endmembers zhou et al 2006 thus the proportion of endogenous and terrestrial poc could be estimated based on a mass balance calculation raymond et al 2001 yuan et al 2017 this approach was based on the mixing model of shultz and calder 1976 assuming that the endmembers of δ13c were terrestrial and endogenous hu et al 2006 zhou et al 2006 for this study area 28 1 was taken as the background value for the terrestrial endmember based on δ13cpoc values in the changdou river and chengdong river fig 1 this value is close to that of c3 plants which is consistent with the paucity of c4 plants within the drainage basin likewise the δ13cpoc of microcystis occurring in surface blooms 20 5 was taken as the endogenous endmember for these calculations kluijver et al 2012 adopting the above endmember values the relative percentage of terrestrial derived organic carbon f in the upper waters of lake taihu was estimated based on the following mixing model shultz and calder 1976 hu et al 2006 zhou et al 2006

3 f 1 f and the concentration of endogenous poc and terrestrial poc was calculated as follows 4 endogenous poc concentration mg l poc f 5 terrestrial poc concentration mg l poc f 2 3 pre processing of olci imagery with special spectral configurations in the red and near infrared bands and high signal to noise ratios olci sentinel 3a is a very effective ocean color sensor designed for monitoring the water quality of optically complex coastal and inland waters olci images of lake taihu at a resolution of 300 m were obtained from the copernicus website geometric correction and atmospheric correction were conducted using seadas 7 2 software and the management unit mathematical model mumm atmospheric correction algorithm contained in seadas which is applicable to inland waters ruddick et al 2000 bi et al 2018 miao et al 2019 2 4 poc source algorithm based on remote sensing fig 2 shows the concept of the formulation of the poc source color index s poc for the simulated olci r rs of high terrestrial poc ratio waters fig 2a and high endogenous poc ratio waters fig 2b respectively both types of waters had a reflection peak at band 6 560 nm which formed a reflection valley at band 9 673 75 nm it was clear that under the influence of the weak absorption of chl a and carotenes and the scattering of cells there were differences in the morphology of endogenous and exogenous reflection peaks similarly due to the difference in c sources terrestrial poc ratio dominated water bodies had a much smaller reflection valley at the red band fig 2a considering that satellite derived r rs at the blue band may have relatively high uncertainties as caused by the strong scattering of aerosols in the short wave band a new method was proposed for calculating the absorption valley for this the calculation of s used r rs at 560 674 and 709 nm as follows 6 s p o c r r s 674 r r s 560 674 560 709 560 r r s 709 r r s 560 2 5 algorithm evaluation data for all 73 samples were sorted in ascending order according to their endogenous or terrestrial poc ratios and then every third site was omitted to test the algorithm as a result all data were divided into two parts a a validation dataset containing one third of the data used to validate the algorithm and b a modelling dataset including approximately two thirds of the data to calibrate the relevant coefficients the root mean square error rmse eq 7 and the mean absolute percentage error mape eq 8 were employed to assess the performance of the poc estimating algorithm 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y j 2 8 mape 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 where y i and y i are the measured and estimated values respectively and n is the sample size 3 results 3 1 δ13cpoc and poc sources δ13cpoc values in may and august ranged from 28 1 to 20 5 and 27 9 to 20 6 respectively fig 3 the endogenous and exogenous reference values showed strong internal and external symbiosis emerson and hedges 1988 in terms of the mean values δ13cpoc in may 24 6 was slightly higher than in august 25 1 showing a higher endogenous trend consistent with the higher chl a for may table 1 a large amount of terrestrial organic matter is transported by rivers into west taihu and south taihu li et al 2017 which explains why the mean δ13cpoc values here were significantly lower than in central taihu fig 4 shows the performance of the isotope model with respect to distinguishing the sources of poc in lake taihu as the background value of the terrestrial endmembers the proportion of terrestrial poc in rivers was 0 97 0 1 fig 4b this indicated a very small error in the use of isotopes to calculate the poc source in addition chl a can be used to characterize the stock of phytoplankton which is an important component of endogenous poc the endogenous poc concentration showed a very significant positive correlation with the chl a concentration r2 0 76 p 0 01 n 73 fig 4a which also indicated that the results of sources identification were reliable in may and august the average poc concentrations in lake taihu were almost the same at 4 35 mg l and 4 39 mg l respectively however poc concentration showed strong spatial heterogeneity fig 3 in may the region with the highest average concentration was south taihu while in august the highest concentrations were measured in central taihu for the source endmembers calculated using the isotope analyses the endogenous proportion was 0 42 in may compared to 0 37 in august for the whole lake the average value of terrestrial poc in may and august both exceeded 0 5 3 2 evaluation of the algorithm performance according to the method described in section 2 5 the sample sizes of the model data set and the independent verification data set were 49 and 24 respectively analysis of the 49 samples from the modelling data set showed a significant correlation between olci derived s poc values and endogenous or terrestrial poc ratios fig 5 a and b from equation 3 the sum of the endogenous and exogenous ratios was 1 which resulted in s poc and the two ratios having the same coefficient of determination r2 0 80 a validation dataset with 24 samples was used to validate the algorithm fig 5c the results of this validation showed that the rmse of the estimated terrestrial poc proportion and the measured values was 13 02 while the mape was only 20 82 fig 5c which indicated that s poc was effective at estimating the terrestrial source proportion similarly the endogenous ratio verification showed that the rmse of the estimated and measured values obtained using the s poc algorithm was 13 02 and the mape was 35 37 the s poc algorithm also had a high value in the estimation of the endogenous source proportion being affected by the inputs from a large number of exogenous rivers the concentration of terrestrial organic matter in lake taihu was generally high which gave the s poc algorithm greater robustness in estimating terrestrial sources overall s poc was effective at estimating the proportion of different poc endmembers 4 discussion 4 1 matching analysis of the s poc algorithm the s poc algorithm based on remote sensing reflected the proportion of endogenous and terrestrial poc in studied eutrophic waters well due to the cloud cover on may 9 2018 synchronous verification was performed using the august 5 2018 olci inversion values time window 4 h and the lake taihu measurements compared with the measured values both the terrestrial and endogenous rmse of the olci inversion was 14 07 fig 5d there was some limited overestimation of terrestrial poc ratios and an underestimation of endogenous poc ratios which might have been caused by common errors in satellite derived products e g imperfect atmospheric correction and temporal difference as far as atmospheric correction is concerned the s poc values were computed as the difference between r rs 674 and r rs 709 eq 6 miao et al 2019 showed that although the mumm atmospheric correction model is more suitable for lake taihu than the flaash the 6s and the bpac models there is still an overcorrection in the near infrared band in addition due to the influence of temporal difference the hydrodynamic changes induced by inflow and outflow rivers yacobi et al 2011 lake currents and wind waves exert a significant effect on poc behaviours in shallow lake ecosystems piirsoo et al 2018 4 2 spatio temporal dynamics of poc sources exploring different carbon sources in eutrophic lakes can help to enhance understanding of lake ecology and carbon cycling here the proportions of different sources in lake taihu from 2018 to 2019 excluding february 2019 due to a lack of suitable imagery were estimated using the s poc algorithm and monthly olci data fig 6 selected monthly olci images where the time interval was closest to 30 days were used to invert the spatiotemporal information of the poc source from april to september there were algal blooms in west taihu south taihu and central taihu the pixels containing algal blooms were removed where r rs 745 r rs 665 3 0 to avoid interference with source estimates simis et al 2005 the spatiotemporal dynamics of the poc sources showed that lake taihu was dominated by terrestrial sources from march 2018 to february 2019 fig 6 which is attributed to a short water exchange period of 300 days in the lake xu et al 2019 excluding the algal bloom areas the proportion of terrestrial poc in lake taihu was 69 1 which is close to the 66 surveyed in the sediment xu et al 2015 the area with the highest annual average terrestrial proportion was central taihu 0 74 and the area with the lowest proportion was meiliang bay 0 64 in the case of lake taihu the input of exogenous organic matter is mainly via river input caused by rainfall in the basin however there was large spatial and temporal heterogeneity between the amount of water entering the lake and the ratios of terrestrial poc according to the data from the lake taihu health bulletin http www tba gov cn the land areas corresponding to west taihu and south taihu are huxi and zhexi respectively and these two districts are where the largest amounts of water enter the lake fig 7 b however tthis was inconsistent with the situation in central taihu which had the highest ratio of terrestrial poc this may indicate that the external input of carbon was not the most important factor affecting the proportion of terrestrial poc endmembers conversely the terrestrial poc in central taihu may derive from sediments and wind speed was an important driver here similarly the monthly mean of the terrestrial ratios of west taihu and south taihu and rainfall in the corresponding areas suggest a similar problem fig 7a in summer and autumn the terrestrial ratio showed a weak negative correlation with rainfall p 0 05 n 12 while in spring and winter there was no significant correlation p 0 05 n 10 in fact poc produced by land leaching and human emissions passes through the entire lake bio pump process the organic carbon inputs from the river are converted into dissolved organic carbon doc co2 ch4 and other non living c by microbial decomposition some of which is permanently buried as c in the sediment phytoplankton and aquatic vegetation absorb co2 from water bodies through photosynthesis and bring land based poc into the new carbon cycle that is the end elements of the distribution of dominant poc source may have seasonal turnover the proportion of poc in different endmembers is physiologically related to phytoplankton and aquatic vegetation huang et al 2019 from a seasonal point of view higher endogenous proportions coincide with the timing of algal blooms and the decomposition of aquatic plants in this study due to the impact of algal blooms the dominant role of exogenous sources was weakened in summer and autumn similarly chl a concentration was highly significantly correlated with the endogenous ratio fig 8 on the one hand endogenous poc is mainly derived from the secretions of phytoplankton during metabolism jones et al 2012 and algae are mainly concentrated in the western part of lake taihu from april to november under the influence of the southeast monsoon lürling et al 2016 this makes it easier for algae driven endogenous poc to become concentrated around algal blooms from april to september fig 6 on the other hand east taihu contains 95 of the lake s aquatic vegetation biomass qin et al 2007 and given that poc and doc produced by the decomposition of vegetation during winter re enter the carbon cycle krembs et al 2002 the endogenous ratio in this part of the lake is increased 4 3 optical mechanism of the s poc algorithm although s poc is an empirical algorithm it can be applied to different sensors based on the conceptual model proposed in section 2 4 the simulated r rs data for the meris modis aqua and goci sensors were tested using an independent verification dataset there was good overall performance using the proposed algorithm for both the simulated meris and olci spectra table 2 which is to be expected given their similarity in band configuration liu et al 2018 the verification results based on modis and goci were comparatively poorer however because the longer nir band is used instead of the 708 nm band the r rs based s poc algorithm showed good performance when using different sensors which may be related to the relationship between s poc and multiple iops because changes in the absorption and scattering properties of waterbodies are ultimately reflected in the difference in the reflection spectrum ma et al 2006 some earlier studies have shown that organic particles may make a strong contribution to absorption but less of a contribution to the backscattering coefficient balch et al 1999 hunter et al 2008 fig 9 shows that three absorption coefficients for the internal and terrestrial source ratios were greater than 0 9 the a ph in the lake water that was dominated by endogenous poc was higher than that of terrestrial poc fig 9a and this difference was evident at 560 nm and 640 nm in general endogenous poc is mainly derived from phytoplanktonic metabolic secretions morán et al 1999 in comparison terrestrial poc is mainly derived from soil organic matter and its degradation products as well as from anthropogenic sources wei et al 2015 in eutrophic waters the primary productivity by phytoplankton contributes more than 80 to endogenous poc jones et al 2012 similarly the a nap in the waters dominated by the terrestrial poc was lower than for endogenous poc fig 9b since the s poc algorithm based on three bands contains optical information of various sources the algorithm showed good applicability the correlation between s poc and the absorption coefficient also illustrates this point fig 10 in the visible region a ph showed a good correlation with s poc which suggests that a ph is an effective indicator of poc sources the indication of a nap sources increased with wavelength and a cdom did not reflect the difference between internal and external sources fig 9c thus a cdom may not be a qualified indicator of the source fig 10 4 4 advantages and limitations of remote sensing for tracing poc sources compared to biochemistry based approaches the use of remote sensing to identify the proportion of poc endmembers is more convenient and efficient than using isotopes machiwa 2010 carbon nitrogen ratios thornton and mcmanus 1994 fatty acids xu et al 2015 and other molecular markers li et al 2018 it does however sacrifice a small amount of precision in this study the δ13c endmember mixing model was used to calculate the poc ratio of different sources phytoplankton based endogenous algae can use hco3 in water and co2 from the atmosphere as carbon sources during photosynthesis the δ13cpoc value of algae is therefore usually higher than that of the land emerson and hedges 1988 in addition aquatic plants also form part of the endogenous source because of their similar isotope fractionation mechanisms and isotope values to algae xu et al 2019 in lake taihu the δ13cpoc values for rivers and algal blooms showed the greatest level of consistency with the observations of mao et al 2012 and kluijver et al 2012 in situ measurements of δ13cpoc in may and august were higher than for terrestrial particulate matter but lower than algae particles which indicates that there was a terrestrial and endogenous mixture of poc in the surface waters during this period that is to say using remote sensing to trace poc sources can obtain a relatively accurate long term sequence more easily to inform understanding of large scale poc source dynamics it should be noted that the present approach was focused on optically complex case 2 waters thus further research is needed to validate and refine the approach for other water types indeed the remote sensing based method was affected by many factors such as satellite image quality and atmospheric correction consequently it cannot obtain more accurate source information than chemical analysis in theory it should be possible to combine the s poc algorithms with existing poc optical algorithm in other studies e g jiang et al 2015 jie et al 2018 to obtain concentration information for different endmembers however due to the optical complexity of inland waters there is some degree of error in optical poc concentration algorithms which makes it difficult to obtain information about different source concentrations 5 conclusions 1 the combination of δ13cpoc and remote sensing was shown to be effective for tracking the sources of poc in a eutrophic lake a s poc could be calculated as s p o c r r s 674 r r s 560 674 560 709 560 r r s 709 r r s 560 2 there was good overall performance using the s poc algorithm for both the simulated meris and olci spectra in the visible range both a ph and a nap provide some indication of the poc sources 3 between march 2018 and january 2019 lake taihu in southern china was dominated by terrestrial poc fluvial carbon inputs may not the most important factor affecting the proportions of terrestrial poc endmembers in this lake as a result of the monsoon exogenous poc in central taihu may mainly derive from sediments 4 there is potential to combine the developed s poc algorithm with existing poc

introduction aerobic granular sludge ags technology has proven as an appealing alternative for the conventional activated sludge cas owing to robust biological nutrient removal bnr and outstanding solid liquid separation in a compact reactor as such this technology has been anticipated as a game changer in the future of wastewater treatment van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 however its application in real life practices is still sparse due to limited know how of process scale up serving as testing optimization step pilot scale studies are integral part of upgrading the current knowledge acquired from lab scale investigations to be used in larger scale reactors de kreuk 2006 nevertheless only a handful of pilot scale studies have been carried out so far which mainly focused

chen et al 2009 most studies with respect to ca accumulation in aerobic granules have focused on characterization of the formed ca compounds such as spatial distribution chemical composition and the relation between ca accumulation and granule physiochemical properties mañas et al 2012 2011 ren et al 2008 to the best of our knowledge bnr capacity of mineral rich granules has not been thoroughly studied so far aerobic granules are recognized as self immobilized bio aggregates carrying diverse communities of aerobic facultative and anaerobic bacteria so far many theories have been proposed to explain aerobic granulation such as hydrophobic cell surface di iaconi et al 2006 extracellular polymeric substances eps wilén et al 2008 and divalent cations bridging theories sobeck and higgins 2005 these theories mostly explain the microbial agglomeration phenomenon overlooking the effect of ca precipitation wan et al 2015 proposed a universal mineral core theory encompassing all the aforementioned ones the researchers suggested that aerobic granulation was the consequence of two consecutive steps mineral core formation and microbial agglomeration around it however this theory requires further reconsideration and proper refinement to define the actual order of granulation steps with the consideration of underlying microbiology underlying microbiology of bnr in ags reactors includes simultaneous autotrophic nitrification anoxic denitrification and phosphate removal sndpr beyond the growth requirement of a guild of bacteria known as polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos the sndpr is facilitated with proper localization of the associated microorganisms along substrate oxygen gradients regulated by diffusion conversion rates within the granule structure bassin et al 2012 de kreuk et al 2005 lemaire et al 2008 however the conventional nutrient removing organisms do not inherently dominate in response to granulation but under certain operational and environmental strategies guimarães et al 2018 weissbrodt et al 2013 instead other species potentially with dual functions i e floc formation primary function and substrate conversion secondary

thus rarely accounted for guimarães et al 2017 wei et al 2012 for example there is a consensus upon the significant contribution of bipp to overall phosphate removal in ags bioreactors de kreuk et al 2005 mañas et al 2012 2011 nonetheless its numerical share has remained either unidentified de kreuk et al 2005 or not agreed upon mañas et al 2011 yilmaz et al 2008 profound understanding and proper quantification of uncommon nutrient removal pathways in the ags systems especially at large scale can open new horizons in the advanced bnr realm therefore this study aimed to identify and evaluate

wastewater pishgar et al 2019a according to the study of ren et al 2008 supplementing 40 mg ca l 1 to wastewater would result in formation of ca rich granules with more rigid structure and higher strength using wastewater with two different strength medium vs high strength two primary objectives were to fulfil which included determination of the effect of wastewater strength on 1 startup time aerobic granular sludge characteristics and effluent quality and 2 nutrient removal characteristics of aerobic granulation at pilot scale while the first objective was addressed in another study pishgar et al 2019a this study focused on the second one the cod and toc were supplemented using sodium acetate naac 25 and sodium propionate napr 75 as dual carbon sources the nh4 n concentration was adjusted using nh4cl the po4 p was supplied in the form of phosphate buffer ph 6 4 6 8 at 25 c using kh2po4 and k2hpo4 essential macro and microelements were added as detailed elsewhere pishgar et al 2019a the ph of the feed was maintained around neutral 2 2 aerobic granulation experimental setup and operating conditions aerobic granules were cultivated in three geometrically identical bubble

the gsbrs were operated at the room temperature 19 5 3 5 c granulation happened within similar periods in an o ax o sbr and o sbr where identical organic loading rates olr were applied 7 1 0 3 and 6 9 0 3 kg cod m 3 d 1 respectively slight differences in granulation time and granule size and morphology fig s1 were attributed to system perturbations which happened more frequently in an o ax o sbr due to more complicated and thus less stable operation compared to o sbr pishgar et al 2019a granulation was prolonged and 7 to 10 time smaller granules were formed in an o sbr due to significantly lower operational olr of 1 8 0 13 kg cod m 3 d 1 pishgar et al 2019a the details of granulation process and the ags characteristics are summarized in table s1 2 3 analytical procedures 2 3 1 influent

souraobs and sournobs respectively represent specific autotrophic nitritation and nitratation oxygen utilization rates the sum of souraobs and sournobs determines the overall activity of autotrophic

dispersive x ray sem edx this technique was performed on ags ashes as well as the core of dried granules to determine the elemental composition of mineral deposits in aerobic granules sem fei philips xl 30 edx bruker the sem edx analysis was performed when mature granules dominated the ags of the gsbrs and the systems reached steady state in terms of treatment performance long term performance data related to this study can be found in pishgar et al 2019a determination of elemental composition of mineral deposits in the mature aerobic granules when the process was running under steady state would ensure that thermodynamically stable end products were formed and dominated the mineral deposits based on the experimental results and equilibrium study barat et al 2008 elucidated that ca p precipitation would occurr through two successive steps precipitation of amorphous calcium phosphate acp and the subsequent crystallization of hydroxyapatite hap the researchers explained that formation of thermodynamically stable hap was not a straightforward process and complete conversion of acp to hap could happen within a certain period 1 11 h depending on the ph barat et al 2008 first homogenous mixed liquor samples were taken during aeration at days 57 107 and 53 maturation phases pishgar et al 2019a from an o ax o sbr the second aeration phase an o sbr and o sbr respectively the retentate of mixed liquor samples i e aerobic granules filtered using whatman 934 ah glass microfiber filters 1 5 μm for mlss mlvss analysis were converted to ashes via calcination 500 c for 2 h mañas

perchloric acid extraction to differentiate chemically precipitated from biologically accumulated phosphorus in the biomass cold perchloric acid pca extraction method was selected de haas et al 2000 in brief total phosphorus tp concentration of mixed liquor samples was determined using ascorbic acid method after sludge digestion with potassium persulfate apha 2012 the mixed liquor was thereafter centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min the corresponding supernatant was hereinafter known as sup1 centrifugation step was repeated after adding 0 9 m v nacl 10 ml to the pellets the corresponding supernatant was hereinafter known as sup2 the pool of the collected supernatants sup sup1 sup2 was immediately analyzed for phosphorus concentration which would represent the bulk liquid phosphorus concentration it constituted all the soluble phosphate species po4 3 hpo4 2 h2po4 and h3po4 plus the interstitial loosely bound phosphate in the mixed liquor samples cold pca extraction was performed on the pellets thrice using ice cold 0 5 m pca 20 ml in a refrigerated water bath 0 3 c for 5 min refrigerated centrifugation 5 c was carried out between extraction steps 3000 rpm at 5 min the pool of pca extracts was immediately analyzed for orthophosphate ortho p and tp due to slow hydrolysis of biologically stored phosphorus i e polyphosphate poly p nucleic acids phospholipids minor organics phosphorus collectively referred to as complex p only phosphorus of chemical origin mineral complexes can be determined by ortho p measurement the non ortho p i e tp ortho p is presumed to be the complex p for this analysis homogenous samples were withdrawn from the gsbrs in the same operational days as stated in section 2 3 4 2 3 6 microbial community analysis 16s rrna phylogenetic gene sequencing and constructing clone library homogenous biomass samples were taken from the gsbrs when the systems were being aerated and in the same operational days as stated in section 2 3 4 subsequently 2 ml aliquots were taken from the homogenized ags samples for the subsequent 16s rrna phylogenetic gene sequencing analysis the 2 ml sample was centrifuged 6000 rpm for 3 min to separate the solids from the liquid solution and the collected solids were preserved in 80 c prior to dna extraction genomic dna extraction 16s rrna phylogenetic gene sequencing and constructing clone library was performed using the protocols provided by pishgar et al 2019a 2 3 7 calculations 2 3 7 1 biomass yield microorganisms oxidize organic matter to produce carbon and energy for cell reproduction and

δ x r x e f f δ c o d o v e r a l l in this study due to lack of deliberate sludge withdrawal δxr was equal to changes in mlvss concentration in the reactor over time and δcodoverall was determined from the difference between influent and effluent cod concentrations codinf and codeff respectively under steady state condition biomass concentration in the reactor remains almost constant in this study in the last stage of granulation i e maturation phase mlss concentrations in the gsbrs showed variations of 10 from the average values pishgar et al 2019a the calculations were based on the average mlvss concentrations over this period of time thus eq 1 can be simplified as follows chen et al 2008 2 y o b s c o d x e f f δ c o d o v e r a l l in addition the observed yield can also be

results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mineral rich aerobic granules 3 1 1 microstructure of granules identification of crystalline mineral cores microstructure of aerobic granules was evaluated by visual observations via digital and sem imagings and optical microscopy fig 1 concentric structure was seen inside the granules developed in the three gsbrs fig 1a c the core of granules was featured with a distinct white color a magnified look using sem imaging identified them as crystalline clusters of mineral deposits fig 1f optical microscopy detected inert materials in the crushed granules fig 1g which were seen as tiny pieces of crystals at higher magnifications fig 1h 1k the mineral core was encapsulated by a rim layer of biomass distinguished by a darker color fig 1a c it agreed with ren et al 2008 who ascertained that ca free shells covered the white precipitates at the center of granules with minimum 200 μm from the granule surfaces 3 1 2 chemical composition of mineral deposits the edx microanalysis revealed that the ags ashes were mainly composed of high ca and phosphorus p contents fig 2 typical bacterial cell is composed of 50 wt carbon c and 2 3 wt p metcalf eddy 2014 applying this mass ratio to the normalized c contents reported in fig 2c f and 2i the amount of intracellular p taken up for cell synthesis passimilated was estimated the p contents of 0 58 1 02 and 1 05 found in the ags ashes of an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively could be attributed to passimilated the pprecipitated was determined from the difference between the normalized p content fig 2c f 2i and the estimated passimilated consequently ca and pprecipitated constituted 21 45 0 50 and 10 53 1 17 of the normalized mass of the ashes resulting in caash pprecipitated mass ratio of 2 06 0 26 in the three gsbrs high ca and p contents were also detected in the central part of dried granules fig 3 given the passimilated content estimated above cacore pprecipitated mass ratio of the core of dried granules varied in a similar range 2 18 0 14 to that of the ags ashes these ca p mass ratios were identical to that of hap ca10 po4 6 oh 2 mass based ca p 2 15 hap is the major mineral compound found in the core of aerobic granules with acp being its precursor barat et al 2008 mañas et al 2012 2011 3 1 3 microbial composition 3 1 3 1 heterotrophic nitrifying denitrifying genera microbial analysis at genus level fig 4 confirmed that the conventional nitrogen transforming organisms i e autotrophic aobs nitrosomonas and autotrophic nobs nitrospira completely disappeared from all the three gsbrs 1 7 and 1 2 in the seed respectively the washout of aobs and nobs could be attributed to unfavorable do concentration and aeration duration undesirable temperature and ph and detrimentally high substrate load pishgar et al 2019a instead heterotrophic organisms with unorthodox nutrient removal capabilities plenteously existed in the gsbrs many detected families carried members capable of simultaneous heterotrophic nitrification and anoxic aerobic denitrification in a single cell sndc the reported functions for the isolated phylogenetic groups are tabulated in table s2 given their dominance throughout the entire operation thauera 25 9 21 5 28 9 and flavobacterium 15 4 10 4 23 4 were identified as the core sndc species in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively the rest of sndc selection showed noticeable distinctions in the gsbrs in an o ax o sbr sndc species included acinetobacter 2 6 15 entirely chryseobacterium 1 5 4 6 between days 50 61 comamonas 1 0 6 8 between days 14 50 pseudomonas 2 3 2 0 and 1 7 at days 14 50 54 and zoogloea 1 34 20 10 entirely in an o sbr these species were comamonas 26 at day 25 and 1 9 at day 53 paracoccus 2 1 17 between days 25 and 109 and pseudomonas 2 0 and 1 2 at days 53 and 67 respectively in o sbr the following sndc were isolated acinetobacter 0 54 12 90 entirely comamonas 6 7 at day 14 and 2 3 at day 22 and paracoccus 2 7 3 3 between days 14 and 50 and 1 5 at day 54 the rapid shift in sndc population seemed to be related to wastewater composition it seemed that all types of wastewater used in this study medium to high strength provided the favorable condition for the growth of sndc species regardless of the operation mode and thus led to their proliferation in all the gsbrs it agreed with pishgar et al 2019b where using different selection pressure strategies the researchers concluded that the selective pressure imposed by nourishment condition was in fact the decisive factor in microbial selection and the resulting nutrient removal mechanisms in the previous study which complements the current work pishgar et al 2019a biodiversity analysis using different diversity indices confirmed the same implication elucidating that the microbial selection strategies in these gsbrs could be imposed by wastewater strength rather than the sbr operation mode regarding the lower population of sndc species in o sbr it could highlight the effect of sbr operation mode on microbial structure of gsbrs it could be argued that the operation mode of o sbr was not as desirable for the enrichment of sndc species as were the operation modes of an o ax o sbr and an o sbr it could imply that either sndc species required an anaerobic or anoxic phase prior to aerobic phase for their growth or the presence of a low shear phase like anaerobic or anoxic phase with oxygen deficiency restricted the growth of competing organisms and provided competitive advantage for the enrichment of sndc species understanding the effect of operation mode and wastewater strength on the growth and activity of sndc species warrant further investigation using a more systematic experimentation number of the detected sndc species including thauera flavobacterium paracoccus and acinetobacter have been characterized as polysaccharide producing bacteria see table s2 it indicated that overabundance of these species was potentially primarily due to the strong hydraulic selection pressures applied in the gsbrs for aerobic granulation multiple denitrifying species were isolated the most important one was azoarcus which is one of the most abundant anoxic denitrifiers in lab osaka et al 2006 and full scale systems thomsen et al 2007 azoarcus sp considerably proliferated in the gsbrs 0 2 7 1 0 10 and 0 5 23 in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively with the largest populations observed at the beginning of maturation other putative denitrifying organisms included hydrogenophaga an o ax o sbr 0 4 2 2 o sbr 0 6 6 erysipelothrix an o sbr 0 02 4 8 o sbr 0 2 1 8 fusibacter o sbr 0 6 3 8 see table s2 for the reported functions isolation of these species supported the formation of anoxic zone inside aerobic granules in this study 3 1 3 2 putative phosphate accumulators the conventional polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos i e ca accumulibacter emerged in neither of the gsbrs although it was seen in the seed 3 5 fig 4 instead other putative paos showed significant relative abundances in at least two out of the three reactors such as acinetobacter 2 6 15 0 09 2 2 0 5 13 pseudomonas 0 08 2 3 0 04 2 0 0 06 0 6 and corynebacterium 0 4 3 2 0 01 9 5 0 1 0 6 in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively see table s2 for the anticipated functions the absence of p release uptake in the alternating anaerobic aerobic gsbrs an o ax o sbr and an o sbr and the purely aerobic one o sbr see section 3 3 2 suggested that either these species were not contributing to biological phosphate removal in this study or their phosphate accumulation metabolism was distinct from that of ca accumulibacter this ambiguity necessitates further investigation on phosphate removal capacity and mechanism of these bacteria to develop the know how about their contribution to phosphate depletion in bnr processes 3 1 3 3 bio calcifying organisms several isolated species could contribute to bio calcification inside the granules in the form of calcite aragonite and or vaterite those species included flavobacterium 7 0 21 4 0 13 19 30 acinetobacter 3 0 15 0 08 2 2 0 6 13 pseudomonas 0 08 2 3 0 04 2 0 0 04 0 6 and corynebacterium 0 4 3 2 0 01 10 0 1 0 6 in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively see table s2 for the anticipated functions 3 1 4 granulation mechanism aerobic granulation started with microbial colonization of floc forming sndc species see section 3 1 3 1 a process which was enabled by the consecutive steps of cell to cell contact bio aggregation and eps embedment liu and tay 2002 thereafter carbonate crystals formed around the polysaccharide network in which the bacterial species were encased zamarreňo et al 2009 ascertained that the carbonate crystals precipitated by freshwater bacteria composed of bacterial cells embedded in a matrix of neutral and acid polysaccharides it is known that eps has high affinity for ca ions being a fundamental constituent of polysaccharide ps and protein pn components of eps free ca facilitates interaction between adjacent sugars and maintains the tertiary structure of eps molecules in addition it forms a gel like but rigid eps matrix by interacting with secondary function groups in ps molecules e g oh yu et al 2001 afterwards small crystal pieces were bound together by eps to form sheet like structures as demonstrated by zamarreňo et al 2009 eps facilitates crystal to crystal bonding either via entrapping and concentrating calcium in its structure or due to having specific protein which promotes calcium carbonate precipitation in the form of diverse polymorphs kawaguchi and decho 2002 later the bacteria entrapped within the crystal shell died leaving the internal part of granules lifeless histological and fluorescence staining in the study of zamarreňo et al 2009 demonstrated that the bacterial community inside carbonate crystals could only maintain their viability over a short period of time about 2 weeks thus carbon nitrogen and oxygen found in the granule cores in this study see fig 3 could be explained by the remnants of dead bacterial cells neutral ps associated with young microbial colonies and negligible number of microorganisms which could survive in the core the results of the study of zamarreňo et al 2009 demonstrated that the number of surviving cells inside carbonate crystals was 9 cells mg 1 subsequently bacterial cell nucleation and multiplication around the inert core continued and mineral rich aerobic granules with inert cores formed this process has been schematized in fig 5 3 2 treatment performance 3 2 1 long term removal efficiencies table 1 presents long term performance parameters organic matter i e cod and toc removal efficiencies were consistently high 90 in all the three gsbrs although different influent cod and toc concentrations and divergent olrs were applied the highest nitrogen removal efficiency 75 was mutually achieved in an o ax o sbr and o sbr where the highest olr was maintained in contrast about one third nh4 n removal efficiency 22 was obtained in an o sbr where the olr was four times less compared to the two other reactors similar phosphorus removal efficiencies were achieved in the gsbrs despite different influent po4 p concentrations 3 2 2 short term performance batch cycle kinetics and inhibition of the conventional sndpr to further investigate nutrient removal mechanisms dynamics of soluble components and environmental factors were analyzed in typical batch cycles of the gsbrs fig 6 in all cases negligible cod concentration 30 mg l 1 and substantial tn nh4 n and po4 p concentrations were detected in the effluents while no x accumulation did not happen entirely residual cod concentration could be attributed to the release of non biodegradable organic matter due to endogenous respiration during famine phases of the sbr cycles having had no no x residues nh4 n and tn concentration profiles intertwined resulting in similar residual concentrations of these components in the effluents no no x production could suggest that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd did not occur and that ammonium removal was only associated with the metabolism of ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos in all the three gsbrs accumulation of free ammonia fa the protonated form of ammonium was observed in all the three gsbrs fa formation depends on nh4 concentration ph and temperature anthonisen et al 1976 the fa concentration ranged between 3 and 9 12 and 16 and 6 and 21 mg l 1 as nh3 in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively during the first 60 70 min fa increased significantly to the highest values in all the three gsbrs 8 5 15 5 and 20 5 mg nh3 l 1 respectively accumulation of fa within the first 45 60 min of an o ax o sbr and an o sbr was not as distinguishable as it was in o sbr moderate mixing strategies during the initial anaerobic phases in these systems could mask the fa production patterns hence fa concentration exponentially increased from 3 to 3 8 mg nh3 l 1 at 7 45 min in an o ax o sbr and 12 14 mg nh3 l 1 at 0 60 min in an o sbr to the highest values stated above within the first 10 15 min of the subsequent aeration phases in addition increase in do during this time interval from 0 02 0 09 to 5 16 6 21 mg o2 l 1 elevated the ph from 8 8 27 to 8 57 8 66 respectively the concentration of fa increased with the increase of ph due to volatilization of co2 which was formed as a result of organic matter oxidation with aeration it gave rise to fa production even if the ammonium concentration was experiencing a declining trend at the same time at the end of batch cycles while fa concentrations subsequently declined to 5 and 8 mg nh3 l 1 in an o ax o sbr and o sbr respectively it maintained high concentrations in an o sbr 14 16 mg l 1 as nh3 it could be attributed to higher residual nh4 concentration in an o sbr 72 mg nh4 n l 1 compared to the other gsbrs 24 37 mg nh4 n l 1 autotrophic nitrification did not happen in either of the gsbrs due to intensive fa accumulation the fa ranges in this study stated above mutually suppressed aobs and nobs proliferation in all the three gsbrs according to anthonisen et al 1976 fa impedes both aobs and nobs activities at completely distinct concentration ranges 10 150 and 0 1 1 0 mg nh3 l 1 respectively indicating the higher nobs sensitivity to this inhibitory factor concentration range of 1 5 mg nh3 l 1 hinders nitratation n o 2 n o b s n o 3 but not nitritation n h 4 a o b s n o 2 abeling and seyfried 1992 the inhibition of nitritation commences at fa concentrations about 7 mg nh3 l 1 while this reaction is almost completely impeded at around 20 mg nh3 l 1 anthonisen et al 1976 regarding nobs more inhibitory factors were in effect repression of aobs limited the nobs substrate i e no2 and the temperature variations did not favor the growth of this guild of bacteria as well nobs are active over a temperature range of 10 20 c increase in temperature to 20 25 c favors nitritation while it declines the nitratation rate balmelle et al 1992 nitritation reaches a maximum rate at 25 c balmelle et al 1992 with fa inhibition becoming preponderant at higher temperatures abeling and seyfried 1992 thus while the temperature ranges in the gsbrs 20 24 c could potentially promote aobs growth if such strong fa inhibition did not prevail it contributed to nobs repression alongside other inhibitory factors inconsiderable cod degradation efficiencies 20 and 56 respectively were estimated for anaerobic phases of an o ax o sbr and an o sbr which potentially hindered enhanced biological phosphate removal ebpr pathway in these reactors the absence of poly p cleavage formation in the ags which if present would lead to ortho p release uptake in the bulk liquid was supported by the dynamics of cation concentrations fig s2 mg2 and k profiles did not show any release and uptake patterns which would be expected if ebpr activity was occurring filali et al 2012 these cations contribute to charge balance during ortho p traverse through cell membrane metcalf eddy 2014 the limited anaerobic cod consumption could not provide sufficient intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoate pha pool to induce pao proliferation the channelling phenomenon encountered in slow feeding upflow sludge bed usb reactors jin et al 2012 could had caused unpromising biomass wastewater contact during anaerobic phases in this study implementing an anaerobic mixed batch phase concomitant with slow up flow feeding or separately could overcome this problem guimarães et al 2018 this strategy is especially helpful in pilot reactors where an undesirable feed distribution design can exacerbate the channelling issue due to proportionate increase in design error with increment in reactor scale pishgar et al 2018 drastic fa production could also contribute to ebpr inhibition in the study of cao et al 2017 the fa concentration over 10 mg nh3 l 1 decreased the diversity and abundance of paos with phosphate removal efficiency severely deteriorated at 16 18 mg nh3 l 1 yang et al 2018 zheng et al 2013 zheng et al 2013 ascertained that disturbance of pao community due to fa exposure was irreversible 3 3 nutrient removal mechanisms 3 3 1 microbial assimilation ammary s equation was adopted to estimate the nutrient concentration removed via assimilation ammary 2004 10 cod n p 0 41 100 e y o b s c o d 5 1 where e was cod removal efficiency and yobs cod represented the observed yield the conversion factor 0 41 is the observed yield commonly considered for aerobic biological reactions ammary 2004 since the observed yield can be different from case to case this change should be accounted for in nutrient requirement calculations as it was done here accordingly nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations utilized for microbial growth were determined in terms of δcod δn δp growth table 1 these ratios were identical in an o ax o sbr and o sbr where wastewater of the same relative carbon and nutrient strength i e cod n p inf and matching substrate loading conditions were used on the contrary significantly lower nutrient concentrations about half were used for bacterial growth in an o sbr the cod n p inf established inverse relation with cod n p growth figs s3a and b in other words ammonium nitrogen and phosphorus incorporated into cellular tissues considerably increased in the nutrient limited environments of an o ax o sbr and o sbr compared to those in the nutrient rich medium of an o sbr mass balances based on eq 10 demonstrated that biomass assimilation was responsible for the removal of 33 39 of the depleted nitrogen concentration in an o ax o sbr and o sbr and 16 of that in an o sbr contribution of this pathway to overall phosphorus removal was moderate in an o ax o sbr 48 and o sbr 61 and insignificant in an o sbr 4 the results of this study demonstrated that the actual nutrient requirement for growth could largely deviate from the conventional ratios cod n p of 100 5 1 and the amplitude of variation depended on nutrient availability the conventional nutrient requirement ratio is approximated based on cell dry weight composition of typical bacterial species formulated as c60h87o23n12p2 3 and should be used for estimations in practical applications only metcalf eddy 2014 during in depth investigations extrapolation of the generalized conversion factors i e carbon to cell carbon to volume and elemental ratios should be accomplished with caution vrede et al 2002 3 3 2 nitrogen removal heterotrophic nitrification was the dominant ammonia transformation pathway quasilinear relation between olr and nh4 n removal efficiency as discussed in section 3 2 1 implied co metabolism of organic matter and ammonium despite variant ammonium removal efficiencies the ratios between removed cod and ammonium nitrogen concentrations δcod δn overall were identical 100 4 in all the three gsbrs see table 1 similarity between this ratio and the optimal ratio reported for aerobic growth i e cod n of 100 5 ammary 2004 first prompted the idea that ammonium removal was only via biomass assimilation as it was also speculated by cetin et al 2018 under similar circumstances nevertheless the significant gaps between the observed yields based on cod consumption and nitrogen assimilation yobs n yobs cod table 1 demonstrated that a major fraction of the removed ammonium was not due to biomass assimilation depleted nh4 n concentration beyond microbial assimilation i e 61 84 in all the three gsbrs was attributed to nitrification activity table 1 existing a relation between nitrification and cod degradation disagreed with independency of autotrophic nitrification from organic matter consumption refuting the occurrence of this ammonium oxidation pathway respirometric activity of the ags supported this hypothesis the results of sour analysis showed that the activity of autotrophic nitrifying community was suppressed in all the three reactors fig s4a although the seed sludge showed considerably high nitrifying activity souraobs and sournobs of 24 2 5 and 33 4 mg o2 mg 1 vss h 1 respectively souraobs and sournobs reduced in half in all the three gsbrs during acclimatization upon granule formation and maturation further reductions were observed such that these parameters attained values in the range of sourendo this observation suggested that any activity in souraobs and sournobs vessels was in fact due to biomass autolysis as also discussed earlier see section 3 2 2 it could be said that aobs and nobs were inhibited and then washed out of all the gsbrs therefore low sours in batch tests were measured for both aobs and nobs instead heterotrophic nitrification could be in effect no no x accumulation during biochemical reactions in the typical batch cycles of the gsbrs supported this hypothesis fig 6a c and 6e trace or no no x concentrations has been reported for heterotrophic nitrification zhao et al 2012 2013 and in case of no x accumulation its removal rate would be significantly fast joo et al 2005 it is known that some heterotrophic nitrifiers e g alcaligenes sp direct nitrification via hydroxylamine nh2oh instead of no x due to lack of nitrate nar and nitrite reductase nir enzymes joo et al 2005 zhao et al 2012 a trait which might be shared by a wider range of heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria verifying this hypothesis requires further research about heterotrophic nitrification pathway of a diverse group of bacterial species a recent study demonstrated that heterotrophic nitrifiers paracoccus sp dominated the reactor treating incineration leachate at high fa concentrations and were actively transcribing nitrification amoa and denitrification genes narg norb nirs and nosz even when fa was as high as 184 mg l 1 liu et al 2018 it suggested that heterotrophic nitrification could contribute to ammonium removal in this study although fa toxicity existed in all the three gsbrs fig 6a c and 6e this implication was further supported by the results of microbial community analysis section 3 1 3 where 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed the abundance of numerous sndc species in all the gsbrs however further investigations are recommended to verify the insensitivity of heterotrophic nitrification to fa heterotrophic nitrification occurred alongside nh4 n assimilation co occurrence of these two nitrogen transformation pathways has been widely reported in pure culture studies with 27 52 of nh4 n concentration 100 1000 mg n l 1 being incorporated into cellular tissues joo et al 2006 sun et al 2017 in fact in a heterotrophic nitrifying community ammonium assimilation is the preferred nitrogen removal pathway rather than heterotrophic nitrification and serves as a crucial accessory for the successive aerobic denitrification improving denitrification efficiency by further propagating sndc community sun et al 2017 moderate to low nitrification efficiencies η nitrification resulted in residual nitrogen concentration in the effluents of the gsbrs table 1 indicating limited capacity of heterotrophic nitrification unlike cod n growth see section 3 3 1 heterotrophic nitrification efficiency η heterotrophic nitrification established a direct relation with cod n inf increase in cod n inf in other words nutrient limitation enhanced η heterotrophic nitrification while it reduced cod n growth fig s3a it agreed with joo et al 2005 sun et al 2017 who ascertained that higher c n ratios 10 20 enhanced nitrogen assimilation compared to those observed at low c n of 2 5 sun et al 2017 elucidated that the maximized ammonium assimilation at higher c n ratios would encourage faster cell propagation resulting in maintaining sufficient heterotrophic nitrifying community and thus enhancing the efficiency of this ammonium oxidation pathway thus in case of operating an o sbr with a four time greater olr η heterotrophic nitrification could become comparable in the three gsbrs regardless of dissimilar sbr operation modes in these reactors 3 3 3 phosphorus removal biologically induced precipitation was a significant contributor leakage of cod into aerobic phase and accumulation of high fa concentration during batch cycles hampered ebpr activity in this study see section 3 2 2 as demonstrated earlier section 3 3 1 microbial assimilation only contributed partially to phosphorus removal since paos i e ca accumulibacter were absent from all the three gsbrs see section 3 1 3 2 phosphorus removal beyond assimilation was attributed to bipp this hypothesis was supported by the results of pca extraction method showing that 32 74 and 49 of the ags of an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr was composed of chemically precipitated phosphorus respectively table 2 biological phosphorus content of the ags determined from the difference of tp and ortho p of the pca extracts see section 2 3 5 originated from the cellular nucleic acid phosphorus contributions of bipp to overall phosphorus removal in the gsbrs were estimated 39 96 with the lowest happened in o sbr and the highest in an o sbr table 2 significant reduction in bioactivity fig s4a and increase in ash content of the ags fig s4b in an o sbr confirmed considerable ca p accumulation in this reactor compared to the other gsbrs decrease in bioactivity has been related to ca accumulation in the core of granules ren et al 2008 the higher ca content the lower the ags microbial activity it results from the competition between biomass and ca on space which in turn restricts biomass volume of aerobic granules in an o ax o sbr and o sbr the biomass content mlvss mlss ratio increased upon granule formation fig s4b thereafter it slightly decreased from 0 88 0 91 at the end of granulation to 0 84 upon granule maturation consequently the ash content mass percentage marginally increased from about 10 to 16 in these reactors on the contrary no increase in mlvss mlss ratio was observed in an o sbr during the entire operation it continuously reduced from the initial value of 0 82 to 0 60 during acclimatization phase and maintained the same value 0 60 during granulation and maturation consequently the ash content substantially increased from the initial amount of 18 to 40 during granulation and maturation phases these differences could be explained by variant granule sizes shown in fig s1 compared to an o sbr significantly larger granules formed in an o ax o sbr and o sbr which resulted in greater biomass volume enhanced volatile contents and less ca to biomass ratio in these systems as shown in fig s5 a logarithmic relation established between granule size and biomass content ca p crystallization happened potentially via precipitation on calcite surfaces categorizing phosphate removal as the secondary effect of microbiologically induced calcium carbonate precipitation micp neither of the detected bio calcifying species as discussed in section 3 1 3 3 has ca p precipitation capacity see table s2 except pseudomonas which can precipitate calcium and phosphate in the form of acp the precursor of hap and amorphous apatite fishman et al 2018 however phosphate can precipitate on calcite crystal surfaces at certain reaction times and po4 3 concentrations li et al 2017 in phosphate bearing solutions with calcite surfaces a series of reactions occur 1 surface induced formation of ca p phases 2 aggregation of ca p clusters and 3 nucleation and subsequent growth of ca p phases on calcite surfaces wang et al 2012 the dominant mineral composition i e calcium carbonate vs calcium phosphate is determined by the competition between carbonate and phosphate to form ion pairs with calcium ions the ph of 7 7 8 7 and certain initial degree of supersaturation co3 2 ca 1 and ca p 5 0 tip the balance in the favor of phosphate house 1987 lin and singer 2006 song et al 2002a the corresponding po4 3 removal efficiency is regulated by ph and reaction time at given p concentration the longer the reaction time and the lower the ph the higher the phosphate removal efficiency li et al 2017 in this study the primary factors affecting bipp were identified as cod p inf phosphorus concentration beyond growth requirement and ca p inf the bipp efficiency η bipp reduced with increase in cod p inf fig s3b and molar ratio of ca p inf fig s6 the latter disagreed with the literature barat et al 2008 mañas et al 2012 song et al 2002b where a direct relation between ca p inf and ca p precipitation has been reported in addition η bipp enhanced with increase in phosphorus availability beyond microbial growth requirement fig s6 as demonstrated earlier section 3 3 1 in nutrient deficient environments such as an o ax o sbr and o sbr higher phosphorus concentration was required to support cell reproduction this phenomenon limited precipitable phosphorus concentration in the systems and thus resulted in lower η bipp in an o ax o sbr and o sbr nonetheless with the current database the relationship between η bipp η heterotrophic nitrification and cod n p growth and the nutrient availability cod n p inf could not be determined with the utmost certainty to profoundly understand the corresponding phenomena and accurately define the associated functions further investigation in a wider range of cod n p inf is required 4 conclusion mineral rich aerobic granules with hap core were cultivated in the gsbrs regardless of the wastewater strength and sbr operation modes mineral rich aerobic granulation was proposed to start with microbial colonization followed by carbonate crystals formation around the ps network of bioaggregates crystal growth toward the center and lifeless core formation and cell multiplication in the rim and granule growth the conventional sndpr was hindered in all the gsbrs mainly due to 1 fa accumulation 8 20 mg nh3 l 1 beyond threshold concentrations for autotrophic aobs and nobs and heterotrophic paos and 2 unfavorable biomass wastewater contact during anaerobic phases of an o ax o sbr and o sbr for paos proliferation mass balances and 16s rrna phylogenetic gene sequencing analysis demonstrated that heterotrophic nitrification and bipp were the dominant nutrient depletion pathways contributing 61 84 and 39 96 to overall ammonium nitrogen and phosphorus removal a direct relation existed between nutrient availability and η heterotrophic nitrification as nitrification efficiencies of 18 and 64 were observed for cod ninf of 5 and 20 respectively the primary factors affecting η bipp were identified as cod p inf ca p inf and the remained phosphorus concentration beyond microbial growth requirement while η bipp established inverse relations with the first two factors it demonstrated direct relation with the latter one ca p crystallization was proposed to be via phosphate precipitation on calcite surfaces categorizing phosphate removal as the secondary effect of micp phenomenon the results of this study demonstrated that nutrient removal in ags reactors during scale up can be different from the conventional sndpr observed in many lab scale ags studies especially when treating medium to high strength wastewater with the optimization of sndc and bipp processes identified in this work new horizons in the advanced bnr realm are opened which can result in improvement in resource recovery

18407,this study investigated nutrient removal characteristics and the related pathways in aerobic granular reactors using three pilot scale granular sequencing batch reactors gsbrs treating wastewaters of diverse carbon and nutrient strength the gsbrs were operated with alternating an o ax o sbr and an o sbr and purely aerobic o sbr operation modes mineral rich aerobic granules with hydroxyapatite hap core were cultivated in all the three gsbrs the highest nitrogen removal efficiency 75 was achieved in an o ax o sbr and o sbr and the lowest 22 in an o sbr establishing a quasi linear relationship with organic loading rate olr phosphorus removal efficiencies of 55 63 were achieved in the gsbrs despite different influent po4 p concentrations heterotrophic nitrification and biologically induced phosphate precipitation bipp became the dominant nutrient depletion pathways contributing 61 84 and 39 96 to overall ammonium nitrogen and phosphorus removal respectively a direct relation was noted between heterotrophic nitrification efficiency η heterotrophic nitrification and nutrient availability as nitrification efficiencies of 18 and 64 were observed for cod ninf of 5 and 20 respectively whereas bipp efficiency η bipp established inverse relation with cod p inf and ca p inf and direct relation with phosphorus concentration beyond microbial growth requirement core heterotrophic nitrifiers and bio calcifying species were identified as thauera and flavobacterium and flavobacterium acinetobacter pseudomonas and corynebacterium respectively ca p crystallization was proposed to be via phosphate precipitation on calcite surfaces granulation mechanism was proposed as crystallization on bio aggregates periphery and then crystal growth toward the core graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granulation biologically induced phosphorus precipitation bipp granulation mechanism heterotrophic nitrification nutrient removal mechanisms wastewater treatment 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags technology has proven as an appealing alternative for the conventional activated sludge cas owing to robust biological nutrient removal bnr and outstanding solid liquid separation in a compact reactor as such this technology has been anticipated as a game changer in the future of wastewater treatment van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 however its application in real life practices is still sparse due to limited know how of process scale up serving as testing optimization step pilot scale studies are integral part of upgrading the current knowledge acquired from lab scale investigations to be used in larger scale reactors de kreuk 2006 nevertheless only a handful of pilot scale studies have been carried out so far which mainly focused on startup granulation time and ags characteristics cetin et al 2018 liu et al 2010 ni et al 2009 pishgar et al 2019a 2018 mineral core mainly composed of different calcium ca compounds calcium phosphate ca p barat et al 2008 mañas et al 2012 2011 wan et al 2015 vs calcium carbonate caco3 ren et al 2008 wang et al 2007 are widely detected in aerobic granules ca deposition has demonstrated to play a crucial role in self immobilization and long term stability of aerobic granules binding with proteins ca facilitates cell to cell aggregation by enhancing bacterial cell adhesion to surfaces rose 2000 acting as cross bridging molecules ca2 ions neutralize negative charges of bacterial and exopolymer surfaces and facilitate cell polysaccharide ps and ps ps bindings yu et al 2001 juang et al 2010 demonstrated that granules with ca rich interior could maintain their strength and integrity for 216 days under continuous flow operation regime which proved detrimental for granule stability chen et al 2009 most studies with respect to ca accumulation in aerobic granules have focused on characterization of the formed ca compounds such as spatial distribution chemical composition and the relation between ca accumulation and granule physiochemical properties mañas et al 2012 2011 ren et al 2008 to the best of our knowledge bnr capacity of mineral rich granules has not been thoroughly studied so far aerobic granules are recognized as self immobilized bio aggregates carrying diverse communities of aerobic facultative and anaerobic bacteria so far many theories have been proposed to explain aerobic granulation such as hydrophobic cell surface di iaconi et al 2006 extracellular polymeric substances eps wilén et al 2008 and divalent cations bridging theories sobeck and higgins 2005 these theories mostly explain the microbial agglomeration phenomenon overlooking the effect of ca precipitation wan et al 2015 proposed a universal mineral core theory encompassing all the aforementioned ones the researchers suggested that aerobic granulation was the consequence of two consecutive steps mineral core formation and microbial agglomeration around it however this theory requires further reconsideration and proper refinement to define the actual order of granulation steps with the consideration of underlying microbiology underlying microbiology of bnr in ags reactors includes simultaneous autotrophic nitrification anoxic denitrification and phosphate removal sndpr beyond the growth requirement of a guild of bacteria known as polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos the sndpr is facilitated with proper localization of the associated microorganisms along substrate oxygen gradients regulated by diffusion conversion rates within the granule structure bassin et al 2012 de kreuk et al 2005 lemaire et al 2008 however the conventional nutrient removing organisms do not inherently dominate in response to granulation but under certain operational and environmental strategies guimarães et al 2018 weissbrodt et al 2013 instead other species potentially with dual functions i e floc formation primary function and substrate conversion secondary function are enriched during granulation li et al 2008 wan et al 2015 2013 zhao et al 2013 for example ps producer rhodocyclaceae related thauera has been widespread isolated from ags with high abundance and was realized to contribute to ammonium oxidation and no x reduction in the ags system zhao et al 2013 in addition the existence of novel nutrient removal mechanisms e g anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox heterotrophic nitrification nitrifier denitrification and biologically induced phosphate precipitation bipp has been suspected in ags reactors but not well understood and thus rarely accounted for guimarães et al 2017 wei et al 2012 for example there is a consensus upon the significant contribution of bipp to overall phosphate removal in ags bioreactors de kreuk et al 2005 mañas et al 2012 2011 nonetheless its numerical share has remained either unidentified de kreuk et al 2005 or not agreed upon mañas et al 2011 yilmaz et al 2008 profound understanding and proper quantification of uncommon nutrient removal pathways in the ags systems especially at large scale can open new horizons in the advanced bnr realm therefore this study aimed to identify and evaluate nutrient removal and mineral precipitation mechanisms exhibited by ags and the associated microbiology at pilot scale experiments were conducted in three pilot ags reactors operated with distinct sequencing batch cycle modes treating wastewaters of diverse strength the objectives of this study were to i characterize nutrient removal mechanisms in pilot scale ags systems dominated with mineral rich aerobic granules treating wastewaters with divergent carbon and nutrient strength and ii quantify the contribution of the involved nutrient removal pathways to overall nutrient removal efficiencies 2 materials and methods 2 1 seed and media return activated sludge ras taken from a wastewater treatment plant equipped with bnr pine creek wastewater treatment plant calgary canada was used as inoculum to ensure introducing diversified bacterial community to the reactors inoculum characteristics and the inoculation volume are described in pishgar et al 2019a synthetic wastewater with different carbon and nutrient strength were fed to the granular sequencing batch reactors gsbrs the principal components of the wastewaters were chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon

100 po4 p 25 cod n p inf 100 20 5 medium strength and nutrient rich wastewater the ca was supplemented using cacl2 2h2o which would introduce ca2 concentration of 45 mg l 1 to both types of synthetic wastewater pishgar et al 2019a according to the study of ren et al 2008 supplementing 40 mg ca l 1 to wastewater would result in formation of ca rich granules with more rigid structure and higher strength using wastewater with two different strength medium vs high strength two primary objectives were to fulfil which included determination of the effect of wastewater strength on 1 startup time aerobic granular sludge characteristics and effluent quality and 2 nutrient removal characteristics of aerobic granulation at pilot scale while the first objective was addressed in another study pishgar et al 2019a this study focused on the second one the cod and toc were supplemented using sodium acetate naac 25 and sodium propionate napr 75 as dual carbon sources the nh4 n concentration was adjusted using nh4cl the po4 p was supplied in the form of phosphate buffer ph 6 4 6 8 at 25 c using kh2po4 and k2hpo4 essential macro and microelements were added as detailed elsewhere pishgar et al

the gsbrs were operated at the room temperature 19 5 3 5 c granulation happened within similar periods in an o ax o sbr and o sbr where identical organic loading rates olr were applied 7 1 0 3 and 6 9 0 3 kg cod m 3 d 1 respectively slight differences in granulation time and granule size and morphology fig s1 were attributed to system perturbations which happened more frequently in an o ax o sbr due to more complicated and thus less stable operation compared to o sbr pishgar et al 2019a granulation was prolonged and 7 to 10 time smaller granules were formed in an o sbr due to significantly lower operational olr of 1 8 0 13 kg cod m 3 d 1 pishgar et al 2019a the details of granulation process and the ags characteristics are summarized in table s1 2 3 analytical procedures 2 3 1 influent

data related to this study can be found in pishgar et al 2019a determination of elemental composition of mineral deposits in the mature aerobic granules when the process was running under steady state would ensure that thermodynamically stable end products were formed and dominated the mineral deposits based on the experimental results and equilibrium study barat et al 2008 elucidated that ca p precipitation would occurr through two successive steps precipitation of amorphous calcium phosphate acp and the subsequent crystallization of hydroxyapatite hap the researchers explained that formation of thermodynamically stable hap was not a straightforward process and complete conversion of acp to hap could happen within a certain period 1 11 h depending on the ph barat et al 2008 first homogenous mixed liquor samples were taken during aeration at days 57 107 and 53 maturation phases pishgar et al 2019a from an o ax o sbr the second aeration phase an o sbr and o sbr respectively the

perchloric acid extraction to differentiate chemically precipitated from biologically accumulated phosphorus in the biomass cold perchloric acid pca extraction method was selected de haas et al 2000 in brief total phosphorus tp concentration of mixed liquor samples was determined using ascorbic acid method after sludge digestion with potassium persulfate apha 2012 the mixed liquor was thereafter centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min the corresponding supernatant was hereinafter known as sup1 centrifugation step was repeated after adding 0 9 m v nacl 10 ml to the pellets the corresponding supernatant was hereinafter known as sup2 the pool of the collected supernatants sup sup1 sup2 was immediately analyzed for phosphorus concentration which would represent the bulk liquid phosphorus

on the pellets thrice using ice cold 0 5 m pca 20 ml in a refrigerated water bath 0 3 c for 5 min refrigerated centrifugation 5 c was carried out between extraction steps 3000 rpm at 5 min the pool of

phosphorus collectively referred to as complex p only phosphorus of chemical origin mineral complexes can be determined by ortho p measurement the non ortho p i e tp ortho p is presumed to be the

sequencing and constructing clone library homogenous biomass samples were taken from the gsbrs when the systems were being aerated and in the same operational days as stated in section 2 3 4 subsequently 2 ml aliquots were taken from the homogenized ags samples for the subsequent 16s rrna phylogenetic gene sequencing analysis the 2 ml sample was centrifuged 6000 rpm for 3 min to separate the solids from the liquid solution and the collected solids were preserved in 80 c prior to dna extraction genomic dna extraction 16s rrna phylogenetic gene sequencing and constructing clone library was performed using the protocols provided by pishgar et al 2019a 2 3 7 calculations 2 3 7 1 biomass yield microorganisms oxidize organic matter to produce carbon and energy for cell reproduction and

study in the last stage of granulation i e maturation phase mlss concentrations in the gsbrs showed variations of 10 from the average values pishgar et al 2019a the calculations were based on the

metcalf eddy 2014 applying this mass ratio to the normalized c contents reported in fig 2c f and 2i the amount of intracellular p taken up for cell synthesis passimilated was estimated the p contents of 0 58 1 02 and 1 05 found in the ags ashes of an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively could be attributed to passimilated the pprecipitated was determined from the difference between the normalized p content fig 2c f 2i and the estimated passimilated consequently ca and pprecipitated constituted 21 45 0 50 and 10 53 1 17 of the normalized mass of the ashes resulting in caash pprecipitated mass ratio of 2 06 0 26 in the three gsbrs high ca and p contents were also detected in the central part of dried granules fig 3 given the passimilated content estimated above cacore pprecipitated mass ratio of the core of dried granules varied in a similar range 2 18 0 14 to that of the ags ashes these ca p mass ratios were identical to that of hap ca10 po4 6 oh 2 mass based ca p 2 15 hap is the major mineral compound found in the core of aerobic granules with acp being its precursor barat et al 2008 mañas et al 2012 2011 3 1 3 microbial composition 3 1 3 1 heterotrophic nitrifying denitrifying genera microbial analysis at genus level fig 4 confirmed that the conventional nitrogen transforming organisms i e autotrophic aobs nitrosomonas and autotrophic nobs nitrospira completely disappeared from all the three gsbrs 1 7 and 1 2 in the seed respectively the washout of aobs and nobs could be attributed to unfavorable do concentration and aeration duration undesirable temperature and ph and detrimentally high substrate load pishgar et al 2019a instead heterotrophic organisms with unorthodox nutrient removal capabilities plenteously existed in the gsbrs many detected families carried members capable of simultaneous heterotrophic nitrification and anoxic aerobic denitrification in a single cell sndc the reported functions for the isolated phylogenetic groups are tabulated in table s2 given their dominance throughout the entire operation thauera 25 9 21 5 28 9 and flavobacterium 15 4 10 4 23 4 were identified as the core sndc species in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively the rest of sndc selection showed noticeable distinctions in the gsbrs in an o ax o sbr sndc species included acinetobacter 2 6 15 entirely chryseobacterium 1 5 4 6 between days 50 61 comamonas 1 0 6 8 between days 14 50 pseudomonas 2 3 2 0 and 1 7 at days 14 50 54 and zoogloea 1 34 20 10 entirely in an o sbr these species were comamonas 26 at day 25 and 1 9 at day 53 paracoccus 2 1 17 between days 25 and 109 and pseudomonas 2 0 and 1 2 at days 53 and 67 respectively in o sbr the following sndc were isolated acinetobacter 0 54 12 90 entirely comamonas 6 7 at day 14 and 2 3 at day 22 and paracoccus 2 7 3 3 between days 14 and 50 and 1 5 at day 54 the rapid shift in sndc population seemed to be related to wastewater composition it seemed that all types of wastewater used in this study medium to high strength provided the favorable condition for the growth of sndc species regardless of the operation mode and thus led to their proliferation in all the gsbrs it agreed with pishgar et al 2019b where using different selection pressure strategies the researchers concluded that the selective pressure imposed by nourishment condition was in fact the decisive factor in microbial selection and the resulting nutrient removal mechanisms in the previous study which complements the current work pishgar et al 2019a biodiversity analysis using different diversity indices confirmed the same implication elucidating that the microbial selection strategies in these gsbrs could be imposed by wastewater strength rather than the sbr operation mode regarding the lower population of sndc species in o sbr it could highlight the effect of sbr operation mode on microbial structure of gsbrs it could be argued that the operation mode of o sbr was not as desirable for the enrichment of sndc species as were the operation modes of an o ax o sbr and an o sbr it could imply that either sndc species required an anaerobic or anoxic phase prior to aerobic phase for their growth or the presence of a low shear phase like anaerobic or anoxic phase with oxygen deficiency restricted the growth of competing organisms and provided competitive advantage for the enrichment of sndc species understanding the effect of operation mode and wastewater strength on the growth and activity of sndc species warrant further investigation using a more systematic experimentation number of the detected sndc species including thauera flavobacterium paracoccus and acinetobacter have been characterized as polysaccharide producing bacteria see table s2 it indicated that overabundance of these species was potentially primarily due to the strong hydraulic selection pressures applied in the gsbrs for aerobic granulation multiple denitrifying species were isolated the most important one was azoarcus which is one of the most abundant anoxic denitrifiers in lab osaka et al 2006 and full scale systems thomsen et al 2007 azoarcus sp considerably proliferated in the gsbrs 0 2 7 1 0 10 and 0 5 23 in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively with the largest populations observed at the beginning of maturation other putative denitrifying organisms included hydrogenophaga an o ax o sbr 0 4 2 2 o sbr 0 6 6 erysipelothrix an o sbr 0 02 4 8 o sbr 0 2 1 8 fusibacter o sbr 0 6 3 8 see table s2 for the reported functions isolation of these species supported the formation of anoxic zone inside aerobic granules in this study 3 1 3 2 putative phosphate accumulators the conventional polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos i e ca accumulibacter emerged in neither of the gsbrs although it was seen in the seed 3 5 fig 4 instead other putative paos showed significant relative abundances in at least two out of the three reactors such as acinetobacter 2 6 15 0 09 2 2 0 5 13 pseudomonas 0 08 2 3 0 04 2 0 0 06 0 6 and corynebacterium 0 4 3 2 0 01 9 5 0 1 0 6 in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively see table s2 for the anticipated functions the absence of p release uptake in the alternating anaerobic aerobic gsbrs an o ax o sbr and an o sbr and the purely aerobic one o sbr see section 3 3 2 suggested that either these species were not contributing to biological phosphate removal in this study or their phosphate accumulation metabolism was distinct from that of ca accumulibacter this ambiguity necessitates further investigation on phosphate removal capacity and mechanism of these bacteria to develop the know how about their contribution to phosphate depletion in bnr processes 3 1 3 3 bio calcifying organisms several isolated species could contribute to bio calcification inside the granules in the form of calcite aragonite and or vaterite those species included flavobacterium 7 0 21 4 0 13 19 30 acinetobacter 3 0 15 0 08 2 2 0 6 13 pseudomonas 0 08 2 3 0 04 2 0 0 04 0 6 and corynebacterium 0 4 3 2 0 01 10 0 1 0 6 in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively see table s2 for the anticipated functions 3 1 4 granulation mechanism aerobic granulation started with microbial colonization of floc forming sndc species see section 3 1 3 1 a process which was enabled by the consecutive steps of cell to cell contact bio aggregation and eps embedment liu and tay 2002 thereafter carbonate crystals formed around the polysaccharide network in which the bacterial species were encased zamarreňo et al 2009 ascertained that the carbonate crystals precipitated by freshwater bacteria composed of bacterial cells embedded in a matrix of neutral and acid polysaccharides it is known that eps has high affinity for ca ions being a fundamental constituent of polysaccharide ps and protein pn components of eps free ca facilitates interaction between adjacent sugars and maintains the tertiary structure of eps molecules in addition it forms a gel like but rigid eps matrix by interacting with secondary function groups in ps molecules e g oh yu et al 2001 afterwards small crystal pieces were bound together by eps to form sheet like structures as demonstrated by zamarreňo et al 2009 eps facilitates crystal to crystal bonding either via entrapping and concentrating calcium in its structure or due to having specific protein which promotes calcium carbonate precipitation in the form of diverse polymorphs kawaguchi and decho 2002 later the bacteria entrapped within the crystal shell died leaving the internal part of granules lifeless histological and fluorescence staining in the study of zamarreňo et al 2009 demonstrated that the bacterial community inside carbonate crystals could only maintain their viability over a short period of time about 2 weeks thus carbon nitrogen and oxygen found in the granule cores in this study see fig 3 could be explained by the remnants of dead bacterial cells neutral ps associated with young microbial colonies and negligible number of microorganisms which could survive in the core the results of the study of zamarreňo et al 2009 demonstrated that the number of surviving cells inside carbonate crystals was 9 cells mg 1 subsequently bacterial cell nucleation and multiplication around the inert core continued and mineral rich aerobic granules with inert cores formed this process has been schematized in fig 5 3 2 treatment performance 3 2 1 long term removal efficiencies table 1 presents long term performance parameters organic matter i e cod and toc removal efficiencies were consistently high 90 in all the three gsbrs although different influent cod and toc concentrations and divergent olrs were applied the highest nitrogen removal efficiency 75 was mutually achieved in an o ax o sbr and o sbr where the highest olr was maintained in contrast about one third nh4 n removal efficiency 22 was obtained in an o sbr where the olr was four times less compared to the two other reactors similar phosphorus removal efficiencies were achieved in the gsbrs despite different influent po4 p concentrations 3 2 2 short term performance batch cycle kinetics and inhibition of the conventional sndpr to further investigate nutrient removal mechanisms dynamics of soluble components and environmental factors were analyzed in typical batch cycles of the gsbrs fig 6 in all cases negligible cod concentration 30 mg l 1 and substantial tn nh4 n and po4 p concentrations were detected in the effluents while no x accumulation did not happen entirely residual cod concentration could be attributed to the release of non biodegradable organic matter due to endogenous respiration during famine phases of the sbr cycles having had no no x residues nh4 n and tn concentration profiles intertwined resulting in similar residual concentrations of these components in the effluents no no x production could suggest that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd did not occur and that ammonium removal was only associated with the metabolism of ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos in all the three gsbrs accumulation of free ammonia fa the protonated form of ammonium was observed in all the three gsbrs fa formation depends on nh4 concentration ph and temperature anthonisen et al 1976 the fa concentration ranged between 3 and 9 12 and 16 and 6 and 21 mg l 1 as nh3 in an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr respectively during the first 60 70 min fa increased significantly to the highest values in all the three gsbrs 8 5 15 5 and 20 5 mg nh3 l 1 respectively accumulation of fa within the first 45 60 min of an o ax o sbr and an o sbr was not as distinguishable as it was in o sbr moderate mixing strategies during the initial anaerobic phases in these systems could mask the fa production patterns hence fa concentration exponentially increased from 3 to 3 8 mg nh3 l 1 at 7 45 min in an o ax o sbr and 12 14 mg nh3 l 1 at 0 60 min in an o sbr to the highest values stated above within the first 10 15 min of the subsequent aeration phases in addition increase in do during this time interval from 0 02 0 09 to 5 16 6 21 mg o2 l 1 elevated the ph from 8 8 27 to 8 57 8 66 respectively the concentration of fa increased with the increase of ph due to volatilization of co2 which was formed as a result of organic matter oxidation with aeration it gave rise to fa production even if the ammonium concentration was experiencing a declining trend at the same time at the end of batch cycles while fa concentrations subsequently declined to 5 and 8 mg nh3 l 1 in an o ax o sbr and o sbr respectively it maintained high concentrations in an o sbr 14 16 mg l 1 as nh3 it could be attributed to higher residual nh4 concentration in an o sbr 72 mg nh4 n l 1 compared to the other gsbrs 24 37 mg nh4 n l 1 autotrophic nitrification did not happen in either of the gsbrs due to intensive fa accumulation the fa ranges in this study stated above mutually suppressed aobs and nobs proliferation in all the three gsbrs according to anthonisen et al 1976 fa impedes both aobs and nobs activities at completely distinct concentration ranges 10 150 and 0 1 1 0 mg nh3 l 1 respectively indicating the higher nobs sensitivity to this inhibitory factor concentration range of 1 5 mg nh3 l 1 hinders nitratation n o 2 n o b s n o 3 but not nitritation n h 4 a o b s n o 2 abeling and seyfried 1992 the inhibition of nitritation commences at fa concentrations about 7 mg nh3 l 1 while this reaction is almost completely impeded at around 20 mg nh3 l 1 anthonisen et al 1976 regarding nobs more inhibitory factors were in effect repression of aobs limited the nobs substrate i e no2 and the temperature variations did not favor the growth of this guild of bacteria as well nobs are active over a temperature range of 10 20 c increase in temperature to 20 25 c favors nitritation while it declines the nitratation rate balmelle et al 1992 nitritation reaches a maximum rate at 25 c balmelle et al 1992 with fa inhibition becoming preponderant at higher temperatures abeling and seyfried 1992 thus while the temperature ranges in the gsbrs 20 24 c could potentially promote aobs growth if such strong fa inhibition did not prevail it contributed to nobs repression alongside other inhibitory factors inconsiderable cod degradation efficiencies 20 and 56 respectively were estimated for anaerobic phases of an o ax o sbr and an o sbr which potentially hindered enhanced biological phosphate removal ebpr pathway in these reactors the absence of poly p cleavage formation in the ags which if present would lead to ortho p release uptake in the bulk liquid was supported by the dynamics of cation concentrations fig s2 mg2 and k profiles did not show any release and uptake patterns which would be expected if ebpr activity was occurring filali et al 2012 these cations contribute to charge balance during ortho p traverse through cell membrane metcalf eddy 2014 the limited anaerobic cod consumption could not provide sufficient intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoate pha pool to induce pao proliferation the channelling phenomenon encountered in slow feeding upflow sludge bed usb reactors jin et al 2012 could had caused unpromising biomass wastewater contact during anaerobic phases in this study implementing an anaerobic mixed batch phase concomitant with slow up flow feeding or separately could overcome this problem guimarães et al 2018 this strategy is especially helpful in pilot reactors where an undesirable feed distribution design can exacerbate the channelling issue due to proportionate increase in design error with increment in reactor scale pishgar et al 2018 drastic fa production could also contribute to ebpr inhibition in the study of cao et al 2017 the fa concentration over 10 mg nh3 l 1 decreased the diversity and abundance of paos with phosphate removal efficiency severely deteriorated at 16 18 mg nh3 l 1 yang et al 2018 zheng et al 2013 zheng et al 2013 ascertained that disturbance of pao community due to fa exposure was irreversible 3 3 nutrient removal mechanisms 3 3 1 microbial assimilation ammary s equation was adopted to estimate the nutrient concentration removed via assimilation ammary 2004 10 cod n p 0 41 100 e y o b s c o d 5 1 where e was cod removal efficiency and yobs cod represented the observed yield the conversion factor 0 41 is the observed yield commonly considered for aerobic biological reactions ammary 2004 since the observed yield can be different from case to case this change should be accounted for in nutrient requirement calculations as it was done here accordingly nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations utilized for microbial growth were determined in terms of δcod δn δp growth table 1 these ratios were identical in an o ax o sbr and o sbr where wastewater of the same relative carbon and nutrient strength i e cod n p inf and matching substrate loading conditions were used on the contrary significantly lower nutrient concentrations about half were used for bacterial growth in an o sbr the cod n p inf established inverse relation with cod n p growth figs s3a and b in other words ammonium nitrogen and phosphorus incorporated into cellular tissues considerably increased in the nutrient limited environments of an o ax o sbr and o sbr compared to those in the nutrient rich medium of an o sbr mass balances based on eq 10 demonstrated that biomass assimilation was responsible for the removal of 33 39 of the depleted nitrogen concentration in an o ax o sbr and o sbr and 16 of that in an o sbr contribution of this pathway to overall phosphorus removal was moderate in an o ax o sbr 48 and o sbr 61 and insignificant in an o sbr 4 the results of this study demonstrated that the actual nutrient requirement for growth could largely deviate from the conventional ratios cod n p of 100 5 1 and the amplitude of variation depended on nutrient availability the conventional nutrient requirement ratio is approximated based on cell dry weight composition of typical bacterial species formulated as c60h87o23n12p2 3 and should be used for estimations in practical applications only metcalf eddy 2014 during in depth investigations extrapolation of the generalized conversion factors i e carbon to cell carbon to volume and elemental ratios should be accomplished with caution vrede et al 2002 3 3 2 nitrogen removal heterotrophic nitrification was the dominant ammonia transformation pathway quasilinear relation between olr and nh4 n removal efficiency as discussed in section 3 2 1 implied co metabolism of organic matter and ammonium despite variant ammonium removal efficiencies the ratios between removed cod and ammonium nitrogen concentrations δcod δn overall were identical 100 4 in all the three gsbrs see table 1 similarity between this ratio and the optimal ratio reported for aerobic growth i e cod n of 100 5 ammary 2004 first prompted the idea that ammonium removal was only via biomass assimilation as it was also speculated by cetin et al 2018 under similar circumstances nevertheless the significant gaps between the observed yields based on cod consumption and nitrogen assimilation yobs n yobs cod table 1 demonstrated that a major fraction of the removed ammonium was not due to biomass assimilation depleted nh4 n concentration beyond microbial assimilation i e 61 84 in all the three gsbrs was attributed to nitrification activity table 1 existing a relation between nitrification and cod degradation disagreed with independency of autotrophic nitrification from organic matter consumption refuting the occurrence of this ammonium oxidation pathway respirometric activity of the ags supported this hypothesis the results of sour analysis showed that the activity of autotrophic nitrifying community was suppressed in all the three reactors fig s4a although the seed sludge showed considerably high nitrifying activity souraobs and sournobs of 24 2 5 and 33 4 mg o2 mg 1 vss h 1 respectively souraobs and sournobs reduced in half in all the three gsbrs during acclimatization upon granule formation and maturation further reductions were observed such that these parameters attained values in the range of sourendo this observation suggested that any activity in souraobs and sournobs vessels was in fact due to biomass autolysis as also discussed earlier see section 3 2 2 it could be said that aobs and nobs were inhibited and then washed out of all the gsbrs therefore low sours in batch tests were measured for both aobs and nobs instead heterotrophic nitrification could be in effect no no x accumulation during biochemical reactions in the typical batch cycles of the gsbrs supported this hypothesis fig 6a c and 6e trace or no no x concentrations has been reported for heterotrophic nitrification zhao et al 2012 2013 and in case of no x accumulation its removal rate would be significantly fast joo et al 2005 it is known that some heterotrophic nitrifiers e g alcaligenes sp direct nitrification via hydroxylamine nh2oh instead of no x due to lack of nitrate nar and nitrite reductase nir enzymes joo et al 2005 zhao et al 2012 a trait which might be shared by a wider range of heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria verifying this hypothesis requires further research about heterotrophic nitrification pathway of a diverse group of bacterial species a recent study demonstrated that heterotrophic nitrifiers paracoccus sp dominated the reactor treating incineration leachate at high fa concentrations and were actively transcribing nitrification amoa and denitrification genes narg norb nirs and nosz even when fa was as high as 184 mg l 1 liu et al 2018 it suggested that heterotrophic nitrification could contribute to ammonium removal in this study although fa toxicity existed in all the three gsbrs fig 6a c and 6e this implication was further supported by the results of microbial community analysis section 3 1 3 where 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed the abundance of numerous sndc species in all the gsbrs however further investigations are recommended to verify the insensitivity of heterotrophic nitrification to fa heterotrophic nitrification occurred alongside nh4 n assimilation co occurrence of these two nitrogen transformation pathways has been widely reported in pure culture studies with 27 52 of nh4 n concentration 100 1000 mg n l 1 being incorporated into cellular tissues joo et al 2006 sun et al 2017 in fact in a heterotrophic nitrifying community ammonium assimilation is the preferred nitrogen removal pathway rather than heterotrophic nitrification and serves as a crucial accessory for the successive aerobic denitrification improving denitrification efficiency by further propagating sndc community sun et al 2017 moderate to low nitrification efficiencies η nitrification resulted in residual nitrogen concentration in the effluents of the gsbrs table 1 indicating limited capacity of heterotrophic nitrification unlike cod n growth see section 3 3 1 heterotrophic nitrification efficiency η heterotrophic nitrification established a direct relation with cod n inf increase in cod n inf in other words nutrient limitation enhanced η heterotrophic nitrification while it reduced cod n growth fig s3a it agreed with joo et al 2005 sun et al 2017 who ascertained that higher c n ratios 10 20 enhanced nitrogen assimilation compared to those observed at low c n of 2 5 sun et al 2017 elucidated that the maximized ammonium assimilation at higher c n ratios would encourage faster cell propagation resulting in maintaining sufficient heterotrophic nitrifying community and thus enhancing the efficiency of this ammonium oxidation pathway thus in case of operating an o sbr with a four time greater olr η heterotrophic nitrification could become comparable in the three gsbrs regardless of dissimilar sbr operation modes in these reactors 3 3 3 phosphorus removal biologically induced precipitation was a significant contributor leakage of cod into aerobic phase and accumulation of high fa concentration during batch cycles hampered ebpr activity in this study see section 3 2 2 as demonstrated earlier section 3 3 1 microbial assimilation only contributed partially to phosphorus removal since paos i e ca accumulibacter were absent from all the three gsbrs see section 3 1 3 2 phosphorus removal beyond assimilation was attributed to bipp this hypothesis was supported by the results of pca extraction method showing that 32 74 and 49 of the ags of an o ax o sbr an o sbr and o sbr was composed of chemically precipitated phosphorus respectively table 2 biological phosphorus content of the ags determined from the difference of tp and ortho p of the pca extracts see section 2 3 5 originated from the cellular nucleic acid phosphorus contributions of bipp to overall phosphorus removal in the gsbrs were estimated 39 96 with the lowest happened in o sbr and the highest in an o sbr table 2 significant reduction in bioactivity fig s4a and increase in ash content of the ags fig s4b in an o sbr confirmed considerable ca p accumulation in this reactor compared to the other gsbrs decrease in bioactivity has been related to ca accumulation in the core of granules ren et al 2008 the higher ca content the lower the ags microbial activity it results from the competition between biomass and ca on space which in turn restricts biomass volume of aerobic granules in an o ax o sbr and o sbr the biomass content mlvss mlss ratio increased upon granule formation fig s4b thereafter it slightly decreased from 0 88 0 91 at the end of granulation to 0 84 upon granule maturation consequently the ash content mass percentage marginally increased from about 10 to 16 in these reactors on the contrary no increase in mlvss mlss ratio was observed in an o sbr during the entire operation it continuously reduced from the initial value of 0 82 to 0 60 during acclimatization phase and maintained the same value 0 60 during granulation and maturation consequently the ash content substantially increased from the initial amount of 18 to 40 during granulation and maturation phases these differences could be explained by variant granule sizes shown in fig s1 compared to an o sbr significantly larger granules formed in an o ax o sbr and o sbr which resulted in greater biomass volume enhanced volatile contents and less ca to biomass ratio in these systems as shown in fig s5 a logarithmic relation established between granule size and biomass content ca p crystallization happened potentially via precipitation on calcite surfaces categorizing phosphate removal as the secondary effect of microbiologically induced calcium carbonate precipitation micp neither of the detected bio calcifying species as discussed in section 3 1 3 3 has ca p precipitation capacity see table s2 except pseudomonas which can precipitate calcium and phosphate in the form of acp the precursor of hap and amorphous apatite fishman et al 2018 however phosphate can precipitate on calcite crystal surfaces at certain reaction times and po4 3 concentrations li et al 2017 in phosphate bearing solutions with calcite surfaces a series of reactions occur 1 surface induced formation of ca p phases 2 aggregation of ca p clusters and 3 nucleation and subsequent growth of ca p phases on calcite surfaces wang et al 2012 the dominant mineral composition i e calcium carbonate vs calcium phosphate is determined by the competition between carbonate and phosphate to form ion pairs with calcium ions the ph of 7 7 8 7 and certain initial degree of supersaturation co3 2 ca 1 and ca p 5 0 tip the balance in the favor of phosphate house 1987 lin and singer 2006 song et al 2002a the corresponding po4 3 removal efficiency is regulated by ph and reaction time at given p concentration the longer the reaction time and the lower the ph the higher the phosphate removal efficiency li et al 2017 in this study the primary factors affecting bipp were identified as cod p inf phosphorus concentration beyond growth requirement and ca p inf the bipp efficiency η bipp reduced with increase in cod p inf fig s3b and molar ratio of ca p inf fig s6 the latter disagreed with the literature barat et al 2008 mañas et al 2012 song et al 2002b where a direct relation between ca p inf and ca p precipitation has been reported in addition η bipp enhanced with increase in phosphorus availability beyond microbial growth requirement fig s6 as demonstrated earlier section 3 3 1 in nutrient deficient environments such as an o ax o sbr and o sbr higher phosphorus concentration was required to support cell reproduction this phenomenon limited precipitable phosphorus concentration in the systems and thus resulted in lower η bipp in an o ax o sbr and o sbr nonetheless with the current database the relationship between η bipp η heterotrophic nitrification and cod n p growth and the nutrient availability cod n p inf could not be determined with the utmost certainty to profoundly understand the corresponding phenomena and accurately define the associated functions further investigation in a wider range of cod n p inf is required 4 conclusion mineral rich aerobic granules with hap core were cultivated in the gsbrs regardless of the wastewater strength and sbr operation modes mineral rich aerobic granulation was proposed to start with microbial colonization followed by carbonate crystals formation around the ps network of bioaggregates crystal growth toward the center and lifeless core formation and cell multiplication in the rim and granule growth the conventional sndpr was hindered in all the gsbrs mainly due to 1 fa accumulation 8 20 mg nh3 l 1 beyond threshold concentrations for autotrophic aobs and nobs and heterotrophic paos and 2 unfavorable biomass wastewater contact during anaerobic phases of an o ax o sbr and o sbr for paos proliferation mass balances and 16s rrna phylogenetic gene sequencing analysis demonstrated that heterotrophic nitrification and bipp were the dominant nutrient depletion pathways contributing 61 84 and 39 96 to overall ammonium nitrogen and phosphorus removal a direct relation existed between nutrient availability and η heterotrophic nitrification as nitrification efficiencies of 18 and 64 were observed for cod ninf of 5 and 20 respectively the primary factors affecting η bipp were identified as cod p inf ca p inf and the remained phosphorus concentration beyond microbial growth requirement while η bipp established inverse relations with the first two factors it demonstrated direct relation with the latter one ca p crystallization was proposed to be via phosphate precipitation on calcite surfaces categorizing phosphate removal as the secondary effect of micp phenomenon the results of this study demonstrated that nutrient removal in ags reactors during scale up can be different from the conventional sndpr observed in many lab scale ags studies especially when treating medium to high strength wastewater with the optimization of sndc and bipp processes identified in this work new horizons in the advanced bnr realm are opened which can result in improvement in resource recovery

18408,carbamazepine cbz is a typical pharmaceutical residue commonly found in aqueous environments but its removal through activated carbon or advanced oxidation processes is often disrupted by co existing organic matter an imprinting system which consisted of the target pollutant cbz template molecule and 10 different kinds of functional monomers was constructed via molecular simulation to screen for appropriate monomers thereby addressing cbz removal disruptions an annealing method simulation was used to search for stable low energy conformations of the template monomer interaction system to calculate the binding energy of these different monomers with cbz the order of binding affinity calculated was 4 vinylbenzoic acid itaconic acid methacrylic acid which was consistent with the experimental observations the adsorption capacity of the molecular imprinted polymer mip prepared using 4 vinylbenzoic acid reached 28 40 mg g and the imprinting factor reached 2 72 the simulation and measurement of the ultraviolet spectrum of the imprinting system showed that a new interaction system was formed between the template and monomers and that multiple binding conformations between them took place when specific recognition occurred energy calculation and hydrogen bond analysis revealed that the van der waals force including the π π conjugate and electrostatic forces including hydrogen bonding played an important role during selective adsorption which was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords molecular imprinting molecular simulation annealing algorithm adsorption mechanism drinking water treatment 1 introduction carbamazepine cbz which is used both in pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps has been commonly detected in aqueous environment over the past few years berndt et al 2018 martínez alcalá et al 2018 cbz is refractory chen et al 2015 in aqueous environments and can be ingested by humans via the food chain garcía et al 2018 and drinking water benotti et al 2009 wee and aris 2017 the risks associated with cbz have been acknowledged for some time ebele et al 2017 malarvizhi et al 2012 but traditional methods used to treat drinking water such as activated carbon adsorption varga et al 2019 cannot remove cbz efficiently the removal rate of cbz using advanced oxidation processes such as photocatalysis with titanium dioxide or the fenton reaction can reach more than 98 ali et al 2018 zhen et al 2018 but poor selectivity for the target pollutant zhang et al 2019 often leads to a sharp drop in the removal efficiency under interference from competitive pollutants bo et al 2019 similar drawbacks have been observed using modified adsorbents such as carbon nanotubes lerman et al 2013 and cyclodextrin polymers zhou et al 2019 as the adsorption process is significantly disturbed by co existing matter meaning that target pollutants with greater environmental hazards cannot be removed preferentially chen et al 2017 this defect has limited the practical application of such technologies molecular imprinting technology mit provides a cost effective and easy to use solution for the selective removal of specific pollutants in a complex water environment with imprinting holes that precisely match the stereo structure of the template molecule i e the target pollutant the molecular imprinted polymer mip can specifically identify and adsorb a pollutant under the most difficult circumstances chen et al 2016 at present mips are mostly used for the separation extraction and detection of substances in the field of chromatography some attempts have been made to remove heavy metals önnby et al 2012 dyes ng et al 2017 xenoestrogens ren et al 2014 and endocrine disruptors pereira et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 from water using mips water treatment processing requires not only the highly specific recognition but also an excellent adsorption capacity a fast reaction rate reliable capability for re use and the biological safety of the imprinted adsorbents in aqueous phase the functional monomer which is the site that directly recognizes the template has a significant impact on adsorption performance li et al 2018 selecting the preferred monomers according to the properties of the target pollutant is an important way in which the performance of adsorbents can be improved in previous studies methacrylic acid maa has been most frequently used to synthesize cbz mip with an optimum cbz to maa ratio of 1 4 n n esfandyari manesh et al 2012 lee et al 2014 almost all of the synthesized polymers developed have so far been used for the detection of substances asgari et al 2017 and no reports have been made concerning the optimization of cbz mip monomers however conventional experiments to screen for the optimal monomer are usually erratic and time consuming molecular simulation can help to overcome this drawback molecular simulation can be used to explore molecular structure and behavior in depth and thus predict the physical and chemical properties of a system the use of this method therefore has excellent potential in optimizing conditions for the preparation of mips bakas et al 2013 the preference of a monomer is usually judged by calculating the binding energy of the monomer with its template in a stable low energy conformation monomers with greater binding energy are generally preferred yu et al 2019 however the potential surface of a template monomer interaction system is so complicated with many local energy minima and one global minimum that the conformation with the lowest potential energy is difficult to find in previous research search methods concerning the local optimum have usually been used to find stable conformations marć et al 2018 however the low energy molecules so far obtained are greatly influenced by the initial position of the template monomer and the local energy minimum point tends to be near the initial structure yun et al 2010 an algorithm to simulate annealing could help to overcome this defect during annealing the temperature of the local environment rises and falls alternately in a dynamic process the high temperature period enables monomers with sufficient kinetic energy to cross the energy barrier from a local minimum point to interact with the template from different positions and orientations this overcomes the shortcomings of the existing search method in which the conformations were prone to fall into local potential wells simulated annealing expands the search for useable conformations and therefore helps to obtain the optimum global conformation at which adsorption occurs however no research has yet been carried out concerning the use of simulated annealing in the design of mips in this study a simulated annealing algorithm was for the first time applied to search for the low energy conformation of a specific template monomer and the binding energy was then calculated based on the conformation observed in order to determine the preferred monomer cbz mips were then synthesized using both the optimized monomers and the more traditional monomer methacrylic acid maa separately and their adsorption properties were compared the adsorption performance of the cbz mip prepared with the best monomer found using simulated annealing was expected to be improved as compared to the other monomers tested molecular simulation was also used to explore the micro mechanism by which the specific recognition process takes place the ultraviolet spectra of the imprinted system were also calculated theoretically and measured for the first time the adsorption mechanism was investigated from the perspectives of binding energy interaction force electron cloud density and binding conformations 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents nano fe3o4 50 300 nm carbamazepine cbz 98 0 oxcarbazepine ocbz 98 0 tetraethyl silicate teos 99 ammonia 25

liquid chromatography ultimate 3000 thermo fisher co usa a fourier transform infrared spectrometer nicolet is5 thermo fisher co usa and an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer specord 200 plus analytik jena instrument co ltd germany were used to carry out the processes described in the following sections 2 3 selection of functional monomers by molecular simulation the molecular simulation was carried out using the materials studio 8 0 software platform the simulated imprinted system consisted of cbz and 10 different functional monomers the ratio of cbz to the monomers was 10 40 n n an annealing simulation was carried out based on the compass force field a total of 60 annealing cycles with a time step of 1 fs were carried out the global optimal conformation can theoretically be spotted if sufficient time is allowed the temperature of the environment during annealing is another important parameter as it represents a trade off between a system with too much kinetic energy where the molecules tend to escape from the simulation system and a system with too little kinetic energy for the molecules to cross the energy barrier the highest and lowest annealing temperatures were therefore set at 600 k and 300 k with 10 heating and cooling ramps per cycle to allow the temperature to change in a uniform manner the simulation produced a total of 60 low energy conformations at the end of the annealing and was followed by a more delicate local optimization to confirm the low energy status of the conformations discovered the average binding energy between the template and the monomer was then calculated for the conformations found with the three lowest potential energies binding energy is calculated as follows 1 e binding e total e template e monomer where ebinding is the binding energy between the template cbz and monomers etotal is the total energy of the template and the monomers etemplate is the energy of the template cbz and emonomer is the energy of the monomers 2 4 preparation of magnetic carrier fe3o4 sio2 nano scale fe3o4 was utilized as an adsorbent carrier for the rapid separation of the cbz mip systems from the water nano fe3o4 can readily aggregate in aqueous solution wang et al 2019 and coating with silica allows for a more uniform dispersal chellappa and vijayalakshmi 2019 for the experiment 4 2 g of nanometer sized fe3o4 particles 100 ml ethanol 6 ml water and 6 ml ammonia were added to a 250 ml flask following 2 min of ultrasonic dispersion 3 ml of teos and 30 ml of ethanol were added to the solution the mixture was then stirred ultrasonically at 25 c for 30 min and agitated mechanically at room temperature for 16 h the obtained solid fe3o4 sio2 particles via this process were then washed three times alternatively using ethanol and water the nanoparticles were then separated using a magnet and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 c for 48 h 2 5 preparation of the cbz mip 60 ml methanol acetonitrile 1 1 v v mixture 4 mmol monomers including both the traditional monomer maa and the other monomers selected and 1 mmol of template cbz were added to a 100 ml flask after ultrasonic dispersion at 25 khz for 30 min the solution was placed in cool dry environment for 12 h to pre polymerize 0 5 g of the carrier fe3o4 sio2 20 mmol of the crosslinker egdma and 0 06 g initiator aibn were then added to the pre polymerized solution after 15 min of ultrasonic dispersion in an ice water bath nitrogen was flushed into the flask for 40 min to remove a sufficient amount of oxygen and the reaction system was then sealed the solution was agitated for 24 h at 400 r min and 62 c for thermal polymerization the product was then separated using a magnet and washed with methanol and ultra pure water the template cbz was eluted away from the product using a 100 ml methanol acetic acid solution 9 1 v v the elution lasted for three days with the eluent renewed three times per day after washing the product with methanol and ultra pure water and drying in a vacuum at 50 c for 24 h cbz mip was obtained the non imprinted polymer nip was prepared in a similar manner but without the addition of cbz during preparation 2 6 adsorption performance of mips the performance of the mips was evaluated and compared 10 mg of the imprinted adsorbents prepared using the different monomers were added separately to 30 ml of cbz aqueous solution in a 50 ml conical flask the initial cbz concentration ranged from 200 μg l to 10 mg l the mixture was shaken on the platform of a reciprocating incubator at 200 r min for 2 h at room temperature after magnetic separation the supernatant was collected and then filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon membrane followed by hplc analysis of the residual cbz concentration the adsorption amount q and removal rate η were calculated as follows 2 q c 0 c e v m 3 η c 0 c e c 0 100 where q is the adsorption capacity mg g c 0 is the initial concentration of pollutants mg l c e is the equilibrium concentration of pollutants mg l v is the volume of the solution l and m is the mass of the adsorbent g langmuir and freundlich models were used to describe the adsorption isotherm using the following

mg k f is the freundlich constant and 1 n is the non uniform factor the adsorption kinetics were also investigated by adding 10 mg adsorbent to 30 ml and 10 mg l cbz solutions the concentration of residual cbz was tested at 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 15 30 and 40 min pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were then used to explicate the adsorption kinetics 6 ln q e q t ln

constant min 1 and k 2 is the pseudo second order kinetic constant g mg 1 min 1 the selectivity of the mips and nips was investigated using oxcarbazepine ocbz a compound with a similar structure to cbz as a competitive pollutant fig 1 10 mg of the adsorbent was added to 30 ml cbz and ocbz solutions at 10 mg l the concentration of pollutants in the supernatant was analyzed after 2 h of oscillation under the constant temperature of 25 c considering that the use of mip adsorption for treating drinking water would follow the filtration process the specimen was prepared using both ultra pure water and filter effluent from a drinking water treatment plant the imprinting factor α and selective factor β were applied as indicators to describe the selectivity of the adsorbents the higher

the imprinting factor of the target pollutant and αc is the imprinting factor of the competitive pollutants the adsorbents were regenerated using a methanol acetic acid mixture 9 1 v v 10 mg of the regenerated adsorbent was then added to the 30 ml cbz solution at 10 mg l for adsorption after 6 h the amount of adsorption that had taken place was calculated a total of 10 adsorption elution regeneration cycles were carried out 2 7 the adsorption mechanism in order to ascertain the mechanism by which adsorption takes place electron density analysis of the monomer template system was conducted this calculation is carried out using quantum mechanics and the amount of calculation required increases exponentially with the number of atoms concerned this means that this calculation is difficult to compute with regards to a system that contains a large number of atoms an imprinting system with a monomer template ratio of 1 1 n n was therefore reestablished to perform the electron density calculation the density functional used was gga pbe using the ts method for dft d correction the molecular simulation of the uv spectra of an imprinted system was performed on cbz only monomers only and a mixture of both when the selective recognition actually occurs the template cannot completely react with the monomers at a ratio of 1 4 as was initially injected in the polymerization stage the optical properties of the template monomer mixture were therefore calculated at ratios between 1 1 and 1 4 the density functional used was gga pbe and the effects of using water as the solvent were taken into consideration 2 8 measurement of ultraviolet and infrared spectra and conditions of hplc the ultraviolet spectrum of 10 mg l 42 3 μmol l cbz solution 169 2 μmol l functional monomer solution and the corresponding template monomer mixture 1 4 n n was examined at wavelengths between 190 and 500 nm fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was used to scan both the dried carrier and the adsorbents for the determination of pollutants by high performance liquid chromatography an injection volume of 20 μl a column temperature of 35 c and the waters pah c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm were used the wavelength used to detect cbz was 285 nm the mobile phase was acetonitrile ultrapure water mixture 60 40 v v and the flow rate was 0 9 ml min while ocbz was detected at a wavelength of 254 nm with a methanol ultrapure water mixture 1 1 v v mobile phase and a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 3 results and discussion 3 1 selected monomers by molecular simulation in the simulated annealing process the temperature and energy of the system changed as seen in fig 2 during each annealing cycle the ambient temperature rose from 300 k to 600 k and then decreased again to 300 k and the energy of the imprinting system fluctuated periodically in response the rise in temperature led to an increase in kinetic energy so that the molecules could overcome the steric hindrance and be able to combine from various angles and orientations every time the temperature dropped to 300 k a low energy conformation was output the initial structure had the highest potential energy and was unstable the energy decreased rapidly from 14600 kj mol to 14800 kj mol after one annealing treatment and geometry optimization after several cycles the energy was observed to decrease gradually from 14800 kj mol to below 15000 kj mol and fluctuated continuously within this range the binding capacity of 10 different kinds of functional monomers to cbz is given in table s1 of the supporting information the results of the simulation indicated that the greatest binding energy occurred between 4 vinylbenzoic acid 4vina and the template molecule followed by itaconic acid ia the binding energy between methacrylic acid maa and cbz ranked at approximately the middle of the 10 systems tested fig 3 therefore the magnetic imprinted adsorbents 4vina mip ia mip and maa mip and the corresponding non imprinted adsorbents 4vina nip ia nip and maa nip were synthesized for the practical experimentation and the adsorption capacity and selectivity ability of these adsorbents were compared 3 2 characterization of imprinted adsorbents and analysis of their adsorption properties 3 2 1 characterization of physical and chemical properties fig 4 shows the scanning electron microscopy sem of the cbz mips prepared with different monomers 4vina ia and maa the synthesized cbz mips used were gray black to black powders which could be uniformly dispersed in aqueous solution see supporting information figure s1 the adsorbents prepared using 4vina and ia as monomers were larger in size table 1 suggesting that these monomers were easier to bind with the template it was deduced that hydrogen bonds could form between ia molecules leading to thicker imprinting layers however this might lead to the presence of more deeply embedded imprinting sites in both the 4vina mip and ia mip than those formed in the maa mip the specific surface area increased after modification with sio2 and imprinting and this can be attributed to the decrease in fe3o4 aggregation which is beneficial for application in adsorption the infrared spectra of the nano fe3o4 fe3o4 sio2 4vina mip ia mip and maa mip fig 5 were investigated in both the fe3o4 and fe3o4 sio2 spectra the absorption peak near 540 cm 1 is the absorption peak of an fe o bond and the asymmetric stretching vibration peak observed in the fe3o4 sio2 spectra near 1063 cm 1 is the absorption peak of a si o si bond demonstrating that the surface of the nano fe3o4 particles were successfully coated with sio2 in the spectrum of the adsorbents the contractive vibration peak of the co bond in the carboxyl group of the functional monomers ia and maa is seen near 1724 cm 1 and the contractive vibration peak of the 4vina carboxyl group is at 1701 cm 1 because the co bond of the carboxyl group in 4vina is connected with the benzene ring and conjugated the vibration frequency is displaced towards lower frequencies in addition the absorption peak of 1047 cm 1 seen in the ia mip spectrum is due to the stretching vibration peak of an open chain aliphatic anhydride c o c bond this absorption peak was not observed in either maa mip or 4vina mip so it is assumed that the two carboxyl groups in the ia molecule were liable to dehydration and condensation forming anhydride the cc bond absorption peak seen at approximately 1638 cm 1 the c h in plane bending vibration peak near 1388 cm 1 and the symmetric extension vibration peak of the saturated c h bond near 2954 cm 1 are all produced by the crosslinker egdma and the monomer and the c o c bond absorption peak near 1146 cm 1 is from the crosslinker the functional groups of the monomers and crosslinkers were observed on the surface of the fe3o4 sio2 carrier after thermal polymerization confirming the presence of an imprinted layer of polymer around the carrier 3 2 2 isothermal adsorption analysis isothermal adsorption fig 6 showed that the maximum capacity for the adsorption of 4vina mip ia mip and maa mip onto cbz was 28 40 17 24 and 10 17 mg g respectively 4vina mip has also been observed to have a higher adsorption capacity than that of maa mip prepared under similar testing conditions in previous studies 5 mg g lee et al 2014 the removal rate of cbz by 4vina mip was greater than 98 while the highest removal rates of ia mip and maa mip were only 50 and 34 respectively the preferential order of removal by the functional monomers was consistent with the results of the molecular simulation both the removal rate and adsorption of cbz by the mips were higher than those of the nips which implies that the non specific adsorption affinity of nips is relatively weak the langmuir and freundlich adsorption models were applied to process the data the fitting parameters used can be seen in table s2 of the supporting information the isothermal adsorption was better fitted using the freundlich adsorption model r2 0 985 than the langmuir model suggesting that the distribution of adsorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent was not uniform yeşilova et al 2018 and neither was the adsorption energy 3 2 3 adsorption kinetics analysis the experimental results of the adsorption kinetics are shown in fig 7 the adsorption capacity of the mips and nips increased rapidly in the first few minutes reached an equilibrium at approximately 20 min and increased slowly after that of the three mips maa mip and 4vina mip reached adsorption equilibrium most rapidly after 30 min the concentration of the residual cbz remained constant the adsorption by ia mip then reached equilibrium after approximately 40 min this adsorption process was in accordance with the pseudo second order kinetic model r2 0 996 table 3 of supporting information equilibrium occurred faster using the nips than the mips presumably because some of the imprinted sites were embedded into the core shell of the mips sharma et al 2019 and the imprinting holes left by the cbz after elution formed channels for internal diffusion some cbz molecules would therefore have penetrated through the adsorbent to bind with the monomers however no such imprinting holes are present in the nips meaning that less cbz diffused into the inner layer the adsorption tended to take place mainly at the exposed non imprinted sites on the surface of the nips meaning that the binding reached equilibrium more quickly it has previously been reported gao et al 2016 that the adsorption equilibrium of cbz using granular activated carbon occurs after approximately 24 h under a similar dosage and with pollutants present in the effluent at 20 min the adsorption capacity of granular activated carbon to cbz 2 8 mg g is much lower than that of 4vina mip and ia mip this fast adsorption rate laid the foundation for the practical application of imprinted adsorbents in water treatment it was also found that although ia mip had a higher adsorption capacity for cbz than maa mip the reaction rate of maa mip was faster therefore the molecular simulation calculation succeeded in revealing the affinity between template and monomers in a static structure but it was difficult to predict the reaction rate of the adsorption 3 2 4 adsorption selectivity analysis the greatest advantage of imprinted adsorbents over other adsorbents lies in their adsorptive specificity competitive adsorption experiments were carried out using the structurally similar ocbz as interference fig 8 with stereo holes that matched the shape structure and functional groups of cbz 4vina mip and ia mip exhibited a high specific recognition ability for cbz in both the ultra pure water and the filter effluent imprinting factor α 2 selective factor β 2 5 table 2 which was higher than that of maa mip the imprinting factor α was highest in 4vina mip but the selection factor β in this adsorbent was lower than that of ia mip it may be that 4vina cbz and ocbz all contain benzene rings so the affinity of 4vina mip to ocbz is higher than that of ia mip due to the π π stacking the imprinting factor and selective factor of the mips increased even in the filter effluent it was assumed that while the adsorption capacity of 4vina nip to cbz decreased significantly by 17 02 in the control group due to the co existing pollutants in the filter effluent the adsorption capacity of 4vina mip could be maintained at 27 65 mg g with only a slight decrease 2 65 the adsorption capacity of ia mip and maa mip in the filter effluent also decreased only slightly by 3 85 and 4 97 respectively in general the adsorption selectivity of 4vina mip and ia mip on cbz was better than that of maa mip which is in line with expectations 3 2 5 analysis of the regeneration performance during the 10 elution adsorption cycles fig 9 the adsorption capacity of 4vina mip ia mip and maa mip decreased slightly to 27 740 mg g by 2 33 16 962 mg g by 1 64 and 9 554 mg g by 6 07 respectively the structural stability of ia mip and 4vina mip is higher which can better meet the requirements of adsorbent for use in water treatment the experiments above showed that 4vina mip and ia mip have a better performance in terms of adsorption and thus the specific adsorption mechanisms were investigated 3 3 adsorption mechanism 3 3 1 interaction force between cbz and the monomers it is possible that a van der waals force electrostatic force hydrogen bond or a long distance interaction force sun et al 2019 exists between the cbz and the three functional monomers the calculation of the energy within the imprinting system table 3 demonstrated that no significant difference occurs in the long distance forces interacting between 4vina ia or maa and cbz the difference was mainly derived via the van der waals and electrostatic forces which contributed most to the specific adsorption the electrostatic force was greatest between ia and cbz which indicates that extensive hydrogen bonding is involved in the imprinting system while the van der waals force was greatest between 4vina and cbz suggesting that π π conjugation occurs between the two the determination of the presence of hydrogen bonds by molecular simulation fig 10 revealed that there may be four sites that are beneficial for hydrogen bond formation in the ia mip imprinting system the h in the carboxyl group of the ia molecule could act as an electron donor and form a hydrogen bond with the o within the co from the amino group of the cbz the o in the carboxyl group of the ia molecule could act as electron acceptor and form a hydrogen bond with the h from the amino group of the cbz the hydrogen bond formation between 4vina and cbz was similar to that of ia cbz in addition the ia molecule contains two carboxylic groups which makes it easier to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds between two ia molecules thus contributing to the formation of relatively stable imprinting holes it is speculated that ia mip has better reproducibility for this reason the 4vina and maa molecules contain only one carboxyl group so once they have combined with cbz it becomes difficult to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the monomers themselves in the 4vina cbz imprinting system fig 10 b it was found that the structure of the benzene rings in cbz was close to that of those in 4vina meaning that π π conjugations may have occurred sun et al 2020 quantum mechanical analysis was thus performed on the electron cloud density to explore the possible interaction between the benzene rings overlapping electron clouds were observed between the benzene rings of 4vina and cbz fig 11 differential charge density fig 12 analysis further illustrated that the 2p orbitals of the carbon atom in the benzene rings overlapped and that the density of the electron cloud between the benzene rings increased after the monomers were combined with the template i e there was a π π conjugation of the benzene rings 3 3 2 simulation and analysis of ultraviolet spectrum in order to confirm the existence of intermolecular forces between the monomers and the cbz the uv spectra of cbz 4vina and cbz ia 1 4 n n were calculated theoretically and then measured experimentally figs 13 and 14 d and 15 d experimental examination showed that new absorption peaks appeared at 202 and 207 nm in the cbz ia mixtures but there was no obvious displacement in the ultraviolet absorption peaks of the benzene rings near 283 nm suggesting that the binding sites of the cbz ia mixtures were not on the benzene rings in the cbz 4vina system new absorption peaks appeared at 208 270 and 276 nm and the absorption peaks of the functional groups on the benzene rings also shifted confirming the existence of a π π conjugation between cbz and 4vina which was consistent with the results of the previous analysis in conclusion the interaction between cbz and the monomers did exist and new absorption systems were formed the absorption peaks of the cbz and ia aqueous solutions was calculated successfully by molecular simulation with a maximum error of only 8 and 1 respectively the absorption peak for 4vina was accurately predicted at 262 nm the molecular simulation could well predict the ultraviolet spectrum of the three singular substances in aqueous solution however the simulation of the ultraviolet spectra of the mixed solutions 1 4 n n was not ideal only the absorption peaks of the 4vina cbz aqueous solutions were calculated correctly at 276 nm fig 15 d to find the reason for the inconsistency between simulation and experiment several low energy conformations with different template monomer ratios 1 1 1 4 n n were selected to simulate the ultraviolet spectra the results showed that new absorption peaks would appear when the monomers were bound with cbz and the positions of these absorption peaks were affected by the binding ratio and conformations the absorption peaks of the ia and cbz complexes were predicted to be in the range of 190 227 nm and the absorption peaks of the 4vina and cbz complexes were predicted to be at approximately 193 nm and in the range of 251 279 nm based on the conclusions above the reason for the inconsistency between the calculation made from the simulation and the measurement of the absorption peaks can be inferred by the following cbz could not bind with the monomers at a single ratio of 1 4 when identified by the adsorbents ratios of 1 1 1 2 1 3 and more intricate binding modes were also present even at the same binding ratio multiple recognition conformations may have been present therefore in this study the average binding energy from all three stable structures was used to evaluate the preferential order of the monomers so as to reduce the randomness of the simulation result the new absorption peaks observed were most probably the result of the co existence of various recognition conformations at different binding ratios for example the absorption peak of 4vina cbz at 270 nm was probably from conformation 1 at a binding ration of 1 3 fig 15 c predicted peak value of 269 nm furthermore semi imprinted or non imprinted adsorption sites were formed when the monomers bound with the template at a low ratio this also induced the uneven distribution of the adsorption energies and adsorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent which was consistent with the conclusions made from the freundlich adsorption isotherm model 3 3 3 infrared spectrum analysis before and after adsorption the infrared spectra of the adsorbents before and after adsorption were analyzed with the results shown in fig 16 the in plane bending vibration peaks of the amide oc n at 646 and 610 cm 1 suggest that cbz was adsorbed onto the surface of the mips in addition the stretching vibration peak of ia anhydride c o c was displaced from 1047 cm 1 to 1029 cm 1 the bending absorption peak of the carboxylic acid oh bond shifted from 960 cm 1 to 951 cm 1 and the peak of the co bond absorption in the carboxylic acid also shifted from 1724 cm 1 to 1720 cm 1 which may be due to the formation of a hydrogen bond between the ia carboxyl group and the cbz amino group for similar reasons the angular vibration peak of the carboxyl coo shifted from 756 cm 1 to 768 cm 1 in the 4vina spectrum the vibration peaks of the 4vina benzene ring skeleton shifted from 1485 cm 1 and 1443 cm 1 to 1488 cm 1 and 1438 cm 1 respectively and the π π conjugation between benzene rings was speculated as the contributor which further confirms the analysis of the hydrogen bonds and electron clouds by molecular simulation as mentioned above 4 conclusion and prospects the functional monomers of the imprinted adsorbent were optimized using a simulated annealing algorithm the pursuit of different conformations over a broader scope was carried out which provided theoretical guidance for the preparation of cbz mip the binding energy between 4vina and cbz proved to be the strongest the adsorption capacity of 4vina mip reached 28 40 mg g which was higher than that of both ia mip 17 24 mg g and maa mip 10 17 mg g and thus the performance of cbz mip was improved significantly the adsorption was in conformity with the freundlich isothermal model and the pseudo second order kinetic model and equilibrium was almost reached within 30 min in the specimens prepared with ultra pure water and filter effluent both 4vina mip and ia mip were found to have a strong specific recognition for the target pollutant the experimental results were in line with the molecular simulation and the micro mechanism of the adsorption process was explored hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl group and the amide and the π π conjugation of the benzene rings both contributed significantly to the specific recognition the displacement of the absorption peaks of the carboxyl group and benzene rings was observed by infrared spectroscopy scanning after adsorption which confirmed the conclusions made via the molecular simulation it is thought that monomers containing both benzene and carboxyl groups may possess an excellent affinity for binding with aromatic pollutants containing amides groups as well as for cbz imprinted adsorbents prepared with such monomers are thought to be able to remove these pollutants for instance dye congo red herbicide 2 methyl 6 ethylaniline etc with high efficiency it is reasonable to assume that if monomers which contain multiple benzene rings and carboxyl groups were to be utilized during the preparation of mip the adsorption capacity toward amino containing aromatic pollutants would be further enhanced such molecules are expected to be synthesized in future researches the formation of a new system of interaction between the template and monomers was confirmed by theoretical simulation and the experimental measurement of uv spectra a complex range of binding ratios and adsorption conformations may exist future researches might optimize the conditions for the preparation of mips so that more morphologically precise and orderly molecular recognition sites can be formed further inhibiting non imprinted adsorption and improving the specific recognition ability on the basis of this study declaration of competing interest the

18408,carbamazepine cbz is a typical pharmaceutical residue commonly found in aqueous environments but its removal through activated carbon or advanced oxidation processes is often disrupted by co existing organic matter an imprinting system which consisted of the target pollutant cbz template molecule and 10 different kinds of functional monomers was constructed via molecular simulation to screen for appropriate monomers thereby addressing cbz removal disruptions an annealing method simulation was used to search for stable low energy conformations of the template monomer interaction system to calculate the binding energy of these different monomers with cbz the order of binding affinity calculated was 4 vinylbenzoic acid itaconic acid methacrylic acid which was consistent with the experimental observations the adsorption capacity of the molecular imprinted polymer mip prepared using 4 vinylbenzoic acid reached 28 40 mg g and the imprinting factor reached 2 72 the simulation and measurement of the ultraviolet spectrum of the imprinting system showed that a new interaction system was formed between the template and monomers and that multiple binding conformations between them took place when specific recognition occurred energy calculation and hydrogen bond analysis revealed that the van der waals force including the π π conjugate and electrostatic forces including hydrogen bonding played an important role during selective adsorption which was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords molecular imprinting molecular

detected in aqueous environment over the past few years berndt et al 2018 martínez alcalá et al 2018 cbz is refractory chen et al 2015 in aqueous environments and can be ingested by humans via the food chain garcía et al 2018 and drinking water benotti et al 2009 wee and aris 2017 the risks associated with cbz have been acknowledged for some time ebele et al 2017 malarvizhi et al 2012 but traditional methods used to treat drinking water such as activated carbon adsorption varga et al 2019 cannot remove cbz efficiently the removal rate of cbz using advanced oxidation processes such as photocatalysis with titanium dioxide or the fenton reaction can reach more than 98 ali et al 2018 zhen et al 2018 but poor selectivity for the target pollutant zhang et al 2019 often leads to a sharp drop in the removal efficiency under interference from competitive pollutants bo et al 2019 similar drawbacks have been observed using modified adsorbents such as carbon nanotubes lerman et al 2013 and cyclodextrin polymers zhou et al 2019 as the adsorption process is significantly disturbed by co existing matter meaning that target pollutants with greater environmental hazards cannot be removed preferentially chen et al 2017 this defect has limited the practical application of such technologies molecular imprinting technology mit provides a cost effective and easy to use solution for the selective removal of specific pollutants in a complex water environment with imprinting holes that precisely match the stereo structure of the template molecule i e the target pollutant the molecular imprinted polymer mip can specifically identify and adsorb a pollutant under the most difficult circumstances chen et al 2016 at present mips are mostly used for the separation extraction and detection of substances in the field of chromatography some attempts have been made to remove heavy metals önnby et al 2012 dyes ng et al 2017 xenoestrogens ren et al 2014 and endocrine disruptors pereira et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 from water using mips water treatment processing requires not only the highly specific recognition but also an excellent adsorption capacity a fast reaction rate reliable capability for re use and the biological safety of the imprinted adsorbents in aqueous phase the functional monomer which is the site that directly recognizes the template has a significant impact on adsorption performance li et al 2018 selecting the preferred monomers according to the properties of the target pollutant is an important way in which the performance of adsorbents can be improved in previous studies methacrylic acid maa has been most frequently used to synthesize cbz mip with an optimum cbz to maa ratio of 1 4 n n esfandyari manesh et al 2012 lee et al 2014 almost all of the synthesized polymers developed have so far been used for the detection of substances asgari et al 2017 and no reports have been made concerning the optimization of cbz mip monomers however conventional experiments to screen for the optimal monomer are usually erratic and time consuming molecular simulation can help to overcome this drawback molecular simulation can be used to explore molecular structure and behavior in depth and thus predict the physical and chemical properties of a system the use of this method therefore has excellent potential in optimizing conditions for the preparation of mips bakas et al 2013 the preference of a monomer is usually judged by calculating the binding energy of the monomer with its template in a stable low energy conformation monomers with greater binding energy are generally preferred yu et al 2019 however the potential surface of a template monomer interaction system is so complicated with many local energy minima and one global minimum that the conformation with the lowest potential energy is difficult to find in previous research search methods concerning the local optimum have usually been used to find stable conformations marć et al 2018 however the low energy molecules so far obtained are greatly influenced by the initial position of the template monomer and the local energy minimum point tends to be near the initial structure yun et al 2010 an algorithm to simulate annealing could help to overcome this defect during annealing the temperature of the local environment rises and falls alternately in a dynamic process the high temperature period enables monomers with sufficient kinetic energy to cross the energy barrier from a local minimum point to interact with the template from different positions and orientations this overcomes the shortcomings of the existing search method in which the conformations were prone to fall into local potential wells simulated annealing expands the search for useable conformations and therefore helps to obtain the optimum global conformation at which adsorption occurs however no research has yet been carried out concerning the use of simulated annealing in the design of mips in this study a simulated annealing algorithm was for the first time applied to search for the low energy conformation of a specific template monomer and the binding energy was then calculated based on the conformation observed in order to determine the preferred monomer cbz mips were then synthesized using both the optimized monomers and the more traditional monomer methacrylic acid maa separately and their adsorption properties were compared the adsorption performance of the cbz mip prepared with the best monomer found using simulated annealing was expected to be improved as compared to the other monomers tested molecular simulation was also used to explore the micro mechanism by which the specific recognition process takes place the ultraviolet spectra of the imprinted system were also calculated theoretically and measured for the first time the adsorption mechanism was investigated from the perspectives of binding energy interaction force electron cloud density and binding conformations 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents nano fe3o4 50 300 nm carbamazepine cbz 98 0 oxcarbazepine ocbz 98 0 tetraethyl silicate teos 99 ammonia 25

liquid chromatography ultimate 3000 thermo fisher co usa a fourier transform infrared spectrometer nicolet is5 thermo fisher co usa and an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer specord 200 plus analytik jena instrument co ltd germany were used to carry out the processes described in the following sections 2 3 selection of functional monomers by molecular simulation the molecular simulation was carried out using the materials studio 8 0 software platform the simulated imprinted system consisted of cbz and 10 different functional monomers the ratio of cbz to the monomers was 10 40 n n an annealing simulation was carried out based on the compass force field a total of 60 annealing cycles with a time step of 1 fs were carried out the global optimal conformation can theoretically be spotted if sufficient time is allowed the temperature of the environment during annealing is another important parameter as it represents a trade off between a system with too much kinetic energy where the molecules tend to escape from the simulation system and a system with too little kinetic energy for the molecules to cross the energy barrier the highest and lowest annealing temperatures were therefore set at 600 k and 300 k with 10 heating and cooling ramps per cycle to allow the temperature to change in a uniform manner the simulation produced a total of 60 low energy conformations at the end of the annealing and was followed by a more delicate local optimization to confirm the low energy status of the conformations discovered the average binding energy between the template and the monomer was then calculated for the conformations found with the three lowest potential energies binding energy is calculated as follows 1 e binding e total e template e monomer where ebinding is the binding energy between the template cbz and monomers etotal is the total energy of the template and the monomers etemplate is the energy of the template cbz and emonomer is the energy of the monomers 2 4 preparation of magnetic carrier fe3o4 sio2 nano scale fe3o4 was utilized as an adsorbent carrier for the rapid separation of the cbz mip systems from the water nano fe3o4 can readily aggregate in aqueous solution wang et al 2019 and coating with silica allows for a more uniform dispersal chellappa and vijayalakshmi 2019 for the experiment 4 2 g of nanometer sized fe3o4 particles 100 ml ethanol 6 ml water and 6 ml ammonia were added to a 250 ml flask following 2 min of ultrasonic dispersion 3 ml of teos and 30 ml of ethanol were added to the solution the mixture was then stirred ultrasonically at 25 c for 30 min and agitated mechanically at room temperature for 16 h the obtained solid fe3o4 sio2 particles via this process were then washed three times alternatively using ethanol and water the nanoparticles were then separated using a magnet and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 c for 48 h 2 5 preparation of the cbz mip 60 ml methanol acetonitrile 1 1 v v mixture 4 mmol monomers including both the traditional monomer maa and the other monomers selected and 1 mmol of template cbz were added to a 100 ml flask after ultrasonic dispersion at 25 khz for 30 min the solution was placed in cool dry environment for 12 h to pre polymerize 0 5 g of the carrier fe3o4 sio2 20 mmol of the crosslinker egdma and 0 06 g initiator aibn were then added to the pre polymerized solution after 15 min of ultrasonic dispersion in an ice water bath nitrogen was flushed into the flask for 40 min to remove a sufficient amount of oxygen and the reaction system was then sealed the solution was agitated for 24 h at 400 r min and 62 c for thermal polymerization the product was then separated using a magnet and washed with methanol and ultra pure water the template cbz was eluted away from the product using a 100 ml methanol acetic acid solution 9 1 v v the elution lasted for three days with the eluent renewed three times per day after washing the product with methanol and ultra pure water and drying in a vacuum at 50 c for 24 h cbz mip was obtained the non imprinted polymer nip was prepared in a similar manner but without the addition of cbz during preparation 2 6 adsorption performance of mips the performance of the mips was evaluated and compared 10 mg of the imprinted adsorbents prepared using the different monomers were added separately to 30 ml of cbz aqueous solution in a 50 ml conical flask the initial cbz concentration ranged from 200 μg l to 10 mg l the mixture was shaken on the platform of a reciprocating incubator at 200 r min for 2 h at room temperature after magnetic separation the supernatant was collected and then filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon membrane followed by hplc analysis of the residual cbz concentration the adsorption amount q and removal rate η were calculated as follows 2 q c 0 c e v m 3 η c 0 c e c 0 100 where q is the adsorption capacity mg g c 0 is the initial concentration of pollutants mg l c e is the equilibrium concentration of pollutants mg l v is the volume of the solution l and m is the mass of the adsorbent g langmuir and freundlich models were used to describe the adsorption isotherm using the following

mg k f is the freundlich constant and 1 n is the non uniform factor the adsorption kinetics were also investigated by adding 10 mg adsorbent to 30 ml and 10 mg l cbz solutions the concentration of residual cbz was tested at 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 15 30 and 40 min pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were then used to explicate the adsorption kinetics 6 ln q e q t ln

constant min 1 and k 2 is the pseudo second order kinetic constant g mg 1 min 1 the selectivity of the mips and nips was investigated using oxcarbazepine ocbz a compound with a similar structure to cbz as a competitive pollutant fig 1 10 mg of the adsorbent was added to 30 ml cbz and ocbz solutions at 10 mg l the concentration of pollutants in the supernatant was analyzed after 2 h of oscillation under the constant temperature of 25 c considering that the use of mip adsorption for treating drinking water would follow the filtration process the specimen was prepared using both ultra pure water and filter effluent from a drinking water treatment plant the imprinting factor α and selective factor β were applied as indicators to describe the selectivity of the adsorbents the higher

the imprinting factor of the target pollutant and αc is the imprinting factor of the competitive pollutants the adsorbents were regenerated using a methanol acetic acid mixture 9 1 v v 10 mg of the regenerated adsorbent was then added to the 30 ml cbz solution at 10 mg l for adsorption after 6 h the amount of adsorption that had taken place was calculated a total of 10 adsorption elution regeneration cycles were carried out 2 7 the adsorption mechanism in order to ascertain the mechanism by which adsorption takes place electron density analysis of the monomer template system was conducted this calculation is carried out using quantum mechanics and the amount of calculation required increases exponentially with the number of atoms concerned this means that this calculation is difficult to compute with regards to a system that contains a large number of atoms an imprinting system with a monomer template ratio of 1 1 n n was therefore reestablished to perform the electron density calculation the density functional used was gga pbe using the ts method for dft d correction the molecular simulation of the uv spectra of an imprinted system was performed on cbz only monomers only and a mixture of both when the selective recognition actually occurs the template cannot completely react with the monomers at a ratio of 1 4 as was initially injected in the polymerization stage the optical properties of the template monomer mixture were therefore calculated at ratios between 1 1 and 1 4 the density functional used was gga pbe and the effects of using water as the solvent were taken into consideration 2 8 measurement of ultraviolet and infrared spectra and conditions of hplc the ultraviolet spectrum of 10 mg l 42 3 μmol l cbz solution 169 2 μmol l functional monomer solution and the corresponding template monomer mixture 1 4 n n was examined at wavelengths between 190 and 500 nm fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was used to scan both the dried carrier and the adsorbents for the determination of pollutants by high performance liquid chromatography an injection volume of 20 μl a column temperature of 35 c and the waters pah c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm were used the wavelength used to detect cbz was 285 nm the mobile phase was acetonitrile ultrapure water mixture 60 40 v v and the flow rate was 0 9 ml min while ocbz was detected at a wavelength of 254 nm with a methanol ultrapure water mixture 1 1 v v mobile phase and a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 3 results and discussion 3 1 selected monomers by molecular simulation in the simulated annealing process the temperature and energy of the system changed as seen in fig 2 during each annealing cycle the ambient temperature rose from 300 k to 600 k and then decreased again to 300 k and the energy of the imprinting system fluctuated periodically in response the rise in temperature led to an increase in kinetic energy so that the molecules could overcome the steric hindrance and be able to combine from various angles and orientations every time the temperature dropped to 300 k a low energy conformation was output the initial structure had the highest potential energy and was unstable the energy decreased rapidly from 14600 kj mol to 14800 kj mol after one annealing treatment and geometry optimization after several cycles the energy was observed to decrease gradually from 14800 kj mol to below 15000 kj mol and fluctuated continuously within this range the binding capacity of 10 different kinds of functional monomers to cbz is given in table s1 of the supporting information the results of the simulation indicated that the greatest binding energy occurred between 4 vinylbenzoic acid 4vina and the template molecule followed by itaconic acid ia the binding energy between methacrylic acid maa and cbz ranked at approximately the middle of the 10 systems tested fig 3 therefore the magnetic imprinted adsorbents 4vina mip ia mip and maa mip and the corresponding non imprinted adsorbents 4vina nip ia nip and maa nip were synthesized for the practical experimentation and the adsorption capacity and selectivity ability of these adsorbents were compared 3 2 characterization of imprinted adsorbents and analysis of their adsorption properties 3 2 1 characterization of physical and chemical properties fig 4 shows the scanning electron microscopy sem of the cbz mips prepared with different monomers 4vina ia and maa the synthesized cbz mips used were gray black to black powders which could be uniformly dispersed in aqueous solution see supporting information figure s1 the adsorbents prepared using 4vina and ia as monomers were larger in size table 1 suggesting that these monomers were easier to bind with the template it was deduced that hydrogen bonds could form between ia molecules leading to thicker imprinting layers however this might lead to the presence of more deeply embedded imprinting sites in both the 4vina mip and ia mip than those formed in the maa mip the specific surface area increased after modification with sio2 and imprinting and this can be attributed to the decrease in fe3o4 aggregation which is beneficial for application in adsorption the infrared spectra of the nano fe3o4 fe3o4 sio2 4vina mip ia mip and maa mip fig 5 were investigated in both the fe3o4 and fe3o4 sio2 spectra the absorption peak near 540 cm 1 is the absorption peak of an fe o bond and the asymmetric stretching vibration peak observed in the fe3o4 sio2 spectra near 1063 cm 1 is the absorption peak of a si o si bond demonstrating that the surface of the nano fe3o4 particles were successfully coated with sio2 in the spectrum of the adsorbents the contractive vibration peak of the co bond in the carboxyl group of the functional monomers ia and maa is seen near 1724 cm 1 and the contractive vibration peak of the 4vina carboxyl group is at 1701 cm 1 because the co bond of the carboxyl group in 4vina is connected with the benzene ring and conjugated the vibration frequency is displaced towards lower frequencies in addition the absorption peak of 1047 cm 1 seen in the ia mip spectrum is due to the stretching vibration peak of an open chain aliphatic anhydride c o c bond this absorption peak was not observed in either maa mip or 4vina mip so it is assumed that the two carboxyl groups in the ia molecule were liable to dehydration and condensation forming anhydride the cc bond absorption peak seen at approximately 1638 cm 1 the c h in plane bending vibration peak near 1388 cm 1 and the symmetric extension vibration peak of the saturated c h bond near 2954 cm 1 are all produced by the crosslinker egdma and the monomer and the c o c bond absorption peak near 1146 cm 1 is from the crosslinker the functional groups of the monomers and crosslinkers were observed on the surface of the fe3o4 sio2 carrier after thermal polymerization confirming the presence of an imprinted layer of polymer around the carrier 3 2 2 isothermal adsorption analysis isothermal adsorption fig 6 showed that the maximum capacity for the adsorption of 4vina mip ia mip and maa mip onto cbz was 28 40 17 24 and 10 17 mg g respectively 4vina mip has also been observed to have a higher adsorption capacity than that of maa mip prepared under similar testing conditions in previous studies 5 mg g lee et al 2014 the removal rate of cbz by 4vina mip was greater than 98 while the highest removal rates of ia mip and maa mip were only 50 and 34 respectively the preferential order of removal by the functional monomers was consistent with the results of the molecular simulation both the removal rate and adsorption of cbz by the mips were higher than those of the nips which implies that the non specific adsorption affinity of nips is relatively weak the langmuir and freundlich adsorption models were applied to process the data the fitting parameters used can be seen in table s2 of the supporting information the isothermal adsorption was better fitted using the freundlich adsorption model r2 0 985 than the langmuir model suggesting that the distribution of adsorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent was not uniform yeşilova et al 2018 and neither was the adsorption energy 3 2 3 adsorption kinetics analysis the experimental results of the adsorption kinetics are shown in fig 7 the adsorption capacity of the mips and nips increased rapidly in the first few minutes reached an equilibrium at approximately 20 min and increased slowly after that of the three mips maa mip and 4vina mip reached adsorption equilibrium most rapidly after 30 min the concentration of the residual cbz remained constant the adsorption by ia mip then reached equilibrium after approximately 40 min this adsorption process was in accordance with the pseudo second order kinetic model r2 0 996 table 3 of supporting information equilibrium occurred faster using the nips than the mips presumably because some of the imprinted sites were embedded into the core shell of the mips sharma et al 2019 and the imprinting holes left by the cbz after elution formed channels for internal diffusion some cbz molecules would therefore have penetrated through the adsorbent to bind with the monomers however no such imprinting holes are present in the nips meaning that less cbz diffused into the inner layer the adsorption tended to take place mainly at the exposed non imprinted sites on the surface of the nips meaning that the binding reached equilibrium more quickly it has previously been reported gao et al 2016 that the adsorption equilibrium of cbz using granular activated carbon occurs after approximately 24 h under a similar dosage and with pollutants present in the effluent at 20 min the adsorption capacity of granular activated carbon to cbz 2 8 mg g is much lower than that of 4vina mip and ia mip this fast adsorption rate laid the foundation for the practical application of imprinted adsorbents in water treatment it was also found that although ia mip had a higher adsorption capacity for cbz than maa mip the reaction rate of maa mip was faster therefore the molecular simulation calculation succeeded in revealing the affinity between template and monomers in a static structure but it was difficult to predict the reaction rate of the adsorption 3 2 4 adsorption selectivity analysis the greatest advantage of imprinted adsorbents over other adsorbents lies in their adsorptive specificity competitive adsorption experiments were carried out using the structurally similar ocbz as interference fig 8 with stereo holes that matched the shape structure and functional groups of cbz 4vina mip and ia mip exhibited a high specific recognition ability for cbz in both the ultra pure water and the filter effluent imprinting factor α 2 selective factor β 2 5 table 2 which was higher than that of maa mip the imprinting factor α was highest in 4vina mip but the selection factor β in this adsorbent was lower than that of ia mip it may be that 4vina cbz and ocbz all contain benzene rings so the affinity of 4vina mip to ocbz is higher than that of ia mip due to the π π stacking the imprinting factor and selective factor of the mips increased even in the filter effluent it was assumed that while the adsorption capacity of 4vina nip to cbz decreased significantly by 17 02 in the control group due to the co existing pollutants in the filter effluent the adsorption capacity of 4vina mip could be maintained at 27 65 mg g with only a slight decrease 2 65 the adsorption capacity of ia mip and maa mip in the filter effluent also decreased only slightly by 3 85 and 4 97 respectively in general the adsorption selectivity of 4vina mip and ia mip on cbz was better than that of maa mip which is in line with expectations 3 2 5 analysis of the regeneration performance during the 10 elution adsorption cycles fig 9 the adsorption capacity of 4vina mip ia mip and maa mip decreased slightly to 27 740 mg g by 2 33 16 962 mg g by 1 64 and 9 554 mg g by 6 07 respectively the structural stability of ia mip and 4vina mip is higher which can better meet the requirements of adsorbent for use in water treatment the experiments above showed that 4vina mip and ia mip have a better performance in terms of adsorption and thus the specific adsorption mechanisms were investigated 3 3 adsorption mechanism 3 3 1 interaction force between cbz and the monomers it is possible that a van der waals force electrostatic force hydrogen bond or a long distance interaction force sun et al 2019 exists between the cbz and the three functional monomers the calculation of the energy within the imprinting system table 3 demonstrated that no significant difference occurs in the long distance forces interacting between 4vina ia or maa and cbz the difference was mainly derived via the van der waals and electrostatic forces which contributed most to the specific adsorption the electrostatic force was greatest between ia and cbz which indicates that extensive hydrogen bonding is involved in the imprinting system while the van der waals force was greatest between 4vina and cbz suggesting that π π conjugation occurs between the two the determination of the presence of hydrogen bonds by molecular simulation fig 10 revealed that there may be four sites that are beneficial for hydrogen bond formation in the ia mip imprinting system the h in the carboxyl group of the ia molecule could act as an electron donor and form a hydrogen bond with the o within the co from the amino group of the cbz the o in the carboxyl group of the ia molecule could act as electron acceptor and form a hydrogen bond with the h from the amino group of the cbz the hydrogen bond formation between 4vina and cbz was similar to that of ia cbz in addition the ia molecule contains two carboxylic groups which makes it easier to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds between two ia molecules thus contributing to the formation of relatively stable imprinting holes it is speculated that ia mip has better reproducibility for this reason the 4vina and maa molecules contain only one carboxyl group so once they have combined with cbz it becomes difficult to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the monomers themselves in the 4vina cbz imprinting system fig 10 b it was found that the structure of the benzene rings in cbz was close to that of those in 4vina meaning that π π conjugations may have occurred sun et al 2020 quantum mechanical analysis was thus performed on the electron cloud density to explore the possible interaction between the benzene rings overlapping electron clouds were observed between the benzene rings of 4vina and cbz fig 11 differential charge density fig 12 analysis further illustrated that the 2p orbitals of the carbon atom in the benzene rings overlapped and that the density of the electron cloud between the benzene rings increased after the monomers were combined with the template i e there was a π π conjugation of the benzene rings 3 3 2 simulation and analysis of ultraviolet spectrum in order to confirm the existence of intermolecular forces between the monomers and the cbz the uv spectra of cbz 4vina and cbz ia 1 4 n n were calculated theoretically and then measured experimentally figs 13 and 14 d and 15 d experimental examination showed that new absorption peaks appeared at 202 and 207 nm in the cbz ia mixtures but there was no obvious displacement in the ultraviolet absorption peaks of the benzene rings near 283 nm suggesting that the binding sites of the cbz ia mixtures were not on the benzene rings in the cbz 4vina system new absorption peaks appeared at 208 270 and 276 nm and the absorption peaks of the functional groups on the benzene rings also shifted confirming the existence of a π π conjugation between cbz and 4vina which was consistent with the results of the previous analysis in conclusion the interaction between cbz and the monomers did exist and new absorption systems were formed the absorption peaks of the cbz and ia aqueous solutions was calculated successfully by molecular simulation with a maximum error of only 8 and 1 respectively the absorption peak for 4vina was accurately predicted at 262 nm the molecular simulation could well predict the ultraviolet spectrum of the three singular substances in aqueous solution however the simulation of the ultraviolet spectra of the mixed solutions 1 4 n n was not ideal only the absorption peaks of the 4vina cbz aqueous solutions were calculated correctly at 276 nm fig 15 d to find the reason for the inconsistency between simulation and experiment several low energy conformations with different template monomer ratios 1 1 1 4 n n were selected to simulate the ultraviolet spectra the results showed that new absorption peaks would appear when the monomers were bound with cbz and the positions of these absorption peaks were affected by the binding ratio and conformations the absorption peaks of the ia and cbz complexes were predicted to be in the range of 190 227 nm and the absorption peaks of the 4vina and cbz complexes were predicted to be at approximately 193 nm and in the range of 251 279 nm based on the conclusions above the reason for the inconsistency between the calculation made from the simulation and the measurement of the absorption peaks can be inferred by the following cbz could not bind with the monomers at a single ratio of 1 4 when identified by the adsorbents ratios of 1 1 1 2 1 3 and more intricate binding modes were also present even at the same binding ratio multiple recognition conformations may have been present therefore in this study the average binding energy from all three stable structures was used to evaluate the preferential order of the monomers so as to reduce the randomness of the simulation result the new absorption peaks observed were most probably the result of the co existence of various recognition conformations at different binding ratios for example the absorption peak of 4vina cbz at 270 nm was probably from conformation 1 at a binding ration of 1 3 fig 15 c predicted peak value of 269 nm furthermore semi imprinted or non imprinted adsorption sites were formed when the monomers bound with the template at a low ratio this also induced the uneven distribution of the adsorption energies and adsorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent which was consistent with the conclusions made from the freundlich adsorption isotherm model 3 3 3 infrared spectrum analysis before and after adsorption the infrared spectra of the adsorbents before and after adsorption were analyzed with the results shown in fig 16 the in plane bending vibration peaks of the amide oc n at 646 and 610 cm 1 suggest that cbz was adsorbed onto the surface of the mips in addition the stretching vibration peak of ia anhydride c o c was displaced from 1047 cm 1 to 1029 cm 1 the bending absorption peak of the carboxylic acid oh bond shifted from 960 cm 1 to 951 cm 1 and the peak of the co bond absorption in the carboxylic acid also shifted from 1724 cm 1 to 1720 cm 1 which may be due to the formation of a hydrogen bond between the ia carboxyl group and the cbz amino group for similar reasons the angular vibration peak of the carboxyl coo shifted from 756 cm 1 to 768 cm 1 in the 4vina spectrum the vibration peaks of the 4vina benzene ring skeleton shifted from 1485 cm 1 and 1443 cm 1 to 1488 cm 1 and 1438 cm 1 respectively and the π π conjugation between benzene rings was speculated as the contributor which further confirms the analysis of the hydrogen bonds and electron clouds by molecular simulation as mentioned above 4 conclusion and prospects the functional monomers of the imprinted adsorbent were optimized using a simulated annealing algorithm the pursuit of different conformations over a broader scope was carried out which provided theoretical guidance for the preparation of cbz mip the binding energy between 4vina and cbz proved to be the strongest the adsorption capacity of 4vina mip reached 28 40 mg g which was higher than that of both ia mip 17 24 mg g and maa mip 10 17 mg g and thus the performance of cbz mip was improved significantly the adsorption was in conformity with the freundlich isothermal model and the pseudo second order kinetic model and equilibrium was almost reached within 30 min in the specimens prepared with ultra pure water and filter effluent both 4vina mip and ia mip were found to have a strong specific recognition for the target pollutant the experimental results were in line with the molecular simulation and the micro mechanism of the adsorption process was explored hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl group and the amide and the π π conjugation of the benzene rings both contributed significantly to the specific recognition the displacement of the absorption peaks of the carboxyl group and benzene rings was observed by infrared spectroscopy scanning after adsorption which confirmed the conclusions made via the molecular simulation it is thought that monomers containing both benzene and carboxyl groups may possess an excellent affinity for binding with aromatic pollutants containing amides groups as well as for cbz imprinted adsorbents prepared with such monomers are thought to be able to remove these pollutants for instance dye congo red herbicide 2 methyl 6 ethylaniline etc with high efficiency it is reasonable to assume that if monomers which contain multiple benzene rings and carboxyl groups were to be utilized during the preparation of mip the adsorption capacity toward amino containing aromatic pollutants would be further enhanced such molecules are expected to be synthesized in future researches the formation of a new system of interaction between the template and monomers was confirmed by theoretical simulation and the experimental measurement of uv spectra a complex range of binding ratios and adsorption conformations may exist future researches might optimize the conditions for the preparation of mips so that more morphologically precise and orderly molecular recognition sites can be formed further inhibiting non imprinted adsorption and improving the specific recognition ability on the basis of this study declaration of competing interest the

concern around the application of vuv to drinking water treatment is the formation of nitrite during the vuv photolysis of nitrate containing water this is largely because the absorption coefficient of nitrate increases sharply at shorter wavelengths leading to the potential formation of nitrite nitrate and nitrite have been identified as harmful compounds towards human health the reduction of nitrate to nitrite has a major role in forming methemoglobin which results in a disease affecting infants and pregnant women commonly known as the blue baby syndrome or methemoglobinemia nitrate and

moussavi and mahdavianpour 2016 which could act as oh radical scavenger imoberdorf and mohseni 2011 and influence nitrite formation however studies on the formation of nitrite during vuv aop is absent more specifically the influence of major organic and inorganic solutes present in natural waters on nitrite formation during the uv vuv photolysis of nitrate containing water has not been investigated this research aimed to fill this gap and investigate the vuv photolysis of nitrate and the formation of nitrite in water matrices with different doc dic and dissolved oxygen do in addition the combined effects of doc and dic within a water matrix and their reaction mechanisms were also included in the investigation the mechanisms involved in the photolysis of nitrate and formation of nitrite under vuv irradiation especially in a water matrix with different constituents could be very complex to reach the goal of thorough mechanistic study it is necessary to determine the possible pathways for the photoreactions of nitrate to nitrite by reviewing and summarizing pervious research under different uv based aops three major possible pathways were identified as seen below all the potential reactions involved are presented in si section 9 first the oh radical is directly produced through the photolysis of water forming h e aq and ho getoff and schenck 1968 gonzalez and braun 1995 gonzalez et al 2004 zoschke et al 2014 the initial reactive species of h e aq and oh participate in chain reactions with nitrate gonzalez and braun 1995 since no 3 is not quite reactive with oh the formation of no 3 is negligible the produced no 3 h and no 3 2 further react with h 2 o decompose to no 2 and finally form nitrite gonzalez and braun 1995 mack and bolton 1999 image 2 the second primary reaction pathway is believed to result in the formation of peroxynitrite anion oono via isomerization of no 3 it is reported by madsen et al 2003 that 44 of the excited no 3 molecules return to the vibrationally equilibrated electronic ground state and 48 of the no 3 molecules isomerize to oono while the remaining 8 molecules dissociate to no o 2 goldstein and czapski 1997 madsen et al 2003 goldstein et al 2005 goldstein and rabani 2007 the formed peroxynitrite anion is a precursor of nitrite image 3 the last possible mechanism is direct photolysis of nitrate to produce no 2 and o atom or form nitrite radical and oh radical mack and bolton 1999 the quantum yield of nitrite at 254 nm is less than 0 001 mark et al 1996 mack and bolton 1999 lu et al 2009 however with the wavelength decreasing below 200 nm this pathway is no longer negligible for nitrite formation image 4 these three major pathways highly impact nitrite formation different nitrate concentrations various water solutes such as dissolved organic carbon and inorganic carbon and dissolved oxygen all take part in these reaction chains and increase the complexity of nitrate chemistry this research

then water quality parameters including ph doc alkalinity and uv absorbance at 254 nm were measured before the solution was irradiated in a vuv reactor set up fig s1 ph was always adjusted to 7 5 0 5 to reach neutral ph and eliminate the effect of ph in different water matrices doc and alkalinity were measured to confirm the initial concentration of samples which contained srnom as a source of doc and nahco3 as a source of dic absorbance at 254 nm was determined for uv actinometry water factor correction bolton and linden 2003 a cuvette starna cells inc atascadero ca usa with a stopper under vuv lamp was used to contain samples which was made by spectrosil quartz and allow penetration of wavelengths from 170 to 2700 nm the irradiation time was set at 20 40 60 80 and 100 min upon collection of the samples the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were analyzed by ion chromatography for a given water matrix the experiments were performed in triplicate and ion concentrations were identical within standard deviation of 5 maximum 2 3 photolysis experiments the vuv aop experiments were mainly conducted with a collimated beam bench scale reactor fig s1 equipped with a vacuum uv hg lamp emitting light at 80 90 254 nm 10 20 185 nm and a low percentage of visible this lamp was mounted in a sealed aluminum tubular and enclosed nitrogen purged chamber to provide the no oxygen atmosphere which guaranteed 185 nm wavelength irradiation a collimation tube was fitted under an aperture from lamp housing which measured 18 cm in length and 3 2 cm inner diameter samples were enclosed in a transparent synthetic quartz cuvette which has an interior diameter of 47 mm and the nominal volume of 17 0 ml and placed at the bottom of a uv vuv collimated beam apparatus a shutter of thick card was used via a slot in the shutter housing and operated manually in coordination with a timer to measure exposure times the distance from the bottom of shutter housing to the surface of the cuvette was only 2 cm and surrounded by a transparent plastic curtain outside to ensure an uninterrupted flow of nitrogen gas over the sample a magnetic stirrer inside cuvette was used to mix the solution during the irradiation for temperature control a copper made cuvette holder fig s2 was used to quickly remove heat from the light source and kept temperature difference in 2 c which can be ignored during the daily use nitrogen kept flushing through the setup and the vuv lamp was turned on after nitrogen gas flowed in the system took at least 10 min to reach stable prior to samples irradiation 2 4 analytical methods before vuv irradiation ph was adjusted to neutral and absorbance at 254 nm was recorded for uv fluence correction doc and alkalinity tests were performed when there were additions of nom or hco3 respectively ph was measured using an oakton ph 5 meter oakton instruments usa the absorbance of the solution was measured by uv vis cary 100 spectrophotometer agilent

photometer hanna hi 83300 for experiments on the study of dissolved oxygen do effect do was measured using ysi proodo handheld do meter ysi inc xylem inc usa uv energy was measured by iodide iodate actinometry rahn et al 2006 goldstein and rabani 2008 bolton et al 2011 for determining uv 254 nm fluence rate si section 3 note that the lamp power output ratio of the uv 185 nm to uv 254 nm remains constant around 16 furatian 2017 provided the operating conditions stay unchanged hence we monitored and presented uv energy at 254 nm instead of 185 nm because it allows for convenient comparison with other uv based aop studies in the literature the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite in samples were measured using an ion chromatograph ic dionex ics 1100 thermo fisher scientific usa to be more specific the autosampler withdrew a 10 μl sample volume from ic vials per injection multi injections were applied to reduce variability dionex ionpac as22 column thermo fisher scientific usa with super fast separation time were equipped and maintained at 35 c in isocratic mode a mobile phase composed of 0 45 m carbonate and 0 14 m bicarbonate thermo fisher scientific usa was diluted 100 times and applied as eluent solution at a flow rate of 1 2 ml min 1 3 results and discussion prior to conducting experiments involving vuv irradiation it was necessary to confirm that nitrite formation under uv 254 nm see setup in si fig s3 is negligible the preliminary tests si section 5 with only uv 254 nm photolysis of nitrate nitrate as n at 10 mg l were performed and the results indicated that nitrite formation up to 1500 mj cm2 radiation was indeed negligible with concentrations below the ic detection limit of 10 μg l 3 1 effect of initial nitrate concentration the five different initial nitrate concentrations were chosen from 1 mg l to 20 mg l no 3 n fig 1 a shows the formation of nitrite as a result of vuv photolysis and the fact that the nitrite formation increased with increasing the concentration of initial nitrate however the formation of nitrite was not simply linearly correlated with uv fluence up to 1600 mj cm2 in 100 min irradiation which represents the amount of uv energy delivered to the solution for the low nitrate concentrations n1 to n5 no 3 n at 1 5 mg l respectively there was a gradual decline in the rate of nitrite formation as the fluence increased the effect of initial nitrate concentration can be analyzed at two stages initial rate and residual rate of nitrite formation mack and bolton 1999 the formation rate of nitrite refer to the amount of nitrite formation divided by the uv fluence for a specific range of fluence applied the initial formation rate is estimated at the early stage of uv radiation which shows the nitrite concentration increases linearly with uv fluence for example at low uv fluence nitrite formation increases linearly with initial nitrate concentrations of n1 to n5 nonetheless with continuing the uv irradiation the formation of nitrite increases at a slower formation rate which is referred to as the residual formation rate it is proposed that the initial formation rate of nitrite is dependent on nitrate concentration whereas for the residual formation rate of nitrite is somewhat self inhibited by nitrite reactions daniels et al 1968 4 o no 3 oonoo no 2 o 2 k 3 10 8 m 1 s 1 5 o no 2 no 3 k 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 the plot of the initial formation rate of nitrite vs nitrate concentrations fig 1b shows that the initial nitrite formation rate increases initially but reaches a nearly constant value with further increase of nitrate concentration the concentration of nitrate in water directly influences photon absorption fraction table 1 which can be calculated using lambert beer s law with α h2o 1 8 cm 1 weeks et al 1963 and ε no 3 185 nm 4779 m 1s 1 serrano mora and mohseni 2018 table 2 the photon fraction calculation details could be found in si table s3 the increase of nitrate leads to an increase of 185 nm photons being absorbed by nitrate and results in a decrease of photolysis of water note the species h oh and eaq which are produced by the photolysis of water have an important role in nitrite formation via reaction 1 the decreased photons fraction absorbed by h2o eventually hinders reaction 1 and reduces the initial formation rate of nitrite at high nitrate concentration on the other hand as reactions proceed nitrite is formed and participates in the complex set of reaction chains shown in reaction 6 and reform nitrate this is referred to as the self inhibition of nitrite which plays an important role in the residual formation rate with the increasing ratio of nitrite to nitrate in the solution this self inhibition effect cannot be ignored because nitrite strongly absorbs 185 nm photons and highly reacts with oh image 5 the residual formation rate of nitrite is dependent on pathways shown in reactions 4 5 and 6 and the ratio of nitrate nitrite and other radical species formed during the photolysis of water the formed nitrite is consumed by oh forming no2 which can further react with other radicals to form n2o3 n2o4 intermediates and finally convert back to nitrate via reactions 4 6 the re formed nitrate could continue to participate in the vuv photolysis and produce nitrite again via the major three possible pathways as mentioned earlier with the increase of nitrite concentration the residual formation rate of nitrite reduces under a higher uv fluence and finally reach zero which means the nitrite formation reach a constant eventually and no longer increase with the increase of uv fluence for example nitrite formation of n1 was considered as equilibrium status at high uv fluence n2 and n5 is believed to reach constant nitrite formation with higher uv irradiation for the higher initial nitrate concentration such as n10 the formation of nitrite increases linearly with fluence the hypothesis is that nitrate at such high concentration can absorb all or majority of the 185 nm photons thus nitrite formation is mainly dependent on the uv energy and the self inhibition effects caused by nitrite is insignificant due to the relatively low concentration of nitrite formed further increase of the nitrate in the solution i e n20 did not lead to an increase in nitrite formation confirming the aforementioned hypothesis that nitrite formation is limited by 185 nm photon absorption by nitrate this result is valuable since it demonstrates that the formation of nitrite during the vuv advanced oxidation is independent of the concentration of nitrate when it is high hence one could determine and control the extent of nitrite formation by simply controlling the irradiation time or uv fluence delivered to the solution 3 2 effects of doc nom as one of the major sources of doc is already found to impact on nitrite formation under uv254 or other uv based aops due to its high uv absorbance sharpless and linden 2001 thomson and vmlm 2004 fig 2 shows the effect of doc on nitrite formation under vuv photolysis the results show that the presence of doc leads to increased concentration of nitrite and the higher concentration of doc the greater formation of nitrite as seen in table s6 the pseudo first order rate constant of the sample n10 doc6 no3 n at 10 mg l and doc c at 6 mg l is 2 4 times greater than that of the sample n10 which means doc has a large effect on nitrite formation there are two likely explanations for this phenomenon first nom is known as a strong oh radical scavenger which competes with nitrite for oh radicals hence reaction 7 is hindered resulting in an increase in nitrite concentration mack and bolton 1999 7 no 2 oh no 2 oh k 1 0 10 10 m 1 s 1 8 nom oh nom oh k 2 3 10 4 mg c l 1 s 1 another hypothesis for the increased formation of nitrite is through the vuv photolysis of nom since nom has large molecular structure and contains a small portion of n based group functions westerhoff and mash 2002 however this second hypothesis is unlikely based on our further investigation using a control test involving irradiation of nom solution doc at 6 mg l it was determined that nitrite formation was below the detection limit of 10 μg l considering the effect of vuv photon fraction the presence of doc is assumed to reduce the direct photolysis of nitrate since doc highly absorbs 185 nm photons with the molar absorption coefficient of 1402 m 1cm 1 serrano mora and mohseni 2018 thus doc can compete with nitrate for vuv photons nonetheless the relative absorption of vuv photons by doc compared to that by nitrate is not significant due to the very large molecular weight of nom refer to table s4 for detailed calculation according to the above the major impact of nom is related to its oh radical scavenging effect table 3 shows the reaction rate constants of hydroxyl radical and nom determined by several studies all the suggested rate constants of k dom oh are in the order of 104 mg of c l 1s 1 assuming an average molecular weight of 3000 da for nom wang et al 2017 the value of k dom oh for reaction 8 will be in the order of 1010 m 1s 1 which is competitive with the reaction of nitrite and oh radical it is important to note that nom can scavenge not only free oh but also the oh inside the solvent cage of oh no2 daniels et al 1968 which is formed by photolysis of nitrate reaction 3 mark et al 1996 these two species are initially surrounded by a cage of water molecules the scavenging of oh in the cage can inhibit their recombination and enhance the generation of no2 very efficiently mack and bolton 1999 to confirm the oh radical scavenging effect of nom and its impact on nitrite formation tert butanol tba was selected as another known oh radical scavenger in the experiments fig 3 the rate constant of tba reacting with oh radical is 6 108 m 1s 1 buxton et al 2000 the concentration of tba was chosen at 2 mm which was confirmed to be a sufficient radical scavenging concentration in our experimental condition refer to si section 10 the pseudo first order rate constants of doc contained solution for nitrite formation are shown in table s6 the presence of tba prominently increases the pseudo first order rate constant of nitrite formation compared with the solution of no tba since tba as an oh radical scavenger also competes with nitrite the concentration of oh radical is significantly reduced by the contribution of tba thus reaction 7 is further hindered and nitrite concentration is increased it is important to note that the absorption coefficient of tert butanol at 185 nm was measured in this study si section 7 as 72 77 m 1cm 1 at 20 c which does not significantly affect the photon absorption fraction and radical distributions based on these results figs 2 and 3 and the fact that tba through its scavenging of oh radicals results in the increased formation of nitrite it is concluded that the role of nom on increasing nitrite formation is due to its strong competition with nitrite for oh radicals the presence of nom in nitrate contaminated water impacts the quality of treated water with respect to nitrite formation 3 3 effects of dic bicarbonate is a major dissolved inorganic carbon species at neutral ph which often influences the efficacy of the treatment processes the global average concentration of bicarbonate in various surface water ranges widely from 5 mg l to 300 mg l stumm and morgan 1996 wetzel 2001 as shown in fig 4 the presence of dic in the form of bicarbonate at low concentrations had little or no impact on nitrite formation and only at very high dic concentrations it was observed to decrease the formation of nitrite dic is likely involved in the mechanism of nitrite formation in two different ways that bring opposing influences on the one hand bicarbonate can react with and scavenge oh buxton et al 1988 9 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 10 co 3 2 oh co 3 oh k 3 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 accordingly one might expect that dic would lead to increased formation of nitrite since the presence of bicarbonate can compete with oh radicals in reacting with nitrite this phenomenon however was not evident from the results obtained fig 4 since the reaction of oh with hco3 is much slower than that with co3 2 the oh radical scavenging effect might be overestimated on the other hand co2 aq can rapidly react with peroxynitrite ions lymar and hurst 1995 according to reaction 11 11 onoo co 2 aq onooco 2 k 3 10 4 m 1 s 1 high concentration of bicarbonate can promote the formation of co2 aq and contribute to reaction 11 thereby reducing the concentration of onoo which could play a role in the formation of nitrite refer to reaction 2 stumm and morgan 1970 presented the equilibrium distribution of solutes in aqueous carbonate solution for the pure nahco3 solution the concentration of co 2 aq has been confirmed to increase with the increase of sodium bicarbonate concnetration the detailed discussion is provided in si section 11 thus it is confirmed that co2 aq increases with the increase of dic at neutral ph thereby facilitating reaction 11 and obstructing reaction 2 and finally decreasing the formation of nitrite another possible mechanism which may influence nitrite concentration in the solution with higher concentration of bicarbonate involves that co3 formed either in reaction 9 or reaction 10 the formed onooco2 can yield no2 and co3 goldstein and czapski 1998 lymar and hurst 1998 sharpless and linden 2001 which can further produce co2 aq and no3 buxton et al 1988 12 onooco 2 no 2 co 3 k 1 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 co 2 aq no 3 the produced co2 aq from reaction 12 can also contribute to reaction 11 and decrease nitrite formation it is known that carbonate radical is a common product in photoreactions however unlike oh radical the species co3 is a highly selective reactant with few exceptions chen and hoffman 1973 larson and zepp 1988 so far except reaction 12 there are no reactions of carbonate radical and nitrate nitrite ions found in the open literature to further confirm the hypotheses on the negligible impact of dic as oh radical scavenger and significant effect of co2 aq nitrite formation was monitored in a solution containing tba as shown in fig 5 at very high concentration of dic nitrite formation was somewhat suppressed in the presence of tba similar to the results in fig 4 which confirmed that the effect of bicarbonate at high concentration on reduced nitrite formation is non negligible it is indicated that the effect of co2 aq and formation of co3 which play an important role on reducing nitrite formation is non negligible nonetheless comparing the results presented in figs 4 and 5 as well as the pseudo first order rate constants of all the dic solutions details presented in table s7 indicated that the presence of tba significantly increased the formation of nitrite these further underscore the significance of scavenging oh radicals on increasing nitrite formation on the other hand the results show that bicarbonate at the concentration in the range of surface water does not impact nitrite formation 3 4 combined effects of doc and dic fig 6 shows the effect of both doc and dic when present in water on the formation of nitrite as shown in fig 6 a for a given concentration of doc dic did not show any impact on the concentration of nitrite formed indeed there was no statistically significant difference between the formation of nitrite in the presence or absence of dic in water on the other hand at a given dic concentration fig 6b increases in doc concentration led to more nitrite formation much the same as what was observed in fig 1 all these confirm the aforementioned conclusion that dic has negligible effect at the same time comparing the results of figs 4 and 6 a reveals that pseudo first order rate constants of nitrite formation for the water containing both doc and dic were more than 2 times greater than those for the water with dic only table s8 similarly comparing the results of figs 2 and 6 b the formation rates of nitrite are very close as long as the doc concentration is the same table s8 3 5 effect of dissolved oxygen do to investigate the effect of dissolved oxygen experiments were conducted by sparging compressed air nitrogen gas in water fig 7 shows that nitrite formation decreased with the increase of do which is consistent with the finding of gonzalez and braun 1995 1996 it is mentioned that dissolved oxygen strongly competes with nitrate for h and hydrated electrons as shown in reactions 13 to 16 note that the reactive species h and hydrated electron are produced by 185 nm photolysis of water the overall interactions of do and the pathways involved in the process are shown in fig 8 which mainly impact the formation of nitrite from first pathway reaction 1 13 o 2 h ho 2 k 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 14 o 2 e aq o 2 k 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 15 no 3 h no 3 h k 2 4 10 7 m 1 s 1 16 no 3 e aq no 3 2 k 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 17 no 3 2 o 2 no 3 o 2 k 1 6 10 8 m 1 s 1 reaction 17 also occurs resulting in the decreased formation of nitrite however based on the reported rate constants reactions 13 14 should be more dominant than reaction 17 in the process of nitrite formation of important note is that the impact of do on the formation of oh radicals which are the most effective species for the degradation of micropollutants is unclear given that do mainly reacts with h the recombination between h and oh is inhibited resulting in an increased formation of oh it is speculated that the decreasing formation of oh is insignificant since nitrite is strongly affected by oh and the reduced formation of oh should lead to an increase of nitrite which is conflicting with our results the effect of do absorption at 185 nm is negligible as the molar absorption coefficient of oxygen at this wavelength is less than 10 m 1cm 1 krupenie 1972 mejía et al 2009 based on the photon fraction calculation refer to table s5 the photon fraction distribution of water and nitrate is unchanged with the increase of do concentration overall injecting air oxygen and increasing do could present itself as an effective strategy to decrease nitrite formation during the application of vuv photolysis for micropollutant removal 4 conclusions in this work we have demonstrated that formation of nitrite under vuv photolysis of nitrate rich water is related to uv fluence initial nitrate concentration and the presence of doc dic and do the rate of nitrite formation is initially high but it plateaues with increased irradiation time i e fluence this brings a great possibility to guide vuv applications for better controlling nitrite formation based on the initial nitrate concentration light intensity etc doc has the greatest impact on the formation of nitrite and its presence leads to an increased nitrite formation by scavenging oh radicals dic on the other hand has little impact and leads to slight reduction in nitrite formation at extremely high concentration do has a positive role in reducing nitrite formation and brings the opportunity to broaden vuv applications for treating micropollutants in nitrate rich water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

chemicals used such as sodium nitrate sodium bicarbonate tert butanol etc were analytical grade and purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa suwannee river natural organic matter srnom was obtained from the international humic substance society st paul mn usa as reverse osmosis isolates in freeze dried powder form all solutions were made using deionized water which was treated by a milli q water resistivity 18 2 mω cm purification system elga labwater uk ultrahigh purity nitrogen gas praxair canada inc mississauga on canada was used for purging air from the optical path of the 185 nm enabled collimated beam 2 2 experimental overview the experimental solutions were prepared with water matrix composition including doc dic and do at desired concentrations refer to si section 4 then water quality parameters including ph doc alkalinity and uv absorbance at 254 nm were measured before the solution was irradiated in a vuv reactor set up fig s1 ph was always adjusted to 7 5 0 5 to reach neutral ph and eliminate the effect of ph in different water matrices doc and alkalinity were measured to confirm the initial concentration of samples which contained srnom as a source of doc and nahco3 as a source of dic absorbance at 254 nm was determined for uv actinometry water factor correction bolton and linden 2003 a cuvette starna cells inc atascadero ca usa with a stopper under vuv lamp was used to contain samples which was made by spectrosil quartz and allow penetration of wavelengths from 170 to 2700 nm the irradiation time was set at 20 40 60 80 and 100 min upon collection of the samples the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were analyzed by ion chromatography for a given water matrix the experiments were performed in triplicate and ion concentrations were identical within standard deviation of 5 maximum 2 3 photolysis experiments the vuv aop experiments were mainly conducted with a collimated beam bench scale reactor fig s1 equipped with a vacuum uv hg lamp emitting light at 80 90 254 nm 10 20 185 nm and a low percentage of visible this lamp was mounted in a sealed aluminum tubular and enclosed nitrogen purged chamber to provide the no oxygen atmosphere which guaranteed 185 nm wavelength irradiation a collimation tube was fitted under an aperture from lamp housing which measured 18 cm in length and 3 2 cm inner diameter samples were enclosed in a transparent synthetic quartz cuvette which has an interior diameter of 47 mm and the nominal volume of 17 0 ml and placed at the bottom of a uv vuv collimated beam apparatus a shutter of thick card was used via a slot in the shutter housing and operated manually in coordination with a timer to measure exposure times the distance from the bottom of shutter housing to the surface of the cuvette was only 2 cm and surrounded by a transparent plastic curtain outside to ensure an uninterrupted flow of nitrogen gas over the sample a magnetic stirrer inside cuvette was used to mix the solution during the irradiation for temperature control a copper made cuvette holder fig s2 was used to quickly remove heat from the light source and kept temperature difference in 2 c which can be ignored during the daily use nitrogen kept flushing through the setup and the vuv lamp was turned on after nitrogen gas flowed in the system took at least 10 min to reach stable prior to samples irradiation 2 4 analytical methods before vuv irradiation ph was adjusted to neutral and absorbance at 254 nm was recorded for uv fluence correction doc and alkalinity tests were performed when there were additions of nom or hco3 respectively ph was measured using an oakton ph 5 meter oakton instruments usa the absorbance of the solution was measured by uv vis cary 100 spectrophotometer agilent technologies usa the concentration of doc was measured using a toc analyzer ge sievers m5310 c usa based on oxidizing regent ammonium persulfate alkalinity was measured by multiparameter benchtop photometer hanna hi 83300 for experiments on the study of dissolved oxygen do effect do was measured using ysi proodo handheld do meter ysi inc xylem inc usa uv energy was measured by iodide iodate actinometry rahn et al 2006 goldstein and rabani 2008 bolton et al 2011 for determining uv 254 nm fluence rate si section 3 note that the lamp power output ratio of the uv 185 nm to uv 254 nm remains constant around 16 furatian 2017 provided the operating conditions stay unchanged hence we monitored and presented uv energy at 254 nm instead of 185 nm because it allows for convenient comparison with other uv based aop studies in the literature the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite in samples were measured using an ion chromatograph ic dionex ics 1100 thermo fisher scientific usa to be more specific the autosampler withdrew a 10 μl sample volume from ic vials per injection multi injections were applied to reduce variability dionex ionpac as22 column thermo fisher scientific usa with super fast separation time were equipped and maintained at 35 c in isocratic mode a mobile phase composed of 0 45 m carbonate and 0 14 m bicarbonate thermo fisher scientific usa was diluted 100 times and applied as eluent solution at a flow rate of 1 2 ml min 1 3 results and discussion prior to conducting experiments involving vuv irradiation it was necessary to confirm that nitrite formation under uv 254 nm see setup in si fig s3 is negligible the preliminary tests si section 5 with only uv 254 nm photolysis of nitrate nitrate as n at 10 mg l were performed and the results indicated that nitrite formation up to 1500 mj cm2 radiation was indeed negligible with concentrations below the ic detection limit of 10 μg l 3 1 effect of initial nitrate concentration the five different initial nitrate concentrations were chosen from 1 mg l to 20 mg l no 3 n fig 1 a shows the formation of nitrite as a result of vuv photolysis and the fact that the nitrite formation increased with increasing the concentration of initial nitrate however the formation of nitrite was not simply linearly correlated with uv fluence up to 1600 mj cm2 in 100 min irradiation which represents the amount of uv energy delivered to the solution for the low nitrate concentrations n1 to n5 no 3 n at 1 5 mg l respectively there was a gradual decline in the rate of nitrite formation as the fluence increased the effect of initial nitrate concentration can be analyzed at two stages initial rate and residual rate of nitrite formation mack and bolton 1999 the formation rate of nitrite refer to the amount of nitrite formation divided by the uv fluence for a specific range of fluence applied the initial formation rate is estimated at the early stage of uv radiation which shows the nitrite concentration increases linearly with uv fluence for example at low uv fluence nitrite formation increases linearly with initial nitrate concentrations of n1 to n5 nonetheless with continuing the uv irradiation the formation of nitrite increases at a slower formation rate which is referred to as the residual formation rate it is proposed that the initial formation rate of nitrite is dependent on nitrate concentration whereas for the residual formation rate of nitrite is somewhat self inhibited by nitrite reactions daniels et al 1968 4 o no 3 oonoo no 2 o 2 k 3 10 8 m 1 s 1 5 o no 2 no 3 k 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 the plot of the initial formation rate of nitrite vs nitrate concentrations fig 1b shows that the initial nitrite formation rate increases initially but reaches a nearly constant value with further increase of nitrate concentration the concentration of nitrate in water directly influences photon absorption fraction table 1 which can be calculated using lambert beer s law with α h2o 1 8 cm 1 weeks et al 1963 and ε no 3 185 nm 4779 m 1s 1 serrano mora and mohseni 2018 table 2 the photon fraction calculation details could be found in si table s3 the increase of nitrate leads to an increase of 185 nm photons being absorbed by nitrate and results in a decrease of photolysis of water note the species h oh and eaq which are produced by the photolysis of water have an important role in nitrite formation via reaction 1 the decreased photons fraction absorbed by h2o eventually hinders reaction 1 and reduces the initial formation rate of nitrite at high nitrate concentration on the other hand as reactions proceed nitrite is formed and participates in the complex set of reaction chains shown in reaction 6 and reform nitrate this is referred to as the self inhibition of nitrite which plays an important role in the residual formation rate with the increasing ratio of nitrite to nitrate in the solution this self inhibition effect cannot be ignored because nitrite strongly absorbs 185 nm photons and highly reacts with oh image 5 the residual formation rate of nitrite is dependent on pathways shown in reactions 4 5 and 6 and the ratio of nitrate nitrite and other radical species formed during the photolysis of water the formed nitrite is consumed by oh forming no2 which can further react with other radicals to form n2o3 n2o4 intermediates and finally convert back to nitrate via reactions 4 6 the re formed nitrate could continue to participate in the vuv photolysis and produce nitrite again via the major three possible pathways as mentioned earlier with the increase of nitrite concentration the residual formation rate of nitrite reduces under a higher uv fluence and finally reach zero which means the nitrite formation reach a constant eventually and no longer increase with the increase of uv fluence for example nitrite formation of n1 was considered as equilibrium status at high uv fluence n2 and n5 is believed to reach constant nitrite formation with higher uv irradiation for the higher initial nitrate concentration such as n10 the formation of nitrite increases linearly with fluence the hypothesis is that nitrate at such high concentration can absorb all or majority of the 185 nm photons thus nitrite formation is mainly dependent on the uv energy and the self inhibition effects caused by nitrite is insignificant due to the relatively low concentration of nitrite formed further increase of the nitrate in the solution i e n20 did not lead to an increase in nitrite formation confirming the aforementioned hypothesis that nitrite formation is limited by 185 nm photon absorption by nitrate this result is valuable since it demonstrates that the formation of nitrite during the vuv advanced oxidation is independent of the concentration of nitrate when it is high hence one could determine and control the extent of nitrite formation by simply controlling the irradiation time or uv fluence delivered to the solution 3 2 effects of doc nom as one of the major sources of doc is already found to impact on nitrite formation under uv254 or other uv based aops due to its high uv absorbance sharpless and linden 2001 thomson and vmlm 2004 fig 2 shows the effect of doc on nitrite formation under vuv photolysis the results show that the presence of doc leads to increased concentration of nitrite and the higher concentration of doc the greater formation of nitrite as seen in table s6 the pseudo first order rate constant of the sample n10 doc6 no3 n at 10 mg l and doc c at 6 mg l is 2 4 times greater than that of the sample n10 which means doc has a large effect on nitrite formation there are two likely explanations for this phenomenon first nom is known as a strong oh radical scavenger which competes with nitrite for oh radicals hence reaction 7 is hindered resulting in an increase in nitrite concentration mack and bolton 1999 7 no 2 oh no 2 oh k 1 0 10 10 m 1 s 1 8 nom oh nom oh k 2 3 10 4 mg c l 1 s 1 another hypothesis for the increased formation of nitrite is through the vuv photolysis of nom since nom has large molecular structure and contains a small portion of n based group functions westerhoff and mash 2002 however this second hypothesis is unlikely based on our further investigation using a control test involving irradiation of nom solution doc at 6 mg l it was determined that nitrite formation was below the detection limit of 10 μg l considering the effect of vuv photon fraction the presence of doc is assumed to reduce the direct photolysis of nitrate since doc highly absorbs 185 nm photons with the molar absorption coefficient of 1402 m 1cm 1 serrano mora and mohseni 2018 thus doc can compete with nitrate for vuv photons nonetheless the relative absorption of vuv photons by doc compared to that by nitrate is not significant due to the very large molecular weight of nom refer to table s4 for detailed calculation according to the above the major impact of nom is related to its oh radical scavenging effect table 3 shows the reaction rate constants of hydroxyl radical and nom determined by several studies all the suggested rate constants of k dom oh are in the order of 104 mg of c l 1s 1 assuming an average molecular weight of 3000 da for nom wang et al 2017 the value of k dom oh for reaction 8 will be in the order of 1010 m 1s 1 which is competitive with the reaction of nitrite and oh radical it is important to note that nom can scavenge not only free oh but also the oh inside the solvent cage of oh no2 daniels et al 1968 which is formed by photolysis of nitrate reaction 3 mark et al 1996 these two species are initially surrounded by a cage of water molecules the scavenging of oh in the cage can inhibit their recombination and enhance the generation of no2 very efficiently mack and bolton 1999 to confirm the oh radical scavenging effect of nom and its impact on nitrite formation tert butanol tba was selected as another known oh radical scavenger in the experiments fig 3 the rate constant of tba reacting with oh radical is 6 108 m 1s 1 buxton et al 2000 the concentration of tba was chosen at 2 mm which was confirmed to be a sufficient radical scavenging concentration in our experimental condition refer to si section 10 the pseudo first order rate constants of doc contained solution for nitrite formation are shown in table s6 the presence of tba prominently increases the pseudo first order rate constant of nitrite formation compared with the solution of no tba since tba as an oh radical scavenger also competes with nitrite the concentration of oh radical is significantly reduced by the contribution of tba thus reaction 7 is further hindered and nitrite concentration is increased it is important to note that the absorption coefficient of tert butanol at 185 nm was measured in this study si section 7 as 72 77 m 1cm 1 at 20 c which does not significantly affect the photon absorption fraction and radical distributions based on these results figs 2 and 3 and the fact that tba through its scavenging of oh radicals results in the increased formation of nitrite it is concluded that the role of nom on increasing nitrite formation is due to its strong competition with nitrite for oh radicals the presence of nom in nitrate contaminated water impacts the quality of treated water with respect to nitrite formation 3 3 effects of dic bicarbonate is a major dissolved inorganic carbon species at neutral ph which often influences the efficacy of the treatment processes the global average concentration of bicarbonate in various surface water ranges widely from 5 mg l to 300 mg l stumm and morgan 1996 wetzel 2001 as shown in fig 4 the presence of dic in the form of bicarbonate at low concentrations had little or no impact on nitrite formation and only at very high dic concentrations it was observed to decrease the formation of nitrite dic is likely involved in the mechanism of nitrite formation in two different ways that bring opposing influences on the one hand bicarbonate can react with and scavenge oh buxton et al 1988 9 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 10 co 3 2 oh co 3 oh k 3 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 accordingly one might expect that dic would lead to increased formation of nitrite since the presence of bicarbonate can compete with oh radicals in reacting with nitrite this phenomenon however was not evident from the results obtained fig 4 since the reaction of oh with hco3 is much slower than that with co3 2 the oh radical scavenging effect might be overestimated on the other hand co2 aq can rapidly react with peroxynitrite ions lymar and hurst 1995 according to reaction 11 11 onoo co 2 aq onooco 2 k 3 10 4 m 1 s 1 high concentration of bicarbonate can promote the formation of co2 aq and contribute to reaction 11 thereby reducing the concentration of onoo which could play a role in the formation of nitrite refer to reaction 2 stumm and morgan 1970 presented the equilibrium distribution of solutes in aqueous carbonate solution for the pure nahco3 solution the concentration of co 2 aq has been confirmed to increase with the increase of sodium bicarbonate concnetration the detailed discussion is provided in si section 11 thus it is confirmed that co2 aq increases with the increase of dic at neutral ph thereby facilitating reaction 11 and obstructing reaction 2 and finally decreasing the formation of nitrite another possible mechanism which may influence nitrite concentration in the solution with higher concentration of bicarbonate involves that co3 formed either in reaction 9 or reaction 10 the formed onooco2 can yield no2 and co3 goldstein and czapski 1998 lymar and hurst 1998 sharpless and linden 2001 which can further produce co2 aq and no3 buxton et al 1988 12 onooco 2 no 2 co 3 k 1 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 co 2 aq no 3 the produced co2 aq from reaction 12 can also contribute to reaction 11 and decrease nitrite formation it is known that carbonate radical is a common product in photoreactions however unlike oh radical the species co3 is a highly selective reactant with few exceptions chen and hoffman 1973 larson and zepp 1988 so far except reaction 12 there are no reactions of carbonate radical and nitrate nitrite ions found in the open literature to further confirm the hypotheses on the negligible impact of dic as oh radical scavenger and significant effect of co2 aq nitrite formation was monitored in a solution containing tba as shown in fig 5 at very high concentration of dic nitrite formation was somewhat suppressed in the presence of tba similar to the results in fig 4 which confirmed that the effect of bicarbonate at high concentration on reduced nitrite formation is non negligible it is indicated that the effect of co2 aq and formation of co3 which play an important role on reducing nitrite formation is non negligible nonetheless comparing the results presented in figs 4 and 5 as well as the pseudo first order rate constants of all the dic solutions details presented in table s7 indicated that the presence of tba significantly increased the formation of nitrite these further underscore the significance of scavenging oh radicals on increasing nitrite formation on the other hand the results show that bicarbonate at the concentration in the range of surface water does not impact nitrite formation 3 4 combined effects of doc and dic fig 6 shows the effect of both doc and dic when present in water on the formation of nitrite as shown in fig 6 a for a given concentration of doc dic did not show any impact on the concentration of nitrite formed indeed there was no statistically significant difference between the formation of nitrite in the presence or absence of dic in water on the other hand at a given dic concentration fig 6b increases in doc concentration led to more nitrite formation much the same as what was observed in fig 1 all these confirm the aforementioned conclusion that dic has negligible effect at the same time comparing the results of figs 4 and 6 a reveals that pseudo first order rate constants of nitrite formation for the water containing both doc and dic were more than 2 times greater than those for the water with dic only table s8 similarly comparing the results of figs 2 and 6 b the formation rates of nitrite are very close as long as the doc concentration is the same table s8 3 5 effect of dissolved oxygen do to investigate the effect of dissolved oxygen experiments were conducted by sparging compressed air nitrogen gas in water fig 7 shows that nitrite formation decreased with the increase of do which is consistent with the finding of gonzalez and braun 1995 1996 it is mentioned that dissolved oxygen strongly competes with nitrate for h and hydrated electrons as shown in reactions 13 to 16 note that the reactive species h and hydrated electron are produced by 185 nm photolysis of water the overall interactions of do and the pathways involved in the process are shown in fig 8 which mainly impact the formation of nitrite from first pathway reaction 1 13 o 2 h ho 2 k 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 14 o 2 e aq o 2 k 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 15 no 3 h no 3 h k 2 4 10 7 m 1 s 1 16 no 3 e aq no 3 2 k 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 17 no 3 2 o 2 no 3 o 2 k 1 6 10 8 m 1 s 1 reaction 17 also occurs resulting in the decreased formation of nitrite however based on the reported rate constants reactions 13 14 should be more dominant than reaction 17 in the process of nitrite formation of important note is that the impact of do on the formation of oh radicals which are the most effective species for the degradation of micropollutants is unclear given that do mainly reacts with h the recombination between h and oh is inhibited resulting in an increased formation of oh it is speculated that the decreasing formation of oh is insignificant since nitrite is strongly affected by oh and the reduced formation of oh should lead to an increase of nitrite which is conflicting with our results the effect of do absorption at 185 nm is negligible as the molar absorption coefficient of oxygen at this wavelength is less than 10 m 1cm 1 krupenie 1972 mejía et al 2009 based on the photon fraction calculation refer to table s5 the photon fraction distribution of water and nitrate is unchanged with the increase of do concentration overall injecting air oxygen and increasing do could present itself as an effective strategy to decrease nitrite formation during the application of vuv photolysis for micropollutant removal 4 conclusions in this work we have demonstrated that formation of nitrite under vuv photolysis of nitrate rich water is related to uv fluence initial nitrate concentration and the presence of doc dic and do the rate of nitrite formation is initially high but it plateaues with increased irradiation time i e fluence this brings a great possibility to guide vuv applications for better controlling nitrite formation based on the initial nitrate concentration light intensity etc doc has the greatest impact on the formation of nitrite and its presence leads to an increased nitrite formation by scavenging oh radicals dic on the other hand has little impact and leads to slight reduction in nitrite formation at extremely high concentration do has a positive role in reducing nitrite formation and brings the opportunity to broaden vuv applications for treating micropollutants in nitrate rich water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
