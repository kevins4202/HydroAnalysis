9735,in spite of the benefits of heterosis in maize breeding little is known about the physiological mechanisms of this phenomenon and its genetic control under different water regimes this study aimed to understand the heterosis effects on plant growth the photosynthetic and transpiration traits and the root traits of four inbred popcorn lines and their hybrids including their reciprocal combinations plants were grown in lysimeters inside a rain shelter under two water conditions water stress ws well watered ww until anthesis plant growth traits included shoot biomass plant height and leaf area photosynthetic traits comprised leaf pigment and total nitrogen content chlorophyll fluorescence gas exchange water use efficiency and stomatal index and density along with the stable carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n isotope compositions of the last developed leaf root weight density and specific root length were also recorded greater heterosis effects were observed for traits related to plant growth and root weight density and specifically under ws traits related to root weight density in deeper soil layers benefited markedly from heterosis but there were no advantages in terms of stomatal conductance and water status in general apparently only δ13c supported a better water status under ws and was observed in the hybrids in particular non additive gene effects were predominant in controlling of most of the growth and root traits studied supporting the conclusion that the heterosis effect is especially favorable under water limiting conditions moreover the choice of the

supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors without undue reservation 1 introduction the continuous increase in maize grain yield that started in the late 1930s was essentially due to the expression of heterosis tollenaar and lee 2006 currently maize breeding programs are still largely based on the exploitation of this phenomenon zhang et al 2016 but the increasingly negative effects of climatic change worldwide ipcc 2019 makes it necessary to accelerate breeding for resilience to abiotic stress conditions such as drought heterosis is the expression of an adaptive advantage of a progeny in relation to its parents which can be quantified by faster growth higher final biomass greater flower fertility and consequently larger yields birchler et al 2010 the positive effects of heterosis have been especially relevant for biomass and yield cairns et al 2012 and have been evidenced from early growth through to adult plant stages chairi et al 2016 holá et al 2017 rockenbach et al 2018 furthermore heterosis has been suggested to positively affect crop adaptation to abiotic stresses such as drought araus et al 2010 which opens the possibility of identifying phenotypic traits in maize that confer stress resilience water stress induced physiological and biochemical disturbances which can reduce leaf expansion and alter the metabolic cell activity that leads to stomatal closure and photosynthetic inhibition are known to affect carbon partitioning and result in a fall in yield dalal and sharma 2017 some studies have reported that hybrids have adaptive advantages compared to parent lines under water limitation resulting in higher final productivity araus et al 2010 chairi et al 2016 in the case of subtropical maize hybrids under drought conditions araus et al 2010 suggested that heterosis was due to constitutive differences in plant water status and an enhanced water use by hybrids along the same lines chairi et al 2016 reported heterosis for root traits and total transpiration in a dry soil environment regardless of the water regime as well heterosis for photosynthetic traits leaf net co2 assimilation rate stomatal conductance and transpiration rate being more evident under water stress a root system that secures higher transpiration and water use may also have a positive role in improving the uptake of nutrients like nitrogen lynch 2019 therefore a root system that is highly resilient to soil water stress represents an adaptive advantage of high agronomic relevance trachsel et al 2011 in this sense gao and lynch 2016 described that maize genotypes with a lower number of crown roots have greater rooting depth under water stress contributing to a better adaptation in terms of water use and improved growth and yield according to zhan et al 2015 the reduction in root branch density increases drought tolerance in maize preventing excessive metabolic costs of soil exploration while allowing deeper rooting in this line of work the occurrence of heterosis in maize hybrids under drought has been reported for root traits enhancing agronomic performance either due to higher root weight density or to lower specific root length ali et al 2016 chairi et al 2016 additional root traits may also be involved thus in a recent study in popcorn the higher agronomic water use efficiency and photosynthetic rates of hybrids compared to inbred lines under water stress seems as least in part to be the result of a synergistic association of wider root angles in relation to the soil about 90º and longer roots leite et al 2021 understanding the physiological mechanisms associated with heterosis can reveal ways to increase the grain yield potential and to improve plant adaptation to water stress this information associated with a deeper knowledge about the genetic control of these traits may guide more efficient parent selection and management of superior segregating populations the performance data of parents and their hybrid combinations derived from diallel crosses provide valuable information for breeders based on these crosses the general combining ability can be estimated which is associated with additive effects as well as the specific combining ability which is associated with non additive effects cruz et al 2014 diallel crosses that include parents in a reciprocal sense allow conclusions about the influence of extrachromosomal genes cruz et al 2014 thus the interactions between nuclear and cytoplasmic genes have been reported as negligible in explaining heterosis zhang et al 2016 despite their effects on the phenotypic expression of some traits in f1 hybrids fan et al 2014 such as grain yield and its components yao et al 2013 including grain resistance to disease spread e g zhang et al 1997 for aspergillus flavus and the early vigor of maize seeds santos et al 2017 despite the importance of heterosis for maize yield as well as the known action of reciprocal effects on crosses the genetic effects and physiological mechanisms associated with heterosis performance under soil water stress conditions needs further study while the effect of heterosis is relatively well known in terms of increasing growth biomass and yield ahmadzadeh et al 2004 araus et al 2010 chairi et al 2016 the genetics and especially the physiological mechanisms behind it are still largely unclear among the mechanisms contributing to the greater growth of hybrids compared to inbred lines higher photosynthetic rates chairi et al 2016 greater transpiration and better water status araus et al 2010 or a more efficient root system ali et al 2016 chairi et al 2016 have all been proposed but so far the debate remains mostly open to date besides leaf greenness kamphorst et al 2020a 2020b 2021b traits related to leaf photosynthetic status and stomatal conductance have been shown to be good indicators of the agronomic performance of popcorn under water constraints kamphorst et al 2020a in addition the current body of research has reinforced the importance of root physiological and morphological traits in explaining agronomic water use efficiency and the possibility of advances through exploitation of heterosis given the superior performance of roots in the hybrids relative to the parent lines leite et al 2021 the objective of this study was to evaluate differences in growth photosynthesis transpiration nitrogen uptake and root architecture that may be involved in the expression of heterosis in popcorn as well as to investigate the genetic mechanisms that control these traits under different water conditions the results of our study may support breeding strategies and even agronomic practices aimed at improving popcorn resilience to drought since the goal of this study was to provide insights into which phenotypic traits are associated with maize genotypes better adapted to water stress we therefore analyzed a wide range of traits to this end we performed an exhaustive evaluation of different shoot growth and root traits together with a wide range of physiological traits informing about the photosynthetic and transpirative status of the plants in terms of shoot growth total biomass as well as leaf characteristics were assessed to quantify leaf growth e g total area density of epidermal cells and leaf thickness compaction e g the specific leaf area zhang et al 2015 to enable a detailed study of the plants root architecture while controlling water status plants were grown in a 1 5 m deep lysimetric system where root characteristics at different depths were assessed concerning leaf photosynthesis and transpiration instantaneous measurements gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence together with leaf structural traits pigment content on a per area basis nitrogen content and stomatal density and time integrated indicators of the water and nitrogen status such as the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures when analyzed in leaf dry matter were assessed thus the carbon isotope signature when analyzed in plant dry matter expressed either as composition δ13c or discrimination δ13c is affected by water status even in c4 species farquhar 1983 farquhar et al 1989 consequently the carbon isotope signature has been used to indicate water status in maize araus et al 2010 chairi et al 2016 kamphorst et al 2020a with regard to the nitrogen isotope composition δ15n even though its signal in the plant seems more complex to model and less resolved cui et al 2020 it gives insights about how water affects nitrogen uptake and downstream metabolism with δ15n usually decreasing in response to water stress yousfi et al 2009 2012 2 material and methods 2 1 genotypes and growth conditions four s7 popcorn zea mays l var everta inbred lines were used namely p6 derived from zaeli a hybrid adapted to temperate tropical climates p7 derived from the iac112 hybrid adapted to temperate tropical climates l61 derived from the open pollinated variety brs angela embrapa adapted to tropical climates and l75 derived from the open pollinated variety viçosa adapted to temperate tropical climates and their possible hybrids 12 including reciprocal combinations these inbred lines were selected based on a previous field study under soil water stress and classified as agronomically efficient p6 and p7 and inefficient with regard to water use l61 and l75 kamphorst et al 2018 following the order of female and male parents the hybrids p6 x p7 p6 x l61 p6 x l75 p7 x l61 p7 x l75 l75 x l61 p7 x p6 l61 x p6 l75 x p6 l61 x p7 l75 x p7 and l61 x l75 were used the experiment was carried out in a lysimetric system placed under a glass rain shelter at the greenhouse at the experimental field facilities of the university of barcelona from early may to mid july 2018 the lysimetric system is described by elazab et al 2016 in short the system consists of pvc tubes diameter 14 cm length 150 cm cut in half longitudinally and the two halves fixed together with adhesive tape the lower parts of the tubes were tied with wire which was threaded through holes and the bottom of each tube closed with a pot of the same diameter as the tubes allowing adequate drainage the substrate consisted of 80 perlite and 20 peat moss to which the fertilizer complex npk mgo so3 20 5 8 5 17 was added together with micronutrients and a slow release 2 3 months nitrogen source isobutylidenediurea 17 g tube 1 in absolute values the fertilizer corresponded to 144 7 kg n ha 1 36 2 kg p ha 1 and 57 8 kg k ha 1 the experiment was arranged in complete randomized blocks evaluated under two water conditions wc with three replicates per genotype and water condition each replicate consisting of one plant within an individual lysimeter three seeds were germinated directly on substrate in each pvc tube for each genotype and replicate fifteen days after germination seedlings were thinned to one per tube the plants were spaced 25 cm apart and 94 cm between rows corresponding to a density of 42 553 plants ha 1 in the range of densities under field conditions temperature humidity and solar radiation followed the seasonal pattern fig 1 the tubes were irrigated abundantly with water before sowing left to stand for 72 h to drain excess water and then weighed the water holding capacity of each tube at 100 field capacity was calculated as the difference between the wet substrate after draining excess and dry substrate weight before saturation oven dried the mean water content per tube at relative field capacity was 6 772 l 100 the plant weight was not included when calculating the relative field capacity of the tubes to establish well irrigated ww conditions the tubes were maintained at relative field capacity until the final evaluations pre flowering period to this end every 2 3 days the tubes were weighed and then replenished with the corresponding amount of water to restore relative field capacity in water stress ws conditions limited irrigation was imposed 15 days after the emergence of seedlings the amount of water available in the tubes gradually reduced according to plant consumption until it reached 35 of relative field capacity thereafter water content was maintained for 15 days until harvest the calculations of relative field capacity did not consider the weight of the growing plants causing a certain underestimation of the amount of water needed to reach 35 of the relative field capacity in the tubes the decrease in moisture in the tubes was homogeneous because the plants that consumed the most water received the precise amount of irrigation to return to the substrate water conditions of the plants that consumed the least this regime was established to simulate field growth conditions with a slow decrease in water content thus avoiding the typical situation of potted plants which can be affected by severe water stress within a few days to that end the tubes were weighed and irrigated at intervals of 2 3 days 2 2 morphological traits at harvest plant height cm was measured with a ruler from the tube surface to the last developed leaf visible ligule then the plant stalks were separated from the leaves and inserted into paper envelopes for oven drying at 70 ºc for 72 h to determine leaf and stalk biomass g the leaf area m2 was calculated based on pictures of each plant supplementary material fig 1 the images were acquired with a sony α6000 digital slr sony corporation japan 24 5 megapixel resolution camera with a 23 5 15 6 mm sensor size native resolution of 6000 4000 pixels and equipped with a 35 mm focal length lens the pixel size was calculated using the ground sample distance gsd calculator tool developed by pix4d https support pix4d com hc en us articles 202559809 ground sampling distance gsd the following equation was used sw h 100 fr imw where gsd represents the distance between two consecutive pixel centers sw indicates the sensor width of the camera mm h is the height distance between camera and object m fr is the real focal length of the camera mm and imw is the image width pixels in our case sw was 23 2 mm h 1 95 m fr 18 mm and imw 4608 pixels therefore images were analyzed with imagej image processing software using a gsd of 0 054 pixels cm 1 schneider et al 2012 2 3 leaf pigments chlorophyll flavonoids anthocyanins and the nitrogen balance index were determined for the middle third of the last developed leaf one day before harvest with a portable dualex meter force a orsay france 2 4 fluorescence measurements to measure chlorophyll fluorescence we used a multispeq device michigan state university michigan usa controlled by the photosynq software platform kuhlgert et al 2016 the last developed leaf at the time of harvest the same used for all other evaluations was used for measurements prior to fluorescence emission evaluations part of the sampled leaf was dark adapted for 15 min in a box with no light entry to estimate fluorescence based parameters we measured the quantum yield of photosystem ii psii photochemistry φpsii a non photochemical quenching parameter describing regulated dissipation of excess energy npqt non photochemical quenching φnpq other unregulated non photochemical losses φno and the maximum quantum yield of psii fv fm 2 5 leaf gas exchange measurements gas exchange was evaluated in the last two days of the experiment first in ww conditions and the second day in ws conditions between 11 00 am and 2 00 pm using a portable infrared gas analyzer model li 6400 li cor lincoln ne usa equipped with a light source 6400 40 lcf li cor during the evaluations the par was set to 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 the co2 concentration to 400 µmol mol 1 relative humidity to between 55 and 60 and temperature to 25 c the net photosynthetic rate a stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate e were measured in the last developed leaf of each plant the instantaneous wueinstant a e and intrinsic wueintrinsic a gs water use efficiencies were also calculated 2 6 stomatal and epidermal cell density a section about 1 cm in length and 0 5 cm wide from the adaxial and abaxial epidermal surface of the middle third of the last developed leaf specifically between the central rib and the leaf edge was varnished with nail polish after drying for 10 min the dried varnish layer was lifted off with adhesive tape and transferred to a glass slide the numbers of stomata s and epidermal cells e were counted under a microscope with a 10 x ocular and 40 x objective lens three microscope fields were counted in each adaxial and abaxial leaf replicate according to radoglou and jarvis 1990 stomatal density sd stomata mm 2 and epidermal cell density ecd cells mm 2 were calculated with the following equations sd s 0 152 ecd e 0 152 where 0 152 mm 2 is the surface area of each microscope field radius 0 22 mm the stomatal index si of each leaf surface was then calculated with the following equation si 100 x sd ecd 2 7 relative leaf water content and specific leaf area before harvest fresh leaf discs diameter 1 65 cm of the last developed leaf of each plant were collected and immediately weighed to determine the fresh weight fw then the leaf discs were immersed in distilled water in darkness in a refrigerator 4 ºc for 12 h after imbibition the discs were gently dried with paper towels and weighed again to determine the turgid weight tw finally the discs were oven dried at 70 ºc for 72 h and the dry weight dw was determined the relative leaf water content rwc was calculated with the equation rwc 100 x fw dw tw dw for the same leaf discs with a leaf area la of 2 1282 cm2 the specific leaf area sla cm2 g 1 was calculated with the equation sla la dw 2 8 cumulative plant evapotranspiration and agronomic water use efficiency the total amount of water transpired from each plant during all the growth periods the cumulative plant evapotranspiration et dm3 plant 1 was recorded throughout the growth cycle to this end before irrigation each tube was weighed and the substrate surface of each was covered with plastic to avoid direct evaporation from the substrate surface in addition based on the shoot leaf stalk biomass weight ab and et the agronomic water use efficiency wueagro g kg 1 at harvest was calculated as wue agro ab et 2 9 stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures the isotope ratios of stable carbon 13c 12c and nitrogen 15n 14n together with total nitrogen content were determined in samples of the last developed leaf in all plants under both wcs measurements of carbon and nitrogen isotope composition were carried out at the scientific facilities of the university of barcelona using an elemental analyzer flash 1112 ea thermo finnigan berman germany coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta c irms thermo finnigan operating in continuous flow samples of 0 7 0 8 mg of leaf dry matter from each plant together with reference materials were weighed and sealed into tin capsules isotopic results were expressed in standard δ notation coplen and zhu 2008 x r sample r standard 1 100 where x is the δ13c or δ15n value and r is the 13c 12c or 15n 14n ratio respectively the δ13c values were based on the vienna pee dee belemnite isotope standard and δ15n values on n2 in air farquhar et al 1989 2 10 root traits at harvest the tubes were opened to separate the substrate from the roots first the substrate core was cut into five equal sections each 0 30 m long obtained from the upper surface of the tubes to the lower end in the following layers 0 30 cm a 30 60 cm b 60 90 cm c 90 120 cm d and 120 150 cm e afterwards samples were gently shaken and then washed with tap water using mesh to remove the soil finally root samples were rinsed with distilled water and lightly dried with paper towels specific root length and root weight density were determined separately for each layer from each core section a random sample of 4 5 root segments was collected from the total amount of roots recovered and stored in a fridge 4ºc to later calculate the specific root length srl to that end the root samples were spread in a plastic tray 21 0 29 7 cm containing about 1 0 l water depth 0 5 1 0 cm and photographed with a sony α6000 dslr camera sony corporation japan thereafter the images were processed using imagej software root images supplementary material fig 2 were analyzed with gia roots software galkovskyi et al 2012 which includes user assisted algorithms to distinguish roots from background and a highly automated pipeline when calibrating the resolution the user can set the pixels cm 1 scale as desired in this study 1 0 cm corresponded to 148 pixels from a list of root traits provided by gia roots the root network length cm was selected which corresponds to the total number of pixels in the network representing the length of the analyzed root segments the srl in each of the five soil sections srl sample m g 1 was determined using the analyzed images as follows srl sample rl sample rb sample where rl sample represents the total length of the root segments m extracted from the root images and rb sample represents the dry root biomass g of the analyzed segments elazab et al 2012 root dry weight was determined separately for each section each root section

rwd sec g m 3 was calculated as before elazab et al 2012 using the following expression rwd sec rb sec π r 2 l where rb sec is the dry root biomass of the soil section g r is the tube radius 0 07 m and l is the length of the tube section 0 30 m in addition the ratio of shoot aerial biomass ab to root rb total sum of the five rb dry dry matter was calculated using ab rb total 2 11 heterosis estimation for each trait relative heterosis h was calculated as the difference between the mean performance of the hybrid f1 in relation to the means of its parents mp in absolute and percentage values respectively according to the following expressions mp p 1 p 2 2 and h f 1 mp mp 100 in these cases p1 and p2 indicate the mean of the parents and f1 the mean hybrid performance hallauer et al 2010 2 12 statistical analysis for each study trait individual variance analysis was performed within each water condition whereas combined variance analyses were undertaken including both conditions individual variance was analyzed by the following statistical model y ij μ g i b j ε ij where yij is the observation of the i th genotype in the j th block μ is the general constant gi is the genotype effect bj is the block effect and εij is the experimental error combined variance analysis was performed according to the following statistical model y ijk μ g i b wc jk wc j g wc ij ε ijk where y ijk

with nid g wc ij fixed effect of the interaction between the ith genotype and the jth wc and ε ijk mean experimental random error associated with observation y ijk with nid 0 σ2 therefore the parent and hybrid effects were partitioned separately for each trait statistical analyses were performed with sas software 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc usa the combining abilities were analyzed by method i diallel analysis as proposed by griffing 1956 in which p2 combinations are included and the genotype effect is considered fixed the four parents hybrids and reciprocal combinations were analyzed by

using genes software cruz 2013 the quadratic components ϕ that express genetic variability in terms of general g and specific s combining abilities and reciprocal rc effects were estimated by ϕg qmg qmr 2p ϕs qms qmr e ϕrc qmrc qmr 2 where qmg is the mean square of the general combining ability qms is the mean square of the specific combining ability qmrc is the mean square of the reciprocal effect qmr is the mean square of the residue and p is the number of parents lastly the effects of the quadratic components were expressed as percentages relative to the sum of the total effects 3 results 3 1 growth traits leaf pigments chlorophyll fluorescence and n status the growth leaf pigments and n status traits studied differed statistically between inbred lines and hybrids except for plant area and the specific leaf area under ww conditions table 1 water conditions did not affect the flavonoid anthocyanin or the nitrogen contents or stable nitrogen isotope composition δ15ndm in dry matter moreover no effect of the genotype by water condition g wc interaction was observed for plant area plant height flavonoid or anthocyanin all chlorophyll fluorescence traits differed significantly between wcs table 1 the maximum quantum yield of psii fv fm the quantum yield of photosystem ii φpsii and the quantum yield of non regulated non photochemical energy loss in ps ii φno were 21 9 53 6 and 24 7 lower respectively under ws than ww conditions the non photochemical quenching parameter describing regulated dissipation of excess energy npqt and quantum yield of regulated non photochemical energy loss in ps ii φnpq values were 159 4 and 99 2 higher respectively under ws than ww differences between inbred lines and hybrids were only significant for φnpq table 1 with the exception of fv fm and npqt the g wc interaction affected all other traits related to chlorophyll fluorescence table 1 compared to ww conditions soil water stress caused decreases of 15 8 25 8 31 8 and 23 4 in leaf biomass plant area stalk biomass and plant height respectively table 1 decreases in leaf biomass plant area stalk biomass and plant height were higher for the inbred lines i e 19 8 28 6 50 3 and 30 8 respectively than for the hybrids which decreased by 14 8 24 6 26 4 and 21 1 respectively regardless of the wcs the values of these traits were higher for hybrids heterosis was more marked under ws table 1 thus values for leaf biomass plant area stalk biomass and plant height were 38 9 20 6 72 9 and 25 0 respectively the growth trait least affected in relative terms by water status and heterosis was specific leaf area which was 5 6 higher under ws than ww p 0 05 whereas heterosis under ws was just 5 4 table 1 concerning leaf pigments the chlorophyll content and the nitrogen balance index decreased more in the inbred lines 19 7 and 17 7 respectively than in the hybrids 7 0 and 4 3 respectively under ws and ww conditions in general under both wcs the heterosis values of chlorophyll content and nitrogen balance index were negative but positive for flavonoid and anthocyanin table 1 under both wcs hybrids had higher flavonoid and anthocyanin content resulting in positive estimates of heterosis the heterosis estimates of φpsii npqt and φno were more evident under ws corresponding to 22 7 51 6 and 25 7 respectively than under ww conditions 19 1 21 5 and 3 3 under ww respectively the heterosis estimates of φnpq were 30 9 under ws and 69 2 under ww conditions under both wcs nitrogen content in dry matter was higher in inbred lines and δ15ndm was higher in hybrids and consequently heterosis values were negative for nitrogen content in dry matter but positive for δ15ndm table 1 for both wcs we highlight the importance expressed in of the quadratic components related to general ϕg and specific ϕs combining abilities and reciprocal effects ϕrc of the above growth measures leaf pigments and n status traits fig 2 general combining ability related to the quadratic component ϕg and specific combining ability related to the quadratic component ϕs differed significantly under both wcs for most traits supplementary table 1 quadratic components ϕ with negative general combining ability effects were observed for chlorophyll content 0 52 and nitrogen balance index 0 83 these negative values must be interpreted as estimates of the real value equal to zero supplementary table 1 therefore the quadratic component was no longer considered fig 2 comprising 0 of the variation in this way the component does not explain the genetic variability of the trait in general even though mean squares related to general combining ability related to quadratic component ϕg and reciprocal effect related to quadratic component ϕrc were significant the most important component to determine the traits and to explain most of the genetic variability observed was the quadratic component related to specific combining ability related to quadratic component ϕs with non additive effects being the most prevalent fig 2 the values were evident under ws for flavonoid 58 leaf biomass 85 plant height 50 and stalk biomass 70 traits and under ww leaf biomass 64 nitrogen content in dry matter 64 and pa 53 fig 2 regardless of the wcs and given the large values of residual percentages we observed a high environmental influence on chlorophyll fluorescence traits fig 2 however in φno and φnpq under ws and φnpq under ww φpsii we found that the importance expressed in of the quadratic components related to specific combining ability ϕ s and with predominant non additive effects was the most important to explain the genetic variability for these traits fig 2 the significance of values of the mean squares of general and specific combining ability and reciprocal effect and the respective quadratic components related to ϕg ϕs and ϕrc for chlorophyll fluorescence traits can be found in supplementary table 1 3 2 leaf gas exchange stomatal characteristics water status and stable c composition the combined analysis revealed a significant effect of water limitation which decreased the leaf net co2 assimilation rate a by 17 1 stomatal conductance g s by 30 0 the transpiration rate e by 28 7 cumulative plant evapotranspiration et by 29 4 and relative leaf water content by 4 3 while increasing the intrinsic water use efficiency wueintrin by 18 3 and δ13c by 7 8 values averaged through both inbreds and hybrids the differences between inbred lines and hybrids were significant for the traits et and δ13c under ws and only for et under ww conditions aside from et these traits were significantly affected by the g wc interaction table 2 the estimated heterosis was modest 10 0 for a g s e and relative leaf water content under both wcs table 2 the heterosis estimates under both wcs for the traits of instantaneous water use efficiency wueinstant wueintrin agronomic water use efficiency wueagro and δ13cdm were low 7 0 the heterosis effects for et were higher corresponding to 47 5 under ws and 31 4 under ww conditions table 2 in general for the stomatal characteristics adaxial adaxial index and density no significant wc and genotype effects were observed in the combined analysis regardless of the wcs these traits did not show contrasts between means in the inbred lines and hybrids therefore the heterosis estimates for the traits were low 13 6 the ϕ s effects related to specific combining ability with non additive effects being prevalent were the most important for explaining the genetic variability for adaxial stomatal density 38 et 77 and wueintrin 42 under ws and for a 58 adaxial stomatal density 49 e 49 and et 66 under ww fig 3 under ws in particular we observed a strong effect of ϕrc related to reciprocal effect on genetic variability expression in a 30 and g s 32 fig 3 supplementary table 1 presents the significance of values of the mean squares of general and specific combining ability and reciprocal effect and the respective quadratic components related to ϕg ϕs and ϕrc for photosynthetic and transpiration gas exchange stomatal characteristics water status and stable carbon isotope composition traits in general regardless of the wcs and given the large residual percentage values we observed a strong environmental influence on leaf gas exchange stomatal characteristics water status and stable c composition fig 2 3 3 root traits no effect of water limitation on root weight density rwd or specific root length srl was detected in the soil sections b and c nor in the shoot to root dry matter ratio shoot root with the exception of srla and srl under ws the differences between inbred lines and hybrids of all root traits were statistically significant table 3 the g by wc interaction was significant for all root traits regardless of the wc the rwd of the hybrids was higher than that of their parents in the different tube sections table 3 a decrease in rwd was observed with increasing root depth under both wcs fig 4a and b the ratio between ws and ww for the rwd of the parents and the hybrids within each tube section showed a lower reduction in the rwd of the hybrids mainly in soil sections c d and e fig 4c the water stress induced decrease in rwd was more prominent in inbred lines with estimates of 47 1 55 0 and 52 6 for sections c d and e respectively compared to the hybrid genotypes with reductions of 42 5 50 3 and 39 9 for the same sections regardless of the wc the values of these sections c d and e were higher for the hybrids than their parents with the exception of rwd in soil section a the heterosis of rwd for the other sections b c d and e was higher under ws in the deeper soil layers the heterosis effects increased for rwd related traits table 3 with the exception of srl in soil section a root related trait estimates were higher under ws in sections b c d and e 6 7 18 7 compared to ww specific root length tended to increase with increasing soil depth under both wcs in general the heterosis values of srl in all tube sections were negative and higher under ww compared to ws conditions table 3 regardless of the wc the shoot to root ratio of the hybrids was lower than in the parents negative heterosis effects were observed under both wcs table 3 for most root traits in both wcs the most important quadratic components importance expressed in were ϕs related to specific combining ability wich non additive effects being the most prevalent fig 5 the significance of values of the mean squares of general and specific combining ability and reciprocal effect and quadratic components related to ϕg ϕs and ϕrc respectively for root traits can be found in supplementary table 1 4 discussion 4 1 growth measures leaf pigments chlorophyll fluorescence and n status regardless of the wcs the hybrid dry biomass was higher than in the inbred lines both for leaves and stalks and the plant height and area were higher as well with more pronounced heterosis values under ws the greater dry matter accumulation before flowering and larger leaf size represented by plant area was associated with a higher whole plant canopy photosynthesis tollenaar et al 2004 in the hybrids compared to the inbreds table 1 the higher photosynthetic area of hybrids compared to inbreds was probably due to greater cell expansion in the former because the density of epidermal cells in the leaves was lower in the hybrids than the inbreds which indicates that hybrid epidermal cells were larger the stomatal density of the adaxial side was also lower in the hybrids compared to the inbreds under both water conditions moreover the stomatal index which is a trait that compares the number of stomata to the number of epidermal cells remained basically constant between hybrids and inbreds further suggesting that a generally greater expansion of cells was responsible for the larger leaf area of the hybrids in contrast to our results blum 2013 and chairi et al 2016 concluded that the heterosis observed in plant growth traits was the result of a larger number of cells instead of a larger cell size greater cell expansion in hybrids compared to inbreds would be present not only in leaves but also in the non laminar parts of the plant overall the greater cell expansion in hybrids occurred under both ww and ws conditions suggesting constitutive differences i e even under well watered conditions in water status between hybrids and lines araus et al 2010 and thus differences in cell turgor also being present concerning the non laminar parts of the plant the structure most affected by ws was the stalk in both the parent inbred lines and hybrids and particularly so for the parents the stalk has both a structural function due to its high lignification and plays a role in photoassimilate storage forell et al 2015 when photoassimilation is reduced the increase in stalk biomass is decelerated which should also intensify stalk lodging robertson et al 2017 in that sense the hybrids are also better suited than the inbreds to adapt to water stress conditions in our study the specific leaf area was greater under ws and under this condition the parents had the highest values resulting in negative heterosis values whereas no clear differences occurred under ww conditions resulting in negligible heterosis effects although water stress is considered to induce plant morphoanatomical changes leading to reduce specific leaf area zhang et al 2015 this trait is also sensitive to other environmental factors e g temperature and phenology related metabolic variations e g remobilization of photoassimilates song et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 the slightly higher specific leaf area of inbreds compared to hybrids under ww conditions means the former exhibit thinner and or less dense leaves garnier et al 1997 vergara díaz et al 2016 probably associated with a reduced cell expansion relative to the hybrids however the larger cell expansion of the hybrids may also account for the lower nitrogen content on a dry matter basis as well as the lower nitrogen balance index and chlorophyll content on a per area basis the last two measured with a dualex sensor of the hybrids compared to the inbreds in fact the estimates of heterosis for the chlorophyll and nitrogen contents were negative under both wcs although the parents showed the greatest reductions in both traits due to ws previous studies in maize have found no heterosis effects on leaf n content in field grown adult plants araus et al 2010 and on n uptake in maize seedlings chairi et al 2016 the higher vigor of maize hybrids relative to their parents may lead to lower nitrogen content in plant tissues due to the increased demand holá et al 2017 in any case when net assimilation rates on a per area basis are considered the higher nitrogen and chlorophyll contents in the inbreds may be counteracted by the better water status of the hybrids particularly under ws conditions where δ13c clearly indicated a better water status of the hybrids while specific leaf area was lower in fact we found only marginally higher net assimilation rates on a per area basis in the hybrids compared to the inbred lines which agrees with previous studies where heterosis for net assimilation was marginal at least under well watered conditions chairi et al 2016 in the same sense no differences were reported in the net assimilation of hybrids and their parental inbred lines at silking ahmadzadeh et al 2004 therefore differences between parents and hybrids with regards to assimilation rate on a per area basis were either marginal or simply not significant particularly under ww conditions however it is worth mentioning that hybrids had a considerably greater photosynthetic leaf surface and therefore the total net assimilation per plant was higher in hybrids than in inbreds chairi et al 2016 described that a marked heterosis effect on net assimilation and transpiration was only evidenced when these traits were expressed per whole leaf or plant rather than on a per unit area basis however araus et al 2010 under full field conditions also reported higher stomatal conductance and transpiration rates on a per unit area basis in hybrids than in their parents even under ww conditions in our study the higher δ13c values under ws conditions of hybrids compared to the inbreds supports a better water status in the former farquhar et al 1989 araus et al 2010 in spite of no differences in instantaneous gas exchange measures gs and t being recorded in paralell the higher δ15n values in hybrids compared to the inbreds with heterosis being higher under ws compared to ww conditions further supports the notion that hybrids experienced less water stress and that even under ww conditions nitrogen uptake and further metabolism were more efficient in the hybrids yousfi et al 2009 2012 however chairi et al 2016 found no significant differences in δ15n between lines and hybrids in agreement with the literature water stress induced a generalized decrease in photosynthetic psii efficiency and an increase in heat dissipation kuhlgert et al 2016 therefore ws triggered a photoprotective response that contributed to the preservation of the reaction centers through increased heat dissipation at the expense of psii efficiency and thus there was a consequent fall in assimilation rate however in spite of the fact that all chlorophyll fluorescence traits were sensitive to ws only φnpq differed between the hybrids and their parents under any of the wcs thus hybrids showed a significantly higher φnpq and hence positive heterosis values regardless of the water conditions therefore our results suggest that maize hybrids possess a greater photoprotective response which may have conferred an adaptive advantage with regard to the parents eventually contributing to a better physiological agronomic performance kuhlgert et al 2016 in terms of the leaf accessory pigments hybrids showed higher flavonoid and anthocyanin contents regardless of the wc resulting in positive estimates of heterosis flavonoids and anthocyanins are phenolic compounds of ecophysiological relevance that function as antioxidants osmoregulators and photoprotective compounds in plant cells chalker scott 1999 gould et al 2002 mazza et al 2000 steyn et al 2002 as such they are implicated in plant responses to environmental stress including water stress nakabayashi et al 2014 thus these compounds prevent the proliferation of reactive oxygen species that may endanger cell metabolism and homeostasis kalaji et al 2017 wahid et al 2007 in the present work the higher content of phenolic compounds in the hybrids than in inbred lines may represent an adaptive advantage that might contribute to a greater drought tolerance through avoidance of photoinhibition the other two fluorescence traits φpsii and φno also differed between inbreds and hybrids but in the case of φpsii heterosis changed from positive under ws to negative under ww conditions whereas φno was negative under ws and near zero under ww conditions generally an increase in thermal dissipation by unregulated processes φno under severe stress conditions can indicate photoinactivation busch et al 2009 according to these authors higher a values are positively correlated with φpsii busch et al 2009 our results showed a slight tendency towards higher a and φpsii values in hybrids mainly under ws 4 2 water status and cumulative evapotranspiration despite the reduction in relative leaf water content under ws compared to ww conditions this was not an important trait for differentiating the parents from their hybrids resulting in estimates of null heterosis it has been reported that genotypes with greater ws tolerance have a higher relative leaf water content mainly due to the ability to grow a deeper root system and extract water from deeper soil layers or as a result of greater osmotic adjustment gao and lynch 2016 or because they control transpiratory losses more efficiently higher relative leaf water content may allow greater stomatal opening and thus maintenance of photosynthetic metabolism to some extent blum 2011 on the other hand water deficit induced a higher wue as shown by the significant difference in wueintrin between ws and ww conditions in the same sense δ13c values were more negative under ws than under ww conditions opposite to the pattern reported for c3 species water stress in a c4 species like maize causes more negative δ13c values which is associated with a higher time integrated intrinsic wue farquhar et al 1989 cabrera bosquet et al 2009 araus et al 2010 chairi et al 2016 concerning the differences between inbred lines and the corresponding hybrids the later exhibited slightly higher wueintrin and wueinstant regardless of the wcs however δ13c was more negative in the inbreds than hybrids at least under ws conditions which suggests that inbred lines suffer more water stress under ws conditions however besides that no significant differences existed between wcs or between hybrids and their parents for wueagro even though heterosis under ws conditions was slightly higher in hybrids than in inbreds it is likely that the level of water stress was moderate which while preventing net assimilation rates from differing markedly between inbreds and hybrids resulted in the plants adjusting the growth of the photosynthetic area to the available water also it should be noted that calculations of cumulative plant evapotranspiration et did not consider the weight of the growing plants thus causing a certain underestimation of the amount of water needed to reach 100 and 35 of the relative field capacity of the tubes and consequently the heterosis values of et tended to be underestimated as hybrids grew and weight increased there was increasing underestimation of the et of these genotypes and consequently its heterosis effect under ws in particular this fact may have influenced the wueagro values which were higher in hybrids but did not differ statistically between parents and f1 the above reasons may justify at least in part the lack of differences in wueagro between inbred lines and hybrids in any case the heterosis values for cumulative plant et were high especially under ws in the study of chairi et al 2016 the authors described that heterosis in maize seedlings manifests as higher plant water consumption under both wcs which results in hybrids being more vigorous than the corresponding inbred lines this agrees with the increased cumulative leaf biomass and plant area sustaining a higher cumulative et in hybrids compared with inbreds requires a suitably adapted root system 4 3 root traits in response to ws root weight density rwd decreased in all studied soil strata fig 4a b in both parents and hybrids roots play an important adaptive role in drought prone environments and in this situation a better developed system especially in deeper soil layers favors higher grain yields ali et al 2016 according to lambers et al 2002 under ws the metabolic cost of the root system to explore the soil is high and can exceed a plant s daily photosynthetic rate by 50 for this reason plants under ws tend to have lower rwd and this was around 39 8 in our observations table 3 the hybrids had higher values for rwd than the inbreds regardless of the soil section a b c d or e fig 4a and b indicating a better developed root system in addition the hybrids showed a higher rwd ratio rwd ws rwd ww when comparing wcs fig 4c it is noteworthy that these values were the highest in sections c d and e indicating greater investment and deeper root development in response to drought adaptation fig 4c from the five studied sections of rwd heterosis was more evident in the four deepest soil sections under both wcs but mainly under ws the root system developed in deeper soil layers contributes to an efficient water extraction from these more distant profiles lynch 2013 a finding observed in popcorn hybrids that tends to provide adaptive advantages to ws in the field ali et al 2016 reported under ws field conditions a correlation between the biomass of deep maize roots 45 cm and higher grain yield whereas the development of deeper roots is relevant for drought tolerance heterosis effects in root length and root dry matter on popcorn genotypes are already evident during the early stages of plant development a few days after germination rockenbach et al 2018 similar results have also been reported in seedlings of other maize categories chairi et al 2016 under field conditions the heterosis advantage in terms of deeper roots may be even more relevant than under controlled experimental setups based on lysimeters even when long lysimeters were deployed as in our study 1 5 m deep lysimeters were used the specific root length srl tended to increase i e roots to become thinner with increasing substrate depth strata b c d and e in both genotype groups and wcs the greater biological activity of thinner roots which are responsible for nutrient uptake is well known eissenstat 1992 also plants with high srl tend to have higher water uptake rates elazab et al 2012 however inbreds exhibited thinner roots than hybrids which may contradict the positive role of thinner roots thus under both wcs and in the five soil segments the inbred lines exhibited higher srl thinner roots resulting in negative heterosis values contrastingly li et al 2008 reported greater development of fine roots in maize hybrid seedlings as compared to their parents under ws it is believed that the lower availability of photoassimilates due to water stress may contribute to higher srl values under ws compared to ww conditions the same rationale may be applied for the comparison between inbreds and hybrids with the former exhibiting thinner roots i e higher srl in order to optimize the photoassimilates available for growing roots a greater srl may also be a consequence of a less compact structure for example with aerenchyma in the cortex chairi et al 2016 in this sense elazab et al 2012 reported a water stress driven increase in srl in durum wheat reinforcing the role of thin roots i e high srl for the maintenance of high transpiration rates in any case a greater root plasticity of the hybrids compared to their parents was noticed since the srl values of the latter were similar under both wcs whereas they increased in hybrids in response to water stress in that sense chairi et al 2016 suggested that the acclimation capacity of the root structure to ws is lower in the parents than in the hybrids regarding the shoot to root dry matter ratio water stress tended to induce higher values but the differences were not significant previous works have reported a decrease in the shoot to root ratio in response to water limitation chairi et al 2016 kamphorst et al 2020a for their part hybrids showed lower shoot to root ratios than their parents resulting in negative estimates of heterosis this was indicative of a greater plasticity in root development and adaptation in the hybrids particularly in response to ws conditions our results are in line with the negative heterosis effect on this ratio reported by chairi et al 2016 in maize seedlings 4 4 implications for plant breeding in general ws discriminated the studied genotypes more clearly as well as the heterosis values which were also higher under this condition this can be explained by the fact that the genotypes differed more under ws which should also result in higher heritability values in agreement with that kamphorst et al 2019 found higher heritabilities under ws when evaluating popcorn genotypes under different water regimes in the field indicating greater reliability in the selection under this wc due to the higher genetic variance moreover based on the mean square estimates of the effects there was no change between the wcs of the quadratic component with highest relevance for the traits evaluated in this study this implies that the mode of trait expression is the same under both wcs in an inheritance study lima et al 2019 established that the genetic effects were the same under ws and ww conditions in popcorn and inferred that the same breeding methods could be applied for both wcs nevertheless the genetic gain will be greater under ws as stated by kamphorst et al 2019 2021a and lima et al 2019 there is a greater influence of non additive effects related to specific combining ability on the control of leaf biomass plant area the content of chlorophyll flavonoids and anthocyanins and the nitrogen balance index as well as the leaf nitrogen content and δ15n in traits under both wcs therefore it can be concluded that the exploration of heterosis is recommended as a strategy to achieve genetic gains cruz et al 2014 hallauer et al 2010 although the mean square of specific combining ability ϕ s is predominant for most traits as shown by the relative importance in fig 2 some of them also have a significant general combining ability ϕ g and reciprocal effect ϕ rc component indicating the influence of both additive and non additive gene action and the influence of the female parent even if to a lesser extent indeed ϕ s was the most important component to determine these traits and it also explained the genetic variability fig 2 as pointed out by tollenaar et al 2004 and observed in the present work the superiority of the maize hybrids manifested as dry matter accumulation before flowering in the leaf and stalk biomass and greater plant area in terms of leaf size and leaf area index and these factors were due to heterosis although the effect of the quadratic component of specific combining ability stood out for chlorophyll and the nitrogen balance index in other words ϕ s was the most important component to determine the traits and it also explained genetic variability the heterosis values were negative indicating that the hybrids had lower values for these traits than their parents this is due to the fact that a larger plant size normally observed in hybrids sees investment of the n in growth in other words hybrids exhibit faster leaf growth than the inbred lines and this is associated with a dilution effect with regard to the n content in this case n content measured on a dry matter basis in leaves is lower in the hybrids but positive heterosis in n would be detected by total plant n content instead of n content per unit dry matter the potential disadvantage of the hybrids in terms of lower leaf n was noticed particularly under ws as described by holá et al 2017 however we consider that a lower n content on a dry matter basis or on a per unit area basis in the hybrids is a positive trait in the sense that it is an indicator of a faster growth in the hybrids compared to the inbred lines the same rationale applies to the total chlorophyll content which was lower in the hybrids than in the inbred lines indeed the leaf chlorophyll content measured under contrasting water environments in a diallel involving ws tolerant tropical maize parents was reported to have a predominant general combining ability effect erdal et al 2016 these authors concluded that ϕ g was the most important component to determine the traits and it also explained the genetic variability in fact additive and non additive effects have been cited as being involved in the expression of traits related to leaf greenness to our understanding increasing these values under field conditions would be advantageous because higher leaf green values are associated with grain production cairns et al 2012 given the prevalence of the quadratic effects of specific combining ability we recommended further exploration of heterosis to increase root weight density rwd and specific root length srl in ws and ww environments indeed ϕ s was the most important component to determine these traits and it also explained the genetic variability fig 4 in a study carried out under ww and ws conditions ali et al 2016 described highly positive correlations between grain yield and root biomass in maize hybrids on the other hand in the evaluation of a maize diallel under abiotic stresses n and water stress chun et al 2005 observed that for rwd in particular the heterosis values were significant under the different n levels studied which was attributed to the significant general and specific combining ability effects and mainly the latter based on these reports and our results we emphasize that the use of hybrids can ensure improved root development under ws unlike the observations under ws additive effects related to general combining ability were predominant for stalk biomass plant height and specific leaf area under ww conditions this means that ϕ gwas the most important component to determine these traits and it also explained the genetic variability fig 2 evaluating a complete maize diallel in the field under stressful and non stressful water regimes wattoo et al 2014 described the significance of general and specific combining ability under both wcs which indicated the influence of both additive and non additive gene action with greater influence of the former additive effects were also observed for δ13c under both wcs in our study it is believed that the presence of one parent with a high mean in a negative sense may cause an interference resulting in the mean of the hybrids becoming the mean performance of the parents it was assumed that the cytoplasmic effect and the nuclear genes of the maternal genotype influenced gas exchange traits a g s and e under both wcs however this effect was even clearer under ws which means that ϕ rc was the most important component to determine these traits and it also explained the genetic variability observed the reciprocal effect in crosses is due to the action of mitochondrial and chloroplast genes extrachromosomal effect and genes from the nucleus of the maternal parent maternal effect cruz et al 2014 reciprocal effects on the chlorophyll a b and ab contents in millet genotypes have also been described evaluated in a complete diallel of 10 parents mehndiratta and phul 1983 in this sense it can be acknowledged that the extrachromosomal genes associated with photosynthesis in the female parent interfere with the agronomic performance of the hybrids therefore when breeding hybrids it is recommended to prioritize the parent with the highest photosynthetic rate as the female parent especially under drought conditions 5 conclusions the effects of heterosis in popcorn related to biomass were the result of better growth in the shoots which increased the photosynthetic area of the plant as well as the roots which secured an efficient capture of water hybrid vigor was even more evident under water stress conditions which further highlights the importance of an efficient albeit plastic root system in the hybrids by contrast the potential role of a higher net assimilation rate per unit area in the hybrid vigor was minor at best if not completely absent even when the leaves of the hybrids exhibited somewhat better photoprotective mechanisms than the inbred lines despite a lack of difference in instantaneous measurements of stomatal conductance and transpiration between hybrids and inbreds the δ13c of dry matter provided a clue about the better water status in hybrids compared to inbreds under ws in addition hybrids exhibited higher δ15n in leaves than the inbreds particularly under ws conditions this further supported the role of the roots in the hybrids in not only securing more efficient water uptake but also more efficient nitrogen uptake concerning leaf growth this study also evidenced that the lower nitrogen and chlorophyll content of leaves in hybrids compared with inbred lines is likely the result of faster leaf growth in the former since the non additive gene effects due to quadratic components related to specific combining ability comprising most of the genetic variability are responsible for the control of most shoot growth and root traits and especially so under water stress the success of breeding programs for drought adaptation requires appropriate exploitation of heterosis magnifying wherever possible the traits that confer hybrid vigor for traits related to gas exchange leaf net co2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance it was assumed that the cytoplasmic effect and the nuclear genes of the maternal genotype were an influence under ws therefore the choice of the female parent is essential to breed for

9735,in spite of the benefits of heterosis in maize breeding little is known about the physiological mechanisms of this phenomenon and its genetic control under different water regimes this study aimed to understand the heterosis effects on plant growth the photosynthetic and transpiration traits and the root traits of four inbred popcorn lines and their hybrids including their reciprocal combinations plants were grown in lysimeters inside a rain shelter under two water conditions water stress ws well watered ww until anthesis plant growth traits included shoot biomass plant height and leaf area photosynthetic traits comprised leaf pigment and total nitrogen content chlorophyll fluorescence gas exchange water use efficiency and stomatal index and density along with the stable carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n isotope compositions of the last developed leaf root weight density and specific root length were also recorded greater heterosis effects were observed for traits related to plant growth and root weight density and specifically under ws traits related to root weight density in deeper soil layers benefited markedly from heterosis but there were no advantages in terms of stomatal conductance and water status in general apparently only δ13c supported a better water status under ws and was observed in the hybrids in particular non additive gene effects were predominant in controlling of most of the growth and root traits studied supporting the conclusion that the heterosis effect is especially favorable under water limiting conditions moreover the choice of the

supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors without undue reservation 1 introduction the continuous increase in maize grain yield that started in the late 1930s was essentially due to the expression of heterosis tollenaar and lee 2006 currently maize breeding programs are still largely based on the exploitation of this phenomenon zhang et al 2016 but the increasingly negative effects of climatic change worldwide ipcc 2019 makes it necessary to accelerate breeding for resilience to abiotic stress conditions such as drought heterosis is the expression of an adaptive advantage of a progeny in relation to its parents which can be quantified by faster growth higher final biomass greater flower fertility and consequently larger yields birchler et al 2010 the positive effects of heterosis have been especially relevant for biomass and yield cairns et al 2012 and have been evidenced from early growth through to adult plant stages chairi et al 2016 holá et al 2017 rockenbach et al 2018 furthermore heterosis has been suggested to positively affect crop adaptation to abiotic stresses such as drought araus et al 2010 which opens the possibility of identifying phenotypic traits in maize that confer stress resilience water stress induced physiological and biochemical disturbances which can reduce leaf expansion and alter the metabolic cell activity that leads to stomatal closure and photosynthetic inhibition are known to affect carbon partitioning and result in a fall in yield dalal and sharma 2017 some studies have reported that hybrids have adaptive advantages compared to parent lines under water limitation resulting in higher final productivity araus et al 2010 chairi et al 2016 in the case of subtropical maize hybrids under drought conditions araus et al 2010 suggested that heterosis was due to constitutive differences in plant water status and an enhanced water use by hybrids along the same lines chairi et al 2016 reported heterosis for root traits and total transpiration in a dry soil environment regardless of the water regime as well heterosis for photosynthetic traits leaf net co2 assimilation rate stomatal conductance and transpiration rate being more evident under water stress a root system that secures higher transpiration and water use may also have a positive role in improving the uptake of nutrients like nitrogen lynch 2019 therefore a root system that is highly resilient to soil water stress represents an adaptive advantage of high agronomic relevance trachsel et al 2011 in this sense gao and lynch 2016 described that maize genotypes with a lower number of crown roots have greater rooting depth under water stress contributing to a better adaptation in terms of water use and improved growth and yield according to zhan et al 2015 the reduction in root branch density increases drought tolerance in maize preventing excessive metabolic costs of soil exploration while allowing deeper rooting in this line of work the occurrence of heterosis in maize hybrids under drought has been reported for root traits enhancing agronomic performance either due to higher root weight density or to lower specific root length ali et al 2016 chairi et al 2016 additional root traits may also be involved thus in a recent study in popcorn the higher agronomic water use efficiency and photosynthetic rates of hybrids compared to inbred lines under water stress seems as least in part to be the result of a synergistic association of wider root angles in relation to the soil about 90º and longer roots leite et al 2021 understanding the physiological mechanisms associated with heterosis can reveal ways to increase the grain yield potential and to improve plant adaptation to water stress this information associated with a deeper knowledge about the genetic control of these traits may guide more efficient parent selection and management of superior segregating populations the performance data of parents and their hybrid combinations derived from diallel crosses provide valuable information for breeders based on these crosses the general combining ability can be estimated which is associated with additive effects as well as the specific combining ability which is associated with non additive effects cruz et al 2014 diallel crosses that include parents in a reciprocal sense allow conclusions about the influence of extrachromosomal genes cruz et al 2014 thus the interactions between nuclear and cytoplasmic genes have been reported as negligible in explaining heterosis zhang et al 2016 despite their effects on the phenotypic expression of some traits in f1 hybrids fan et al 2014 such as grain yield and its components yao et al 2013 including grain resistance to disease spread e g zhang et al 1997 for aspergillus flavus and the early vigor of maize seeds santos et al 2017 despite the importance of heterosis for maize yield as well as the known action of reciprocal effects on crosses the genetic effects and physiological mechanisms associated with heterosis performance under soil water stress conditions needs further study while the effect of heterosis is relatively well known in terms of increasing growth biomass and yield ahmadzadeh et al 2004 araus et al 2010 chairi et al 2016 the genetics and especially the physiological mechanisms behind it are still largely unclear among the mechanisms contributing to the greater growth of hybrids compared to inbred lines higher photosynthetic rates chairi et al 2016 greater transpiration and better water status araus et al 2010 or a more efficient root system ali et al 2016 chairi et al 2016 have all been proposed but so far the debate remains mostly open to date besides leaf greenness kamphorst et al 2020a 2020b 2021b traits related to leaf photosynthetic status and stomatal conductance have been shown to be good indicators of the agronomic performance of popcorn under water constraints kamphorst et al 2020a in addition the current body of research has reinforced the importance of root physiological and morphological traits in explaining agronomic water use efficiency and the possibility of advances through exploitation of heterosis given the superior performance of roots in the hybrids relative to the parent lines leite et al 2021 the objective of this study was to evaluate differences in growth photosynthesis transpiration nitrogen uptake and root architecture that may be involved in the expression of heterosis in popcorn as well as to investigate the genetic mechanisms that control these traits under different water conditions the results of our study may support breeding strategies and even agronomic practices aimed at improving popcorn resilience to drought since the goal of this study was to provide insights into which phenotypic traits are associated with maize genotypes better adapted to water stress we therefore analyzed a wide range of traits to this end we performed an exhaustive evaluation of different shoot growth and root traits together with a wide range of physiological traits informing about the photosynthetic and transpirative status of the plants in terms of shoot growth total biomass as well as leaf characteristics were assessed to quantify leaf growth e g total area density of epidermal cells and leaf thickness compaction e g the specific leaf area zhang et al 2015 to enable a detailed study of the plants root architecture while controlling water status plants were grown in a 1 5 m deep lysimetric system where root characteristics at different depths were assessed concerning leaf photosynthesis and transpiration instantaneous measurements gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence together with leaf structural traits pigment content on a per area basis nitrogen content and stomatal density and time integrated indicators of the water and nitrogen status such as the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures when analyzed in leaf dry matter were assessed thus the carbon isotope signature when analyzed in plant dry matter expressed either as composition δ13c or discrimination δ13c is affected by water status even in c4 species farquhar 1983 farquhar et al 1989 consequently the carbon isotope signature has been used to indicate water status in maize araus et al 2010 chairi et al 2016 kamphorst et al 2020a with regard to the nitrogen isotope composition δ15n even though its signal in the plant seems more complex to model and less resolved cui et al 2020 it gives insights about how water affects nitrogen uptake and downstream metabolism with δ15n usually decreasing in response to water stress yousfi et al 2009 2012 2 material and methods 2 1 genotypes and growth conditions

field facilities of the university of barcelona from early may to mid july 2018 the lysimetric system is described by elazab et al 2016 in short the system consists of pvc tubes diameter 14 cm length 150 cm cut in half longitudinally and the two halves fixed together with adhesive tape the lower parts of the tubes were tied with wire which was threaded through holes and the bottom of each tube closed with a pot of the same diameter as the tubes allowing adequate drainage the substrate consisted of 80 perlite and 20 peat moss to which the fertilizer complex npk mgo so3 20 5 8 5 17 was added together with micronutrients and a slow release 2 3 months nitrogen source isobutylidenediurea 17 g tube 1 in absolute values the fertilizer corresponded to 144 7 kg n ha 1 36 2 kg p ha 1 and 57 8 kg k ha 1 the experiment was arranged in complete randomized blocks evaluated under two water conditions wc with three replicates per genotype and water condition each replicate consisting of one plant within an individual lysimeter three seeds were germinated directly on substrate in each pvc tube for each genotype and replicate fifteen days after germination seedlings were thinned to one per tube the plants were spaced 25 cm apart and 94 cm between rows corresponding to a density of 42 553 plants ha 1 in the range of densities under field conditions temperature humidity and solar radiation followed the seasonal pattern fig 1 the tubes were irrigated abundantly with water before sowing left to stand for 72 h to drain excess water and then weighed the water holding capacity of each tube at 100 field capacity was calculated as the difference between the wet substrate after draining excess and dry substrate weight before saturation oven dried the mean water content per tube at relative field capacity was 6 772 l 100 the plant weight was not included when calculating the relative field capacity of the tubes to establish well irrigated ww conditions the tubes were maintained at relative field capacity until the final evaluations pre flowering period to this end every 2 3 days the tubes were weighed and then replenished with the corresponding amount of water to restore relative field capacity in water stress ws conditions limited irrigation was imposed 15 days after the emergence of seedlings the amount of water available in the tubes gradually reduced according to plant consumption until it reached 35 of relative field capacity thereafter water content was maintained for 15 days until harvest the calculations of relative field capacity did not consider the weight of the growing plants causing a certain underestimation of the amount of water needed to reach 35 of the relative field capacity in the tubes the decrease in moisture in the tubes was homogeneous because the plants that consumed the most water received the precise amount of irrigation to return to the substrate water conditions of the plants that consumed the least this regime was established to simulate field growth conditions with a slow decrease in water content thus avoiding the typical situation of potted plants which can be affected by severe water stress within a few days to that end the tubes were weighed and irrigated at intervals of 2 3 days 2 2 morphological traits at harvest plant height cm was measured with a ruler from the tube surface to the last developed leaf visible ligule then the plant stalks were separated from the leaves and inserted into paper envelopes for oven drying at 70 ºc for 72 h to determine leaf and stalk biomass g the leaf area m2 was calculated based on pictures of each plant supplementary material fig 1 the images were acquired with a sony α6000 digital slr sony corporation japan 24 5 megapixel resolution camera with a 23 5 15 6

adaxial and abaxial epidermal surface of the middle third of the last developed leaf specifically between the central rib and the leaf edge was varnished with nail polish after drying for 10 min the dried varnish layer was lifted off with adhesive tape and transferred to a glass slide the numbers of stomata s and epidermal cells e were counted under a microscope with a 10 x ocular and 40 x objective lens three microscope fields were counted in each adaxial and abaxial leaf replicate according to radoglou and jarvis 1990 stomatal density sd stomata mm 2 and epidermal cell density ecd

direct evaporation from the substrate surface in addition based on the shoot leaf stalk biomass weight ab and et the agronomic water use efficiency wueagro g kg 1 at harvest was calculated as wue agro ab et 2 9 stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures the isotope ratios of stable carbon 13c 12c and nitrogen 15n 14n together with total nitrogen content were determined in samples of the last

1989 2 10 root traits at harvest the tubes were opened to separate the substrate from the roots first the substrate core was cut into five equal sections each 0 30 m long obtained from the upper surface of the tubes to the lower end in the following layers 0 30 cm a 30 60 cm b 60 90 cm c 90 120 cm d and 120 150 cm e afterwards samples were gently shaken and then washed with tap water using mesh to remove the soil finally root samples were rinsed with distilled water and lightly dried with paper towels specific root length and root weight density were determined separately for each layer from each core section a random sample of 4 5 root segments was collected from the total amount of roots recovered and stored in a fridge 4ºc to later calculate the specific root length srl to that end the root samples were spread in a plastic tray 21 0 29 7 cm containing about 1 0 l water depth 0 5 1 0 cm and photographed with a sony α6000 dslr camera sony corporation japan thereafter the images were processed using imagej software root images supplementary material fig 2 were analyzed with gia roots software galkovskyi et al 2012 which includes user assisted algorithms to distinguish

results 3 1 growth traits leaf pigments chlorophyll fluorescence and n status the growth leaf pigments and n status traits studied differed statistically between inbred lines and hybrids except for plant area and the specific leaf area under ww conditions table 1 water conditions did not affect the flavonoid anthocyanin or the nitrogen contents or stable nitrogen isotope composition δ15ndm in dry matter moreover no effect of the genotype by water condition g wc interaction was observed for plant area plant height flavonoid or anthocyanin all chlorophyll fluorescence traits differed significantly between wcs table 1 the maximum quantum yield of psii fv fm the quantum yield of photosystem ii φpsii and the quantum yield of non regulated non photochemical energy loss in ps ii φno were 21 9 53 6 and 24 7 lower respectively under ws than ww conditions the non photochemical quenching parameter describing regulated dissipation of excess energy npqt and quantum yield of regulated non photochemical energy loss in ps ii φnpq values were 159 4 and 99 2 higher respectively under ws than ww differences between inbred lines and hybrids were only significant for φnpq table 1 with the exception of fv fm and npqt the g wc interaction affected all other traits related to chlorophyll fluorescence table 1 compared to ww conditions soil water stress caused decreases of 15 8 25 8 31 8 and 23 4 in leaf biomass plant area stalk biomass and plant height respectively table 1 decreases in leaf biomass plant area stalk biomass and plant height were higher for the inbred lines i e 19 8 28 6 50 3 and 30 8 respectively than for the hybrids which decreased by 14 8 24 6 26 4 and 21 1 respectively regardless of the wcs the values of these traits were higher for hybrids heterosis was more marked under ws table 1 thus values for leaf biomass plant area stalk biomass and plant height were 38 9 20 6 72 9 and 25 0 respectively the growth trait least affected in relative terms by water status and heterosis was specific leaf area which was 5 6 higher under ws than ww p 0 05 whereas heterosis under ws was just 5 4 table 1 concerning leaf pigments the chlorophyll content and the nitrogen balance index decreased more in the inbred lines 19 7 and 17 7 respectively than in the hybrids 7 0 and 4 3 respectively under ws and ww conditions in general under both wcs the heterosis values of chlorophyll content and nitrogen balance index were negative but positive for flavonoid and anthocyanin table 1 under both wcs hybrids had higher flavonoid and anthocyanin content resulting in positive estimates of heterosis the heterosis estimates of φpsii npqt and φno were more evident under ws corresponding to 22 7 51 6 and 25 7 respectively than under ww conditions 19 1 21 5 and 3 3 under ww respectively the heterosis estimates of φnpq were 30 9 under ws and 69 2 under ww conditions under both wcs nitrogen content in dry matter was higher in inbred lines and δ15ndm was higher in hybrids and consequently heterosis values were negative for nitrogen content in dry matter but positive for δ15ndm table 1 for both wcs we highlight the importance expressed in of the quadratic components related to general ϕg and specific ϕs combining abilities and reciprocal effects ϕrc of the above growth measures leaf pigments and n status traits fig 2 general combining ability related to the quadratic component ϕg and specific combining ability related to the quadratic component ϕs differed significantly under both wcs for most traits supplementary table 1 quadratic components ϕ with negative general combining ability effects were observed for chlorophyll content 0 52 and nitrogen balance index 0 83 these negative values must be interpreted as estimates of the real value equal to zero supplementary table 1 therefore the quadratic component was no longer considered fig 2 comprising 0 of the variation in this way the component does not explain the genetic variability of the trait in general even though mean squares related to general combining ability related to quadratic component ϕg and reciprocal effect related to quadratic component ϕrc were significant the most important component to determine the traits and to explain most of the genetic variability observed was the quadratic component related to specific combining ability related to quadratic component ϕs with non additive effects being the most prevalent fig 2 the values were evident under ws for flavonoid 58 leaf biomass 85 plant height 50 and stalk biomass 70 traits and under ww leaf biomass 64 nitrogen content in dry matter 64 and pa 53 fig 2 regardless of the wcs and given the large values of residual percentages we observed a high environmental influence on chlorophyll fluorescence traits fig 2 however in φno and φnpq under ws and φnpq under ww φpsii we found that the importance expressed in of the quadratic components related to specific combining ability ϕ s and with predominant non additive effects was the most important to explain the genetic variability for these traits fig 2 the significance of values of the mean squares of general and specific combining ability and reciprocal effect and the respective quadratic components related to ϕg ϕs and ϕrc for chlorophyll fluorescence traits can be found in supplementary table 1 3 2 leaf gas exchange stomatal

conductance g s by 30 0 the transpiration rate e by 28 7 cumulative plant evapotranspiration et by 29 4 and relative leaf water content by 4 3 while increasing the intrinsic water use efficiency wueintrin by 18 3 and δ13c by 7 8 values averaged through both inbreds and hybrids the differences between inbred lines and hybrids were significant for the traits et and δ13c under ws and only for et under ww conditions aside from et these traits were significantly affected by the g wc interaction table 2 the estimated heterosis was modest 10 0 for a g s e and relative leaf water content under both wcs table 2 the heterosis estimates under both wcs for the traits of instantaneous water use efficiency wueinstant wueintrin agronomic water use efficiency wueagro and δ13cdm were low 7 0 the heterosis effects for et were higher corresponding to 47 5 under ws and 31 4 under ww conditions table 2 in general for the stomatal characteristics adaxial adaxial index and density no significant wc and genotype effects were observed in the combined analysis regardless of the wcs these traits did not show contrasts between means in the inbred lines and hybrids therefore the heterosis estimates for the traits were low 13 6 the ϕ s effects related to specific combining ability with non additive effects being prevalent were the most important for explaining the genetic variability for adaxial stomatal density 38 et 77 and wueintrin 42 under ws and for a 58 adaxial stomatal density 49 e 49 and et 66 under ww fig 3 under ws in particular we observed a strong effect of ϕrc related to reciprocal effect on genetic variability expression in a 30 and g s 32 fig 3 supplementary table 1 presents the significance of values of the mean squares of general and specific combining ability and reciprocal effect and the respective quadratic components related to ϕg ϕs and ϕrc for photosynthetic and transpiration gas exchange stomatal characteristics water status and stable carbon isotope composition traits in general regardless of the wcs and given the large residual percentage values we observed a strong environmental influence on leaf gas exchange stomatal characteristics water status and stable c composition fig 2 3 3 root traits no effect of water limitation on root weight density rwd or specific root length srl was detected in the soil sections b and c nor in the shoot to root dry matter ratio shoot root with the exception of srla and srl under ws the differences between inbred lines and hybrids of all root traits were statistically significant table 3 the g by wc interaction was significant for all root traits regardless of the wc the rwd of the hybrids was higher than that of their parents in the different tube sections table 3 a decrease in rwd was observed with increasing root depth under both wcs fig 4a and b the ratio between ws and ww for the rwd of the parents and the hybrids within each tube section showed a lower reduction in the rwd of the hybrids mainly in soil sections c d and e fig 4c the water stress induced decrease in rwd was more prominent in inbred lines with estimates of 47 1 55 0 and 52 6 for sections c d and e respectively compared to the hybrid genotypes with reductions of 42 5 50 3 and 39 9 for the same sections regardless of the wc the values of these sections c d and e were higher for the hybrids than their parents with the exception of rwd in soil section a the heterosis of rwd for the other sections b c d and e was higher under ws in the deeper soil layers the heterosis effects increased for rwd related traits table 3 with the exception of srl in soil section a root related trait estimates were higher under ws in sections b c d and e 6 7 18 7 compared to ww specific root length tended to increase with increasing soil depth under both wcs in general the heterosis values of srl in all tube sections were negative and higher under ww compared to ws conditions table 3 regardless of the wc the shoot to root ratio of the hybrids was lower than in the parents negative heterosis effects were observed under both wcs table 3 for most root traits in both wcs the most important quadratic components importance expressed in were ϕs related to specific combining ability wich non additive effects being the most prevalent fig 5 the significance of values of the mean squares of general and specific combining ability and reciprocal effect and quadratic components related to ϕg ϕs and ϕrc respectively for root traits can be found in supplementary table 1 4 discussion 4 1 growth measures leaf pigments chlorophyll fluorescence and n status regardless of the wcs the hybrid dry biomass was higher than in the inbred lines both for leaves and stalks and the plant height and area were higher as well with more pronounced heterosis values under ws the greater dry matter accumulation before flowering and larger leaf size represented by plant area was associated with a higher whole plant canopy photosynthesis tollenaar et al 2004 in the hybrids compared to the inbreds table 1 the higher photosynthetic area of hybrids compared to inbreds was probably due to greater cell expansion in the former because the density of epidermal cells in the leaves was lower in the hybrids than the inbreds which indicates that hybrid epidermal cells were larger the stomatal density of the adaxial side was also lower in the hybrids compared to the inbreds under both water conditions moreover the stomatal index which is a trait that compares the number of stomata to the number of epidermal cells remained basically constant between hybrids and inbreds further suggesting that a generally greater expansion of cells was responsible for the larger leaf area of the hybrids in contrast to our results blum 2013 and chairi et al 2016 concluded that the heterosis observed in plant growth traits was the result of a larger number of cells instead of a larger cell size greater cell expansion in hybrids compared to inbreds would be present not only in leaves but also in the non laminar parts of the plant overall the greater cell expansion in hybrids occurred under both ww and ws conditions suggesting constitutive differences i e even under well watered conditions in water status between hybrids and lines araus et al 2010 and thus differences in cell turgor also being present concerning the non laminar parts of the plant the structure most affected by ws was the stalk in both the parent inbred lines and hybrids and particularly so for the parents the stalk has both a structural function due to its high lignification and plays a role in photoassimilate storage forell et al 2015 when photoassimilation is reduced the increase in stalk biomass is decelerated which should also intensify stalk lodging robertson et al 2017 in that sense the hybrids are also better suited than the inbreds to adapt to water stress conditions in our study the specific leaf area was greater under ws and under this condition the parents had the highest values resulting in negative heterosis values whereas no clear differences occurred under ww conditions resulting in negligible heterosis effects although water stress is considered to induce plant morphoanatomical changes leading to reduce specific leaf area zhang et al 2015 this trait is also sensitive to other environmental factors e g temperature and phenology related metabolic variations e g remobilization of photoassimilates song et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 the slightly higher specific leaf area of inbreds compared to hybrids under ww conditions means the former exhibit thinner and or less dense leaves garnier et al 1997 vergara díaz et al 2016 probably associated with a reduced cell expansion relative to the hybrids however the larger cell expansion of the hybrids may also account for the lower nitrogen content on a dry matter basis as well as the lower nitrogen balance index and chlorophyll content on a per area basis the last two measured with a dualex sensor of the hybrids compared to the inbreds in fact the estimates of heterosis for the chlorophyll and nitrogen contents were negative under both wcs although the parents showed the greatest reductions in both traits due to ws previous studies in maize have found no heterosis effects on leaf n content in field grown adult plants araus et al 2010 and on n uptake in maize seedlings chairi et al 2016 the higher vigor of maize hybrids relative to their parents may lead to lower nitrogen content in plant tissues due to the increased demand holá et al 2017 in any case when net assimilation rates on a per area basis are considered the higher nitrogen and chlorophyll contents in the inbreds may be counteracted by the better water status of the hybrids particularly under ws conditions where δ13c clearly indicated a better water status of the hybrids while specific leaf area was lower in fact we found only marginally higher net assimilation rates on a per area basis in the hybrids compared to the inbred lines which agrees with previous studies where heterosis for net assimilation was marginal at least under well watered conditions chairi et al 2016 in the same sense no differences were reported in the net assimilation of hybrids and their parental inbred lines at silking ahmadzadeh et al 2004 therefore differences between parents and hybrids with regards to assimilation rate on a per area basis were either marginal or simply not significant particularly under ww conditions however it is worth mentioning that hybrids had a considerably greater photosynthetic leaf surface and therefore the total net assimilation per plant was higher in hybrids than in inbreds chairi et al 2016 described that a marked heterosis effect on net assimilation and transpiration was only evidenced when these traits were expressed per whole leaf or plant rather than on a per unit area basis however araus et al 2010 under full field conditions also reported higher stomatal conductance and transpiration rates on a per unit area basis in hybrids than in their parents even under ww conditions in our study the higher δ13c values under ws conditions of hybrids compared to the inbreds supports a better water status in the former farquhar et al 1989 araus et al 2010 in spite of no differences in instantaneous gas exchange measures gs and t being recorded in paralell the higher δ15n values in hybrids compared to the inbreds with heterosis being higher under ws compared to ww conditions further supports the notion that hybrids experienced less water stress and that even under ww conditions nitrogen uptake and further metabolism were more efficient in the hybrids yousfi et al 2009 2012 however chairi et al 2016 found no significant differences in δ15n between lines and hybrids in agreement with the literature water stress induced a generalized decrease in photosynthetic psii efficiency and an increase in heat dissipation kuhlgert et al 2016 therefore ws triggered a photoprotective response that contributed to the preservation of the reaction centers through increased heat dissipation at the expense of psii efficiency and thus there was a consequent fall in assimilation rate however in spite of the fact that all chlorophyll fluorescence traits were sensitive to ws only φnpq differed between the hybrids and their parents under any of the wcs thus hybrids showed a significantly higher φnpq and hence positive heterosis values regardless of the water conditions therefore our results suggest that maize hybrids possess a greater photoprotective response which may have conferred an adaptive advantage with regard to the parents eventually contributing to a better physiological agronomic performance kuhlgert et al 2016 in terms of the leaf accessory pigments hybrids showed higher flavonoid and anthocyanin contents regardless of the wc resulting in positive estimates of heterosis flavonoids and anthocyanins are phenolic compounds of ecophysiological relevance that function as antioxidants osmoregulators and photoprotective compounds in plant cells chalker scott 1999 gould et al 2002 mazza et al 2000 steyn et al 2002 as such they are implicated in plant responses to environmental stress including water stress nakabayashi et al 2014 thus these compounds prevent the proliferation of reactive oxygen species that may endanger cell metabolism and homeostasis kalaji et al 2017 wahid et al 2007 in the present work the higher content of phenolic compounds in the hybrids than in inbred lines may represent an adaptive advantage that might contribute to a greater drought tolerance through avoidance of photoinhibition the other two fluorescence traits φpsii and φno also differed between inbreds and hybrids but in the case of φpsii heterosis changed from positive under ws to negative under ww conditions whereas φno was negative under ws and near zero under ww conditions generally an increase in thermal dissipation by unregulated processes φno under severe stress conditions can indicate photoinactivation busch et al 2009 according to these authors higher a values are positively correlated with φpsii busch et al 2009 our results showed a slight tendency towards higher a and φpsii values in hybrids mainly under ws 4 2 water status and cumulative evapotranspiration despite the reduction in relative leaf water content under ws compared to ww conditions this was not an important trait for differentiating the parents from their hybrids resulting in estimates of null heterosis it has been reported that genotypes with greater ws tolerance have a higher relative leaf water content mainly due to the ability to grow a deeper root system and extract water from deeper soil layers or as a result of greater osmotic adjustment gao and lynch 2016 or because they control transpiratory losses more efficiently higher relative leaf water content may allow greater stomatal opening and thus maintenance of photosynthetic metabolism to some extent blum 2011 on the other hand water deficit induced a higher wue as shown by the significant difference in wueintrin between ws and ww conditions in the same sense δ13c values were more negative under ws than under ww conditions opposite to the pattern reported for c3 species water stress in a c4 species like maize causes more negative δ13c values which is associated with a higher time integrated intrinsic wue farquhar et al 1989 cabrera bosquet et al 2009 araus et al 2010 chairi et al 2016 concerning the differences between inbred lines and the corresponding hybrids the later exhibited slightly higher wueintrin and wueinstant regardless of the wcs however δ13c was more negative in the inbreds than hybrids at least under ws conditions which suggests that inbred lines suffer more water stress under ws conditions however besides that no significant differences existed between wcs or between hybrids and their parents for wueagro even though heterosis under ws conditions was slightly higher in hybrids than in inbreds it is likely that the level of water stress was moderate which while preventing net assimilation rates from differing markedly between inbreds and hybrids resulted in the plants adjusting the growth of the photosynthetic area to the available water also it should be noted that calculations of cumulative plant evapotranspiration et did not consider the weight of the growing plants thus causing a certain underestimation of the amount of water needed to reach 100 and 35 of the relative field capacity of the tubes and consequently the heterosis values of et tended to be underestimated as hybrids grew and weight increased there was increasing underestimation of the et of these genotypes and consequently its heterosis effect under ws in particular this fact may have influenced the wueagro values which were higher in hybrids but did not differ statistically between parents and f1 the above reasons may justify at least in part the lack of differences in wueagro between inbred lines and hybrids in any case the heterosis values for cumulative plant et were high especially under ws in the study of chairi et al 2016 the authors described that heterosis in maize seedlings manifests as higher plant water consumption under both wcs which results in hybrids being more vigorous than the corresponding inbred lines this agrees with the increased cumulative leaf biomass and plant area sustaining a higher cumulative et in hybrids compared with inbreds requires a suitably adapted root system 4 3 root traits in response to ws root weight density rwd decreased in all studied soil strata fig 4a b in both parents and hybrids roots play an important adaptive role in drought prone environments and in this situation a better developed system especially in deeper soil layers favors higher grain yields ali et al 2016 according to lambers et al 2002 under ws the metabolic cost of the root system to explore the soil is high and can exceed a plant s daily photosynthetic rate by 50 for this reason plants under ws tend to have lower rwd and this was around 39 8 in our observations table 3 the hybrids had higher values for rwd than the inbreds regardless of the soil section a b c d or e fig 4a and b indicating a better developed root system in addition the hybrids showed a higher rwd ratio rwd ws rwd ww when comparing wcs fig 4c it is noteworthy that these values were the highest in sections c d and e indicating greater investment and deeper root development in response to drought adaptation fig 4c from the five studied sections of rwd heterosis was more evident in the four deepest soil sections under both wcs but mainly under ws the root system developed in deeper soil layers contributes to an efficient water extraction from these more distant profiles lynch 2013 a finding observed in popcorn hybrids that tends to provide adaptive advantages to ws in the field ali et al 2016 reported under ws field conditions a correlation between the biomass of deep maize roots 45 cm and higher grain yield whereas the development of deeper roots is relevant for drought tolerance heterosis effects in root length and root dry matter on popcorn genotypes are already evident during the early stages of plant development a few days after germination rockenbach et al 2018 similar results have also been reported in seedlings of other maize categories chairi et al 2016 under field conditions the heterosis advantage in terms of deeper roots may be even more relevant than under controlled experimental setups based on lysimeters even when long lysimeters were deployed as in our study 1 5 m deep lysimeters were used the specific root length srl tended to increase i e roots to become thinner with increasing substrate depth strata b c d and e in both genotype groups and wcs the greater biological activity of thinner roots which are responsible for nutrient uptake is well known eissenstat 1992 also plants with high srl tend to have higher water uptake rates elazab et al 2012 however inbreds exhibited thinner roots than hybrids which may contradict the positive role of thinner roots thus under both wcs and in the five soil segments the inbred lines exhibited higher srl thinner roots resulting in negative heterosis values contrastingly li et al 2008 reported greater development of fine roots in maize hybrid seedlings as compared to their parents under ws it is believed that the lower availability of photoassimilates due to water stress may contribute to higher srl values under ws compared to ww conditions the same rationale may be applied for the comparison between inbreds and hybrids with the former exhibiting thinner roots i e higher srl in order to optimize the photoassimilates available for growing roots a greater srl may also be a consequence of a less compact structure for example with aerenchyma in the cortex chairi et al 2016 in this sense elazab et al 2012 reported a water stress driven increase in srl in durum wheat reinforcing the role of thin roots i e high srl for the maintenance of high transpiration rates in any case a greater root plasticity of the hybrids compared to their parents was noticed since the srl values of the latter were similar under both wcs whereas they increased in hybrids in response to water stress in that sense chairi et al 2016 suggested that the acclimation capacity of the root structure to ws is lower in the parents than in the hybrids regarding the shoot to root dry matter ratio water stress tended to induce higher values but the differences were not significant previous works have reported a decrease in the shoot to root ratio in response to water limitation chairi et al 2016 kamphorst et al 2020a for their part hybrids showed lower shoot to root ratios than their parents resulting in negative estimates of heterosis this was indicative of a greater plasticity in root development and adaptation in the hybrids particularly in response to ws conditions our results are in line with the negative heterosis effect on this ratio reported by chairi et al 2016 in maize seedlings 4 4 implications for plant breeding in general ws discriminated the studied genotypes more clearly as well as the heterosis values which were also higher under this condition this can be explained by the fact that the genotypes differed more under ws which should also result in higher heritability values in agreement with that kamphorst et al 2019 found higher heritabilities under ws when evaluating popcorn genotypes under different water regimes in the field indicating greater reliability in the selection under this wc due to the higher genetic variance moreover based on the mean square estimates of the effects there was no change between the wcs of the quadratic component with highest relevance for the traits evaluated in this study this implies that the mode of trait expression is the same under both wcs in an inheritance study lima et al 2019 established that the genetic effects were the same under ws and ww conditions in popcorn and inferred that the same breeding methods could be applied for both wcs nevertheless the genetic gain will be greater under ws as stated by kamphorst et al 2019 2021a and lima et al 2019 there is a greater influence of non additive effects related to specific combining ability on the control of leaf biomass plant area the content of chlorophyll flavonoids and anthocyanins and the nitrogen balance index as well as the leaf nitrogen content and δ15n in traits under both wcs therefore it can be concluded that the exploration of heterosis is recommended as a strategy to achieve genetic gains cruz et al 2014 hallauer et al 2010 although the mean square of specific combining ability ϕ s is predominant for most traits as shown by the relative importance in fig 2 some of them also have a significant general combining ability ϕ g and reciprocal effect ϕ rc component indicating the influence of both additive and non additive gene action and the influence of the female parent even if to a lesser extent indeed ϕ s was the most important component to determine these traits and it also explained the genetic variability fig 2 as pointed out by tollenaar et al 2004 and observed in the present work the superiority of the maize hybrids manifested as dry matter accumulation before flowering in the leaf and stalk biomass and greater plant area in terms of leaf size and leaf area index and these factors were due to heterosis although the effect of the quadratic component of specific combining ability stood out for chlorophyll and the nitrogen balance index in other words ϕ s was the most important component to determine the traits and it also explained genetic variability the heterosis values were negative indicating that the hybrids had lower values for these traits than their parents this is due to the fact that a larger plant size normally observed in hybrids sees investment of the n in growth in other words hybrids exhibit faster leaf growth than the inbred lines and this is associated with a dilution effect with regard to the n content in this case n content measured on a dry matter basis in leaves is lower in the hybrids but positive heterosis in n would be detected by total plant n content instead of n content per unit dry matter the potential disadvantage of the hybrids in terms of lower leaf n was noticed particularly under ws as described by holá et al 2017 however we consider that a lower n content on a dry matter basis or on a per unit area basis in the hybrids is a positive trait in the sense that it is an indicator of a faster growth in the hybrids compared to the inbred lines the same rationale applies to the total chlorophyll content which was lower in the hybrids than in the inbred lines indeed the leaf chlorophyll content measured under contrasting water environments in a diallel involving ws tolerant tropical maize parents was reported to have a predominant general combining ability effect erdal et al 2016 these authors concluded that ϕ g was the most important component to determine the traits and it also explained the genetic variability in fact additive and non additive effects have been cited as being involved in the expression of traits related to leaf greenness to our understanding increasing these values under field conditions would be advantageous because higher leaf green values are associated with grain production cairns et al 2012 given the prevalence of the quadratic effects of specific combining ability we recommended further exploration of heterosis to increase root weight density rwd and specific root length srl in ws and ww environments indeed ϕ s was the most important component to determine these traits and it also explained the genetic variability fig 4 in a study carried out under ww and ws conditions ali et al 2016 described highly positive correlations between grain yield and root biomass in maize hybrids on the other hand in the evaluation of a maize diallel under abiotic stresses n and water stress chun et al 2005 observed that for rwd in particular the heterosis values were significant under the different n levels studied which was attributed to the significant general and specific combining ability effects and mainly the latter based on these reports and our results we emphasize that the use of hybrids can ensure improved root development under ws unlike the observations under ws additive effects related to general combining ability were predominant for stalk biomass plant height and specific leaf area under ww conditions this means that ϕ gwas the most important component to determine these traits and it also explained the genetic variability fig 2 evaluating a complete maize diallel in the field under stressful and non stressful water regimes wattoo et al 2014 described the significance of general and specific combining ability under both wcs which indicated the influence of both additive and non additive gene action with greater influence of the former additive effects were also observed for δ13c under both wcs in our study it is believed that the presence of one parent with a high mean in a negative sense may cause an interference resulting in the mean of the hybrids becoming the mean performance of the parents it was assumed that the cytoplasmic effect and the nuclear genes of the maternal genotype influenced gas exchange traits a g s and e under both wcs however this effect was even clearer under ws which means that ϕ rc was the most important component to determine these traits and it also explained the genetic variability observed the reciprocal effect in crosses is due to the action of mitochondrial and chloroplast genes extrachromosomal effect and genes from the nucleus of the maternal parent maternal effect cruz et al 2014 reciprocal effects on the chlorophyll a b and ab contents in millet genotypes have also been described evaluated in a complete diallel of 10 parents mehndiratta and phul 1983 in this sense it can be acknowledged that the extrachromosomal genes associated with photosynthesis in the female parent interfere with the agronomic performance of the hybrids therefore when breeding hybrids it is recommended to prioritize the parent with the highest photosynthetic rate as the female parent especially under drought conditions 5 conclusions the effects of heterosis in popcorn related to biomass were the result of better growth in the shoots which increased the photosynthetic area of the plant as well as the roots which secured an efficient capture of water hybrid vigor was even more evident under water stress conditions which further highlights the importance of an efficient albeit plastic root system in the hybrids by contrast the potential role of a higher net assimilation rate per unit area in the hybrid vigor was minor at best if not completely absent even when the leaves of the hybrids exhibited somewhat better photoprotective mechanisms than the inbred lines despite a lack of difference in instantaneous measurements of stomatal conductance and transpiration between hybrids and inbreds the δ13c of dry matter provided a clue about the better water status in hybrids compared to inbreds under ws in addition hybrids exhibited higher δ15n in leaves than the inbreds particularly under ws conditions this further supported the role of the roots in the hybrids in not only securing more efficient water uptake but also more efficient nitrogen uptake concerning leaf growth this study also evidenced that the lower nitrogen and chlorophyll content of leaves in hybrids compared with inbred lines is likely the result of faster leaf growth in the former since the non additive gene effects due to quadratic components related to specific combining ability comprising most of the genetic variability are responsible for the control of most shoot growth and root traits and especially so under water stress the success of breeding programs for drought adaptation requires appropriate exploitation of heterosis magnifying wherever possible the traits that confer hybrid vigor for traits related to gas exchange leaf net co2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance it was assumed that the cytoplasmic effect and the nuclear genes of the maternal genotype were an influence under ws therefore the choice of the female parent is essential to breed for

9736,nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k are essential elements for crop growth the absorption accumulation process and distribution of these nutrients affect not only the growth and grain yield but also the grain quality of wheat triticum aestivum l various fertilization and irrigation practices can influence wheat growth as well as the absorption and utilization of nutrient elements a four season 2014 2018 experiment was conducted on drip fertigated winter wheat on the loess plateau of china with three irrigation levels and three fertilization rates irrigation rates included normal irrigation w1 mild deficit irrigation w2 and more severe deficit irrigation w3 while fertilization rates n p2o5 k2o included f1 175 117 150 kg ha 1 f2 125 84 108 kg ha 1 and f3 75 50 65 kg ha 1 the results showed that npk uptake in aboveground biomass decreased as the water stress increased but there was no significant difference between w1 and w2 when sufficient water and fertilizer were applied the stem leaf and rachis glume obtained higher proportion of np while grain nitrogen and phosphorus harvest index nhi and phi decreased when the supply of water and fertilizer was insufficient nhi and phi increased and the proportion of vegetative organs was relatively low the average npk requirement for 100 kg grain gnr gpr and gkr varied 1 93 3 03 0 37 0 41 and 2 26 2 93 kg over the four seasons gnr and gkr increased with increasing irrigation and fertilization regimes with the increase of irrigation amount irrigation water use efficiency iwue first increased and then decreased slightly and the maximum iwue occurred under w2 yield and iwue increased with the increase of fertilization rate but there was no significant difference between f1 and f2 f2 obtained higher partial factor productivity than f1 f1 and f2 had no significant difference in protein content and protein yield but they obtained significantly higher values than f3 therefore w2f2 was an efficient water and fertilizer management practice for drip fertigated winter wheat which promoted nutrients transfer to grains without significantly reducing grain yield and protein keywords drip fertigation nutrient uptake nutrient partitioning partial factor productivity irrigation water use efficiency 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l as a staple food is a widely cultivated cereal crop for national and global food security global population obtain over 45 of calories and over 40 of protein from wheat dhillon et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 china is the largest wheat producer and consumer around the world producing 133 6 million tons wheat with 23 7 million ha planting area in 2019 fao 2019 water is one of the limited resources and vital elements for agricultural production in the arid and semi arid regions on the loess plateau of china such as the guanzhong plain xu et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 severe water shortage and uneven precipitation distribution have become major challenges for meeting the growth needs of winter wheat and supplementary irrigation is thus urgent for wheat production xu et al 2020 motazedian et al 2019 hence developing suitable irrigation scheduling is imperative and potential to support optimal plant growth xie et al 2017 fan et al 2020 fertilization also plays an important role in agricultural production wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2013a the increasing water shortages and excessive nitrogen fertilizer application are two major challenges that the chinese agriculture is currently facing wu et al 2020 in pursuit of high yield nitrogen fertilizers applied by farmers far exceeds the crop demand zhang et al 2015 excessive fertilization potentially leads to soil degradation and groundwater pollution yan et al 2021 previous studies indicated that an appropriate soil moisture promoted n availability and the simultaneous utilization of water li et al 2019 di paolo and rinaldi 2008 therefore there is a pressing demand for synergetic improvement of irrigation and fertilization for wheat production in the arid and semi arid regions with the increasingly serious agricultural pollution and water shortage in the guanzhong plain drip irrigation has started to be used to support sustainable crop production in the region bai et al 2020 drip irrigation as a high performance irrigation system supplies water to the root area at very low rates and provides uttermost water productivity by keeping soil moisture at 50 60 field capacity wang et al 2013 li et al 2018 drip irrigation dramatically enhances the water and fertilizer use efficiency lv et al 2019 and improves wheat yield rekaby et al 2016 and water productivity over traditional irrigation systems such as flood irrigation chen et al 2015 wang et al 2013 ayars et al 2015 when combined with drip irrigation both water and nutrients can be manipulated to obtain the maximum possible yield and alleviate environmental disruption tian et al 2017 eissa et al 2018 with given water and fertilizers inputs drip fertigation an effectively modern fertilization technique can supply water and fertilizers simultaneously to the plant root zone according to the water and nutrients requirements of crops fan et al 2017 zhang et al 2013b in recent years drip fertigation has been gradually adopted in cereal crops in the arid and semi arid regions jha et al 2019 mostafa et al 2018 yan et al 2019 researches have investigated the effects of drip fertigation on crop yield bai et al 2020 rekaby et al 2016 water movement and nitrogen transport in soils sui et al 2015 and optimized irrigation and nitrogen fertilization scheduling jha et al 2019 mehmood et al 2019 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2017a however few studies have been conducted to assess the applicability of water and fertilizer saving strategies with drip fertigation on water and nutrients utilization of winter wheat in the arid and semi arid regions therefore more research is needed to explore how much water and nutrients are absorbed and utilized by wheat plants under severe water shortage environment especially with drip fertigation technique for the efficient utilization of resources and sustainable agricultural development for feeding the growing population on the limited cropland not only achieving high yield but also obtaining grain protein content is a major goal in wheat production especially in regions where the dietary protein intake depends mainly on protein in cereal grains ma et al 2019 shi et al 2010 zhang et al 2013a however it has been difficult to enhance grain yield and grain protein content simultaneously because of n dilution in grain and the negative genetic relationship between both of them li et al 2021b to date there has been little agreement on the relationship between irrigation amount and grain protein content zeleke and nendel 2016 found that supplemental irrigation reduced the protein content of wheat grains in south eastern australia rezaei et al 2010 reported that moderate water deficit irrigation during the grain filling stage of wheat increased grain protein content with a slight decrease in grain yield besides that nitrogen fertilizer application was the most effective input in terms of improving yield and grain protein concentration in wheat production grahmann et al 2014 malik et al 2013 flagella et al 2010 previous studies indicated that grain yield and protein content of winter wheat were positively related to the n fertilizer application rates in all years and various planting sites ma et al 2019 zhang et al 2017a excessive and insufficient nitrogen supply however decreased both grain yield and grain protein content wu et al 2019 therefore seeking the optimum regimes of irrigation and fertilizer application is a critical issue for enhancing grain yield and quality in wheat production the objectives of this study were thus to understand the variations of nutrient absorption and distribution in the vegetative organs of winter wheat and to explore nutrient harvest index and nutrients requirement of 100 kg grain under different irrigation and fertilization practices this study aims to provide a scientific basis for the effective management of drip fertigation for winter wheat production on the loess plateau of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field

and distribution of winter wheat nutrient absorption of crops is closely related to variety fertilization precipitation and soil conditions andresen et al 2016 ning et al 2013 bruns and ebelhar 2006 chen et al 2016 cao et al 2017 reported that there was a positively linear relationship between npk absorption of aboveground dry matter and grain yield according to data from 52 experimental sites during 2009 2013 liu et al 2006 estimated the npk demand of various yields by using the quefts model and found that the npk uptake increased with yield based on from 1985 to 1995 in china similarly this is in accordance with our results indicating that adequate water and fertilizer supply was conducive to npk absorption by crops and suitable water and fertilizer supply improved nutrient transport from vegetative organs to grain yield and npk harvest index distribution of nutrients npk in wheat grain decreased under f1 this was because that nutrients absorbed from soils could not be effectively transported to grains when nutrient supply capacity of soils exceeded the nutrient demand of grains resulting in higher nutrient content accumulated in nutrient organs it was consistent with the results from previous studies li et al 2019 besides wang and li 2002 studied the effects of irrigation at different growth stages of winter wheat on nutrients npk absorption by a greenhouse pot experiment and found that tillering stage jointing stage and filling stage were the key stages affected by water deficit and water deficit reduced the dry weight of seedlings by 36 1 72 3 total nitrogen absorption by 40 6 72 8 phosphorus absorption by 40 5 72 4 and potassium absorption by 25 9 69 5 this finding was generally in agreement with results in our study under the same fertilization rate total npk uptake decreased with increasing water stress compared with w3 total npk uptake under w1 increased by 26 89 25 73 and 16 24 and by 21 21 20 78 and 13 93 under w2 respectively however w1 and w2 had no significant difference in total npk uptake p 0 05 table 2 4 2 effects of water and fertilizer supply on grain protein content of winter wheat this study showed that irrigation had no significant effect on protein content p 0 05 table 1 protein content and protein yield of f1 and f2 had no significant difference regardless of the water deficit levels p 0 05 there are several possible explanations for this result firstly increased moisture supply had a relatively greater impact on starch synthesis grain yield reduction and grain nitrogen content increase galindo et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a secondly variation of grain nitrogen and protein content is influenced by the balance between the increases in grain yields and its nutrient exports yang et al 2014 in addition fertilization significantly affected protein content and f3 obtained significantly lower protein content and protein yield than f1 and f2 p 0 05 table 1 this supports evidence from previous observations showing nutrients applied over crop demands may result in offset positive nutrient effects on grain yield chen et al 2016 furthermore in the present study different year types influenced grain protein content of winter wheat significantly p 0 05 table 1 these results are likely to be related to the continuous rainy weather during 2015 2016 resulting lower air temperature and solar radiation during this period and indirectly affecting the growth environment of wheat fig 1 4 3 effects of water and fertilizer supply on npk harvest indexes and 100 kg grain npk requirement of winter wheat in this study the ranges of average nhi phi and khi were 77 08 81 88 81 12 88 64 and 16 62 19 34 respectively researcher reported that nhi ranged from 71 72 to 82 85 across all irrigation treatments in a northern chinese field where water resources were scarce jia et al 2021 ma et al 2017 pointed out that in high medium and low yield fields in dryland of shanxi and shaanxi province on the loess plateau of china average nhi phi and khi ranged from 73 to 77 from 82 to 86 and from 20 to 23 respectively phi obtained in this study was consistent with the above study in dryland but nhi and khi were slightly higher and lower respectively the reason may be that the fertilizer supply characteristics of drip fertigation was consistent with nutrient requirements of wheat growth the relatively sufficient fertilizer supply resulted in the increase of nitrogen content in grain and nitrogen harvest index fig 3 and table 2 another possible reason would be that khi slightly reduced with the wheat yield zhan et al 2016 water and fertilizer supply met the growth demand of wheat and sufficient grain filling led to grain potassium content decreased slightly yan et al 2020 additionally the nutrients proportion of stem leaf cob husk and grain varied with various water and fertilization supplies over different growing seasons fig 3 when sufficient water and fertilizers were applied the proportions of n and p uptake in stem leaf cob glume were higher than that in grain resulting in reducing nhi and phi however the proportions of k uptake in stem and grain were lower and k uptake in leaf and cob glume were relatively high total nutrients amount required for the formation of grain yield reflects the nutrient demand of crops for production which is the main parameter for the calculation of recommended fertilization amount zhan et al 2016 liu et al 2006 reported that npk requirement for 100 kg grain reached 2 46 0 37 and 2 30 kg respectively it has been concluded that average npk requirement for 100 kg grain ranged from 2 67 to 3 04 kg from 0 31 to 0 32 kg and from 1 52 to 1 78 kg in 282 farmers dryland fields of shanxi and shaanxi on the loess plateau of china ma et al 2017 similarly our study indicated average npk requirement for 100 kg grain gnr gpr and gkr of four growing seasons under various water and fertilization management practices were 1 93 3 03 0 37 0 41 and 2 26 2 93 kg respectively gpr and gkr were slightly higher than that in drylands mainly because irrigation promoted the absorption of phosphorus p and potassium k fertilizers and thus increased p and k requirement 4 4 effects of water and fertilizer supply on yield iwue and pfp of winter wheat irrigation can reduce the inhibitory effects of drought stress promote crop growth and then achieve high level production this study also confirmed the promoting effect of irrigation showing that w1 and w2 had the significantly higher grain yield than w3 besides that results of our study showed that grain yield in w1 increased with fertilization amount significantly p 0 05 table 1 the reason is that fertilization could promote crop growth and improve the lack of fertilizer supply capacity of soil previous studies showed that the increase of fertilizer input especially nitrogen fertilizer can promote crop growth improve photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content which help leaves intercept more light energy to obtain higher dry biomass and yield fois et al 2009 mon et al 2016 however f3 obtained significantly lower grain yield than f1 and f2 under w2 and w3 p 0 05 through a four year field experiment of irrigation and fertilization zhang et al 2018 found that irrigation quota of 60 mm at the jointing stage and heading stage and nitrogen fertilizer amount of 100 kg ha 1 could meet the normal growth of winter wheat for obtaining higher yield and fertilizer use efficiency instead of higher irrigation and fertilization treatments iwue of w2 and w3 were about 15 higher than that of w1 and iwue under f1 and f2 were 24 48 25 67 higher than that under f3 iwue improved with the increase of fertilization however it reduced with the increase of irrigation amount the primary reason for this inconsistency is that unsuitable irrigation affects root growth root nutrients and water uptake and ultimately affect water use efficiency ali et al 2019 zhao et al 2022 and the recycling of assimilated dry matter before anthesis is inhibited under excessive irrigation zhang et al 2015 moreover unlike iwue pfp reduced with increasing fertilizers input f1 and f2 compared with f3 decreased pfp by 45 89 and 25 48 and w1 and w2 compared with w3 enhanced pfp by 15 42 18 53 previous research findings into the effects of fertilizer rate on pfp have been consistent li et al 2021 importantly with the increase of fertilization rate yield and iwue improved but pfp showed an opposite trend f1 and f2 had no significant difference in yield but pfp under f2 was 31 27 43 93 higher than that under f1 hence f2 was an economical fertilization management practice for stable yield this confirmed the findings of jiang et al 2016 and zhang et al 2017b which found that suitable fertilization rate was conductive to obtaining greater number of effective panicles grain number per panicle and grain weight for high yield 5 conclusions total npk uptake reduced with increasing water stress but there was no significant difference between normal irrigation w1 and mild deficit irrigation w2 p 0 05 when sufficient water and fertilizers were applied the proportions of n and p uptake in stem leaf cob glume were higher than that in grain resulting in lower nhi and phi average n p and k requirement for 100 kg grain gnr gpr and gkr ranged from 1 93 to 3 03 kg from 0 37 to 0 41 kg and from 2 26 to 2 93 kg over the four growing seasons respectively grain yield reduced under water deficit conditions resulting in decreasing partial factor productivity irrigation water use efficiency iwue showed an increasing and then slightly decreasing trend with increasing water deficit with the increase of fertilization rate from f2 to f1 the increase of grain yield was not significant the marginal return decreased and the partial factor productivity decreased in all w2f2 was more beneficial for winter wheat yield which promotes nutrients transfer to grains without significantly reducing yield and keeps high protein content and it was the optimal treatment conducive to the development of high efficient utilization resources agriculture further studies may focus on using crop models to simulate wheat nutrients uptake under various drip fertigation managements and investigating the source sink relationship based on nutrients transport process and the

9736,nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k are essential elements for crop growth the absorption accumulation process and distribution of these nutrients affect not only the growth and grain yield but also the grain quality of wheat triticum aestivum l various fertilization and irrigation practices can influence wheat growth as well as the absorption and utilization of nutrient elements a four season 2014 2018 experiment was conducted on drip fertigated winter wheat on the loess plateau of china with three irrigation levels and three fertilization rates irrigation rates included normal irrigation w1 mild deficit irrigation w2 and more severe deficit irrigation w3 while fertilization rates n p2o5 k2o included f1 175 117 150 kg ha 1 f2 125 84 108 kg ha 1 and f3 75 50 65 kg ha 1 the results showed that npk uptake in aboveground biomass decreased as the water stress increased but there was no significant difference between w1 and w2 when sufficient water and fertilizer were applied the stem leaf and rachis glume obtained higher proportion of np while grain nitrogen and phosphorus harvest index nhi and phi decreased when the supply of water and fertilizer was insufficient nhi and phi increased and the proportion of vegetative organs was relatively low the average npk requirement for 100 kg grain gnr gpr and gkr varied 1 93 3 03 0 37 0 41 and 2 26 2 93 kg over the four seasons gnr and gkr increased with increasing irrigation and fertilization regimes with the increase of irrigation amount irrigation water use efficiency iwue first increased and then decreased slightly and the maximum iwue occurred under w2 yield and iwue increased with the increase of fertilization rate but there was no significant difference between f1 and f2 f2 obtained higher partial factor productivity than f1 f1 and f2 had no significant difference in protein content and protein yield but they obtained significantly higher values than f3 therefore w2f2 was an efficient water and fertilizer management practice for drip fertigated winter wheat which promoted nutrients transfer to grains without significantly reducing grain yield and protein keywords drip fertigation nutrient uptake nutrient partitioning partial factor productivity irrigation water use efficiency 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l as a staple food is a widely cultivated cereal crop for national and global food security global population obtain over 45 of calories and over 40 of protein from wheat dhillon et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 china is the largest wheat producer and consumer around the world producing 133 6 million tons wheat with 23 7 million ha planting area in 2019 fao 2019 water is one of the limited resources and vital elements for agricultural production in the arid and semi arid regions on the loess plateau of china such as the guanzhong plain xu et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 severe water shortage and uneven precipitation distribution have become major challenges for meeting the growth needs of winter wheat and supplementary irrigation is thus urgent for wheat production xu et al 2020 motazedian et al 2019 hence developing suitable irrigation scheduling is imperative and potential to support optimal plant growth xie et al 2017 fan et al 2020 fertilization also plays an important role in agricultural production wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2013a the increasing water shortages and excessive nitrogen fertilizer application are two major challenges that the chinese agriculture is currently facing wu et al 2020 in pursuit of high yield nitrogen fertilizers applied by farmers far exceeds the crop demand zhang et al 2015 excessive fertilization potentially leads to soil degradation and groundwater pollution yan et al 2021 previous studies indicated that an appropriate soil moisture promoted n availability and the simultaneous utilization of water li et al 2019 di paolo and rinaldi 2008 therefore there is a pressing demand for synergetic improvement of irrigation and fertilization for wheat production in the arid and semi arid regions with the increasingly serious agricultural pollution and water shortage in the guanzhong plain drip irrigation has started to be used to support sustainable crop production in the region bai et al 2020 drip irrigation as a high performance irrigation system supplies water to the root area at very low rates and provides uttermost water productivity by keeping soil moisture at 50 60 field capacity wang et al 2013 li et al 2018 drip irrigation dramatically enhances the water and fertilizer use efficiency lv et al 2019 and improves wheat yield rekaby et al 2016 and water productivity over traditional irrigation systems such as flood irrigation chen et al 2015 wang et al 2013 ayars et al 2015 when combined with drip irrigation both water and nutrients can be manipulated to obtain the maximum possible yield and alleviate environmental disruption tian et al 2017 eissa et al 2018 with given water and fertilizers inputs drip fertigation an effectively modern fertilization technique can supply water and fertilizers simultaneously to the plant root zone according to the water and nutrients requirements of crops fan et al 2017 zhang et al 2013b in recent years drip fertigation has been gradually adopted in cereal crops in the arid and semi arid regions jha et al 2019 mostafa et al 2018 yan et al 2019 researches have investigated the effects of drip fertigation on crop yield bai et al 2020 rekaby et al 2016 water movement and nitrogen transport in soils sui et al 2015 and optimized irrigation and nitrogen fertilization scheduling jha et al 2019 mehmood et al 2019 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2017a however few studies have been conducted to assess the applicability of water and fertilizer saving strategies with drip fertigation on water and nutrients utilization of winter wheat in the arid and semi arid regions therefore more research is needed to explore how much water and nutrients are absorbed and utilized by wheat plants under severe water shortage environment especially with drip fertigation technique for the efficient utilization of resources and sustainable agricultural development for feeding the growing population on the limited cropland not only achieving high yield but also obtaining grain protein content is a major goal in wheat production especially in regions where the dietary protein intake depends mainly on protein in cereal grains ma et al 2019 shi et al 2010 zhang et al 2013a however it has been difficult to enhance grain yield and grain protein content simultaneously because of n dilution in grain and the negative genetic relationship between both of them li et al 2021b to date there has been little agreement on the relationship between irrigation amount and grain protein content zeleke and nendel 2016 found that supplemental irrigation reduced the protein content of wheat grains in south eastern australia rezaei et al 2010 reported that moderate water deficit irrigation during the grain filling stage of wheat increased grain protein content with a slight decrease in grain yield besides that nitrogen fertilizer application was the most effective input in terms of improving yield and grain protein concentration in wheat production grahmann et al 2014 malik et al 2013 flagella et al 2010 previous studies indicated that grain yield and protein content of winter wheat were positively related to the n fertilizer application rates in all years and various planting sites ma et al 2019 zhang et al 2017a excessive and insufficient nitrogen supply however decreased both grain yield and grain protein content wu et al 2019 therefore seeking the optimum regimes of irrigation and fertilizer application is a critical issue for enhancing grain yield and quality in wheat production the objectives of this study were thus to understand the variations of nutrient absorption and distribution in the vegetative organs of winter wheat and to explore nutrient harvest index and nutrients requirement of 100 kg grain under different irrigation and fertilization practices this study aims to provide a scientific basis for the effective management of drip fertigation for winter wheat production on the loess plateau of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field

fertilization rate total potassium uptake decreased with the increasing water stress there was no significant difference in average potassium uptake among the four growing seasons but the average potassium uptake during 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 decreased slightly compared with that during other two growing seasons table 2 average proportions of potassium uptake by stem leaf cob husk and grain

and distribution of winter wheat nutrient absorption of crops is closely related to variety fertilization precipitation and soil conditions andresen et al 2016 ning et al 2013 bruns and ebelhar 2006 chen et al 2016 cao et al 2017 reported that there was a positively linear relationship between npk absorption of aboveground dry matter and grain yield according to data from 52 experimental sites during 2009 2013 liu et al 2006 estimated the npk demand of various yields by using the quefts model and found that the npk uptake increased with yield based on from 1985 to 1995 in china similarly this is in accordance with our results indicating that adequate water and fertilizer supply was conducive to npk absorption by crops and suitable water and fertilizer supply improved nutrient transport from vegetative organs to grain yield and npk harvest index distribution of nutrients npk in wheat grain decreased under f1 this was because that nutrients absorbed from soils could not be effectively transported to grains when nutrient supply capacity of soils exceeded the nutrient demand of grains resulting in higher nutrient content accumulated in nutrient organs it was consistent with the results from previous studies li et al 2019 besides wang and li 2002 studied the effects of irrigation at different growth stages of winter wheat on nutrients npk absorption by a greenhouse pot experiment and found that tillering stage jointing stage and filling stage were the key stages affected by water deficit and water deficit reduced the dry weight of seedlings by 36 1 72 3 total nitrogen absorption by 40 6 72 8 phosphorus absorption by 40 5 72 4 and potassium absorption by 25 9 69 5 this finding was generally in agreement with results in our study under the same fertilization rate total npk uptake decreased with increasing water stress compared with w3 total npk uptake under w1 increased by 26 89 25 73 and 16 24 and by 21 21 20 78 and 13 93 under w2 respectively however w1 and w2 had no significant difference in total npk uptake p 0 05 table 2 4 2 effects of water and fertilizer supply on grain protein content of winter wheat this study showed that irrigation had no significant effect on protein content p 0 05 table 1 protein content and protein yield of f1 and f2 had no significant difference regardless of the water deficit levels p 0 05 there are several possible explanations for this result firstly increased moisture supply had a relatively greater impact on starch synthesis grain yield reduction and grain nitrogen content increase galindo et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a secondly variation of grain nitrogen and protein content is influenced by the balance between the increases in grain yields and its nutrient exports yang et al 2014 in addition fertilization significantly affected protein content and f3 obtained significantly lower protein content and protein yield than f1 and f2 p 0 05 table 1 this supports evidence from previous observations showing nutrients applied over crop demands may result in offset positive nutrient effects on grain yield chen et al 2016 furthermore in the present study different year types influenced grain protein content of winter wheat significantly p 0 05 table 1 these results are likely to be related to the continuous rainy weather during 2015 2016 resulting lower air temperature and solar radiation during this period and indirectly affecting the growth environment of wheat fig 1 4 3 effects of water and fertilizer supply on npk harvest indexes and 100 kg grain npk requirement of winter wheat in this study the ranges of average nhi phi and khi were 77 08 81 88 81 12 88 64 and 16 62 19 34 respectively researcher reported that nhi ranged from 71 72 to 82 85 across all irrigation treatments in a northern chinese field where water resources were scarce jia et al 2021 ma et al 2017 pointed out that in high medium and low yield fields in dryland of shanxi and shaanxi province on the loess plateau of china average nhi phi and khi ranged from 73 to 77 from 82 to 86 and from 20 to 23 respectively phi obtained in this study was consistent with the above study in dryland but nhi and khi were slightly higher and lower respectively the reason may be that the fertilizer supply characteristics of drip fertigation was consistent with nutrient requirements of wheat growth the relatively sufficient fertilizer supply resulted in the increase of nitrogen content in grain and nitrogen harvest index fig 3 and table 2 another possible reason would be that khi slightly reduced with the wheat yield zhan et al 2016 water and fertilizer supply met the growth demand of wheat and sufficient grain filling led to grain potassium content decreased slightly yan et al 2020 additionally the nutrients proportion of stem leaf cob husk and grain varied with various water and fertilization supplies over different growing seasons fig 3 when sufficient water and fertilizers were applied the proportions of n and p uptake in stem leaf cob glume were higher than that in grain resulting in reducing nhi and phi however the proportions of k uptake in stem and grain were lower and k uptake in leaf and cob glume were relatively high total nutrients amount required for the formation of grain yield reflects the nutrient demand of crops for production which is the main parameter for the calculation of recommended fertilization amount zhan et al 2016 liu et al 2006 reported that npk requirement for 100 kg grain reached 2 46 0 37 and 2 30 kg respectively it has been concluded that average npk requirement for 100 kg grain ranged from 2 67 to 3 04 kg from 0 31 to 0 32 kg and from 1 52 to 1 78 kg in 282 farmers dryland fields of shanxi and shaanxi on the loess plateau of china ma et al 2017 similarly our study indicated average npk requirement for 100 kg grain gnr gpr and gkr of four growing seasons under various water and fertilization management practices were 1 93 3 03 0 37 0 41 and 2 26 2 93 kg respectively gpr and gkr were slightly higher than that in drylands mainly because irrigation promoted the absorption of phosphorus p and potassium k fertilizers and thus increased p and k requirement 4 4 effects of water and fertilizer supply on yield iwue and pfp of winter wheat irrigation can reduce the inhibitory effects of drought stress promote crop growth and then achieve high level production this study also confirmed the promoting effect of irrigation showing that w1 and w2 had the significantly higher grain yield than w3 besides that results of our study showed that grain yield in w1 increased with fertilization amount significantly p 0 05 table 1 the reason is that fertilization could promote crop growth and improve the lack of fertilizer supply capacity of soil previous studies showed that the increase of fertilizer input especially nitrogen fertilizer can promote crop growth improve photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content which help leaves intercept more light energy to obtain higher dry biomass and yield fois et al 2009 mon et al 2016 however f3 obtained significantly lower grain yield than f1 and f2 under w2 and w3 p 0 05 through a four year field experiment of irrigation and fertilization zhang et al 2018 found that irrigation quota of 60 mm at the jointing stage and heading stage and nitrogen fertilizer amount of 100 kg ha 1 could meet the normal growth of winter wheat for obtaining higher yield and fertilizer use efficiency instead of higher irrigation and fertilization treatments iwue of w2 and w3 were about 15 higher than that of w1 and iwue under f1 and f2 were 24 48 25 67 higher than that under f3 iwue improved with the increase of fertilization however it reduced with the increase of irrigation amount the primary reason for this inconsistency is that unsuitable irrigation affects root growth root nutrients and water uptake and ultimately affect water use efficiency ali et al 2019 zhao et al 2022 and the recycling of assimilated dry matter before anthesis is inhibited under excessive irrigation zhang et al 2015 moreover unlike iwue pfp reduced with increasing fertilizers input f1 and f2 compared with f3 decreased pfp by 45 89 and 25 48 and w1 and w2 compared with w3 enhanced pfp by 15 42 18 53 previous research findings into the effects of fertilizer rate on pfp have been consistent li et al 2021 importantly with the increase of fertilization rate yield and iwue improved but pfp showed an opposite trend f1 and f2 had no significant difference in yield but pfp under f2 was 31 27 43 93 higher than that under f1 hence f2 was an economical fertilization management practice for stable yield this confirmed the findings of jiang et al 2016 and zhang et al 2017b which found that suitable fertilization rate was conductive to obtaining greater number of effective panicles grain number per panicle and grain weight for high yield 5 conclusions total npk uptake reduced with increasing water stress but there was no significant difference between normal irrigation w1 and mild deficit irrigation w2 p 0 05 when sufficient water and fertilizers were applied the proportions of n and p uptake in stem leaf cob glume were higher than that in grain resulting in lower nhi and phi average n p and k requirement for 100 kg grain gnr gpr and gkr ranged from 1 93 to 3 03 kg from 0 37 to 0 41 kg and from 2 26 to 2 93 kg over the four growing seasons respectively grain yield reduced under water deficit conditions resulting in decreasing partial factor productivity irrigation water use efficiency iwue showed an increasing and then slightly decreasing trend with increasing water deficit with the increase of fertilization rate from f2 to f1 the increase of grain yield was not significant the marginal return decreased and the partial factor productivity decreased in all w2f2 was more beneficial for winter wheat yield which promotes nutrients transfer to grains without significantly reducing yield and keeps high protein content and it was the optimal treatment conducive to the development of high efficient utilization resources agriculture further studies may focus on using crop models to simulate wheat nutrients uptake under various drip fertigation managements and investigating the source sink relationship based on nutrients transport process and the

9737,competition for fresh water is increasing in highly populated areas especially those regions located in arid and semi arid climates water uses are under scrutiny to determine the potential for water savings particularly the agricultural sector is identified because it is the largest consumer of water however information is limited on the year to year variability of agricultural irrigation management specifically the variability related to seasonal water availability remote sensing is a useful input into models to estimate actual evapotranspiration eta for large irrigation districts and provides an archive of historical data in this paper a decade of remote sensing data are used applying the metric algorithm and linear interpolation to achieve eta estimates inter annual variations in seasonal eta are related to snowpack weather irrigation diversions and crop data to understand the factors having an impact it was found that consecutive second years of dry or wet events impacted the seasonal eta indicating limitations in the buffer capacity of the irrigation district this study shows that the irrigation district is capable of buffering dry or wet events during the first year but need to adapt during a consecutive year of extreme dry or wet weather additionally cropping patterns indicate that the crop choices in the irrigation district do not change during extreme events in contrast irrigation diversions are influenced by prolonged dry events the depleted fraction indicated good performance of the irrigation system with potential for improvements in dry years this study demonstrates the dynamic consumptive water use of an irrigation district thereby indicating the importance for considering multiple years of data for an assessment of the agricultural sectors water use additionally the impact of seasonal water availability gives insight on the adaptability of an irrigation district and its capability to cope with current and future variability in weather conditions and extreme events keywords evapotranspiration remote sensing metric irrigation performance adaptive management water availability 1 introduction water scarcity and unreliability is a growing issue in multiple regions worldwide demands for fresh water are increasing driven by rapid population growth high food demands and climate variability the agricultural sector is the largest consumer of fresh water supplies and is consequently affected by changes in water availability in periods of extreme drought regional water managers consider water allocations and evaluate water use in irrigation areas rijsberman 2006 however there is a lack of insight in the irrigator decision making during prolonged drought events these individual irrigators are the end users of the agricultural irrigation water and have an essential impact on the water use in agricultural areas lenton 2014 analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of water demand in irrigated areas is required to encompass the diversity of irrigators and evaluate the operational and management decisions of the irrigation district this is made possible with remote sensing which is capable of distinguishing spatial diversity and offers an archive of historical data bastiaanssen et al 2000 evapotranspiration et is a major component of the water balance therefore spatial estimates of et give crucial insight on agricultural water management jensen 2007 remote sensing provides spatial information over large areas which make et estimations at irrigation district scales possible distinguishing inter annual variations in seasonal et increases our understanding of irrigators responses to seasonal water availability et in irrigated areas is traditionally calculated by using a reference et etr value estimated from weather station data multiplied with empirical crop coefficients such as those reported in the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 this is a simple method for approximating crop et etc and is useful for water managers and scientists alike pereira et al 2015 estimations of et at basin scales are commonly calculated using a traditional water balance approach however the accuracy of the results is determined by among other things the accuracy of the flow and rainfall measurements senay et al 2011 fortunately over recent decades there have been great improvements in estimating et over large areas by making use of satellite remote sensing data and energy balance algorithms anderson et al 2012 the great advantage of remote sensing methods compared to traditional methods is the incorporation of spatial variability and the capability of representing actual et eta conditions thereby accounting for the influence of water stress on crops and natural vegetation gonzalez dugo et al 2009 senay et al 2011 traditionally water stress is represented in the crop coefficient method with another empirical stress factor ks as presented by allen et al 1998 however this requires information on the soil water balance for each field whereas remote sensing energy balance methods indirectly incorporates this factor in the estimation of crop eta using the thermal infrared band without needing soil moisture measurements even though remote sensing methods for estimating eta over large areas have rapidly and vastly improved during the past decades there are few practical applications of remotely sensed eta estimates the studies making use of remotely sensed eta to evaluate regional water balances and irrigation performance are limited taghvaeian and neale 2011 however there is a considerable demand for applying the spatially distributed et estimations into practical information which can assist regional water managers the 35 year database of satellite remote sensing imagery can be used to aid in decisions regarding water allocations especially where competition for water increases due to limited water supplies anderson et al 2012 studies on multi decadal vegetation indices derived from remote sensing have been reported for example one study used multiple decades of ndvi data to analyze the expanse of irrigated area for a region jordan and barroll 2013 another study used multiple years of remotely sensed data to evaluate the spatial variability of crop conditions and connect it with irrigation performance indicators al zayed et al 2015 however these studies have not connected multiple years of remotely sensed estimations with the variability of weather conditions water supplies or management decisions cycles of dry and wet years are evident in many regions including the intermountain west in usa significant droughts are common and show some cyclical behavior such as the case in california in 2014 wang et al 2014 it appears these cycles will be intensified according to future climate scenarios regions such as the western us can expect earlier snowmelt and less accumulation of snow with an increase of temperature in the future this will lead to less water available during the growing season and will impact mountainous areas barnett et al 2005 the shift in water availability can be buffered by using reservoirs additionally an irrigation system can have the capacity of buffering the impact of a change in water availability water can be stored as soil water storage or water users can adapt by changing on farm irrigation cropping pattern or water delivery scheduling a study by nam et al 2015 analyzed the vulnerability of irrigation systems to future climate scenarios according to the capacity of reservoirs for irrigation in korea the results show that under future climate scenarios irrigation districts will be more vulnerable and can be negatively impacted if measures are not undertaken another study in new mexico analyzes certain operational changes made by farmers to cope with a decrease in water availability ward 2014 findings showed that irrigators typically apply less irrigation water and decrease irrigated area additionally crop choices can change to salt tolerant or low water use crops irrigation systems are designed with a certain capacity but the operation of the system can vary greatly these operational decisions can provide a buffer capacity to withstand a drought event up to a critical value it is essential that agricultural areas improve irrigation performance and anticipate a change in water availability turral et al 2010 therefore insights are needed on the adaptability of irrigation systems to seasonal water availability to be able to make well informed decisions under future climate scenarios this paper aims to identify inter annual variations of seasonal crop evapotranspiration eta in an irrigation district in the intermountain region of the western us and relate these variations to weather conditions irrigation water availability and management changes weather patterns affect seasonal crop eta as well as available water for irrigation from snowpack stored soil water atmospheric properties promoting and or constraining the et process and local precipitation meanwhile operational decision making is characterized in this study as irrigation canal diversions cropping patterns and cultivated area information on these interactions can assess the adaptability of an irrigation system to limited water availability this study gives essential insights to water managers regarding the influence of seasonal water availability on water management in agricultural areas in snow driven watersheds and can assist with anticipating future irrigation trends under the influence of a changing climate 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the bear river canal company brcc the study area is an agricultural irrigated area located in northern utah 41 42 n 112 9 w managed by the bear river canal company brcc it is part of the bear river basin which is a river system flowing from the uintah mountain range in utah continuing through wyoming and idaho back into utah and ending in the great salt lake after a journey of 796 km see fig 1 the brcc is one of the last users of the bear river water irrigation water is diverted from the bear river during the growing season from may to october and feeds a canal system see fig 2 which is partially lined the area irrigated by the brcc canal system encompasses 29 500 ha in total the irrigators mainly use border surface irrigation with the bear river being the sole source of irrigation water in the canals the main crops are alfalfa corn for forage and grain crops such as wheat there are also several other less extensive crops the soil types in the region are silty clay to silt loam soils with a few small areas of sandy loam the brcc is a suitable location for this study because it encounters several similar issues existing in other agricultural irrigation areas in semi arid regions that depend on mountain snowpack for water one major issue is that the irrigation water availability is largely dependent on the previous winter snowpack and timing of snowmelt in the mountains the irrigation allocation is determined according to the winter snow accumulation as well as water levels in the reservoirs and lakes of the bear river system therefore the irrigation diversions of the brcc are sensitive to seasonal water availability and antecedent reservoir storage levels hence findings from this study in the brcc can potentially be relevant to several other large agricultural irrigation areas globally 2 2 local weather snowpack and crop data weather conditions during the growing season were measured at a centrally located weather station indicated in fig 2 operated by the utah climate center www climate usurf usu edu the data used consisted of precipitation maximum and minimum daily temperature solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and calculated etr for an alfalfa reference which was estimated using the penman monteith equation walter et al 2004 this weather station started operations in early 2003 irrigated areas depend on seasonal water availability by the accumulated snowpack in the mountains during early spring april the snowpack and the level of water stored in the lakes and reservoirs determine if the brcc irrigation district can receive their full seasonal allocation of irrigation water for this study the snow water equivalent swe of the snowpack is noted at the end of each month for february to april as was measured by the nrcs usda www nrcs usda gov the snowpack water equivalent data were measured at tony grove ranger station 40 n 58 48 110 w 60 0 which is located in one of the mountain ranges that feeds the bear river basin indicated in fig 1 this station started measurements in 1924 and is therefore useful for a historical review of seasonal water availability for this region and was considered a good proxy to conditions in the headwaters of the bear river the variability of cropping patterns can potentially explain differences in inter annual seasonal crop eta depending on decisions made by individual farmers the acreage of each major crop in the irrigation district is determined for the years 2008 2014 as published by the usda national agricultural statistics service www nassgeodata gmu edu cropscape this gives more detailed information of crop choices during the growing season for instance choosing a short season crop winter wheat over a full season crop corn 2 3 categorization of seasonal water availability seasonal weather data and a modified drought index are used to categorize the years into dry wet and average years dry and wet years are frequently labeled by local water users but a drought index is more useful for categorization as it is less subjective and can be calculated with weather data tsakiris et al 2013 the reconnaissance drought index rdi is considered the most applicable index for agricultural areas because it incorporates both et and precipitation data tsakiris et al 2007 in addition it is simple to apply because it does not require an extensive amount of data a modified version of rdi is used in this study which combines both the summer precipitation and snowpack data in the equation the modified rdi is calculated according to eq 1 the summer precipitation and etr are summed for the growing season from march through september the snowpack data are included as measured in march at the tony grove ranger station indicated in fig 1 the monthly average snow measurement of march is chosen for the calculation of rdi because it occurs early spring and is timed at the start of the growing season with april 1st considered to be the date of peak snowpack accumulation in northern utah however it should be noted that this is not every year the timing of peak snowpack 1 modified rdi sum of precipitation mm snow water equivalent in march mm sum of etr mm categories are formed by calculating the first quartile and third quartile of rdi values all years with a lower rdi than the first quartile are categorized as a dry year those years with a rdi higher than the third quartile are categorized as a wet year those years falling in between the first and third quartile are categorized as an average year this is a rational and simplistic method for categorizing the different seasons in dry wet and average years additionally the modified rdi values are solely applicable for the bear river canal company irrigation area and therefore not an indication of regional climate patterns 2 4 remote sensing based surface energy balance algorithm several methods exist incorporating multispectral and thermal bands from satellite imagery to estimate actual et gowda et al 2008 kalma et al 2008 one of these methods is the mapping et at high resolution with internal calibration metric algorithm as published by allen et al 2011a 2007b the algorithm estimates three of the four surface energy balance terms and calculates latent heat flux i e et as a residual metric applies an internal calibration choosing extreme pixels of well irrigated and dry soil agricultural fields to calculate the instantaneous et allen et al 2007b this calibration approach requires less additional atmospheric data for running the model and is therefore widely used for estimating et in large scale agricultural areas for this reason it is well suited for this study to estimate eta for a large agricultural irrigation district however it should be noted that remote sensing is not a measurement of eta but makes approximations from observed radiation at different wavelengths to describe the atmospheric and surface interactions allen et al 2011b these estimations need to be validated with field measurements of eta such as data from eddy covariance flux towers which is a direct measurement of eta nevertheless there remains some uncertainty in the estimation of eta with remote sensing at a larger scale which cannot be validated only with point measurements metric is based on the principles of the sebal model bastiaanssen et al 1998 and the triangle method carlson 2007 this approach takes extreme hot and cold pixels from the satellite image that represents well irrigated fully covered agricultural fields and dry soil it is assumed that both extreme conditions exist in the image which is often a valid assumption for irrigated agricultural areas gonzalez dugo et al 2009 gowda et al 2008 several guidelines are provided for selecting the extreme pixels correctly however it remains a manual process and is influenced by user subjectivity nevertheless the impact of the user was found not to be significant in a test reported by gonzalez dugo et al 2009 which compared the results from three users and did not find significant differences a major advantage of metric is that it does not require accurate surface temperature estimations and thereby atmospheric corrections of the thermal band are not necessary allen et al 2007b it is mentioned by kalma et al 2008 that the accurate estimation of radiometric temperature is challenging however the above internal calibration process metric utilizes makes results less sensitive to the accuracy of temperature estimates metric has been successfully applied in several agricultural water management studies using moderate resolution imagery allen et al 2007a and is therefore the fitting choice for this study an elaborate description including the equations of the metric algorithm is published by allen et al 2011a 2007b and in the annex of singh et al 2012 the basis is the simplified surface energy balance as given in eq 2 with rn net radiation g soil heat flux h sensible heat flux and le latent heat flux all calculated in w m 2 2 rn g h le the principles from sebal for estimating the heat fluxes are also used in metric including the internal calibration method for estimating sensible heat flux bastiaanssen et al 2005 metric differs from sebal in the definition of the cold pixel with metric choosing this extreme condition in an agricultural field whilst sebal defines cold conditions in a body of water gowda et al 2008 additionally daily eta values are calculated in sebal using the evaporative fraction ef or λ and in metric by using the etr fraction etrf resembling the crop coefficient from fao56 the metric algorithm was processed in this study by erdas imagine 2013 using model maker tools and batch options for processing a vast number of images the metric algorithm has been applied and validated in several agricultural settings allen et al 2007a validated metric instantaneous eta estimates with lysimeter data from a forage crop field in idaho results show an average error of 30 with the error being larger in the early and late growing season cuenca et al 2013 compared bowen ratio estimates with metric instantaneous estimates in an agricultural area located in oregon the average error was 11 with larger errors occurring in non irrigated fields some level of error is unavoidable with eta estimations from remote sensing or any measurement of et allen et al 2011b estimates a typical error of remotely sensed eta estimations to be at 10 20 seasonal error of eta may be reduced to a typical 1 5 due to the reduction of random error in the calculation of seasonal et anderson et al 2012 2 5 eddy covariance field experiment and data analysis the crop eta estimates calculated from metric are compared with ground measurements from an eddy covariance tower which is considered the current gold standard for directly measuring eta this comparison indicates if the results from metric are consistent and if there is a general over or underestimation in crop eta eddy covariance towers were installed in the 2013 growing season in three different sites wheat corn and onion fields wheat and corn are both major crops in this irrigation district measurements coinciding with satellite overpass were used for analysis for comparison with metric results the towers measured the entire surface energy balance net radiation soil heat flux sensible heat flux and latent heat flux net radiation was measured with a q6 net radiometer campbell scientific inc which was cross calibrated in a grass field with a four component sensor cnr2 l kipp zonen inc to correct for a linear offset in q6 measurements soil heat flux was measured with two rebs hft3 l rebs inc heat flux plates at a depth of 0 08 m at each system in furrow like systems such as the corn and onion fields the heat flux plates were placed in both the furrow and in the crop bed the plate heat fluxes were corrected for volumetric water storage in the soil measured by a cs616 l reflectometer and temperature in the layer of soil above the plates measured by tcav l soil thermocouples campbell scientific inc the 3 components of wind were measured with a csat3 sonic anemometer campbell scientific inc and the water vapor density fluctuations were measured with a kh20 krypton hygrometer campbell scientific inc both sensors were sampled at 20 hz additionally the towers were equipped with a solar panel a cr1000 or cr5000 datalogger campbell scientific inc and hmp45c l temperature and humidity sensor campbell scientific inc the q6 net radiometer csat and kh20 were placed at 2 5 m above the ground in the wheat and onion fields and 7 m above the ground and 3 5 m above the top of canopy for the corn field all three flux towers were located in the north eastern corner of the field because the predominant wind direction was mainly from the southwest this provided adequate upwind fetch so that the footprint of the flux calculations was the surface of interest the high frequency 20 hz data from the 3 d sonic and fast response hygrometer were filtered for spikes using our own software modeled after known procedures for cleaning high frequency datasets aubinet et al 2012 hojstrup 1999 additional corrections included coordinate rotation sensor separation path length effects frequency response and effects of water vapor density and attendant small vertical velocity aka webb pearman leuning equations and procedures for the above corrections are found in foken 2008 and massman and lee 2002 finally spectral analyses of the time series data were applied for representative periods to verify turbulence scaling properties of the boundary layer such as the 5 3 law from kolmogorov similarity theory the corrected dataset was used for calculating the fluxes for all times of day but only daytime hours were integrated in this case since et is near zero at night the combination of eddy covariance and available energy measurements yielded all four terms of the energy balance this allowed a check on closing the balance or determining how close the values match from eq 1 forced closure of the energy balance was done by assuming the ratio of sensible to latent heat fluxes was correct and adding to the fluxes in proportion to this bowen ratio to match the available energy this was done due to the known underestimation of the sensible and latent heat flux components of eddy covariance systems twine et al 2000 the eddy covariance fluxes were compared with instantaneous eta estimates from metric using the root mean squared error rmse squared bias sb and coefficient of determination r2 according to equations from kobayashi and salam 2000 2 6 seasonal crop eta estimations seasonal crop eta estimations are the total eta during the crop growing season which for this study was 15th april day of year 105 to 15th october day of year 288 the results from metric are instantaneous eta estimates at the time of the satellite overpass they were first extrapolated to daily values however seasonal eta estimates of an agricultural area are required for evaluating the agricultural water consumption the daily extrapolated results from metric must be combined using interpolation between image days to achieve seasonal et estimates in metric an etrf value is calculated for each satellite image which represents the ratio between instantaneous eta as calculated with metric and the etr as measured at the local weather station this ratio is also known as the crop coefficient kc as described by allen et al 1998 in fao 56 the kc curve for each crop is divided in three stages initial mid and end stage with the mid growth stage being the peak of crop development there are three interpolation methods generally applied for estimating seasonal eta namely the fixed etrf linear and curvilinear methods the three interpolation methods have been shown to perform similarly with no significant differences although the curvilinear method is slightly better singh et al 2012 however in this study the major crop of the irrigation district is alfalfa and therefore the curvilinear method is presumably less suitable for calculating the timing of cuttings hence a linear interpolation method is chosen in this study which is applicable when enough images are available during the season the next step is to multiply daily etr values from the weather station with the predicted daily etrf values from interpolation the data from a local weather station indicated in fig 2 is provided by the utah climate center www climate usurf usu edu daily crop eta values are determined as above and summed for the growing season from mid april to mid october interpolation of the etrf values and the summation of daily eta values for seasonal et were performed using r statistical software to automate and run the process for several seasons it is important to note that seasonal eta estimations are achieved using a limited amount of metric data and are mostly approximated with an interpolation method the metric results provide estimates for etrf and instantaneous et throughout the season at infrequent intervals the advantage of these results is that the spatial variability within the irrigation district is captured the estimations from metric therefore guide the interpolation process for estimating seasonal eta and provide intermittent information on crop development and crop stress in order to achieve good approximations of seasonal eta it requires that at least one satellite image per month be available allen et al 2007b fortunately the study area was located within two path lines of the landsat satellite so a scene was potentially available every 8 days however in some years it remained challenging to achieve sufficient cloud free images for running metric a list of the satellite images used for this study is given in table 1 landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli tirs were chosen as suitable platforms neither platform was available in the 2012 growing season therefore that year was excluded from the analysis other platforms available in 2012 e g landsat 7 etm or modis were not used to ensure consistency of the imagery input data and not include possible dissimilarities due to gap filled product landsat 7 etm or resolution modis both landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli tirs produce moderate resolution imagery with the thermal layer being 120 m or 60 m respectively this pixel size is well suited for evaluating an agricultural irrigation area due to the large size of farm fields in the western us anderson et al 2012 2 7 irrigation system performance indicator the operations of an irrigation system can be indicated by decisions in the amount of irrigation diversions and performance indicators these aspects can potentially explain part of the inter annual variability in seasonal crop et several performance indicators are used to evaluate and monitor the irrigation system which consider either the volumetric water balance or the quality of water delivery bos 1997 in this study the irrigation system is defined as the physical canal network used for conveying the irrigation water from the diversion point to the farm fields evaluating and monitoring the performance of the irrigation system is necessary to determine the adequacy of the water delivery however in practice the water delivery is seldom monitored and rarely adapts to the fluctuations between wet and dry years jensen 2007 for this study irrigation diversion data are provided by the brcc and usgs waterdata usgs gov measurements of the diversions commenced in 1912 but include a few gaps of data including the 2011 season which was excluded from the analysis the diversion data are used in combination with the seasonal actual et estimates and precipitation data to evaluate the irrigation system performance this is assessed using the depleted fraction as described by bos et al 2005 and shown in eq 3 this performance indicator gives insightful information for regional water managers on the year to year variability of water consumption in an agricultural irrigation area the critical value for depleted fraction was found to be 0 6 from analysis of large scale canal systems but can fluctuate between 0 55 and 0 7 bos 2004 performance less than 0 6 indicates that water is going to groundwater storage whilst performance higher than 0 6 indicates that additional water is required from diversions to feed the canal system and ensure adequate water delivery bos et al 2005 this also indicates that a depleted fraction of 1 is not desirable because water stress is likely occurring in the irrigation district due to the amount of water necessary for optimal operation of the canal system 3 df depleted fraction actual evapotranspiration eta precipitation irrigation diversions 3 results and discussion 3 1 categorization of wet dry and average years the different growing seasons are categorized in dry wet and average years using the rdi reconnaissance drought index and are presented in table 2 the 1st and 3rd quartile of the rdi are 0 25 and 0 48 respectively these are used for distinguishing wet dry and average categories during the analysis timeframe several wet and dry years occurred but for no longer than for two consecutive years some basic weather data are shown in table 2 to provide insight on the conditions during the growing season the etr varies yearly with higher etr values found in the dry years with the exception of 2014 which is categorized as a wet year this year is characterized by warmer spring weather and then exceptional rainfall during the latter part of the growing season according to weather observations in table 2 the average temperature during the peak of the growing season was generally higher for dry years compared to wet or average years the temperature during the spring months is more variable average temperatures below 10 c were only observed during wet or average years snowpack as measured in march was below 200 mm for all dry years higher values for the snow water equivalent were only measured in wet or average years also high values for precipitation during the growing season were mostly observed in wet years or average years 3 2 metric results and comparison with eddy covariance data metric produced hourly eta results for the hour of satellite overpass daily eta values are found through interpolation of hourly et with etrf values during the 2013 growing season data were collected at three eddy covariance towers being operational in the study the hourly and daily eta estimates from metric were compared with fluxes calculated by the eddy covariance towers at the given days of satellite overpass energy balance closure was forced using the bowen ratio method as described earlier in the methodology results of this comparison are shown in fig 3 indicating the 1 1 line and the different crop fields the data were taken from fig 3a indicates the hourly eta comparison and shows a low overall bias there is a larger bias from the 1 1 line for the lower eta values associated with the onion crop measurements the onion crop is a row crop with lower fraction of plant cover thus more bare soil in contrast with the wheat and corn fields which are more homogeneous at full cover therefore more errors in the measurement of the different energy balance components might occur the soil heat flux is measured by two plates with one located in the furrow and the other in the crop row additional heat flux plates might be needed to represent the heterogeneity of the soil heat flux better however inaccuracies might also lie in the observations by the satellite which does not have a sufficient spatial resolution to distinguish between the different row crops with pixel size being 100 120 m for the thermal band or the problem may lie in the inability of the metric procedure being a one layer canopy model to deal with a sparse heterogeneous surface like an onion row crop when all three crops are considered the r2 of 0 64 and rmse of 0 16 mm hr 1 show that the comparison of eddy covariance and metric results are overall reasonable additionally obvious over or underestimation is not observed in the results for wheat or corn but there was a positive bias by the metric results for onions on the order of 100 fig 3b shows the comparison of daily eta as estimated by metric with the daily eta as measured at the eddy covariance system after forcing the energy balance closure the overall bias is relatively low but slightly negative there is a better overall resemblance with the 1 1 line compared to hourly eta results the positive bias for onions expresses itself again for the daily totals but is both smaller than the instantaneous values and only present in two of the four cases for the onion field the rmse error in this case was 0 77 mm d 1 and the r2 of 0 71 show a reasonable correlation which is slightly better than for instantaneous eta values it should be noted that the number of cases available in fig 3 are not very large but sufficient to indicate a useful comparison two images are shown as an example of spatial eta results over the brcc command area in fig 4 from 2004 a and 2011 b during early august the 2004 season was a dry year whereas 2011 was a wet year as indicated by table 2 the results for 2004 show lower eta values throughout the irrigation district whilst 2011 shows higher eta values estimated by metric although the actual values of eta on these images were only validated at the three sites shown earlier it is the spatial pattern that is of interest in fig 4 additionally the 2004 metric estimates indicate that lower eta values are evident in areas further away from the diversion point located north east of the image indicated in fig 2 the western and southern areas are more concentrated with lower eta values indicating that water stress might be occurring at the tail end of the canal system it was also indicated by local farmers that tail end users of the canal experience inconsistent water delivery due to the lengthy canal system of this irrigation district 3 3 seasonal crop eta estimations the seasonal eta results are shown in fig 5 estimating the total seasonal eta for the whole agricultural area managed by the brcc the average seasonal eta of all the years included in this study was 737 mm as indicated by the dashed horizontal line the years are categorized into dry wet and average years according to the categorization given by table 2 additional information regarding weather conditions during the growing season is also provided in table 2 and gives some necessary insights for describing certain variations in seasonal eta as presented in fig 5 fig 5 shows that average years display an average or above average seasonal eta both 2009 and 2010 show above average seasonal eta in fig 5 whilst 2008 is close to the mean eta of 737 mm for dry years fig 5 indicates a large variability between the different seasons examined in this study the seasons of 2003 and 2007 show well above average seasonal eta whilst 2004 and 2013 are well below average in fact 2007 dry year had the largest eta value the seasonal actual et only decreased during the second year of drought in both cases of 2004 and 2013 with 2012 and 2003 being a dry year but 2012 has no results the first year of drought was likely provisioned by irrigation water from the reservoirs and lakes within the bear river system whilst during the consecutive year of drought the reservoir water levels had decreased and water allocations were not fully granted as was reported by the canal company the seasonal eta values during 2003 and 2007 the first dry years are exceptionally high due to the high etr reported in table 2 and shown in fig 5 the crop water demands are high and irrigation water was not limited in those seasons therefore seasonal crop eta is well above average etr was lower for the years 2004 and 2013 which are the second dry years and display a lower seasonal eta value in fig 5 possibly part of the lower et value can be attributed to the lower etr however the seasonal eta shown in fig 5 is considerably lower than the other years having low etr therefore the water stress factor from limited water supplies might be an explanation for that difference during wet years all the seasonal eta estimates were lower than or at the average 737 mm despite water availability being abundant two main factors can clarify this result for three wet years but not the 2006 season firstly colder temperatures are observed during the spring of the growing season as was indicated in table 2 this causes delays in the growth of certain crops and some farmers might do certain activities later under warmer temperatures and drier conditions such as sowing and wetting the root zone with the first irrigation the second reason is that etr during the growing season was lower for some of the wet years as is indicated in table 2 however these explanations are not valid for the 2006 season and also not as obvious for the 2014 season additionally the seasonal eta of 2006 is considerably lower than the other wet years according to fig 5 there is no obvious explanation that can be derived from the weather conditions in table 2 to clarify the lower seasonal eta of the 2006 season it is however a second wet consecutive year so potentially some operational decisions were made as a consequence similar to the second consecutive dry years the seasonal eta results are examined more closely by dividing the growing season into three periods early mid and late season the periods are from 15th april to 15th june for early season 16th june to 15th august for mid season and 16th august to 15th october for late season these divisions represent the various cropping patterns in the brcc with early season growing mainly wheat and alfalfa crops late season growing mainly alfalfa and corn and mid season being the peak of the growing season with all crops growing results for eta according to period and categorized in average dry and wet years are shown in fig 6 additionally dry years are sub divided into first and second dry years to examine the effects on consequential dry years better due to the large variability within the dry year category mean values for each sub season are indicated by the dotted horizontal line and are 205 mm 340 mm and 190 mm for the early mid and late season respectively fig 6 shows that the average years have less variability within the season and especially in the late season d furthermore for the early b and mid c seasons the estimated eta during average years was close to the mean value during the late season period the average year displayed a higher eta than the mean value it is expected that average years are more consistent considering the lack of an extreme event during dry years the mean eta results are similar to those of the average years with the exception of the late season which displays a lower eta compared to the average however large variability is displayed in fig 6 for the dry year category due to the difference between a first and second dry years as indicated in the discussion of fig 5 first dry year events show well above average eta during the early and mid season and the late season eta is at the mean line the high eta during the early and mid season is associated with the high etr which combined with unlimited water supply results in large eta in addition a dry year usually has a shifted peak of cropping patterns compared to an average year due to the warmer temperatures in early spring resulting in crops being grown earlier in the season the second dry year displays well below average values in fig 6 for the early mid and late seasons limited irrigation water availability during a second dry year causes a lower eta throughout the season either cropping patterns were changed to shorter season crops or water stress is occurring due to less frequent irrigation events being possible fig 6 shows that during wet years the eta is usually close to the mean eta of all years the variability in eta is relatively small for each season except the late season which displays a larger variability this might indicate a difference in crop growth stages according to table 2 wet years differ in magnitude of early season average temperature the onset of warmer temperatures triggers the start of the growing season therefore the differences in temperature cause a different timing in the peak growth of the crops this becomes apparent in the late season eta variability for wet years with some crops still at full growth whilst some other crops are senescing or harvested seasonal eta can be related to several weather conditions such as eta precipitation during the growing season and water availability from the mountain snowpack feeding the upstream reservoirs these factors have all shown to have an amount of influence on seasonal eta as is indicated in the discussion so far the weather conditions as stated in table 2 have provided some explanation for the results of seasonal eta shown in figs 5 and 6 however the degree of impact of each weather condition is vague a larger sample of years is required to make more definite connections between weather conditions and impact on seasonal actual eta from the irrigation district 3 4 seasonal crop cover in the previous section variations of seasonal eta were largely explained by weather conditions during the season or snowpack accumulated in the winter and spring however weather conditions alone do not explain the value of estimated seasonal eta during the second year of an extreme event or the variation within each category therefore explanations may be found in the management decisions typical for these years one of these operational decisions is the cropping pattern during average dry and wet years the cropped area for the major crop types is shown in fig 7 displaying the results from several years examined in this study the percentage for wheat crops is very consistent for each year varying between 25 and 29 of the total cropland winter wheat is planted at the end of fall during the previous season therefore farmers cannot anticipate the seasonal water availability in the next year the acreage of alfalfa varies between 37 and 43 with the lowest percentage occurring in a dry year alfalfa is a perennial high water consuming crop and it would seem rational to change this crop to a low water consuming crop during a dry year however no obvious patterns can be distinguished between years alfalfa is a perennial crop lasting typically four years before replanting therefore a farmer will likely not change to another crop during a dry year except if the crop is already due for replanting soon the area farmed for corn seems to be similar in the latter three years during 2008 more pasture was farmed than corn but after this year there is a gradual increase of growing corn likely because it is silage corn which provides better feed than pasture grass farmers testified during interviews that they grow less late season crops such as corn during a dry year due to water allocations running out at the end of the season however this information is not observed in the data from fig 7 the percentage of corn is similar during the 2013 dry year compared to the other years possibly most of the farmers prefer using the warm early spring occurring during a dry year to grow corn early or choose other crops that have a longer growing season overall the differences between years are not distinct and do not indicate a significant seasonal change in cropping pattern so changes in seasonal eta are not explainable from the data available for this factor it is difficult to observe changes with a small set of data and more years are necessary to represent the diverse management occurring in the irrigation district in addition several factors influence the farmer s decision in crop choices seasonal water availability might be of influence but other aspects are considered for example market prices 3 5 irrigation diversions a third explanation given to clarify trends in season crop eta results aside from weather patterns and cropping patterns was the differences in water allocations during dry years compared to full allocations usually granted in average or wet years fig 8 indicates historical data of annual canal diversions and snowpack water equivalent during the past century the canal diversion data shows an overall increasing trend during the first half of the past century according to fig 8 presumably the irrigation district expanded the irrigated cropland and experienced less competition over water supplies with other users due to low population density in the region however during the last few decades the irrigation diversions show no pattern of increase indicating a stationary signal of water allocation the similar stationary nature of the snowpack data during this period would suggest that there was not water supply present to allow diversions to increase there are a few cycles of upward and downward periods in irrigation diversions observed in fig 8 apparently related to variations in climate and water availability the most recent reduced water period occurred between 2000 and 2004 indicated with an arrow in fig 8 which coincides with consecutive dry years due to an extreme drought that occurred during the period droughtmonitor unl edu resulting in low snowpack amounts another downward event is observed in 1991 1993 indicated with an arrow in fig 8 which again is simultaneous to consecutive years of low snowpack amounts the third distinct downward event is shown between 1980 and 1984 indicated with an arrow in fig 8 which is preceded by a few wet years but followed by an extreme low snowpack in 1981 overall this plot indicates that diversions are influenced mainly by dry events that vary in duration or severity this indicates that irrigation diversions are not highly sensitive to a particular year snowpack due to storage in the system but are only impacted during a build up of consecutive dry years or an extreme low snowpack year the reservoirs and lakes supplying the irrigation water decrease the sensitivity of diversions to water availability and are an important buffer for this region this affects the capacity of a region to buffer consecutive dry years this will give valuable knowledge of the number of dry years required to have a major impact on the irrigation district 3 6 depleted fraction the last step is to bring the different results of actual crop et and irrigation diversions together to calculate the irrigation system performance using the depleted fraction to evaluate the irrigation system performance gives valuable insight for the local irrigators and to regional water managers recall the depleted fraction defined in eq 3 is simply the ratio of eta to the total of precipitation and irrigation the calculation here combines the diversion data and seasonal eta from the linear interpolation method assisted with metric instantaneous eta estimates in addition summer precipitation is included in the calculation of the depleted fraction which contributes to the water available for the crops during the growing season the results for depleted fraction are given in fig 9 for the years the seasonal eta was calculated for in this study the 2011 season is excluded from this figure due to measurement disruptions occurring at the diversion point throughout most of the growing season recall the critical value for the depleted fraction is proposed to be 0 6 above which crop water requirements are potentially not fulfilled bos et al 2005 lower than 0 6 values indicate that water is being stored in the groundwater or contributing to runoff for downstream water users fig 9 indicates that most of the dry years are above the 0 6 critical threshold which is expected due to the high crop water demands and less summer rainfall occurring as was reported in table 2 this indicates that water stress might be occurring at different locations in the irrigation system due to the high water demands there is no obvious difference observed between first 2003 and 2007 and second dry years 2004 and 2013 the 2013 growing season has a lower depleted fraction than any of the other growing seasons this coincides with the year of management changes in the canal company so operations might have been different the wet years display values lower than the 0 6 threshold thus indicating that sufficient water is being supplied to the fields but some of the water is transported to storage or runoff during the wet years summer precipitation is typically higher than the other years as indicated in table 2 however the irrigation diversion presumably does not adapt which was also indicated by local water managers during a precipitation event less stress is put on the water delivery schedule but the schedule remains unchanged the average years indicate a large variety in depleted fractions which is potentially connected to factors other than the seasonal water availability the 2010 season shows a higher depleted fraction than the other average years this is probably explained by the extremely low summer rainfall occurring during that growing season as is indicated by table 2 the other two average years 2008 and 2009 are close to the average depleted fraction overall the performance of the irrigation district is commendable based on these criteria with an average depleted fraction during the past decade of 0 63 presumably neither substantial crop water stress nor water losses are occurring when the entire period is integrated however the variability could be more balanced towards storing water during wet years and making better use of summer precipitation 4 conclusions this research analyzed a decade of remote sensing data linked to an et model to distinguish inter annual variability of seasonal eta from an irrigation district in northern utah and related this to seasonal water availability seasonal water availability was determined using precipitation snowpack water equivalent and etr data and a drought index value was used to distinguish between average wet and dry years seasonal eta was compared to seasonal weather conditions and to operational aspects namely cropping patterns and irrigation diversions it was found that water consumption differed between a first and second consecutive dry year with the first having high seasonal eta estimates which related to high etr whilst the second dry year displayed low seasonal eta estimates due to decreased water availability this indicated that the capacity of the irrigation district to buffer consecutive dry years was already limited in the occurrence of two consecutive dry years farm management decisions can be influenced by the seasonal water availability however cropping patterns portrayed no distinct relation with seasonal water availability irrigation diversions were only influenced by prolonged dry events or a severe dry event this indicates that the capacity of the irrigation system to use upstream reservoirs as buffer is limited the depleted fraction indicated good overall performance of the irrigation system during wet years the irrigation performance could be improved by incorporating summer precipitation in the irrigation scheduling the decade of eta estimates provided some results on the adaptability of the irrigation system to cope with water availability however a decade appeared to be not long enough for the time scale of short term climate variability especially in this region hence these connections could be made more distinct with the use of a longer period of analysis thereby including more cycles of wet and dry years regarding the adaptability of the irrigation system it is concluded from this study that second dry or wet years lead farmers to adapt to the water availability resulting in changes in seasonal eta these inter annual differences of seasonal eta from this irrigation district offers practical insights to water managers for anticipating future climate scenarios in snow driven systems especially if more extreme events occur of varying duration and severity the inter annual variability in seasonal eta indicates the importance of using a multiple year average for making decisions whereas frequently one year is used as representative results also showed that this irrigation district is impacted by a two year drought event the adaptability of the irrigation district is proven to cope with a one year dry event but the buffer capacity is not sufficient for two consecutive dry years or more the findings make it very evident that in an irrigation district similar to this one the classification of a year as wet dry or average is ambiguous without knowledge of the climate of the previous periods this points directly to the importance of knowing the storage capacity effects on water delivery of the system for any future scenario of decreasing water availability or more frequent extreme events it is of importance to improve the adaptability of the irrigation system and

9737,competition for fresh water is increasing in highly populated areas especially those regions located in arid and semi arid climates water uses are under scrutiny to determine the potential for water savings particularly the agricultural sector is identified because it is the largest consumer of water however information is limited on the year to year variability of agricultural irrigation management specifically the variability related to seasonal water availability remote sensing is a useful input into models to estimate actual evapotranspiration eta for large irrigation districts and provides an archive of historical data in this paper a decade of remote sensing data are used applying the metric algorithm and linear interpolation to achieve eta estimates inter annual variations in seasonal eta are related to snowpack weather irrigation diversions and crop data to understand the factors having an impact it was found that consecutive second years of dry or wet events impacted the seasonal eta indicating limitations in the buffer capacity of the irrigation district this study shows that the irrigation district is capable of buffering dry or wet events during the first year but need to adapt during a consecutive year of extreme dry or wet weather additionally cropping patterns indicate that the crop choices in the irrigation district do not change during extreme events in contrast irrigation diversions are influenced by prolonged dry events the depleted fraction indicated good performance of the irrigation system with potential for improvements in dry years this study demonstrates the dynamic consumptive water use of an irrigation district thereby indicating the importance for considering multiple years of data for an assessment of the agricultural sectors water use additionally the impact of seasonal water availability gives insight on the adaptability of an irrigation district and its capability to cope with current and future variability in weather conditions and extreme events keywords evapotranspiration remote sensing metric irrigation performance adaptive management water availability 1 introduction water scarcity and unreliability is a growing issue in multiple regions worldwide demands for fresh water are increasing driven by rapid population growth high food demands and climate variability the agricultural sector is the largest consumer of fresh water supplies and is consequently affected by changes in water availability in periods of extreme drought regional water managers consider water allocations and evaluate water use in irrigation areas rijsberman 2006 however there is a lack of insight in the irrigator decision making during prolonged drought events these individual irrigators are the end users of the agricultural irrigation water and have an essential impact on the water use in agricultural areas lenton 2014 analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of water demand in irrigated areas is required to encompass the diversity of irrigators and evaluate the operational and management decisions of the irrigation district this is made possible with remote sensing which is capable of distinguishing spatial diversity and offers an archive of historical data bastiaanssen et al 2000 evapotranspiration et is a major component of the water balance therefore spatial estimates of et give crucial insight on agricultural water management jensen 2007 remote sensing provides spatial information over large areas which make et estimations at irrigation district scales possible distinguishing inter annual variations in seasonal et increases our understanding of irrigators responses to seasonal water availability et in irrigated areas is traditionally calculated by using a reference et etr value estimated from weather station data multiplied with empirical crop coefficients such as those reported in the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 this is a simple method for approximating crop et etc and is useful for water managers and scientists alike pereira et al 2015 estimations of et at basin scales are commonly calculated using a traditional water balance approach however the accuracy of the results is determined by among other things the accuracy of the flow and rainfall measurements senay et al 2011 fortunately over recent decades there have been great improvements in estimating et over large areas by making use of satellite remote sensing data and energy balance algorithms anderson et al 2012 the great advantage of remote sensing methods compared to traditional methods is the incorporation of spatial variability and the capability of representing actual et eta conditions thereby accounting for the influence of water stress on crops and natural vegetation gonzalez dugo et al 2009 senay et al 2011 traditionally water stress is represented in the crop coefficient method with another empirical stress factor ks as presented by allen et al 1998 however this requires information on the soil water balance for each field whereas remote sensing energy balance methods indirectly incorporates this factor in the estimation of crop eta using the thermal infrared band without needing soil moisture measurements even though remote sensing methods for estimating eta over large areas have rapidly and vastly improved during the past decades there are few practical applications of remotely sensed eta estimates the studies making use of remotely sensed eta to evaluate regional water balances and irrigation performance are limited taghvaeian and neale 2011 however there is a considerable demand for applying the spatially distributed et estimations into practical information which can assist regional water managers the 35 year database of satellite remote sensing imagery can be used to aid in decisions regarding water allocations especially where competition for water increases due to limited water supplies anderson et al 2012 studies on multi decadal vegetation indices derived from remote sensing have been reported for example one study used multiple decades of ndvi data to analyze the expanse of irrigated area for a region jordan and barroll 2013 another study used multiple years of remotely sensed data to evaluate the spatial variability of crop conditions and connect it with irrigation performance indicators al zayed et al 2015 however these studies have not connected multiple years of remotely sensed estimations with the variability of weather conditions water supplies or management decisions cycles of dry and wet years are evident in many regions including the intermountain west in usa significant droughts are common and show some cyclical behavior such as the case in california in 2014 wang et al 2014 it appears these cycles will be intensified according to future climate scenarios regions such as the western us can expect earlier snowmelt and less accumulation of snow with an increase of temperature in the future this will lead to less water available during the growing season and will impact mountainous areas barnett et al 2005 the shift in water availability can be buffered by using reservoirs additionally an irrigation system can have the capacity of buffering the impact of a change in water availability water can be stored as soil water storage or water users can adapt by changing on farm irrigation cropping pattern or water delivery scheduling a study by nam et al 2015 analyzed the vulnerability of irrigation systems to future climate scenarios according to the capacity of reservoirs for irrigation in korea the results show that under future climate scenarios irrigation districts will be more vulnerable and can be negatively impacted if measures are not undertaken another study in new mexico analyzes certain operational changes made by farmers to cope with a decrease in water availability ward 2014 findings showed that irrigators typically apply less irrigation water and decrease irrigated area additionally crop choices can change to salt tolerant or low water use crops irrigation systems are designed with a certain capacity but the operation of the system can vary greatly these operational decisions can provide a buffer capacity to withstand a drought event up to a critical value it is essential that agricultural areas improve irrigation performance and anticipate a change in water availability turral et al 2010 therefore insights are needed on the adaptability of irrigation systems to seasonal water availability to be able to make well informed decisions under future climate scenarios this paper aims to identify inter annual variations of seasonal crop evapotranspiration eta in an irrigation district in the intermountain region of the western us and relate these variations to weather conditions irrigation water availability and management changes weather patterns affect seasonal crop eta as well as available water for irrigation from snowpack stored soil water atmospheric properties promoting and or constraining the et process and local precipitation meanwhile operational decision making is characterized in this study as irrigation canal diversions cropping patterns and cultivated area information on these interactions can assess the adaptability of an irrigation system to limited water availability this study gives essential insights to water managers regarding the influence of seasonal water availability on water management in agricultural areas in snow driven watersheds and can assist with anticipating future irrigation trends under the influence of a changing climate 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the bear river canal company brcc the study area is an agricultural irrigated area located in northern utah 41 42 n 112 9 w managed by the bear river canal company brcc it is part of the bear river basin which is a river system flowing from the uintah mountain range in utah continuing through wyoming and idaho back into utah and ending in the great salt lake after a journey of 796 km see fig 1 the brcc is one of the last users of the bear river water irrigation water is diverted from the bear river during the growing season from may to october and feeds a canal system see fig 2 which is partially lined the area irrigated by the brcc canal system encompasses 29 500 ha in total the irrigators mainly use border surface irrigation with the bear river being the sole source of irrigation water in the canals the main crops are alfalfa corn for forage and grain crops such as wheat there are also several other less extensive crops the soil types in the region are silty clay to silt loam soils with a few small areas of sandy loam the brcc is a suitable location for this study because it encounters several similar issues existing in other agricultural irrigation areas in semi arid regions that depend on mountain snowpack for water one major issue is that the irrigation water availability is largely dependent on the previous winter snowpack and timing of snowmelt in the mountains the irrigation allocation is determined according to the winter snow accumulation as well as water levels in the reservoirs and lakes of the bear river system therefore the irrigation diversions of the brcc are sensitive to seasonal water availability and antecedent reservoir storage levels hence findings from this study in the brcc can potentially be relevant to several other large agricultural irrigation areas globally 2 2 local weather snowpack and crop data weather conditions during the growing season were measured at a centrally located weather station indicated in fig 2 operated by the utah climate center www climate usurf usu edu the data used consisted of precipitation maximum and minimum daily temperature solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and calculated etr for an alfalfa reference which was estimated using the penman monteith equation walter et al 2004 this weather station started operations in early 2003 irrigated areas depend on seasonal water availability by the accumulated snowpack in the mountains during early spring april the snowpack and the level of water stored in the lakes and reservoirs determine if the brcc irrigation district can receive their full seasonal allocation of irrigation water for this study the snow water equivalent swe of the snowpack is noted at the end of each month for february to april as was measured by the nrcs usda www nrcs usda gov the snowpack water equivalent data were measured at tony grove ranger station 40 n 58 48 110 w 60 0 which is located in one of the mountain ranges that feeds the bear river basin indicated in fig 1 this station started measurements in 1924 and is therefore useful for a historical review of seasonal water availability for this region and was considered a good proxy to conditions in the headwaters of the bear river the variability of cropping patterns can potentially explain differences in inter annual seasonal crop eta depending on decisions made by individual farmers the acreage of each major crop in the irrigation district is determined for the years 2008 2014 as published by the usda national agricultural statistics service www nassgeodata gmu edu cropscape this gives more detailed information of crop choices during the growing season for instance choosing a short season crop winter wheat over a full season crop corn 2 3 categorization of seasonal water availability seasonal weather data and a modified drought index are used to categorize the years into dry wet and average years dry and wet years are frequently labeled by local water users but a drought index is more useful for categorization as it is less subjective and can be calculated with weather data tsakiris et al 2013 the reconnaissance drought index rdi is considered the most applicable index for agricultural areas because it incorporates both et and precipitation data tsakiris et al 2007 in addition it is simple to apply because it does not require an extensive amount of data a modified version of rdi is used in this study which combines both the summer precipitation and snowpack data in the equation the modified rdi is calculated according to eq 1 the summer precipitation and etr are summed for the growing season from march through september the snowpack data are included as measured in march at the tony grove ranger station indicated in fig 1 the monthly average snow measurement of march is chosen for the calculation of rdi because it occurs early spring and is timed at the start of the growing season with april 1st considered to be the date of peak snowpack accumulation in northern utah however it should be noted that this is not every year the timing of peak snowpack 1 modified rdi sum of precipitation mm snow water equivalent in march mm sum of etr mm categories are formed by calculating the first quartile and third quartile of rdi values all years with a lower rdi than the first quartile are categorized as a dry year those years with a rdi higher than the third quartile are categorized as a wet year those years falling in between the first and third quartile are categorized as an average year this is a rational and simplistic method for categorizing the different seasons in dry wet and average years additionally the modified rdi values are solely applicable for the bear river canal company irrigation area and therefore not an indication of regional climate patterns 2 4 remote sensing based surface energy balance algorithm several methods exist incorporating multispectral and thermal bands from satellite imagery to estimate actual et gowda et al 2008 kalma et al 2008 one of these methods is the mapping et at high resolution with internal calibration metric algorithm as published by allen et al 2011a 2007b the algorithm estimates three of the four surface energy balance terms and calculates latent heat flux i e et as a residual metric applies an internal calibration choosing extreme pixels of well irrigated and dry soil agricultural fields to calculate the instantaneous et allen et al 2007b this calibration approach requires less additional atmospheric data for running the model and is therefore widely used for estimating et in large scale agricultural areas for this reason it is well suited for this study to estimate eta for a large agricultural irrigation district however it should be noted that remote sensing is not a measurement of eta but makes approximations from observed radiation at different wavelengths to describe the atmospheric and surface interactions allen et al 2011b these estimations need to be validated with field measurements of eta such as data from eddy covariance flux towers which is a direct measurement of eta nevertheless there remains some uncertainty in the estimation of eta with remote sensing at a larger scale which cannot be validated only with point measurements metric is based on the principles of the sebal model bastiaanssen et al 1998 and the triangle method carlson 2007 this approach takes extreme hot and cold pixels from the satellite image that represents well irrigated fully covered agricultural fields and dry soil it is assumed that both extreme conditions exist in the image which is often a valid assumption for irrigated agricultural areas gonzalez dugo et al 2009 gowda et al 2008 several guidelines are provided for selecting the extreme pixels correctly however it remains a manual process and is influenced by user subjectivity nevertheless the impact of the user was found not to be significant in a test reported by gonzalez dugo et al 2009 which compared the results from three users and did not find significant differences a major advantage of metric is that it does not require accurate surface temperature estimations and thereby atmospheric corrections of the thermal band are not necessary allen et al 2007b it is mentioned by kalma et al 2008 that the accurate estimation of radiometric temperature is challenging however the above internal calibration process metric utilizes makes results less sensitive to the accuracy of temperature estimates metric has been successfully applied in several agricultural water management studies using moderate resolution imagery allen et al 2007a and is therefore the fitting choice for this study an elaborate description including the equations of the metric algorithm is published by allen et al 2011a 2007b and in the annex of singh et al 2012 the basis is the simplified surface energy balance as given in eq 2 with rn net radiation g soil heat flux h sensible heat flux and le latent heat flux all calculated in w m 2 2 rn g h le the principles from sebal for estimating the heat fluxes are also used in metric including the internal calibration method for estimating sensible heat flux bastiaanssen et al 2005 metric differs from sebal in the definition of the cold pixel with metric choosing this extreme condition in an agricultural field whilst sebal defines cold conditions in a body of water gowda et al 2008 additionally daily eta values are calculated in sebal using the evaporative fraction ef or λ and in metric by using the etr fraction etrf resembling the crop coefficient from fao56 the metric algorithm was processed in this study by erdas imagine 2013 using model maker tools and batch options for processing a vast number of images the metric algorithm has been applied and validated in several agricultural settings allen et al 2007a validated metric instantaneous eta estimates with lysimeter data from a forage crop field in idaho results show an average error of 30 with the error being larger in the early and late growing season cuenca et al 2013 compared bowen ratio estimates with metric instantaneous estimates in an agricultural area located in oregon the average error was 11 with larger errors occurring in non irrigated fields some level of error is unavoidable with eta estimations from remote sensing or any measurement of et allen et al 2011b estimates a typical error of remotely sensed eta estimations to be at 10 20 seasonal error of eta may be reduced to a typical 1 5 due to the reduction of random error in the calculation of seasonal et anderson et al 2012 2 5 eddy covariance field experiment and data analysis the crop eta estimates calculated from metric are compared with ground measurements from an eddy covariance tower which is considered the current gold standard for directly measuring eta this comparison indicates if the results from metric are consistent and if there is a general over or underestimation in crop eta eddy covariance towers were installed in the 2013 growing season in three different sites wheat corn and onion fields wheat and corn are both major crops in this irrigation district measurements coinciding with satellite overpass were used for analysis for comparison with metric results the towers measured the entire surface energy balance net radiation soil heat flux sensible heat flux and latent heat flux net radiation was measured with a q6 net radiometer campbell scientific inc which was cross calibrated in a grass field with a four component sensor cnr2 l kipp zonen inc to correct for a linear offset in q6 measurements soil heat flux was measured with two rebs hft3 l rebs inc heat flux plates at a depth of 0 08 m at each system in furrow like systems such as the corn and onion fields the heat flux plates were placed in both the furrow and in the crop bed the plate heat fluxes were corrected for volumetric water storage in the soil measured by a cs616 l reflectometer and temperature in the layer of soil above the plates measured by tcav l soil thermocouples campbell scientific inc the 3 components of wind were measured with a csat3 sonic anemometer campbell scientific inc and the water vapor density fluctuations were measured with a kh20 krypton hygrometer campbell scientific inc both sensors were sampled at 20 hz additionally the towers were equipped with a solar panel a cr1000 or cr5000 datalogger campbell scientific inc and hmp45c l temperature and humidity sensor campbell scientific inc the q6 net radiometer csat and kh20 were placed at 2 5 m above the ground in the wheat and onion fields and 7 m above the ground and 3 5 m above the top of canopy for the corn field all three flux towers were located in the north eastern corner of the field because the predominant wind direction was mainly from the southwest this provided adequate upwind fetch so that the footprint of the flux calculations was the surface of interest the high frequency 20 hz data from the 3 d sonic and fast response hygrometer were filtered for spikes using our own software modeled after known procedures for cleaning high frequency datasets aubinet et al 2012 hojstrup 1999 additional corrections included coordinate rotation sensor separation path length effects frequency response and effects of water vapor density and attendant small vertical velocity aka webb pearman leuning equations and procedures for the above corrections are found in foken 2008 and massman and lee 2002 finally spectral analyses of the time series data were applied for representative periods to verify turbulence scaling properties of the boundary layer such as the 5 3 law from kolmogorov similarity theory the corrected dataset was used for calculating the fluxes for all times of day but only daytime hours were integrated in this case since et is near zero at night the combination of eddy covariance and available energy measurements yielded all four terms of the energy balance this allowed a check on closing the balance or determining how close the values match from eq 1 forced closure of the energy balance was done by assuming the ratio of sensible to latent heat fluxes was correct and adding to the fluxes in proportion to this bowen ratio to match the available energy this was done due to the known underestimation of the sensible and latent heat flux components of eddy covariance systems twine et al 2000 the eddy covariance fluxes were compared with instantaneous eta estimates from metric using the root mean squared error rmse squared bias sb and coefficient of determination r2 according to equations from kobayashi and salam 2000 2 6 seasonal crop eta estimations seasonal crop eta estimations are the total eta during the crop growing season which for this study was 15th april day of year 105 to 15th october day of year 288 the results from metric are instantaneous eta estimates at the time of the satellite overpass they were first extrapolated to daily values however seasonal eta estimates of an agricultural area are required for evaluating the agricultural water consumption the daily extrapolated results from metric must be combined using interpolation between image days to achieve seasonal et estimates in metric an etrf value is calculated for each satellite image which represents the ratio between instantaneous eta as calculated with metric and the etr as measured at the local weather station this ratio is also known as the crop coefficient kc as described by allen et al 1998 in fao 56 the kc curve for each crop is divided in three stages initial mid and end stage with the mid growth stage being the peak of crop development there are three interpolation methods generally applied for estimating seasonal eta namely the fixed etrf linear and curvilinear methods the three interpolation methods have been shown to perform similarly with no significant differences although the curvilinear method is slightly better singh et al 2012 however in this study the major crop of the irrigation district is alfalfa and therefore the curvilinear method is presumably less suitable for calculating the timing of cuttings hence a linear interpolation method is chosen in this study which is applicable when enough images are available during the season the next step is to multiply daily etr values from the weather station with the predicted daily etrf values from interpolation the data from a local weather station indicated in fig 2 is provided by the utah climate center www climate usurf usu edu daily crop eta values are determined as above and summed for the growing season from mid april to mid october interpolation of the etrf values and the summation of daily eta values for seasonal et were performed using r statistical software to automate and run the process for several seasons it is important to note that seasonal eta estimations are achieved using a limited amount of metric data and are mostly approximated with an interpolation method the metric results provide estimates for etrf and instantaneous et throughout the season at infrequent intervals the advantage of these results is that the spatial variability within the irrigation district is captured the estimations from metric therefore guide the interpolation process for estimating seasonal eta and provide intermittent information on crop development and crop stress in order to achieve good approximations of seasonal eta it requires that at least one satellite image per month be available allen et al 2007b fortunately the study area was located within two path lines of the landsat satellite so a scene was potentially available every 8 days however in some years it remained challenging to achieve sufficient cloud free images for running metric a list of the satellite images used for this study is given in table 1 landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli tirs were chosen as suitable platforms neither platform was available in the 2012 growing season therefore that year was excluded from the analysis other platforms available in 2012 e g landsat 7 etm or modis were not used to ensure consistency of the imagery input data and not include possible dissimilarities due to gap filled product landsat 7 etm or resolution modis both landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli tirs produce moderate resolution imagery with the thermal layer being 120 m or 60 m respectively this pixel size is well suited for evaluating an agricultural irrigation area due to the large size of farm fields in the western us anderson et al 2012 2 7 irrigation system performance indicator the operations of an irrigation system can be indicated by decisions in the amount of irrigation diversions and performance indicators these aspects can potentially explain part of the inter annual variability in seasonal crop et several performance indicators are used to evaluate and monitor the irrigation system which consider either the volumetric water balance or the quality of water delivery bos 1997 in this study the irrigation system is defined as the physical canal network used for conveying the irrigation water from the diversion point to the farm fields evaluating and monitoring the performance of the irrigation system is necessary to determine the adequacy of the water delivery however in practice the water delivery is seldom monitored and rarely adapts to the fluctuations between wet and dry years jensen 2007 for this study irrigation diversion data are provided by the brcc and usgs waterdata usgs gov measurements of the diversions commenced in 1912 but include a few gaps of data including the 2011 season which was excluded from the analysis the diversion data are used in combination with the seasonal actual et estimates and precipitation data to evaluate the irrigation system performance this is assessed using the depleted fraction as described by bos et al 2005 and shown in eq 3 this performance indicator gives insightful information for regional water managers on the year to year variability of water consumption in an agricultural irrigation area the critical value for depleted fraction was found to be 0 6 from analysis of large scale canal systems but can fluctuate between 0 55 and 0 7 bos 2004 performance less than 0 6 indicates that water is going to groundwater storage whilst performance higher than 0 6 indicates that additional water is required from diversions to feed the canal system and ensure adequate water delivery bos et al 2005 this also indicates that a depleted fraction of 1 is not desirable because water stress is likely occurring in the irrigation district due to the amount of water necessary for optimal operation of the canal system 3 df depleted fraction actual evapotranspiration eta precipitation irrigation diversions 3 results and discussion 3 1 categorization of wet dry and average years the different growing seasons are categorized in dry wet and average years using the rdi reconnaissance drought index and are presented in table 2 the 1st and 3rd quartile of the rdi are 0 25 and 0 48 respectively these are used for distinguishing wet dry and average categories during the analysis timeframe several wet and dry years occurred but for no longer than for two consecutive years some basic weather data are shown in table 2 to provide insight on the conditions during the growing season the etr varies yearly with higher etr values found in the dry years with the exception of 2014 which is categorized as a wet year this year is characterized by warmer spring weather and then exceptional rainfall during the latter part of the growing season according to weather observations in table 2 the average temperature during the peak of the growing season was generally higher for dry years compared to wet or average years the temperature during the spring months is more variable average temperatures below 10 c were only observed during wet or average years snowpack as measured in march was below 200 mm for all dry years higher values for the snow water equivalent were only measured in wet or average years also high values for precipitation during the growing season were mostly observed in wet years or average years 3 2 metric results and comparison with eddy covariance data metric produced hourly eta results for the hour of satellite overpass daily eta values are found through interpolation of hourly et with etrf values during the 2013 growing season data were collected at three eddy covariance towers being operational in the study the hourly and daily eta estimates from metric were compared with fluxes calculated by the eddy covariance towers at the given days of satellite overpass energy balance closure was forced using the bowen ratio method as described earlier in the methodology results of this comparison are shown in fig 3 indicating the 1 1 line and the different crop fields the data were taken from fig 3a indicates the hourly eta comparison and shows a low overall bias there is a larger bias from the 1 1 line for the lower eta values associated with the onion crop measurements the onion crop is a row crop with lower fraction of plant cover thus more bare soil in contrast with the wheat and corn fields which are more homogeneous at full cover therefore more errors in the measurement of the different energy balance components might occur the soil heat flux is measured by two plates with one located in the furrow and the other in the crop row additional heat flux plates might be needed to represent the heterogeneity of the soil heat flux better however inaccuracies might also lie in the observations by the satellite which does not have a sufficient spatial resolution to distinguish between the different row crops with pixel size being 100 120 m for the thermal band or the problem may lie in the inability of the metric procedure being a one layer canopy model to deal with a sparse heterogeneous surface like an onion row crop when all three crops are considered the r2 of 0 64 and rmse of 0 16 mm hr 1 show that the comparison of eddy covariance and metric results are overall reasonable additionally obvious over or underestimation is not observed in the results for wheat or corn but there was a positive bias by the metric results for onions on the order of 100 fig 3b shows the comparison of daily eta as estimated by metric with the daily eta as measured at the eddy covariance system after forcing the energy balance closure the overall bias is relatively low but slightly negative there is a better overall resemblance with the 1 1 line compared to hourly eta results the positive bias for onions expresses itself again for the daily totals but is both smaller than the instantaneous values and only present in two of the four cases for the onion field the rmse error in this case was 0 77 mm d 1 and the r2 of 0 71 show a reasonable correlation which is slightly better than for instantaneous eta values it should be noted that the number of cases available in fig 3 are not very large but sufficient to indicate a useful comparison two images are shown as an example of spatial eta results over the brcc command area in fig 4 from 2004 a and 2011 b during early august the 2004 season was a dry year whereas 2011 was a wet year as indicated by table 2 the results for 2004 show lower eta values throughout the irrigation district whilst 2011 shows higher eta values estimated by metric although the actual values of eta on these images were only validated at the three sites shown earlier it is the spatial pattern that is of interest in fig 4 additionally the 2004 metric estimates indicate that lower eta values are evident in areas further away from the diversion point located north east of the image indicated in fig 2 the western and southern areas are more concentrated with lower eta values indicating that water stress might be occurring at the tail end of the canal system it was also indicated by local farmers that tail end users of the canal experience inconsistent water delivery due to the lengthy canal system of this irrigation district 3 3 seasonal crop eta estimations the seasonal eta results are shown in fig 5 estimating the total seasonal eta for the whole agricultural area managed by the brcc the average seasonal eta of all the years included in this study was 737 mm as indicated by the dashed horizontal line the years are categorized into dry wet and average years according to the categorization given by table 2 additional information regarding weather conditions during the growing season is also provided in table 2 and gives some necessary insights for describing certain variations in seasonal eta as presented in fig 5 fig 5 shows that average years display an average or above average seasonal eta both 2009 and 2010 show above average seasonal eta in fig 5 whilst 2008 is close to the mean eta of 737 mm for dry years fig 5 indicates a large variability between the different seasons examined in this study the seasons of 2003 and 2007 show well above average seasonal eta whilst 2004 and 2013 are well below average in fact 2007 dry year had the largest eta value the seasonal actual et only decreased during the second year of drought in both cases of 2004 and 2013 with 2012 and 2003 being a dry year but 2012 has no results the first year of drought was likely provisioned by irrigation water from the reservoirs and lakes within the bear river system whilst during the consecutive year of drought the reservoir water levels had decreased and water allocations were not fully granted as was reported by the canal company the seasonal eta values during 2003 and 2007 the first dry years are exceptionally high due to the high etr reported in table 2 and shown in fig 5 the crop water demands are high and irrigation water was not limited in those seasons therefore seasonal crop eta is well above average etr was lower for the years 2004 and 2013 which are the second dry years and display a lower seasonal eta value in fig 5 possibly part of the lower et value can be attributed to the lower etr however the seasonal eta shown in fig 5 is considerably lower than the other years having low etr therefore the water stress factor from limited water supplies might be an explanation for that difference during wet years all the seasonal eta estimates were lower than or at the average 737 mm despite water availability being abundant two main factors can clarify this result for three wet years but not the 2006 season firstly colder temperatures are observed during the spring of the growing season as was indicated in table 2 this causes delays in the growth of certain crops and some farmers might do certain activities later under warmer temperatures and drier conditions such as sowing and wetting the root zone with the first irrigation the second reason is that etr during the growing season was lower for some of the wet years as is indicated in table 2 however these explanations are not valid for the 2006 season and also not as obvious for the 2014 season additionally the seasonal eta of 2006 is considerably lower than the other wet years according to fig 5 there is no obvious explanation that can be derived from the weather conditions in table 2 to clarify the lower seasonal eta of the 2006 season it is however a second wet consecutive year so potentially some operational decisions were made as a consequence similar to the second consecutive dry years the seasonal eta results are examined more closely by dividing the growing season into three periods early mid and late season the periods are from 15th april to 15th june for early season 16th june to 15th august for mid season and 16th august to 15th october for late season these divisions represent the various cropping patterns in the brcc with early season growing mainly wheat and alfalfa crops late season growing mainly alfalfa and corn and mid season being the peak of the growing season with all crops growing results for eta according to period and categorized in average dry and wet years are shown in fig 6 additionally dry years are sub divided into first and second dry years to examine the effects on consequential dry years better due to the large variability within the dry year category mean values for each sub season are indicated by the dotted horizontal line and are 205 mm 340 mm and 190 mm for the early mid and late season respectively fig 6 shows that the average years have less variability within the season and especially in the late season d furthermore for the early b and mid c seasons the estimated eta during average years was close to the mean value during the late season period the average year displayed a higher eta than the mean value it is expected that average years are more consistent considering the lack of an extreme event during dry years the mean eta results are similar to those of the average years with the exception of the late season which displays a lower eta compared to the average however large variability is displayed in fig 6 for the dry year category due to the difference between a first and second dry years as indicated in the discussion of fig 5 first dry year events show well above average eta during the early and mid season and the late season eta is at the mean line the high eta during the early and mid season is associated with the high etr which combined with unlimited water supply results in large eta in addition a dry year usually has a shifted peak of cropping patterns compared to an average year due to the warmer temperatures in early spring resulting in crops being grown earlier in the season the second dry year displays well below average values in fig 6 for the early mid and late seasons limited irrigation water availability during a second dry year causes a lower eta throughout the season either cropping patterns were changed to shorter season crops or water stress is occurring due to less frequent irrigation events being possible fig 6 shows that during wet years the eta is usually close to the mean eta of all years the variability in eta is relatively small for each season except the late season which displays a larger variability this might indicate a difference in crop growth stages according to table 2 wet years differ in magnitude of early season average temperature the onset of warmer temperatures triggers the start of the growing season therefore the differences in temperature cause a different timing in the peak growth of the crops this becomes apparent in the late season eta variability for wet years with some crops still at full growth whilst some other crops are senescing or harvested seasonal eta can be related to several weather conditions such as eta precipitation during the growing season and water availability from the mountain snowpack feeding the upstream reservoirs these factors have all shown to have an amount of influence on seasonal eta as is indicated in the discussion so far the weather conditions as stated in table 2 have provided some explanation for the results of seasonal eta shown in figs 5 and 6 however the degree of impact of each weather condition is vague a larger sample of years is required to make more definite connections between weather conditions and impact on seasonal actual eta from the irrigation district 3 4 seasonal crop cover in the previous section variations of seasonal eta were largely explained by weather conditions during the season or snowpack accumulated in the winter and spring however weather conditions alone do not explain the value of estimated seasonal eta during the second year of an extreme event or the variation within each category therefore explanations may be found in the management decisions typical for these years one of these operational decisions is the cropping pattern during average dry and wet years the cropped area for the major crop types is shown in fig 7 displaying the results from several years examined in this study the percentage for wheat crops is very consistent for each year varying between 25 and 29 of the total cropland winter wheat is planted at the end of fall during the previous season therefore farmers cannot anticipate the seasonal water availability in the next year the acreage of alfalfa varies between 37 and 43 with the lowest percentage occurring in a dry year alfalfa is a perennial high water consuming crop and it would seem rational to change this crop to a low water consuming crop during a dry year however no obvious patterns can be distinguished between years alfalfa is a perennial crop lasting typically four years before replanting therefore a farmer will likely not change to another crop during a dry year except if the crop is already due for replanting soon the area farmed for corn seems to be similar in the latter three years during 2008 more pasture was farmed than corn but after this year there is a gradual increase of growing corn likely because it is silage corn which provides better feed than pasture grass farmers testified during interviews that they grow less late season crops such as corn during a dry year due to water allocations running out at the end of the season however this information is not observed in the data from fig 7 the percentage of corn is similar during the 2013 dry year compared to the other years possibly most of the farmers prefer using the warm early spring occurring during a dry year to grow corn early or choose other crops that have a longer growing season overall the differences between years are not distinct and do not indicate a significant seasonal change in cropping pattern so changes in seasonal eta are not explainable from the data available for this factor it is difficult to observe changes with a small set of data and more years are necessary to represent the diverse management occurring in the irrigation district in addition several factors influence the farmer s decision in crop choices seasonal water availability might be of influence but other aspects are considered for example market prices 3 5 irrigation diversions a third explanation given to clarify trends in season crop eta results aside from weather patterns and cropping patterns was the differences in water allocations during dry years compared to full allocations usually granted in average or wet years fig 8 indicates historical data of annual canal diversions and snowpack water equivalent during the past century the canal diversion data shows an overall increasing trend during the first half of the past century according to fig 8 presumably the irrigation district expanded the irrigated cropland and experienced less competition over water supplies with other users due to low population density in the region however during the last few decades the irrigation diversions show no pattern of increase indicating a stationary signal of water allocation the similar stationary nature of the snowpack data during this period would suggest that there was not water supply present to allow diversions to increase there are a few cycles of upward and downward periods in irrigation diversions observed in fig 8 apparently related to variations in climate and water availability the most recent reduced water period occurred between 2000 and 2004 indicated with an arrow in fig 8 which coincides with consecutive dry years due to an extreme drought that occurred during the period droughtmonitor unl edu resulting in low snowpack amounts another downward event is observed in 1991 1993 indicated with an arrow in fig 8 which again is simultaneous to consecutive years of low snowpack amounts the third distinct downward event is shown between 1980 and 1984 indicated with an arrow in fig 8 which is preceded by a few wet years but followed by an extreme low snowpack in 1981 overall this plot indicates that diversions are influenced mainly by dry events that vary in duration or severity this indicates that irrigation diversions are not highly sensitive to a particular year snowpack due to storage in the system but are only impacted during a build up of consecutive dry years or an extreme low snowpack year the reservoirs and lakes supplying the irrigation water decrease the sensitivity of diversions to water availability and are an important buffer for this region this affects the capacity of a region to buffer consecutive dry years this will give valuable knowledge of the number of dry years required to have a major impact on the irrigation district 3 6 depleted fraction the last step is to bring the different results of actual crop et and irrigation diversions together to calculate the irrigation system performance using the depleted fraction to evaluate the irrigation system performance gives valuable insight for the local irrigators and to regional water managers recall the depleted fraction defined in eq 3 is simply the ratio of eta to the total of precipitation and irrigation the calculation here combines the diversion data and seasonal eta from the linear interpolation method assisted with metric instantaneous eta estimates in addition summer precipitation is included in the calculation of the depleted fraction which contributes to the water available for the crops during the growing season the results for depleted fraction are given in fig 9 for the years the seasonal eta was calculated for in this study the 2011 season is excluded from this figure due to measurement disruptions occurring at the diversion point throughout most of the growing season recall the critical value for the depleted fraction is proposed to be 0 6 above which crop water requirements are potentially not fulfilled bos et al 2005 lower than 0 6 values indicate that water is being stored in the groundwater or contributing to runoff for downstream water users fig 9 indicates that most of the dry years are above the 0 6 critical threshold which is expected due to the high crop water demands and less summer rainfall occurring as was reported in table 2 this indicates that water stress might be occurring at different locations in the irrigation system due to the high water demands there is no obvious difference observed between first 2003 and 2007 and second dry years 2004 and 2013 the 2013 growing season has a lower depleted fraction than any of the other growing seasons this coincides with the year of management changes in the canal company so operations might have been different the wet years display values lower than the 0 6 threshold thus indicating that sufficient water is being supplied to the fields but some of the water is transported to storage or runoff during the wet years summer precipitation is typically higher than the other years as indicated in table 2 however the irrigation diversion presumably does not adapt which was also indicated by local water managers during a precipitation event less stress is put on the water delivery schedule but the schedule remains unchanged the average years indicate a large variety in depleted fractions which is potentially connected to factors other than the seasonal water availability the 2010 season shows a higher depleted fraction than the other average years this is probably explained by the extremely low summer rainfall occurring during that growing season as is indicated by table 2 the other two average years 2008 and 2009 are close to the average depleted fraction overall the performance of the irrigation district is commendable based on these criteria with an average depleted fraction during the past decade of 0 63 presumably neither substantial crop water stress nor water losses are occurring when the entire period is integrated however the variability could be more balanced towards storing water during wet years and making better use of summer precipitation 4 conclusions this research analyzed a decade of remote sensing data linked to an et model to distinguish inter annual variability of seasonal eta from an irrigation district in northern utah and related this to seasonal water availability seasonal water availability was determined using precipitation snowpack water equivalent and etr data and a drought index value was used to distinguish between average wet and dry years seasonal eta was compared to seasonal weather conditions and to operational aspects namely cropping patterns and irrigation diversions it was found that water consumption differed between a first and second consecutive dry year with the first having high seasonal eta estimates which related to high etr whilst the second dry year displayed low seasonal eta estimates due to decreased water availability this indicated that the capacity of the irrigation district to buffer consecutive dry years was already limited in the occurrence of two consecutive dry years farm management decisions can be influenced by the seasonal water availability however cropping patterns portrayed no distinct relation with seasonal water availability irrigation diversions were only influenced by prolonged dry events or a severe dry event this indicates that the capacity of the irrigation system to use upstream reservoirs as buffer is limited the depleted fraction indicated good overall performance of the irrigation system during wet years the irrigation performance could be improved by incorporating summer precipitation in the irrigation scheduling the decade of eta estimates provided some results on the adaptability of the irrigation system to cope with water availability however a decade appeared to be not long enough for the time scale of short term climate variability especially in this region hence these connections could be made more distinct with the use of a longer period of analysis thereby including more cycles of wet and dry years regarding the adaptability of the irrigation system it is concluded from this study that second dry or wet years lead farmers to adapt to the water availability resulting in changes in seasonal eta these inter annual differences of seasonal eta from this irrigation district offers practical insights to water managers for anticipating future climate scenarios in snow driven systems especially if more extreme events occur of varying duration and severity the inter annual variability in seasonal eta indicates the importance of using a multiple year average for making decisions whereas frequently one year is used as representative results also showed that this irrigation district is impacted by a two year drought event the adaptability of the irrigation district is proven to cope with a one year dry event but the buffer capacity is not sufficient for two consecutive dry years or more the findings make it very evident that in an irrigation district similar to this one the classification of a year as wet dry or average is ambiguous without knowledge of the climate of the previous periods this points directly to the importance of knowing the storage capacity effects on water delivery of the system for any future scenario of decreasing water availability or more frequent extreme events it is of importance to improve the adaptability of the irrigation system and

total number of fruits per tree ranged from 39 1 to 53 4 fruit weight from 253 4 to 350 4 g and yield from 9 8 to 18 6 kg tree 1 among the three pomegranate cultivars studied table 1 the malase saveh cultivar showed the highest number of fruits per tree fruit weight and yield whereas mikhosh cultivar showed the lowest values on the other hand the malase saveh cultivar exhibited the lowest fruit cracking percentage 3 75 whereas mikhosh showed the highest fruit cracking percentage 4 43 under control conditions under drought stress progressive decreases in yield related parameters were observed in the three cultivars and intense drought caused the highest reductions in the number of fruits per tree fruit weight and yield when compared to slight and moderate drought table 1 likewise intense drought increased the fruit cracking percentage compared to slight and moderate drought specifically intense drought stress caused 39 1 41 5 and 43 9 reductions in the number of fruits per tree 29 7 38 2 and 40 7 reductions in fruit weight and 58 0 65 4 and 67 3 reductions in yield in the malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh cultivars respectively relative to control conditions table 1 drought affects yields via decreases in leaf chlorophyll levels and photosynthesis rates as well as reductions in sugar translocation from leaves to fruits sid ko et al 2017 our results are in line with a previous study showing that severe drought caused clear differences among eleven mediterranean pomegranate cultivars and that the drought induced reduction in yield was correlated with significant decreases in photosynthetic pigments fruit weight and number of fruits per tree adiba et al 2021a similarly a recent study showed that moderate and intense drought decreased the yield of sefri and wonderful pomegranate cultivars and yield reduction was attributed to the decrease in fruit weight and fruit cracking adiba et al 2021a in the present study intense drought increased fruit cracking by 84 2 104 5 and 142 8 in the malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh cultivars respectively relative to control conditions table 1 pictures of the fruits are shown in fig 1 in pomegranate cracking is a physiological disorder resulting from changes in fruit water relations fruit skin properties nutritional deficiencies and sharp fluctuations in day night temperature during early fruit growth and or ripening which collectively result in deleterious effects on fruit quality shelf life and commercial value noitsakis et al 2016 marboh et al 2017 ghanbarpour et al 2019 martinez nicolas et al 2019 in pomegranate fruit cracking incidence under drought was interlinked with fruit turgor loss leading to a decrease in fruit growth and yield serpe and matthews 2000 galindo et al 2014 in the present study intense drought showed minimal effects on yield related parameters and cracking incidence in malase saveh suggesting that this cultivar is a potential drought tolerant one 3 2 effects of drought stress on leaf photosynthetic pigments under control conditions the leaf concentrations of leaf chl a b and cars ranged from 3 02 to 3 26 mg g 1 fw and from 0 71 to 0 94 mg g 1 fw respectively among all investigated pomegranate cultivars supplementary materials table s3 under control conditions the malase saveh cultivar showed the highest chl a b and car concentrations whereas rabab e neyriz and mikhosh exhibited the lowest chl a b and car concentrations respectively drought led to a progressive reduction in leaf photosynthetic pigment concentrations relative to control conditions in the three pomegranate cultivars with intense drought causing the highest reductions when compared to slight and moderate drought specifically intense drought stress decreased the concentrations of chl a b by 22 6 25 8 and 38 6 and those of car by 29 7 36 9 and 39 4 in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh respectively relative to control conditions supplementary materials table s3 drought induced reduction in leaf photosynthetic pigment levels has been reported in several fruit crops therefore affecting photosynthetic capacity and crop productivity zarafshar et al 2014 pourghayoumi et al 2017b water stress causes oxidative damages due to an increase in ros level in chloroplasts and mitochondria reddy et al 2004 liu et al 2011 subsequently causing peroxidation and degradation of photosynthetic pigments ramírez et al 2014 our results are consistent with previous studies showing that severe drought led to a significant reduction in chl a b in different commercial iranian pomegranate cultivars pourghayoumi et al 2017b tatari et al 2020 in addition photosynthetic pigments in the ghojagh cultivar was least affected by drought stress compared to other cultivars which was attributed to a better leaf water status allowing the plant to continue metabolic activities and maintain light dissipation systems pourghayoumi et al 2017b similarly under severe drought pomegranate leaves activate osmotic adjustment as an adaptive mechanism to maintain turgor ensuring normal photosynthetic activity thereby maintaining yield and fruit weight aseri et al 2008 the ability of some pomegranate cultivars to maintain chl levels and photosynthesis rates under drought has been suggested to play an important role in crop productivity pourghayoumi et al 2017b in the present study leaf photosynthetic pigments in the malase saveh cultivar were least affected by drought indicating that it can be a potential drought tolerant candidate 3 3 effects of drought on tss ta and sugars under control conditions tss in fruit juice ranged from 15 6 to 19 1 ta from 2 1 to 2 4 glucose from 36 1 to 55 4 g l 1 and fructose from 45 8 to 71 3 g l 1 in the three pomegranate cultivars studied fig 2a d supplementary materials table s4 specifically the fruit juice of the malase saveh cultivar showed the highest tss ta glucose and fructose contents whereas mikhosh showed the lowest ones slight drought stress did not affect significantly tss and ta levels in the juice of malase saveh and rabab e neyriz but increased tss levels in mikhosh fig 2a b supplementary materials table s4 in contrast moderate and intense drought caused significant reductions in the concentrations of tss and ta with the exception of ta in malase saveh with intense drought causing stronger reductions than moderate drought fig 2a d intense drought reduced tss by 20 0 25 6 and 27 7 ta by 13 1 15 7 and 20 3 glucose by 12 2 18 0 and 19 6 and fructose by 13 0 8 6 and 17 2 in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh respectively when compared to the control conditions our results are in line with those of galindo et al 2017 who showed that water withholding during early and late fruit ripping of the mollar de elche pomegranate cultivar decreased tss and ta in fruit juice likewise drought stress decreased tss and ta in the fruit juice of sefri and wonderful pomegranate cultivars affecting juice sweetness adiba et al 2021a in contrast laribi et al 2013 found a significant increase in tss and ta in the fruit juice of pomegranate cultivars exposed to water deficit during fruit growth and ripening and other studies reported that water deficiency had no significant effects on the sugar contents of pomegranate juice mellisho et al 2012 centofanti et al 2017 in the present study tss and ta varied among cultivars and stress severity with the main cause of such variation being not clear however some authors have indicated that a high tss could be caused by osmotic adjustments in the juice cells barry et al 2004 pérez pérez et al 2009 our results and studies cited above suggest that genetic differences and experimental conditions can be determinant factors for pomegranate juice traits under drought the taste of arils obtained from pomegranate cultivars is variable ranging from sweet to sour amir et al 2018 and glucose and fructose are the major sugars in the fruit juice with maltose and sucrose being found in lower amounts dafny yalin et al 2010 in the present study slight drought increased the concentrations of glucose and fructose in all three pomegranate cultivars fig 2c d supplementary materials table s4 many plant species accumulate soluble organic compounds such as sugars in order to maintain cellular turgor and decrease cell dehydration under limited water resources sethi and kaur 2016 abdelrahman et al 2021 however moderate and intense drought decreased the contents of glucose and fructose in all three investigated cultivars similarly schwartz et al 2009a 2009b and li et al 2015 reported that in different pomegranate cultivars glucose and fructose levels decreased in hot dry desert climate and increased in cooler temperatures implying that temperature and water stress play important roles in determining the sugar content of pomegranate juice bar ya akov et al 2019 likewise water deficiency at the flowering stage decreased glucose and sucrose levels in the juice of mollar de elche and wonderful pomegranate cultivars when compared to well watered conditions martinez nicolas et al 2019 in general the decreases in the concentrations of fructose and glucose under moderate and intense drought may affect the palatability and sweetness of the fruit juice 3 4 effects of drought stress on asc tac tpc ellagic acid and dpph under control conditions asc contents in the fruit juice ranged from 62 3 to 78 6 tac from 8 0 to 10 2 and tpc from 47 3 to 63 3 mg 100 g 1 fw in all three investigated cultivars supplementary materials table s5 likewise the concentration of ellagic acid ranged from 18 7 to 23 1 mg l 1 and dpph from 68 8 to 87 3 in the three cultivars supplementary materials table s5 the malase saveh cultivar showed the highest levels of asc tac tpc ellagic acid and dpph whereas mikhosh showed the lowest ones under control conditions progressive drought stress led to significant reductions in asc tac tpc and dpph levels in the three investigated cultivars when compared to control conditions with intense drought showing higher reductions when compared to slight and moderate drought supplementary materials table s5 however slight drought caused a significant increase in the contents of ellagic acid and tpc in all three cultivars when compared to control conditions fig 3a supplementary materials table s5 specifically intense drought decreased the contents of asc by 36 8 50 7 and 49 4 tac by 46 0 44 5 and 45 tpc by 27 0 28 6 and 41 4 and dpph by 32 6 31 3 and 28 9 in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh respectively when compared to control conditions the above results indicated that the concentrations of asc and tpc in malase saveh cultivar were least affected by intense drought when compared to rabab e neyriz and mikhosh whereas the intense drought induced reductions in tac and dpph were comparable in the three pomegranate cultivars slight drought increased the contents of ellagic acid by 6 0 10 6 and 10 6 respectively in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh relative to control conditions ascorbate is one of the well known non enzymatic antioxidants with significant potential for scavenging ros and modulating a number of fundamental functions in plants under stress and non stress conditions akram et al 2017 ahmed et al 2014 hossain et al 2019 sariyer and öztokat kuzucu 2019 an early study reported that the asc content is highly variable among different pomegranate cultivars and indian ones contained higher amounts of asc than those from oman and egypt opara et al 2009 in the present study the content of asc decreased in all pomegranate cultivars in response to drought but the reduction of asc in malase saveh cultivar was minimal when compared to other examined cultivars our results are in contrast with the early study by peña et al 2013 where water deficit increased the contents of asc in the mollar de elche cultivar as a protective strategy against drought injury pomegranate juice contains various types of anthocyanins including cyanidin delphinidin pelargonidin and their glucosides which play significant roles in fruit color formation and plant adaption to various environmental conditions galindo et al 2017 abdelrahman et al 2019 melgarejo sánchez et al 2021 in the present study tac decreased in the three pomegranate cultivars studied in response to drought this was consistent with the observed reduction in tac in the fruit juice of pomegranate cultivars grown in hot dry desert areas compared to cultivars grown under mediterranean conditions schwartz et al 2009a 2009b the decrease in tac in pomegranate juice has been attributed to the reduction in shoot and leaf growth due to the increase in temperature and sunlight schwartz et al 2009a 2009b martinez nicolas et al 2019 in contrast previous studies showed increases in tac in the pomegranate leaf skin and juice in response to drought stress laribi et al 2013 galindo et al 2017 similarly galindo et al 2017 reported that a very short period of water stress at the end of ripening period enhanced the contents of tac tpc and ellagic acid without affecting marketable yield and fruit size our results and above examples indicated that there is genetic variation regarding anthocyanin content under drought stress in pomegranate and this issue deserves further exploration pomegranate fruit juice contains high amounts of phenolics including gallic ellagic acids caffeic chlorogenic and p coumaric acids which act as powerful antioxidants and antimicrobials and also in stress signaling galindo et al 2017 the decrease in tpc found in this study in moderate and intense drought was consistent with the significant reduction in tpc in the fruit juice of mollar de elche cultivar in response to water deficient at fruit ripening stage galindo et al 2017 similarly the tpc in the fruit juice of sefri and wonderful cultivars was decreased in response to intense drought adiba et al 2021a the decrease in tpc has been attributed to the enzymatic oxidation of polyphenols under intense drought fawole et al 2013 the decrease in non enzymatic antioxidants including asc tac and tpc was associated with the reduction in dpph in response to drought likewise the ros scavenging activities in fruit juice using the dpph assay did not show significant changes in response to water stress at fruit ripening stage galindo et al 2017 studies carried out with juice of different pomegranate cultivars have reported differences related to the phenolic compound contribution to antioxidant capacity assays mena et al 2013 peña et al 2013 it is well known that water stress influences the content of secondary metabolites in plant tissues and contradictory results have been found in other crops for example chaves et al 2007 reported a substantial accumulation of anthocyanins in grape berries under water stress in contrast kennedy et al 2000 showed that osmotic stress had little or no effect on anthocyanin accumulation in grape berries these variations can be attributed to the genetic variations and differences in experimental conditions such as the phenological period at which stress takes place the severity and duration of stress level the incidence of partial recoveries and the genetic variability among cultivars 3 5 effects of drought stress on carboxylic acids under control conditions the concentrations of citric tartaric malic and oxalic acids in juice were in the ranges 1 09 2 05 0 29 0 47 0 29 0 61 and 0 72 1 33 g l 1 respectively fig 3b supplementary materials table s6 the malase saveh cultivar showed the highest citric tartaric malic and oxalic acid concentrations whereas mikhosh had the lowest contents under control conditions drought led to increases in the concentrations of all carboxylic acids in the three pomegranate cultivars studied and intense drought showed the highest accumulations of carboxylic acids compared to slight and moderate drought fig 3b supplementary materials table s6 specifically intense drought stress increased the contents of citric tartaric malic and oxalic acids by 40 0 21 8 and 31 1 65 9 34 3 and 75 8 50 8 46 5 and 62 0 and 26 3 30 6 and 34 7 in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh respectively when compared to control conditions although malase saveh showed the highest concentrations of carboxylic acids under both control and drought conditions mikhosh exhibited the highest relative increases with the exception of citric acid in response to drought stress carboxylic acids are crucial for plant adaption to various abiotic stresses as they maintain cellular functions by providing energy for different biological activities and precursors for various biosynthetic pathways farooq et al 2009 foti et al 2021 pre harvest application of oxalic acid improved pomegranate fruit quality and yield and increased the concentrations of malic acid ascorbic acid tac and total antioxidant activities garcía pastor et al 2020a likewise application of salicylic acid sa improved pomegranate fruit quality and storage life and this was attributed to a higher accumulation of sugars citric acid and tac in sa treated than in sa non treated plants garcía pastor et al 2020b in thirty tunisian pomegranate accessions the predominant carboxylate in fruit juice was malic acid followed by citric acid hasnaoui et al 2011 however in thirteen turkish pomegranate varieties citric acid was the predominant carboxylate in fruit juice followed by malic acid poyrazoğlu et al 2002 this suggests that genetic differences as well as growth conditions may affect the carboxylic acid levels in pomegranate juice in tomato the improvement in fruit quality under water deficit conditions was attributed to the increase in the synthesis of carboxylates and the concentrations of malate and citrate were highly affected by tomato cultivars and water stress severity nahar et al 2011 nahar and ullah 2018 iranian pomegranate cultivars and specifically malase saveh had high contents of carboxylic acids and this could be an adaptation mechanism against drought that could increase the sour taste of fruit juice and thereby increase the market value 3 6 effects of drought stress on phytohormone concentrations under control conditions leaf aba ranged from 152 8 to 201 5 ng g 1 fw and iaa from 81 3 to 96 4 ng g 1 fw in the three pomegranate cultivars fig 3c supplementary materials table s7 the malase saveh cultivar showed the highest aba and iaa values whereas mikhosh showed the lowest ones under control conditions under drought stress a concomitant increase in the levels of aba and iaa was observed in the three pomegranate cultivars studied and intense drought led to a higher increase in the levels of phytohormones compared to slight and moderate drought fig 3c table s7 specifically leaf aba and iaa showed 25 6 45 1 and 50 1 and 40 3 42 3 and 42 5 increases in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh in response to intense drought although the leaf levels of aba and iaa in the malase saveh cultivar were high under control and drought conditions when compared to the other two cultivars mikhosh had the higher percentage of increase in aba in response to intense drought iaa regulation varies with plant species growth stage and stress conditions such as duration and intensity krishnan and merewitz 2015 in pomegranate high contents of iaa in the later stage of flower development promotes the development of bisexual flowers whereas high level of aba in middle and later stages stimulates sterility of ovary and promotes stamen organ development resulting in functional male flowers zhao et al 2019 aba is involved in drought stress via signaling reactions to stomatal blockage and the regulation of stress protecting genes krishnan and merewitz 2015 in a recent study aba treatment enhanced drought tolerance in pomegranate and this was attributed to aba induced antioxidant enzyme activities allowing for a decrease in ros and better growth performance qian et al 2020 additionally exogenous aba treatment enhanced pomegranate drought tolerance by activating brassinosteroid synthesis photosynthesis peroxisome biogenesis and hemicellulose synthesis pathways qian et al 2020 likewise exogenous iaa application enhanced drought tolerance in white clover zhang et al 2020 and this was attributed to increase in aba and jasmonic acid levels modulation of genes involved in drought stress response and leaf senescence zhang et al 2020 in general changes in aba and iaa levels have been related to plant adaptation to drought stress abdelrahman et al 2018 in this study malase saveh cultivars maintained high levels of aba and iaa under control and drought when compared to rabab e neyriz and mikhosh and this might be associated with its better yield and physiological responses 3 7 effects of drought stress on oxidative stress parameters proline and antioxidant enzymes under control conditions the leaf concentrations of mda and h2o2 were in the ranges 8 3 10 1 and 0 83 1 13 nmol g 1 fw in the three investigated iranian pomegranate cultivars fig 3c supplementary materials table s7 although mda and h2o2 levels were comparable in all cultivars malase saveh had the highest mda and h2o2 values under control conditions drought increased the oxidative stress related parameters in all cultivars suggesting that drought stress induced ros accumulation and disrupted cell membrane stability fig 3c supplementary materials table s7 intense drought increased the mda and h2o2 levels more than slight and moderate drought specifically intense drought increased mda by 96 0 105 4 and 107 2 and h2o2 by 62 8 87 9 and 90 3 in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh respectively these results indicated that drought induced oxidative stress was lowest in the malase saveh cultivar compared to the other two cultivars increased levels of mda and h2o2 are commonly associated with lipid peroxidation in cell membranes and are often used to estimate the extent of oxidative stress induced damage in cellular membranes and tissues siddique et al 2012 laxa et al 2019 drought stress increased markedly oxidative stress parameters including h2o2 mda other aldehydes and el in american and iranian pistachio rootstocks and the most tolerant cultivars showed the lowest values for these parameters jamshidi goharrizi et al 2020a 2020b under control conditions proline concentrations ranged from 1 59 to 2 61 µg g 1 fw in the three pomegranate cultivars fig 3c supplementary materials table s7 the malase saveh cultivar had higher leaf levels of proline compared to rabab e neyriz and mikhosh the high proline levels in malase saveh cultivar under control conditions might constitute a pre stress adaption mechanism which could be useful for rapid response to drought stress intense drought increased the levels of proline by 12 6 60 6 and 56 6 in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh cultivars respectively fig 3c supplementary materials table s7 likewise variable increases in proline levels was observed in several iranian pomegranates in response to drought depending on the plant cultivar and the severity of drought stress tatari et al 2020 a drought induced proline accumulation was previously reported in pomegranate cultivars khattab et al 2011 however our results showed more profound increases in proline levels than those previously reported suggesting that proline accumulation in pomegranate is associated with genetic variability the improvement of the cell osmotic potential through the accumulation of osmo protectants such as proline which helps to maintain cell water potential is one of the most important factors in drought tolerance in pomegranate rodríguez et al 2012 although intense drought led to higher increases in proline levels in rabab e neyriz and mikhosh when compared to control conditions the malase saveh cultivar maintained high levels or proline under both normal and stress conditions and this could contribute to the better yield under drought stress compared to rabab e neyriz and mikhosh cultivars under control conditions the cat activity ranged from 3 3 to 4 6 δ240 min 1 prot 1 sod from 3 8 to 4 7 u mg prot 1 pod from 15 5 to 17 8 u mg prot 1 and apx from 2 6 to 3 7 δ240 min 1 prot 1 in the three pomegranate cultivars fig 3d supplementary materials table s8 the malase saveh cultivar showed the highest antioxidant enzyme activities under control conditions drought stress increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes compared to control conditions with intense drought causing higher enzymatic activities in all pomegranate cultivars compared to slight and moderate drought fig 3d table s8 in addition antioxidant enzyme activities were higher in the malase saveh cultivar compared to the other two cultivars under intense drought specifically intense drought stress increased the activities of cat by 71 1 100 and 127 7 sod by 113 9 100 2 and 123 3 pod by 60 1 61 1 and 55 7 and apx by 94 0 151 4 and 162 5 in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh respectively our results are consistent with the observed increase in cat sod and pod activities in several iranian pomegranates under drought stress conditions pourghayoumi et al 2017b the drought stress tolerance of different pomegranate cultivars has been attributed to increases in the contents of proline and the activities of sod and pod tatari et al 2020 plants develop high performance enzymatic and non enzymatic defense systems that can limit or neutralize the overproduction of ros subsequently maintaining cellular function under stress conditions blokhina et al 2003 abdelrahman et al 2015 2020 the high basal levels of antioxidant enzymes in the malase saveh cultivar are consistent with the minimal increases in mda and h2o2 in response to drought when compared to rabab e neyriz and mikhosh pourghayoumi et al 2017b reported a non significant increase in mda in drought tolerant pomegranate cultivars compared to drought sensitive cultivars when grown under control conditions in the same study upon exposure to severe drought stress the activities of antioxidant enzymes increased and the level of mda decreased in drought tolerant pomegranate cultivars compared to drought sensitive ones pourghayoumi et al 2017b the slight increase in oxidative stress parameters in the malase saveh cultivar under control conditions might constitute a pre stress adaptation mechanism for activation of antioxidant enzymes which can enable plants to grow under unfavorable conditions 3 8 principal component analysis correlation between parameters and dendrogram clustering the pca was carried out using data for slight moderate and severe drought stresses in all investigated traits in the three iranian pomegranate cultivars fig 4 pca biplots for the three drought stress regimes showed two distinct groups under slight moderate and intense drought the pca biplot had pc1 and pc2 explaining 86 17 and 13 83 89 41 and 10 54 and 91 71 and 8 30 of the total variance respectively fig 4a b and c respectively in all three pca biplots the malase saveh cultivar was separated in one group whereas rabab e neyriz and mikhosh were separated in a second group fig 4a c the pca results confirmed that drought stress exhibited major changes in the phenotype physiological and biochemical traits of the malase saveh cultivar when compared to the other two iranian cultivars among the investigated traits changes in fruit cracking were mainly associated with the rabab e neyriz and mikhosh cultivars on the other hand changes in the photosynthetic pigments and antioxidant enzyme levels were associated with the malase saveh cultivar fig 4a c all the pca statistics are shown in supplementary materials table s9 a correlation heatmap showed that the yield parameters number of fruits per tree fruit weight and yield were positively correlated with photosynthetic pigments chl and cars and some biochemical parameters tss ta glucose fructose asc tac tpc ellagic acid dpph and carboxylates fig 5a in contrast fruit cracking exhibited negative correlations with yield related parameters number of fruits per tree fruit weight and yield photosynthetic pigments chl and cars and some biochemical parameters tss ta glucose fructose asc tac tpc ellagic acid dpph and carboxylates on the on the other hand fruit cracking showed positive correlation with oxidative stress parameters mda and h2o2 phytohormones aba and iaa and enzymatic activities cat pod sod and apx in addition we observed negative correlations between yield related parameters and antioxidant enzymes fig 5a although the antioxidant enzymes are important factors for plant survival under stress conditions an increase in antioxidant enzymes may not always result in yield increases a dendrogram cluster analysis was carried out using all variables and three clades were observed fig 5b clade i include rabab e neyriz grown under normal irrigation and malase saveh grown under normal irrigation and slight drought clade ii include malase saveh grown under moderate and intense drought rabab e neyriz grown under slight and moderate drought and mikhosh grown in control conditions and slight drought clade iii include mikhosh grown under moderate and intense drought and rabab e neyriz grown under intense drought the similar responses of malase saveh under control conditions and slight drought suggest that malase saveh is somewhat able to tolerate drought and can therefore be cultivated under relatively low irrigation conditions 4 conclusion pomegranate is a drought tolerant species and its cultivation is favored even in semi arid climate with different varieties having different adaptation potentials intense drought led to profound changes in the yield biochemical and physiological parameters when compared to slight and moderate drought intense drought led to significant decreases in fruit number per tree fruit weight and photosynthetic pigments which collectively resulted in considerable reductions in yield compared to control conditions in contrast fruit cracking was significantly increased in response to drought thus affecting the fruit market value in this study we found that the malase saveh cultivar was more tolerant against drought stress compared to rabab e neyriz and mikhosh cultivars given the better yield biochemical and physiological responses in this cultivar the malase saveh cultivars exhibited higher contents of photosynthetic pigments asc tac tpc carboxylic acids proline and phytohormones as well as antioxidant enzyme activities compared to rabab e neyriz and mikhosh in response to drought stress the observed differences in the physiological and biochemical responses of iranian cultivars against drought stress indicate that genetic differences could be responsible for the differences in drought tolerance the malase saveh cultivar can be used as a drought tolerant candidate for breeding programs and molecular biology studies aimed to improve yield

levels of aba iaa proline malondialdehyde mda and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as well as the activities of catalase cat peroxidase pod superoxide dismutase sod and ascorbate peroxidase apx antioxidant enzymes were observed in the leaves of all cultivars under intense drought stress with respect to fruit juice quality intense drought caused a considerable decrease in the contents of sugars tac tpc ellagic acid asc tss and ta relative to control conditions while carboxylic acids increased slight drought caused small increases in the concentrations of sugars tpc and ellagic acid in juice the malase saveh cultivar showed a better adaptive response to drought stress than the rabab e neyriz and mikhosh ones suggesting that this pomegranate cultivar could be used in breeding programs to develop new ones with beneficial water stress adaptive traits and better fruit quality keywords drought stress pomegranate bioactive compounds antioxidant activity osmotic adjustment oxidative stress parameters 1 introduction different kinds of abiotic stresses including salinity drought osmotic and cold stresses can alter many physiological and biochemical traits in different plant species jamshidi goharrizi et al 2020c 2020d 2020e 2021 it is expected that by 2050 drought stress will cause significant problems for crop productivity in more than 50 of the arable land kasim et al 2013 the severity of the damage caused by drought is generally unpredictable as it is controlled by many factors including the soil type rainfall patterns and water losses through evapotranspiration abdelrahman et al 2018 the plant response to drought generally varies within species and also depends on the plant growth stage and other environmental conditions in the early phase of drought gradual water depletion causes a decrease in shoot growth along with small increases in the root mass fraction to maintain water uptake ma et al 2020 in contrast plants exposed to severe and or prolonged drought show significant reductions in growth and productivity caused by altered plant water relations decreased co2 assimilation increased production of reactive oxygen species ros and ros induced oxidative damage as well as decreases in plant cell turgor pressure leading to wrinkled cell walls abdelrahman et al 2018 when plants are exposed to limited water conditions for short or long time periods morphological physiological and molecular strategies are elicited to maintain plant functions under stress pourghayoumi et al 2017a 2017b for example osmotic adjustment via accumulation of compatible solutes and reducing transpiration are well known adaptive mechanisms that play significant roles in the plant adaptation to dehydration this maintains turgor pressure and water use efficiency enabling plants to survive under drought without great loss in productivity nemeskéri et al 2015 hosseini et al 2018 pomegranate punica granatum l is one of the oldest horticultural fruit crops and its fruits are usually consumed fresh and in processed forms dhinesh and ramasamy 2016 pomegranate has been recognized as a fortified source of dietary polyphenols with potential antioxidant capacity and health promoting properties due to the high contents of ascorbic acid asc anthocyanins and ferulic acid sakar et al 2016 akhavan and barzegar 2017 jamali and bonyanpour 2017 davarpanah et al 2020 pomegranate is native to the iranian plateau and central asia but since the species is highly adaptive to a wide range of climate and soil conditions it is currently grown in many different geographical areas including asia the mediterranean basin and the americas parvizi et al 2016 davarpanah et al 2018 ghanbarpour et al 2019 pomegranate is a drought tolerant species which is usually grown in arid and semiarid areas with limited water resources galindo et al 2017 ghanbarpour et al 2019 however prolonged and severe drought episodes have become a major concern for pomegranate growers around the world because of the drought impacts on fruit yield quality and appearance specifically pomegranate orchards grown under drought usually show reduced fruit yield and quality increased fruit cracking and changes in the content of different biochemical compounds including phenolics anthocyanins citric and tartaric acid martinez nicolas et al 2019 tatari et al 2020 adiba et al 2021a 2021b therefore identification of candidate drought tolerant cultivars and evaluation of agronomical traits among different genetic resources are crucial for improving fruit productivity and quality in pomegranate with the aim of selecting drought tolerant cultivars three commercial iranian ones malase saveh mikhosh and rabab neyriz were evaluated for tolerance to slight moderate and intense drought stress assessing changes in yield parameters fruit yield number of fruits per tree fruit weight and fruit cracking metabolites in leaves and fruits chlorophyll chl a b carotenoids cars

parameters and enzyme extraction three different leaves per tree were sampled and extracts prepared as in pan et al 2006 the concentration of malondialdehyde mda in the extract was determined spectrophotometrically cary 100 at 532 nm as in hodges et al 1999 the h2o2 concentration in leaf samples was determined with k iodate in a spectrophotometer cary 100 at 390 nm using a h2o2 standard

osmolyte analyses was three each averaging values from two trees 2 8 data analysis the experiment was conducted as a randomized complete block design with three replications data obtained were analyzed using analysis of variance anova and the mean values were compared using duncan s multiple range test at p 0 01 sas software v 9 1 principal component analysis pca pearson correlation coefficient and dendrogram clustering were carried out using r v 3 4 3 www r project org 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of drought stress on yield related parameters under control conditions the total number of fruits per tree ranged from 39 1 to 53 4 fruit weight from 253 4 to 350 4 g and yield from 9 8 to 18 6 kg tree 1 among the three pomegranate cultivars studied table 1 the malase saveh cultivar showed the highest number of fruits per tree fruit weight and yield whereas mikhosh cultivar showed the lowest values on the other hand the malase saveh cultivar exhibited the lowest fruit cracking percentage 3 75 whereas mikhosh showed the highest fruit cracking percentage 4 43 under control conditions under drought stress progressive decreases in yield related parameters were observed in the three cultivars and intense drought caused the highest reductions in the number of fruits per tree fruit weight and yield when compared to slight and moderate drought table 1 likewise intense drought increased the fruit cracking percentage compared to slight and moderate drought specifically intense drought stress caused 39 1 41 5 and 43 9 reductions in the number of fruits per tree 29 7 38 2 and 40 7 reductions in fruit weight and 58 0 65 4 and 67 3 reductions in yield in the malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh cultivars respectively relative to control conditions table 1 drought affects yields via decreases in leaf chlorophyll levels and photosynthesis rates as well as reductions in sugar translocation from leaves to fruits sid ko et al 2017 our results are in line with a previous study showing that severe drought caused clear differences among eleven mediterranean pomegranate cultivars and that the drought induced reduction in yield was correlated with significant decreases in photosynthetic pigments fruit weight and number of fruits per tree adiba et al 2021a similarly a recent study showed that moderate and intense drought decreased the yield of sefri and wonderful pomegranate cultivars and yield reduction was attributed to the decrease in fruit weight and fruit cracking adiba et al 2021a in the present study intense drought increased fruit cracking by 84 2 104 5 and 142 8 in the malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh cultivars respectively relative to control conditions table 1 pictures of the fruits are shown in fig 1 in pomegranate cracking is a physiological disorder resulting from changes in fruit water relations fruit skin properties nutritional deficiencies and sharp fluctuations in day night temperature during early fruit growth and or ripening which collectively result in deleterious effects on fruit quality shelf life and commercial value noitsakis et al 2016 marboh et al 2017 ghanbarpour et al 2019 martinez nicolas et al 2019 in pomegranate fruit cracking incidence under drought was interlinked with fruit turgor loss leading to a decrease in fruit growth and yield serpe and matthews 2000 galindo et al 2014 in the present study intense drought showed minimal effects on yield related parameters and cracking incidence in malase saveh suggesting that this cultivar is a potential drought tolerant one 3 2 effects of drought stress on leaf photosynthetic pigments under control conditions the leaf concentrations of leaf chl a b and cars ranged from 3 02 to 3 26 mg g 1 fw and from 0 71 to 0 94 mg g 1 fw respectively among all investigated pomegranate cultivars supplementary materials table s3 under control conditions the malase saveh cultivar showed the highest chl a b and car concentrations whereas rabab e neyriz and mikhosh exhibited the lowest chl a b and car concentrations respectively drought led to a progressive reduction in leaf photosynthetic pigment concentrations relative to control conditions in the three pomegranate cultivars with intense drought causing the highest reductions when compared to slight and moderate drought specifically intense drought stress decreased the concentrations of chl a b by 22 6 25 8 and 38 6 and those of car by 29 7 36 9 and 39 4 in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh respectively relative to control conditions supplementary materials table s3 drought induced reduction in leaf photosynthetic pigment levels has been reported in several fruit crops therefore affecting photosynthetic capacity and crop productivity zarafshar et al 2014 pourghayoumi et al 2017b water stress causes oxidative damages due to an increase in ros level in chloroplasts and mitochondria reddy et al 2004 liu et al 2011 subsequently causing peroxidation and degradation of photosynthetic pigments ramírez et al 2014 our results are consistent with previous studies showing that severe drought led to a significant reduction in chl a b in different commercial iranian pomegranate cultivars pourghayoumi et al 2017b tatari et al 2020 in addition photosynthetic pigments in the ghojagh cultivar was least affected by drought stress compared to other cultivars which was attributed to a better leaf water status allowing the plant to continue metabolic activities and maintain light dissipation systems pourghayoumi et al 2017b similarly under severe drought pomegranate leaves activate osmotic adjustment as an adaptive mechanism to maintain turgor ensuring normal photosynthetic activity thereby maintaining yield and fruit weight aseri et al 2008 the ability of some pomegranate cultivars to maintain chl levels and photosynthesis rates under drought has been suggested to play an important role in crop productivity pourghayoumi et al 2017b in the present study leaf photosynthetic pigments in the malase saveh cultivar were least affected by drought indicating that it can be a potential drought tolerant candidate 3 3 effects of drought on tss ta and sugars under control conditions tss in fruit juice ranged from 15 6 to 19 1 ta from 2 1 to 2 4 glucose from 36 1 to 55 4 g l 1 and fructose from 45 8 to 71 3 g l 1 in the three pomegranate cultivars studied fig 2a d supplementary materials table s4 specifically the fruit juice of the malase saveh cultivar showed the highest tss ta glucose and fructose contents whereas mikhosh showed the lowest ones slight drought stress did not affect significantly tss and ta levels in the juice of malase saveh and rabab e neyriz but increased tss levels in mikhosh fig 2a b supplementary materials table s4 in contrast moderate and intense drought caused significant reductions in the concentrations of tss and ta with the exception of ta in malase saveh with intense drought causing stronger reductions than moderate drought fig 2a d intense drought reduced tss by 20 0 25 6 and 27 7 ta by 13 1 15 7 and 20 3 glucose by 12 2 18 0 and 19 6 and fructose by 13 0 8 6 and 17 2 in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh respectively when compared to the control conditions our results are in line with those of galindo et al 2017 who showed that water withholding during early and late fruit ripping of the mollar de elche pomegranate cultivar decreased tss and ta in fruit juice likewise drought stress decreased tss and ta in the fruit juice of sefri and wonderful pomegranate cultivars affecting juice sweetness adiba et al 2021a in contrast laribi et al 2013 found a significant increase in tss and ta in the fruit juice of pomegranate cultivars exposed to water deficit during fruit growth and ripening and other studies reported that water deficiency had no significant effects on the sugar contents of pomegranate juice mellisho et al 2012 centofanti et al 2017 in the present study tss and ta varied among cultivars and stress severity with the main cause of such variation being not clear however some authors have indicated that a high tss could be caused by osmotic adjustments in the juice cells barry et al 2004 pérez pérez et al 2009 our results and studies cited above suggest that genetic differences and experimental conditions can be determinant factors for pomegranate juice traits under drought the taste of arils obtained from pomegranate cultivars is variable ranging from sweet to sour amir et al 2018 and glucose and fructose are the major sugars in the fruit juice with maltose and sucrose being found in lower amounts dafny yalin et al 2010 in the present study slight drought increased the concentrations of glucose and fructose in all three pomegranate cultivars fig 2c d supplementary materials table s4 many plant species accumulate soluble organic compounds such as sugars in order to maintain cellular turgor and decrease cell dehydration under limited water resources sethi and kaur 2016 abdelrahman et al 2021 however moderate and intense drought decreased the contents of glucose and fructose in all three investigated cultivars similarly schwartz et al 2009a 2009b and li et al 2015 reported that in different pomegranate cultivars glucose and fructose levels decreased in hot dry desert climate and increased in cooler temperatures implying that temperature and water stress play important roles in determining the sugar content of pomegranate juice bar ya akov et al 2019 likewise water deficiency at the flowering stage decreased glucose and sucrose levels in the juice of mollar de elche and wonderful pomegranate cultivars when compared to well watered conditions martinez nicolas et al 2019 in general the decreases in the concentrations of fructose and glucose under moderate and intense drought may affect the palatability and sweetness of the fruit juice 3 4 effects of drought stress on asc tac tpc ellagic acid and dpph under control conditions asc contents in the fruit juice ranged from 62 3 to 78 6 tac from 8 0 to 10 2 and tpc from 47 3 to 63 3 mg 100 g 1 fw in all three investigated cultivars supplementary materials table s5 likewise the concentration of ellagic acid ranged from 18 7 to 23 1 mg l 1 and dpph from 68 8 to 87 3 in the three cultivars supplementary materials table s5 the malase saveh cultivar showed the highest levels of asc tac tpc ellagic acid and dpph whereas mikhosh showed the lowest ones under control conditions progressive drought stress led to significant reductions in asc tac tpc and dpph levels in the three investigated cultivars when compared to control conditions with intense drought showing higher reductions when compared to slight and moderate drought supplementary materials table s5 however slight drought caused a significant increase in the contents of ellagic acid and tpc in all three cultivars when compared to control conditions fig 3a supplementary materials table s5 specifically intense drought decreased the contents of asc by 36 8 50 7 and 49 4 tac by 46 0 44 5 and 45 tpc by 27 0 28 6 and 41 4 and dpph by 32 6 31 3 and 28 9 in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh respectively when compared to control conditions the above results indicated that the concentrations of asc and tpc in malase saveh cultivar were least affected by intense drought when compared to rabab e neyriz and mikhosh whereas the intense drought induced reductions in tac and dpph were comparable in the three pomegranate cultivars slight drought increased the contents of ellagic acid by 6 0 10 6 and 10 6 respectively in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh relative to control conditions ascorbate is one of the well known non enzymatic antioxidants with significant potential for scavenging ros and modulating a number of fundamental functions in plants under stress and non stress conditions akram et al 2017 ahmed et al 2014 hossain et al 2019 sariyer and öztokat kuzucu 2019 an early study reported that the asc content is highly variable among different pomegranate cultivars and indian ones contained higher amounts of asc than those from oman and egypt opara et al 2009 in the present study the content of asc decreased in all pomegranate cultivars in response to drought but the reduction of asc in malase saveh cultivar was minimal when compared to other examined cultivars our results are in contrast with the early study by peña et al 2013 where water deficit increased the contents of asc in the mollar de elche cultivar as a protective strategy against drought injury pomegranate juice contains various types of anthocyanins including cyanidin delphinidin pelargonidin and their glucosides which play significant roles in fruit color formation and plant adaption to various environmental conditions galindo et al 2017 abdelrahman et al 2019 melgarejo sánchez et al 2021 in the present study tac decreased in the three pomegranate cultivars studied in response to drought this was consistent with the observed reduction in tac in the fruit juice of pomegranate cultivars grown in hot dry desert areas compared to cultivars grown under mediterranean conditions schwartz et al 2009a 2009b the decrease in tac in pomegranate juice has been attributed to the reduction in shoot and leaf growth due to the increase in temperature and sunlight schwartz et al 2009a 2009b martinez nicolas et al 2019 in contrast previous studies showed increases in tac in the pomegranate leaf skin and juice in response to drought stress laribi et al 2013 galindo et al 2017 similarly galindo et al 2017 reported that a very short period of water stress at the end of ripening period enhanced the contents of tac tpc and ellagic acid without affecting marketable yield and fruit size our results and above examples indicated that there is genetic variation regarding anthocyanin content under drought stress in pomegranate and this issue deserves further exploration pomegranate fruit juice contains high amounts of phenolics including gallic ellagic acids caffeic chlorogenic and p coumaric acids which act as powerful antioxidants and antimicrobials and also in stress signaling galindo et al 2017 the decrease in tpc found in this study in moderate and intense drought was consistent with the significant reduction in tpc in the fruit juice of mollar de elche cultivar in response to water deficient at fruit ripening stage galindo et al 2017 similarly the tpc in the fruit juice of sefri and wonderful cultivars was decreased in response to intense drought adiba et al 2021a the decrease in tpc has been attributed to the enzymatic oxidation of polyphenols under intense drought fawole et al 2013 the decrease in non enzymatic antioxidants including asc tac and tpc was associated with the reduction in dpph in response to drought likewise the ros scavenging activities in fruit juice using the dpph assay did not show significant changes in response to water stress at fruit ripening stage galindo et al 2017 studies carried out with juice of different pomegranate cultivars have reported differences related to the phenolic compound contribution to antioxidant capacity assays mena et al 2013 peña et al 2013 it is well known that water stress influences the content of secondary metabolites in plant tissues and contradictory results have been found in other crops for example chaves et al 2007 reported a substantial accumulation of anthocyanins in grape berries under water stress in contrast kennedy et al 2000 showed that osmotic stress had little or no effect on anthocyanin accumulation in grape berries these variations can be attributed to the genetic variations and differences in experimental conditions such as the phenological period at which stress takes place the severity and duration of stress level the incidence of partial recoveries and the genetic variability among cultivars 3 5 effects of drought stress on carboxylic acids under control conditions the concentrations of citric tartaric malic and oxalic acids in juice were in the ranges 1 09 2 05 0 29 0 47 0 29 0 61 and 0 72 1 33 g l 1 respectively fig 3b supplementary materials table s6 the malase saveh cultivar showed the highest citric tartaric malic and oxalic acid concentrations whereas mikhosh had the lowest contents under control conditions drought led to increases in the concentrations of all carboxylic acids in the three pomegranate cultivars studied and intense drought showed the highest accumulations of carboxylic acids compared to slight and moderate drought fig 3b supplementary materials table s6 specifically intense drought stress increased the contents of citric tartaric malic and oxalic acids by 40 0 21 8 and 31 1 65 9 34 3 and 75 8 50 8 46 5 and 62 0 and 26 3 30 6 and 34 7 in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh respectively when compared to control conditions although malase saveh showed the highest concentrations of carboxylic acids under both control and drought conditions mikhosh exhibited the highest relative increases with the exception of citric acid in response to drought stress carboxylic acids are crucial for plant adaption to various abiotic stresses as they maintain cellular functions by providing energy for different biological activities and precursors for various biosynthetic pathways farooq et al 2009 foti et al 2021 pre harvest application of oxalic acid improved pomegranate fruit quality and yield and increased the concentrations of malic acid ascorbic acid tac and total antioxidant activities garcía pastor et al 2020a likewise application of salicylic acid sa improved pomegranate fruit quality and storage life and this was attributed to a higher accumulation of sugars citric acid and tac in sa treated than in sa non treated plants garcía pastor et al 2020b in thirty tunisian pomegranate accessions the predominant carboxylate in fruit juice was malic acid followed by citric acid hasnaoui et al 2011 however in thirteen turkish pomegranate varieties citric acid was the predominant carboxylate in fruit juice followed by malic acid poyrazoğlu et al 2002 this suggests that genetic differences as well as growth conditions may affect the carboxylic acid levels in pomegranate juice in tomato the improvement in fruit quality under water deficit conditions was attributed to the increase in the synthesis of carboxylates and the concentrations of malate and citrate were highly affected by tomato cultivars and water stress severity nahar et al 2011 nahar and ullah 2018 iranian pomegranate cultivars and specifically malase saveh had high contents of carboxylic acids and this could be an adaptation mechanism against drought that could increase the sour taste of fruit juice and thereby increase the market value 3 6 effects of drought stress on phytohormone concentrations under control conditions leaf aba ranged from 152 8 to 201 5 ng g 1 fw and iaa from 81 3 to 96 4 ng g 1 fw in the three pomegranate cultivars fig 3c supplementary materials table s7 the malase saveh cultivar showed the highest aba and iaa values whereas mikhosh showed the lowest ones under control conditions under drought stress a concomitant increase in the levels of aba and iaa was observed in the three pomegranate cultivars studied and intense drought led to a higher increase in the levels of phytohormones compared to slight and moderate drought fig 3c table s7 specifically leaf aba and iaa showed 25 6 45 1 and 50 1 and 40 3 42 3 and 42 5 increases in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh in response to intense drought although the leaf levels of aba and iaa in the malase saveh cultivar were high under control and drought conditions when compared to the other two cultivars mikhosh had the higher percentage of increase in aba in response to intense drought iaa regulation varies with plant species growth stage and stress conditions such as duration and intensity krishnan and merewitz 2015 in pomegranate high contents of iaa in the later stage of flower development promotes the development of bisexual flowers whereas high level of aba in middle and later stages stimulates sterility of ovary and promotes stamen organ development resulting in functional male flowers zhao et al 2019 aba is involved in drought stress via signaling reactions to stomatal blockage and the regulation of stress protecting genes krishnan and merewitz 2015 in a recent study aba treatment enhanced drought tolerance in pomegranate and this was attributed to aba induced antioxidant enzyme activities allowing for a decrease in ros and better growth performance qian et al 2020 additionally exogenous aba treatment enhanced pomegranate drought tolerance by activating brassinosteroid synthesis photosynthesis peroxisome biogenesis and hemicellulose synthesis pathways qian et al 2020 likewise exogenous iaa application enhanced drought tolerance in white clover zhang et al 2020 and this was attributed to increase in aba and jasmonic acid levels modulation of genes involved in drought stress response and leaf senescence zhang et al 2020 in general changes in aba and iaa levels have been related to plant adaptation to drought stress abdelrahman et al 2018 in this study malase saveh cultivars maintained high levels of aba and iaa under control and drought when compared to rabab e neyriz and mikhosh and this might be associated with its better yield and physiological responses 3 7 effects of drought stress on oxidative stress parameters proline and antioxidant enzymes under control conditions the leaf concentrations of mda and h2o2 were in the ranges 8 3 10 1 and 0 83 1 13 nmol g 1 fw in the three investigated iranian pomegranate cultivars fig 3c supplementary materials table s7 although mda and h2o2 levels were comparable in all cultivars malase saveh had the highest mda and h2o2 values under control conditions drought increased the oxidative stress related parameters in all cultivars suggesting that drought stress induced ros accumulation and disrupted cell membrane stability fig 3c supplementary materials table s7 intense drought increased the mda and h2o2 levels more than slight and moderate drought specifically intense drought increased mda by 96 0 105 4 and 107 2 and h2o2 by 62 8 87 9 and 90 3 in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh respectively these results indicated that drought induced oxidative stress was lowest in the malase saveh cultivar compared to the other two cultivars increased levels of mda and h2o2 are commonly associated with lipid peroxidation in cell membranes and are often used to estimate the extent of oxidative stress induced damage in cellular membranes and tissues siddique et al 2012 laxa et al 2019 drought stress increased markedly oxidative stress parameters including h2o2 mda other aldehydes and el in american and iranian pistachio rootstocks and the most tolerant cultivars showed the lowest values for these parameters jamshidi goharrizi et al 2020a 2020b under control conditions proline concentrations ranged from 1 59 to 2 61 µg g 1 fw in the three pomegranate cultivars fig 3c supplementary materials table s7 the malase saveh cultivar had higher leaf levels of proline compared to rabab e neyriz and mikhosh the high proline levels in malase saveh cultivar under control conditions might constitute a pre stress adaption mechanism which could be useful for rapid response to drought stress intense drought increased the levels of proline by 12 6 60 6 and 56 6 in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh cultivars respectively fig 3c supplementary materials table s7 likewise variable increases in proline levels was observed in several iranian pomegranates in response to drought depending on the plant cultivar and the severity of drought stress tatari et al 2020 a drought induced proline accumulation was previously reported in pomegranate cultivars khattab et al 2011 however our results showed more profound increases in proline levels than those previously reported suggesting that proline accumulation in pomegranate is associated with genetic variability the improvement of the cell osmotic potential through the accumulation of osmo protectants such as proline which helps to maintain cell water potential is one of the most important factors in drought tolerance in pomegranate rodríguez et al 2012 although intense drought led to higher increases in proline levels in rabab e neyriz and mikhosh when compared to control conditions the malase saveh cultivar maintained high levels or proline under both normal and stress conditions and this could contribute to the better yield under drought stress compared to rabab e neyriz and mikhosh cultivars under control conditions the cat activity ranged from 3 3 to 4 6 δ240 min 1 prot 1 sod from 3 8 to 4 7 u mg prot 1 pod from 15 5 to 17 8 u mg prot 1 and apx from 2 6 to 3 7 δ240 min 1 prot 1 in the three pomegranate cultivars fig 3d supplementary materials table s8 the malase saveh cultivar showed the highest antioxidant enzyme activities under control conditions drought stress increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes compared to control conditions with intense drought causing higher enzymatic activities in all pomegranate cultivars compared to slight and moderate drought fig 3d table s8 in addition antioxidant enzyme activities were higher in the malase saveh cultivar compared to the other two cultivars under intense drought specifically intense drought stress increased the activities of cat by 71 1 100 and 127 7 sod by 113 9 100 2 and 123 3 pod by 60 1 61 1 and 55 7 and apx by 94 0 151 4 and 162 5 in malase saveh rabab e neyriz and mikhosh respectively our results are consistent with the observed increase in cat sod and pod activities in several iranian pomegranates under drought stress conditions pourghayoumi et al 2017b the drought stress tolerance of different pomegranate cultivars has been attributed to increases in the contents of proline and the activities of sod and pod tatari et al 2020 plants develop high performance enzymatic and non enzymatic defense systems that can limit or neutralize the overproduction of ros subsequently maintaining cellular function under stress conditions blokhina et al 2003 abdelrahman et al 2015 2020 the high basal levels of antioxidant enzymes in the malase saveh cultivar are consistent with the minimal increases in mda and h2o2 in response to drought when compared to rabab e neyriz and mikhosh pourghayoumi et al 2017b reported a non significant increase in mda in drought tolerant pomegranate cultivars compared to drought sensitive cultivars when grown under control conditions in the same study upon exposure to severe drought stress the activities of antioxidant enzymes increased and the level of mda decreased in drought tolerant pomegranate cultivars compared to drought sensitive ones pourghayoumi et al 2017b the slight increase in oxidative stress parameters in the malase saveh cultivar under control conditions might constitute a pre stress adaptation mechanism for activation of antioxidant enzymes which can enable plants to grow under unfavorable conditions 3 8 principal component analysis correlation between parameters and dendrogram clustering the pca was carried out using data for slight moderate and severe drought stresses in all investigated traits in the three iranian pomegranate cultivars fig 4 pca biplots for the three drought stress regimes showed two distinct groups under slight moderate and intense drought the pca biplot had pc1 and pc2 explaining 86 17 and 13 83 89 41 and 10 54 and 91 71 and 8 30 of the total variance respectively fig 4a b and c respectively in all three pca biplots the malase saveh cultivar was separated in one group whereas rabab e neyriz and mikhosh were separated in a second group fig 4a c the pca results confirmed that drought stress exhibited major changes in the phenotype physiological and biochemical traits of the malase saveh cultivar when compared to the other two iranian cultivars among the investigated traits changes in fruit cracking were mainly associated with the rabab e neyriz and mikhosh cultivars on the other hand changes in the photosynthetic pigments and antioxidant enzyme levels were associated with the malase saveh cultivar fig 4a c all the pca statistics are shown in supplementary materials table s9 a correlation heatmap showed that the yield parameters number of fruits per tree fruit weight and yield were positively correlated with photosynthetic pigments chl and cars and some biochemical parameters tss ta glucose fructose asc tac tpc ellagic acid dpph and carboxylates fig 5a in contrast fruit cracking exhibited negative correlations with yield related parameters number of fruits per tree fruit weight and yield photosynthetic pigments chl and cars and some biochemical parameters tss ta glucose fructose asc tac tpc ellagic acid dpph and carboxylates on the on the other hand fruit cracking showed positive correlation with oxidative stress parameters mda and h2o2 phytohormones aba and iaa and enzymatic activities cat pod sod and apx in addition we observed negative correlations between yield related parameters and antioxidant enzymes fig 5a although the antioxidant enzymes are important factors for plant survival under stress conditions an increase in antioxidant enzymes may not always result in yield increases a dendrogram cluster analysis was carried out using all variables and three clades were observed fig 5b clade i include rabab e neyriz grown under normal irrigation and malase saveh grown under normal irrigation and slight drought clade ii include malase saveh grown under moderate and intense drought rabab e neyriz grown under slight and moderate drought and mikhosh grown in control conditions and slight drought clade iii include mikhosh grown under moderate and intense drought and rabab e neyriz grown under intense drought the similar responses of malase saveh under control conditions and slight drought suggest that malase saveh is somewhat able to tolerate drought and can therefore be cultivated under relatively low irrigation conditions 4 conclusion pomegranate is a drought tolerant species and its cultivation is favored even in semi arid climate with different varieties having different adaptation potentials intense drought led to profound changes in the yield biochemical and physiological parameters when compared to slight and moderate drought intense drought led to significant decreases in fruit number per tree fruit weight and photosynthetic pigments which collectively resulted in considerable reductions in yield compared to control conditions in contrast fruit cracking was significantly increased in response to drought thus affecting the fruit market value in this study we found that the malase saveh cultivar was more tolerant against drought stress compared to rabab e neyriz and mikhosh cultivars given the better yield biochemical and physiological responses in this cultivar the malase saveh cultivars exhibited higher contents of photosynthetic pigments asc tac tpc carboxylic acids proline and phytohormones as well as antioxidant enzyme activities compared to rabab e neyriz and mikhosh in response to drought stress the observed differences in the physiological and biochemical responses of iranian cultivars against drought stress indicate that genetic differences could be responsible for the differences in drought tolerance the malase saveh cultivar can be used as a drought tolerant candidate for breeding programs and molecular biology studies aimed to improve yield

9739,sistan is a drought affected region in the southeast of iran dependent on the variable surface water inflow from the helmand river basin in afghanistan the river flow has recently experienced sharp annual fluctuations in afghanistan resulting in a collapse of the agriculture and ecosystem in sistan therefore the authorities have recently decided to rely on non renewable groundwater fossil water aquifers resources to support the current developments in sistan the current study aims to assess the adequacy of fossil water aquifers to back the water demand in scarcity a system dynamics model for the sistan water resources system swrs is developed to analyze the complicated water management system in the basin which considers major hydrological socioeconomic agricultural and specifically environmental aspects the results show that the water resources in sistan are incredibly unreliable and vulnerable due to their dependence on the surface water inflow from afghanistan fossil aquifer withdrawal can address the current water problems in sistan however fossil water over withdrawal without considering the critical level of aquifers can eventually lead the project to fail unmanaged use of fossil aquifers in sistan has the characteristics of a limits to growth archetype system with negative and dangerous effects in the long run in the environmental subsystem meeting the minimum environmental demand is demonstrated as the effective way to stabilize the soil of the lake and considerably reduce dusty days further fossil aquifer exploitation and demand management by increasing irrigation efficiency and reducing wastage of reservoirs have a great impact on the sustainability of the agricultural sector keywords system dynamics environmental subsystem

in arid regions especially in transboundary river basins renewable water resources scarcity is known as a serious threat to sustainable socioeconomic growth and environmental protection the long standing conflicts among transboundary river basins residents prompt policy makers to shift cooperative measures to quick fix solutions such as marginal and non renewable water withdrawal hirmand international river basin helmand located in iran and afghanistan can be one example of such conflicts the downstream of this river basin located in iran faces harsh weather conditions and severe water shortage mainly caused by activities upstream of the basin afghanistan the development of water infrastructure to increase water withdrawal has become a driving force downstream and a source of political conflict thus the boundary between the two countries has led to hydro political issues complicating the management of the basin and intensifying the conflict numerous studies have been done in the basin with emphasizing the integrated water resources management downstream beek and meijer 2006 hydrology burger 2005 the geography of the transboundary basins ebrahimzadeh 2005 hydro political issues m shahbazbegian et al 2016 m r shahbazbegian et al 2016 ettehad 2010 as well as environmental impacts and water scarcity growth sharifikia 2013 these studies have addressed the impact of growing water scarcity downstream helmand and have proposed adaptation strategies so far being ineffective due to the lack of sustainable water inflow to overcome this problem iran has recently decided to operate the non renewable water resources in this river basin the exploitation of resources such as fossil groundwater aquifers is considered temporary to maintain food production and protect rural employment especially in the agricultural sector llamas and custodio 2003 unesco 2003 ward 1998 however fossil groundwater withdrawal is associated with different hydrologic socioeconomic and environmental side effects in the long run the current hydro economic modeling frameworks including groundwater simulation afshar et al 2020 steward et al 2009 and optimizations gisser and sánchez 1980 burnett et al 2020 cannot be able to capture the long term consequences of access to non renewable water resources due to these complexities an informed and scientifically defendable basis is delivered by modeling and dynamically simulating the change in water resources for proactive management policies as well as improving the system s adaptive capacity as a whole madani and mariño 2009 mirchi et al 2012 simonović 2009 winz et al 2009 by raising and interrogating hypotheses these approaches offer flexible tools to examine implications and inconsistencies winz and brierley 2007 providing more sustainable water resources management system dynamics sd modeling is an appropriate framework to implement the integrated frameworks for the performance assessment of water resources systems sd models are credible tools to capture the dynamic interactions within water resources systems simonović 2009 the increasing use of sd in the planning and management of water resources in recent decades is due to its known capabilities sd models have been widely applied in groundwater modeling bates et al 2019 balali and viaggi 2015 mokhtar and aram 2017 surface water

this model the adequacy of fossil groundwater exploitation within the transboundary hirmand international river basin is also investigated as the new source of water supply the developed sd model advances previous applications gohari et al 2013 mehrazar et al 2020 by considering the environmental implications of water resources system management however although the effect of ecosystem protection on socioeconomic development is considered little attention is paid to the sequence of occurrences of disturbing phenomena on the welfare of residents the paper is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 introduce the study area and sd overview the model development and its application are discussed in sections 4 and 5 sections 6 and 7 contain the policy scenario s implications and conclusions 2 case study the transboundary hirmand river basin called helmand in afghanistan stretches across afghanistan mountainous and iranian plateau with an average elevation of 490 4200 m fig 1 shows that more than 95 of the basin is located in afghanistan thomas 2016 the basin is nourished by helmand river with a length of 1000 km starting from the highland of afghanistan upstream and finally ending to hamoun lake as a valuable ecological wetland located in sistan iran najafi and vatanfada 2011 sharifikia 2013 sistan area with a population of 400000 people is stretched in a hot and dry region facing water hydrological agricultural environmental and socioeconomic challenges table 1 summarizes some characteristics of them in sistan according to a transboundary water sharing agreement in 1973 afghanistan is committed to supply the iranian part with a minimum annual inflow of 810 million cubic meters mcm during the normal and wet years farrokhzadeh et al 2020 during the recent decades the rapid agricultural development raising the kajakai dam height as well as construction of the kamal khan dam in afghanistan has significantly reduced the helmand river inflow in sistan currently some doubts have been raised that the annual water supply in iran may decrease around 55 due to severe drought beek and meijer 2006 leading to more intensified water related problems downstream the basin sistan this region experiences severe water shortage which is expected to be intensified by future socioeconomic development iranian policy makers have recently decided to withdraw fossil groundwater to support socioeconomic demand growth by increasing the water supply of the region table 2 presents the general properties of this project 3 system dynamics modeling sd models are powerful tools for capturing complicated systems structures and tracking their dynamic behaviors forrester 1961 sterman 2000 the sd model helps to observe the water resources as a system with the dynamic interaction between the elements within simonović 2009 therefore sd is a compatible framework to grab knotty orientations of water resources and their original reasons within a holistic framework the main steps of developing sd models include gohari et al 2013 1 defining the problem and specifying system boundary 2 developing the conceptual model for the system or causal loop diagram cld 3 developing a stock and flow diagram sfd to formulate model 4 evaluating model performance these steps are pursued iteratively to promote model transparency homer 1996 3 1 problem description and system boundary the first and paramount step for a successful sd modeling is problem definition and project focus to determine the system s structure overlooking the problem definition and model scope in sd modeling leads to its downfall in the end eskinasi and fokkema 2006 despite earlier discussed challenges existing within the study area the helmand river is the single water provider in sistan which the fate of this unreliable source based on the existing or emerging disputes between iran and afghanistan can make it more difficult for iranian authorities how future socioeconomic development should be handled in order to improve the condition of the area this study aims to investigate how sd can address the use of fossil groundwater resources to alleviate water related problems in sistan in this regard assessing the main drivers and evaluating their impacts on systems are both crucial fig 2 shows the process of identifying existing problems understanding the interaction of water resources management components assessing impacts selecting strategies and analyzing the effectiveness of chosen strategies 3 2 causal loop diagram of the swrs the system s structure will be completed in the second step using causal loop diagrams clds showing how different elements in a system are interrelated this diagram is a set of nodes and edges the variables are represented by nodes and the edges arrows are the connections that indicate a bond or a relationship between the two variables these relationships can be positive or negative a positive negative polarity relationship indicates that a change in one variable others being equal causes changes in the same opposite direction in the other variable the mixture of polarity causal relationships forms feedback loops feedback loops can act as reinforcing or positive and balancing or negative feedback loops the system s structure and the polarities of variables in a particular loop indicate the behavior of that loop the unique qualitative model causal loop diagrams improves our conceptual system understanding and can expose feedback loops inherent in the system neuwirth et al 2015 sterman 2000 here four subsystems are identified for the cld of the swrs including hydrological agricultural socioeconomic and environmental subsystems 3 2 1 hydrological subsystem according to fig 3 the hydrological subsystem captures the main climate and hydrologic components including temperature precipitation evaporation reservoirs and water inflow in the basin it is worth noting that chahnimeh reservoirs receive surface water inflow from the sistan river the water stored in these reservoirs is allocated to industrial agricultural domestic and ecosystem hamoun lake sectors the priorities for water supply in the region are domestic industrial agricultural and environmental respectively hamoun lake is considered as the terminal physical boundary of the system with its natural inflow 3 2 2 socioeconomic subsystem cld of the socioeconomic subsystem is presented in fig 3 the socioeconomic attitudes affect the water resources planning and management in this area the residents utility is defined as the key driver for socioeconomic development these factors include per capita water use the added value from different water uses trade level with neighboring countries and environmental water inflows residents utility largely depends on the economic related issues and the numerous values provided by hamoun lake there are positive dynamic relationships between residents utility and regional economic development rate and income due to different economic productivity in different water sectors the added value is defined as the summation of economic productivity for industrial domestic and agricultural users trade with afghanistan is an economic factor that affects the residents utility in sistan trade with afghanistan in the borders as compared to agriculture activities increase the development leading to more income and facilitates without raising water use in the area 3 2 3 agricultural subsystem while agriculture accounts for more than 90 of water consumption in sistan agricultural production accounts for about 1 of iran s national agricultural production due to low irrigation efficiency beek and meijer 2006 according to diverse irrigated crops in the basin five different classes of crops including wheat barley cereals fodder melons and grape vegetables garden products mechanized corps are considered in the agricultural subsystem as a non limiting example the cld of the agricultural subsystem for two classes of crops is presented in fig 3 the water demand is estimated by considering the envisaged land area and irrigation water demand for each crop the total required agricultural water demand is a factor that determines the net irrigation water demand irrigation efficiency describes how water is delivered to crops and indicates the amount of water during water distribution and irrigation systems sharma et al 2015 agricultural products are also important in the local market they provide fresh various and affordable types of food for the whole population of sistan and its neighbors these earnings are simulated to figure out the net economic benefit of the crops separately the production of any crop has a positive relationship with the actual land area allocated to that crop the framework is established based upon two financial parameters cost the cost that must be paid such as seeds fertilizer labor and pesticide and benefit the economic value earning from sold products in markets comparison of these two terms is used to simulate the reaction of the farmers in order to maximize incomes and minimize domestic water resources consumption following the above considerations the land area for each crop represents the farmers behavior at the farm level considering its net economic benefit in the previous year the total amount of land supply is constant and crops with increasing returns attract more land in this study the structures and operations of each crop in the local market are guided to be independent of the variability of supply and demand for other products or services 3 2 4 environmental subsystem the wind has a destructive force and wind erosion causes unfavorable conditions in environmental elements especially in the soil the wind erosion process consists of three stages of taking transporting and depositing the separated particles are picked up by the wind and transported in different ways in the last stage of the wind erosion process wind loaded materials are left according to the reduction of wind speed and the emergence of barriers the hirmand zone is the arena of all three stages of wind erosion the main components required to estimate changes in erosion water volume and air quality include a vegetation b water balance c wind erosion and d dust concentration in the air and number of dusty days the related feedback loops are shown in fig 3 the annual vegetation is regulated based on the data of the area as the plants are regrown and faded temperature and humidity are two important factors for vegetation growth a linear relationship between soil water moisture and vegetation growth was used to regulate plant growth the main purpose of the water balance component is to estimate the volume of water in the lake precipitation as the main cause of water inflow is stored as surface water and then penetrates the soil once the water reaches the surface water storage site it is transported into the ground through infiltration unless the soil is saturated i e the limitation of soil pore volume porosity infiltration is calculated using the absorption of surface water in the lake until the water in the soil reaches its total capacity outflows in water balance include surface water losses evaporation and evapotranspiration vegetation evapotranspiration et is used as soil water output the water requirement for dust stabilization is equal to the amount of evaporation from the soil surface and the amount of water for soil saturation the amount of annual evaporation from the soil surface was calculated according to the research of aydin et al 2005 when dust enters the wind it is suspended in the air or settled on the ground the amount of available suspended solids changes with wind speed and direction and is calculated using the lake dry bed and soil erosion relationships of the area eroded soil enters the wind system under the influence of strong winds and dust is suspended in the air the number of dusty days is predicted based on the number of strong winds and eroded soil 3 3 stock and flow diagram of the swrs based on the developed cld the stock flow diagrams sfd of the swrs are developed to characterize the system processes and capture the stock and flow structure of the system typically stock variables are the aggregation that determines the state of the system and generates information based on which decisions and actions are made due to the flow variables of incoming and outgoing stock variables change madani and mariño 2009 the sfd of the hydrological socioeconomic and environment subsystems are presented in fig 4 4 system dynamic model calibration this step includes the qualitative and quantitative performance assessment of the developed sd model the structural and behavioral aspects of the model are tested to ensure the accuracy of the interrelationships among elements of the subsystems according to the observation and logical extractions the behavior reproduction test is applied here to test the developed model 4 1 behavior reproduction test in order to examine the accuracy of the developed model to reproduce the behavior of the real system here the behavior reproduction test is applied for the period of 2000 2015 in this behavior verification test several statistical metrics eqs 1 4 including root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae r2 and kolmogorov smirnov k s were used to evaluate the results of key relationships in the simulated model with observed historical data 1 rsme 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2

developed models and also o i and p i are the average of corresponding data during n events in addition e pi and e oi are the empirical distribution functions for pi and oi parameters fig 5 and table 3 show the comparison between the simulated and observed values for population chahnimeh reservoirs sistan river flow dust storm days and agricultural land area for cereals and grape production over the calibration period as seen in this behavior reproduction test comparing the values of observational variables simulated by the model indicates the model ability to properly reproduce the desired parameters of the system in terms of behavior 4 2 water resources performance indices in this study the efficiency of water management policies is evaluated by a number of performance indices including the reliability index rel vulnerability index vul resiliency index res sustainability index si and maximum deficit index max def the re index indicates the ability of the system for supplying sufficient water in the long term quantified by eq 5 hashimoto et al 1982 klemeš et al 1981 for different water users 5 rel number of years with d 0 n where d represents the water deficit and n represents either the simulation period length of the number of years mcmahon et al 2006 the vul index is determined as the anticipated value of deficits or yearly average deficit divided by yearly average demand over deficit time eq 6 describing the average failure probability of the water resources in meeting the water demand sandoval solis et al 2011 6 vul i 1 n number of years withd 0

with d t 0 the sustainability index eq 8 as a combination of performance measures is defined as sandoval solis et al 2011 8 si rel res 1 vul 1 3 dividing the maximum annual deficit by the annual water demand the max def index eq 9 is achieved gohari et al 2017 9 max def max d annual water demand 5 results after demonstrating the model robustness and preparation for the application various strategies and policies can be analyzed using swrs a detailed analysis is carried out to assess future suitable water management policies policy analysis is a stepwise systematic process to evaluate the long term performance of a complicated system after understanding strategies levers and responses the behavior sensitivity test identification or construction of alternative policies is the first step in this analysis here according to the results of the identified strategies in the sensitivity analysis the types of policies vary between the agricultural water and water management policies deciding which policy scenario stands out depends on the set of qualitative and quantitative criteria obtained in relation to a comparison point table 4 presents an overview of the selected policy scenarios the presented eight policy scenarios differ in terms of the assumptions made about 1 agricultural water use efficiency 2 the evaporation from chahnimeh reservoirs 3 possible changes in the surface water inflow from afghanistan to iran 4 extraction of the non renewable groundwater fossil aquifer and 5 cropping pattern fig 6 shows the behavior of selected variables in the simulated period for defined policies by various assumptions the behavioral analysis of the major variables for all different simulated policies is elaborated as follows it is worth noting that the simulation results provided by the business as usual policy scenario b a u is the control policy scenario for comparison under this reference policy scenario the population and domestic water demand decrease and drastic agricultural and environmental water deficiencies are anticipated all over the simulation period water shortage and water demand depend on surface water inflow fluctuations in this circumstance around 38 dusty days per year are expected in the region furthermore the results also show that hamoun lake receives no water throughout the simulation period as seen in fig 6 under only two policy scenarios of 3 and 6 the population and residents utility can increase while in other management policies population migration from the region even tends to increase the most important reason for the improvement of conditions under these two policy scenarios is the fossil water withdrawal and consequently the reduction of water shortage in the region needless to say that policy scenario 6 is much more realistic than that of 3 in which there are no restrictions on the use of fossil water policy scenario 7 has the lowest population growth rate due to blocking the sistan river flow in policy scenario 3 agricultural water demand increases due to fossil water withdrawal therefore agricultural water consumption reaches its highest possible level annual aquifers exploitation is between 1500 and 3000 mcm depending on the water inflow of the sistan river as a result of demand management it is reduced to 250 and 1600 mcm in policy scenario 4 which can be very important in the aquifer management approach in the agriculture water demand in policy scenarios 4 and 5 the agriculture sector would experience a water shortage also there have been agricultural water shortages in some years in policy scenario 6 on the one hand the results also show that demand management strategies such as policy scenarios 6 and 2 without fossil waters withdrawal cannot significantly improve the future of the region on the other hand it should be noted that the available water resource cannot be a reliable resource under the occurrence of severe drought or even with no water demand management action especially agricultural demand management in the region in policies1 and 2 water inflow to hamoun lake improves only slightly and the average of dusty days is reduced 5 and 7 days in a year in comparison with b a u respectively in policy scenarios 3 4 and 5 hamoun lake receives no sufficient water and the average of dusty days reduces to 24 29 and 29 days per year respectively the minimum required flow is allocated to hamoun lake in order to stabilize the dust in policy scenario 6 and the average of dusty days is reduced to 19 days per year a comparison of the dust storm days under the selected policy scenarios shows that meeting the minimum environmental demand can reduce the dust storm days up to 50 affecting the resident s utility of sistan the results of policy scenario 6 show that the vegetation cover extension is an effective solution in stabilizing the soil of hamoun lake and reducing the dry area in this region therefore increasing the water inflow to the lake and the vegetation cover can significantly reduce dusty days based on the obtained results the two policy scenarios of 7 as the most pessimistic future condition and 6 as the most optimistic future condition are significantly important in planning to deal with the water shortage during the coming three decades in the area policy scenario 3 is continued for the three time sequences of pre exploitation exploitation mode and post failure cessation of exploitation as shown in fig 7 the results show that the population and agricultural water demand have been increased in the exploitation mode this water resource has met the demands and there is no shortage in the region but in the post failure period agricultural water demand will remain high water shortage has increased to a greater extent than in the pre operation period which is due to the socioeconomic development in this region accordingly the population which can be known as a sign of the region s development reached its peak and then declined obviously by managing the exploitation from these resources we can give the opportunity of recovering these aquifers and delaying or even preventing the arrival of the breaking point generally the results show that if appropriate management policies are not conducted and usage of fossil water does not happen in the region the problems will not be solved therefore extraction from fossil aquifers policy scenario 3 can make it possible to increase the water supply thus decreasing its shortage however an increase in water supply from fossil aquifers leads to an increase in demand in addition the reduction of water loss by increased agricultural irrigation efficiency and evaporation is the other most efficient policy in the area therefore it is necessary to manage water extraction from fossil aquifers and water loss in the long term policy scenario 7 shows the sistan region s severe drought conditions the water storage of chahnimeh reservoirs is sufficient to satisfy domestic water demand temporarily just for the first 2 5 years of the drought period allocating no water to agricultural and environmental sectors makes the living conditions difficult in the villages leading to a dramatic decline in the residents utility in this situation the average dusty days will be increased to 15 days per year table 5 presents the performance indices of different water sectors under different management policy scenarios in the b a u policy scenario vulnerability and reliability indices show that the region has faced severe agricultural and environmental water shortages during the simulation period in this table the green highlighted cells represent the best possible value and the red ones represent the worst possible result of the policy scenarios for each performance criteria based on this table policy scenario 6 is the best in terms of the agricultural aspect also policy scenarios 3 and 4 are the most preferred solutions in other words in the agricultural sector the rel and res indices in the policy scenarios 3 and 4 are equal to 1 also their vul and max def indices are lower than other policy scenarios improved slightly than b a u therefore si for the agricultural sector shows the sustainable conditions in the exploitation of fossil aquifers and demand management of the agricultural sector if fossil water is not extracted agricultural demand management modifying the cultivation pattern and reducing water loss policy scenarios 1 and 2 have suitable impacts in these policy scenarios the agricultural vul index shows that the agricultural water shortage and water stress compared to b a u have decreased over time in terms of the environmental sector in all policy scenarios the rel and res s indices are close to 0 and only under policy scenario 6 which supplies the minimum environmental flow the values of these indices have the highest possible amount equal to 1 in these circumstances the vul and consequently the si indices would have the ideal amount due to the allocation of water from specific reservoirs triple chahnimeh reservoirs to drinking water supply rel and res indices are high and have the lowest values of vul and max def producing the maximum si generally different si indices express important points to achieve the sustainability of water resources in the region 1 the exploitation of fossil aquifers and demand management by increasing irrigation efficiency and reducing water loss from reservoirs have a great impact on the sustainability of the agricultural sector and thus the farmers economy 2 sustainable water resources can be achieved in two ways i to be extracted without restrictions and ii the fossil water extraction management being conceivable only in the case of complementary designs 3 meeting the minimum environmental demand is the best way to promote public health and rehabilitation parts of hamoun 6 discussion in this study the developed model facilitates valuable insights into sistan s problems and system s long run behaviors as opposed to quantitative snapshots of the system behavior making them practical tools for participatory modeling policy screening and high level adaptive managing mirchi 2013 the main driver behind the current water shortage in sistan is unreliable water supply which leads to hampered economic development threatened ecosystems and worsened human health the results show disastrous depletion of the surface water inflow by the mid next century if the current development trends are held on the upstream basin in the future even if the conditions are considered to be fixed in the upstream basin the real issue for the decision makers in sistan will be remained unresolved how different water demands agricultural or domestic would be met while the water inflow from afghanistan will not be sufficient in this condition the use of fossil water can be used as an alternative for better management of the region from a managerial perspective extracting water from fossil aquifers for water supply demand in sistan has the features of the limits to growth archetype fig 8 according to this archetype the initial successful continuous growth loses its effectiveness and balancing feedback loops take over and slow down the system s behavior over time by limiting factors typically the limiting factor is an internal or external variable of a system that opposes significant changes and limits or stops the changes in the system fig 8 for example extracting from the aquifers can lead to initial successful accelerating socioeconomic growth however their excessive use can finally impose several negative impacts such as declined water tables increased extracting costs worsened water quality and conflict among water users therefore it can fully be considered as the limit of that system fig 9 this archetype explains that intense short term effort that leads to short term success can be just as dangerous in the long run as being unsuccessful or with no effort building the future by identifying growth engines and potential hazards and aligning with long term prospects will make it possible to be prepared in advance for adverse conditions and eliminate them before they become a threat from a practical perspective using fossil water can increase the hopes for reconstruction and certainty of the water supply in sistan however extracting excessive amounts of fossil water can lead it to a critical level increasing the extraction cost that reduces the demand for fossil water balancing loop as shown in fig 9 water demand growth can continue successful growth until fossil water extraction becomes uneconomical or impossible limiting factors which in turn reduces growth slow down growth in an extreme case if the growth engine bourns out and the non renewable aquifer becomes completely exhausted the engine of the economy may suddenly stop and fail if one does not plan for limits plans for failure a combination of remedies outlined for sistan should be planned to strengthen the water resources management system the results inferred from the model for various water resource programs and policy scenarios show that sistan s current problems cannot be solved merely by hydraulic reformations or chahnimeh reservoirs development water supply oriented the obtained results are in line with previous works for example farrokhzad et al 2020 showed that urgent improvement of current policies in this region is necessary otherwise the condition of agriculture and the environment could get worse to deal with this situation he suggested various policies such as reducing evaporation from reservoirs increasing irrigation efficiency using shortage optimization controlling population and preventing the cultivation of all the arable land in order to improve the socioeconomic and environmental situation of the region apart from the conservation policies shahbazbegian and bagheri 2016 shahbazbegian and bagheri 2016 show that even with an average annual flow of 2000 mcm in the helmand river hamon lake could not survive from drying they also noted that the economic dependence of the region on the agricultural sector the largest consumer of water and the low productivity of this sector will force iranian decision makers to negotiate with afghanistan shahbazbegian and bagheri 2016 shahbazbegian and bagheri 2016 thus as previously stated by beek et al 2008 water planners in iran should change their last decades main policies and look for better remedies accepting the choice of a political one however several investment projects and the development of water infrastructure upstream the helmand basin show afghanistan s seriousness in controlling hirmand river flow as an effective political lever on iran the limitation in access to reliable information is one of the main obstacles in the study of transboundary basins access to downstream fossil water aquifers in iran could put afghanistan in a new hydro political position and will affect the conflict between the two countries this point is accepted in the present study as a limitation afghanistan can exert this conflict through greater control over surface water resources which affects the socioeconomic conditions of both countries in order to alleviate this challenge the results of this study show that a combination of water demand management evaporation losses and fossil water extraction can be efficient those remedies may lead to 1 sustainable access to water resources beyond the demands for long term 2 sustainable fossil aquifer with groundwater extractions less than or equal to fossil aquifer s critical level 3 protection of environmental resources and wetlands e g hamoun lake and reducing its consequences in the area 4 protecting the area from drought concerns without worrying about different water seeking sectors and contentions with neighboring cities over transferred water resources 5 decreasing sandstorms and cooling the air in the wetlands with more water thus benefitting from the natural region for recreation and festivities from what has been done it can be concluded that although the use of supply oriented policies for improving the condition of the region is necessary but not solely sufficient these solutions must be accompanied by demand management approaches in other words effective implementation of demand management solutions is a basic prerequisite for ensuring the success of supply driven solutions in addition due to lower costs iran s decision makers should pursue water diplomacy much more seriously than providing new water alternative resources 7 conclusions in the water resources systems the high number of complicated subsystems either dependent on each other or independent has made the process of decision making more difficult achieving comprehensive knowledge of the problems and the mechanism of feedback is important in order to predict the long term behavior of the system appropriately the dynamics of the systems is an appropriate method for integrated management of the water resources and the region in the future sd provides a method based on flexibility and realistic orientation identifying and taking care of the intrinsic uncertainties in the management of the water resources making use of fossil aquifers to solve the concurrent water stress in the sistan area follows the archetypal features of the limits to growth system the supply oriented management plan through the fossil water withdrawal serves as a reliable source until the withdrawal reaches a critical level what has caused the fossil water resources to reach their critical supply capacity as a source of water supply for the sistan desert system is the problem of uncontrolled extraction and inefficient irrigation methods immediately after the start of the fossil aquifer extraction too much water is pumped at once the problem will become more challenging if the long time outcomes and environmental damages are taken into account water resources and agricultural managers in sistan are urged to focus on the improvement of the agricultural water efficiency and reducing the evaporation of water reservoirs to ensure that the highest reliability and the lowest vulnerability within the system are achieved interpretation of the simulation results of this study shows that fossil aquifers alone cannot solve the problem of water scarcity in the area therefore it should be noted that to manage the assessed imbalance the existing uncertainty can be controlled by increasing the amount of supply but reducing the amount of demand is also necessary the proposed approach can be further strengthened and extended from several aspects since there is an urgent need to move from supply oriented passive management in the region towards the policies of demand oriented management so that water shortage cannot be felt so much increasing people s awareness about water shortage should be one of the integral and permanent parts of managing water resources in planning demand management in the region so that the region must get closer to the balancing point between supply and demand although reforming the cultivation pattern of the crops and improvement of water optimization is one of the most important effective policies in irrigation water consumption it is not a permanent solution nevertheless the appropriateness of this policy in increasing the system reliability and decreasing its vulnerability compared to the present systems must be further investigated investigating the conflict despite many uncertainties and lack of access to reliable information in the basin can be considered in future research declaration of competing interest the

9739,sistan is a drought affected region in the southeast of iran dependent on the variable surface water inflow from the helmand river basin in afghanistan the river flow has recently experienced sharp annual fluctuations in afghanistan resulting in a collapse of the agriculture and ecosystem in sistan therefore the authorities have recently decided to rely on non renewable groundwater fossil water aquifers resources to support the current developments in sistan the current study aims to assess the adequacy of fossil water aquifers to back the water demand in scarcity a system dynamics model for the sistan water resources system swrs is developed to analyze the complicated water management system in the basin which considers major hydrological socioeconomic agricultural and specifically environmental aspects the results show that the water resources in sistan are incredibly unreliable and vulnerable due to their dependence on the surface water inflow from afghanistan fossil aquifer withdrawal can address the current water problems in sistan however fossil water over withdrawal without considering the critical level of aquifers can eventually lead the project to fail unmanaged use of fossil aquifers in sistan has the characteristics of a limits to growth archetype system with negative and dangerous effects in the long run in the environmental subsystem meeting the minimum environmental demand is demonstrated as the effective way to stabilize the soil of the lake and considerably reduce dusty days further fossil aquifer exploitation and demand management by increasing irrigation efficiency and reducing wastage of reservoirs have a great impact on the sustainability of the agricultural sector keywords system dynamics environmental subsystem fossil aquifer sistan sustainability 1 introduction globally limited access to freshwater resources and increasing water demand underline the importance of marginal water resources worldwide winz and brierley 2007 fossil water is known as one of the most important marginal water resources this water is trapped in isolated geologic formations called the fossil aquifers that are usually separated from ecosystems abu zeid and elrawady 2009 groundwater withdrawal from fossil aquifers is recognized as a common practice to meet the growing water demand in water scarce regions including america

in arid regions especially in transboundary river basins renewable water resources scarcity is known as a serious threat to sustainable socioeconomic growth and environmental protection the long standing conflicts among transboundary river basins residents prompt policy makers to shift cooperative measures to quick fix solutions such as marginal and non renewable water withdrawal hirmand international river basin helmand located in iran and afghanistan can be one example of such conflicts the downstream of this river basin located in iran faces harsh weather conditions and severe water shortage mainly caused by activities upstream of the basin afghanistan the development of water infrastructure to increase water withdrawal has become a driving force downstream and a source of political conflict thus the boundary between the two countries has led to hydro political issues complicating the management of the basin and intensifying the conflict numerous studies have been done in the basin with emphasizing the integrated water resources management downstream beek and meijer 2006 hydrology burger 2005 the geography of the transboundary basins ebrahimzadeh 2005 hydro political issues m shahbazbegian et al 2016 m r shahbazbegian et al 2016 ettehad 2010 as well as environmental impacts and water scarcity growth sharifikia 2013 these studies have addressed the impact of growing water scarcity downstream helmand and have proposed adaptation strategies so far being ineffective due to the lack of sustainable water inflow to overcome this problem iran has recently decided to operate the non renewable water resources in this river basin the exploitation of resources such as fossil groundwater aquifers is considered temporary to maintain food production and protect rural employment especially in the agricultural sector llamas and custodio 2003 unesco 2003 ward 1998 however fossil groundwater withdrawal is associated with different hydrologic socioeconomic and environmental side effects in the long run the current hydro economic modeling frameworks including groundwater simulation afshar et al 2020 steward et al 2009 and optimizations gisser and sánchez 1980 burnett et al 2020 cannot be able to capture the long term consequences of access to non renewable water resources due to these complexities an informed and scientifically defendable basis is delivered by modeling and dynamically simulating the change in water resources for proactive management policies as well as improving the system s adaptive capacity as a whole

and brierley 2007 providing more sustainable water resources management system dynamics sd modeling is an appropriate framework to implement the integrated frameworks for the performance assessment of water resources systems sd models are credible tools to capture the dynamic interactions within water resources systems simonović 2009 the increasing use of sd in the planning and management of water resources in recent decades is due to its known capabilities sd models have been widely applied in groundwater modeling bates et al 2019 balali and viaggi 2015 mokhtar and aram 2017 surface water

this model the adequacy of fossil groundwater exploitation within the transboundary hirmand international river basin is also investigated as the new source of water supply the developed sd model advances previous applications gohari et al 2013 mehrazar et al 2020 by considering the environmental implications of water resources system management however although the effect of ecosystem protection on socioeconomic development is considered little attention is paid to the sequence of occurrences of disturbing phenomena on the welfare of residents the paper is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 introduce the study area and sd overview the model development and its application are discussed in sections 4 and 5 sections 6 and 7 contain the policy scenario s implications and conclusions 2 case study the transboundary hirmand river basin called helmand in afghanistan stretches across afghanistan mountainous and iranian plateau with an average elevation of 490 4200 m fig 1 shows that more than 95 of the basin is located in afghanistan thomas 2016 the basin is nourished by helmand river with a length of 1000 km starting from the highland of afghanistan upstream and finally ending to hamoun lake as a valuable ecological wetland located in sistan iran najafi and vatanfada 2011 sharifikia 2013 sistan area with a population of 400000 people is stretched in a hot and dry region facing water hydrological agricultural environmental and socioeconomic challenges table 1 summarizes some characteristics of them in sistan according to a transboundary water sharing agreement in 1973 afghanistan is committed to supply the iranian part with a minimum annual inflow of 810 million cubic meters mcm during the normal and wet years farrokhzadeh et al 2020 during the recent decades the rapid agricultural development raising the kajakai dam height as well as construction of the kamal khan dam in afghanistan has significantly reduced the helmand river inflow in sistan currently some doubts have been raised that the annual water supply in iran may decrease around 55 due to severe drought beek and meijer 2006 leading to more intensified water related problems downstream the basin sistan this region experiences severe water shortage which is expected to be intensified by future socioeconomic development iranian policy makers have recently decided to withdraw fossil groundwater to support socioeconomic demand growth by increasing the water supply of the region table 2 presents the general properties of this project 3 system dynamics modeling sd models are powerful tools for capturing complicated systems structures and tracking their dynamic behaviors forrester 1961 sterman 2000 the sd model helps to observe the water resources as a system with the dynamic interaction between the elements within simonović 2009 therefore sd is a compatible framework to grab knotty orientations of water resources and their original reasons within a holistic framework the main steps of developing sd models include gohari et al 2013 1 defining the problem and specifying system boundary 2 developing the conceptual model for the system or causal loop diagram cld 3 developing a stock and flow diagram sfd to formulate model 4 evaluating model performance these steps are pursued iteratively to promote model transparency homer 1996 3 1 problem description and system boundary the first and paramount step for a successful sd modeling is problem definition and project focus to determine the system s structure overlooking the problem definition and model scope in sd modeling leads to its downfall in the end eskinasi and fokkema 2006 despite earlier discussed challenges existing within the study area the helmand river is the single water provider in sistan which the fate of this unreliable source based on the existing or emerging disputes between iran and afghanistan can make it more difficult for iranian authorities how future socioeconomic development should be handled in order to improve the condition of the area this study aims to investigate how sd can address the use of fossil groundwater resources to alleviate water related problems in sistan in this regard assessing the main drivers and evaluating their impacts on systems are both crucial fig 2 shows the process of identifying existing problems understanding the interaction of water resources management components assessing impacts selecting strategies and analyzing the effectiveness of chosen strategies 3 2 causal loop diagram of the swrs the system s structure will be completed in the second step using causal loop diagrams clds showing how different elements in a system are interrelated this diagram is a set of nodes and edges the variables are represented by nodes and the edges arrows are the connections that indicate a bond or a relationship between the two variables these relationships can be positive or negative a positive negative polarity relationship indicates that a change in one variable others being equal causes changes in the same opposite direction in the other variable the mixture of polarity causal relationships forms feedback loops feedback loops can act as reinforcing or positive and balancing or negative feedback loops the system s structure and the polarities of variables in a particular loop indicate the behavior of that loop the unique qualitative model causal loop diagrams improves our conceptual system understanding and can expose feedback loops inherent in the system neuwirth et al 2015 sterman 2000 here four subsystems are identified for the cld of the swrs including hydrological agricultural socioeconomic and environmental subsystems 3 2 1 hydrological subsystem according to fig 3 the hydrological subsystem captures the main climate and hydrologic components including temperature precipitation evaporation reservoirs and water inflow in the basin it is worth noting that chahnimeh reservoirs receive surface water inflow from the sistan river the water stored in these reservoirs is allocated to industrial agricultural domestic and ecosystem hamoun lake sectors the priorities for water supply in the region are domestic industrial agricultural and environmental respectively hamoun lake is considered as the terminal physical boundary of the system with its natural inflow 3 2 2 socioeconomic subsystem cld of the socioeconomic subsystem is presented in fig 3 the socioeconomic attitudes affect the water resources planning and management in this area the residents utility is defined as the key driver for socioeconomic development these factors include per capita water use the added value from different water uses trade level with neighboring countries and environmental water inflows residents utility largely depends on the economic related issues and the numerous values provided by hamoun lake there are positive dynamic relationships between residents utility and regional economic development rate and income due to different economic productivity in different water sectors the added value is defined as the summation of economic productivity for industrial domestic and agricultural users trade with afghanistan is an economic factor that affects the residents utility in sistan trade with afghanistan in the borders as compared to agriculture activities increase the development leading to more income and facilitates without raising water use in the area 3 2 3 agricultural subsystem while agriculture accounts for more than 90 of water consumption in sistan agricultural production accounts for about 1 of iran s national agricultural production due to low irrigation efficiency beek and meijer 2006 according to diverse irrigated crops in the basin five different classes of crops including wheat barley cereals fodder melons and grape vegetables garden products mechanized corps are considered in the agricultural subsystem as a non limiting example the cld of the agricultural subsystem for two classes of crops is presented in fig 3 the water demand is estimated by considering the envisaged land area and irrigation water demand for each crop the total required agricultural water demand is a factor that determines the net irrigation water demand irrigation efficiency describes how water is delivered to crops and indicates the amount of water during water distribution and irrigation systems sharma et al 2015 agricultural products are also important in the local market they provide fresh various and affordable types of food for the whole population of sistan and its neighbors these earnings are simulated to figure out the net economic benefit of the crops separately the production of any crop has a positive relationship with the actual land area allocated to that crop the framework is established based upon two financial parameters cost the cost that must be paid such as seeds fertilizer labor and pesticide and benefit the economic value earning from sold products in markets comparison of these two terms is used to simulate the reaction of the farmers in order to maximize incomes and minimize domestic water resources consumption following the above considerations the land area for each crop represents the farmers behavior at the farm level considering its net economic benefit in the previous year the total amount of land supply is constant and crops with increasing returns attract more land in this study the structures and operations of each crop in the local market are guided to be independent of the variability of supply and demand for other products or services 3 2 4 environmental subsystem the wind has a destructive force and wind erosion causes unfavorable conditions in environmental elements especially in the soil the wind erosion process consists of three stages of taking transporting and depositing the separated particles are picked up by the wind and transported in different ways in the last stage of the wind erosion process wind loaded materials are left according to the reduction of wind speed and the emergence of barriers the hirmand zone is the arena of all three stages of wind erosion the main components required to estimate changes in erosion water volume and air quality include a vegetation b water balance c wind erosion and d dust concentration in the air and number of dusty days the related feedback loops are shown in fig 3 the annual vegetation is regulated based on the data of the area as the plants are regrown and faded temperature and humidity are two important factors for vegetation growth a linear relationship between soil water moisture and vegetation growth was used to regulate plant growth the main purpose of the water balance component is to estimate the volume of water in the lake precipitation as the main cause of water inflow is stored as surface water and then penetrates the soil once the water reaches the surface water storage site it is transported into the ground through infiltration unless the soil is saturated i e the limitation of soil pore volume porosity infiltration is calculated using the absorption of surface water in the lake until the water in the soil reaches its total capacity outflows in water balance include surface water losses evaporation and evapotranspiration vegetation evapotranspiration et is used as soil water output the water requirement for dust stabilization is equal to the amount of evaporation from the soil surface and the amount of water for soil saturation the amount of annual evaporation from the soil surface was calculated according to the research of aydin et al 2005 when dust enters the wind it is suspended in the air or settled on the ground the amount of available suspended solids changes with wind speed and direction and is calculated using the lake dry bed and soil erosion relationships of the area eroded soil enters the wind system under the influence of strong winds and dust is suspended in the air the number of dusty days is predicted based on the number of strong winds and eroded soil 3 3 stock and flow diagram of the swrs based on the developed cld the stock flow diagrams sfd of the swrs are developed to characterize the system processes and capture the stock and flow structure of the system typically stock variables are the aggregation that determines the state of the system and generates information based on which decisions and actions are made due to the flow variables of incoming and outgoing stock variables change madani and mariño 2009 the sfd of the hydrological socioeconomic and environment subsystems are presented in fig 4 4 system dynamic model calibration this step includes the qualitative and quantitative performance assessment of the developed sd model the structural and behavioral aspects of the model are tested to ensure the accuracy of the interrelationships among elements of the subsystems according to the observation and logical extractions the behavior reproduction test is applied here to test the developed model 4 1 behavior reproduction test in order to examine the accuracy of the developed model to reproduce the behavior of the real system here the behavior reproduction test is applied for the period of 2000 2015 in this behavior verification test several statistical metrics eqs 1 4 including root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae r2 and kolmogorov smirnov k s were used to evaluate the results of key relationships in the simulated model with observed historical data 1 rsme 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2

developed models and also o i and p i are the average of corresponding data during n events in addition e pi and e oi are the empirical distribution functions for pi and oi parameters fig 5 and table 3 show the comparison between the simulated and observed values for population chahnimeh reservoirs sistan river flow dust storm days and agricultural land area for cereals and grape production over the calibration period as seen in this behavior reproduction test comparing the values of observational variables simulated by the model indicates the model ability to properly reproduce the desired parameters of the system in terms of behavior 4 2 water resources performance indices in this study the efficiency of water management policies is evaluated by a number of performance indices including the reliability index rel vulnerability index vul resiliency index res sustainability index si and maximum deficit index max def the re index indicates the ability of the system for supplying sufficient water in the long term quantified by eq 5 hashimoto et al 1982 klemeš et al 1981 for different water users 5 rel number of years with d 0 n where d represents the water deficit and n represents either the simulation period length of the number of years mcmahon et al 2006 the vul index is determined as the anticipated value of deficits or yearly average deficit divided by yearly average demand over deficit time eq 6 describing the average failure probability of the water resources in meeting the water demand sandoval solis et al 2011 6 vul i 1 n number of years withd 0 water demand the res index eq 7 is equal to an average recovery probability from the failure set in a single time step hashimoto et al 1982 7 res number of years with d t 1 0 d t 0 number of years with d t 0 the sustainability index eq 8 as a combination of performance measures is defined as sandoval solis et al 2011 8 si rel res 1 vul 1 3 dividing the maximum annual deficit by the annual water demand the max def index eq 9 is achieved gohari et al 2017 9 max def max d annual water demand 5 results after demonstrating the model robustness and preparation for the application various strategies and policies can be analyzed using swrs a detailed analysis is carried out to assess future suitable water management policies policy analysis is a stepwise systematic process to evaluate the long term performance of a complicated system after understanding strategies levers and responses the behavior sensitivity test identification or construction of alternative policies is the first step in this analysis here according to the results of the identified strategies in the sensitivity analysis the types of policies vary between the agricultural water and water management policies deciding which policy scenario stands out depends on the set of qualitative and quantitative criteria obtained in relation to a comparison point table 4 presents an overview of the selected policy scenarios the presented eight policy scenarios differ in terms of the assumptions made about 1 agricultural water use efficiency 2 the evaporation from chahnimeh reservoirs 3 possible changes in the surface water inflow from afghanistan to iran 4 extraction of the non renewable groundwater fossil aquifer and 5 cropping pattern fig 6 shows the behavior of selected variables in the simulated period for defined policies by various assumptions the behavioral analysis of the major variables for all different simulated policies is elaborated as follows it is worth noting that the simulation results provided by the business as usual policy scenario b a u is the control policy scenario for comparison under this reference policy scenario the population and domestic water demand decrease and drastic agricultural and environmental water deficiencies are anticipated all over the simulation period water shortage and water demand depend on surface water inflow fluctuations in this circumstance around 38 dusty days per year are expected in the region furthermore the results also show that hamoun lake receives no water throughout the simulation period as seen in fig 6 under only two policy scenarios of 3 and 6 the population and residents utility can increase while in other management policies population migration from the region even tends to increase the most important reason for the improvement of conditions under these two policy scenarios is the fossil water withdrawal and consequently the reduction of water shortage in the region needless to say that policy scenario 6 is much more realistic than that of 3 in which there are no restrictions on the use of fossil water policy scenario 7 has the lowest population growth rate due to blocking the sistan river flow in policy scenario 3 agricultural water demand increases due to fossil water withdrawal therefore agricultural water consumption reaches its highest possible level annual aquifers exploitation is between 1500 and 3000 mcm depending on the water inflow of the sistan river as a result of demand management it is reduced to 250 and 1600 mcm in policy scenario 4 which can be very important in the aquifer management approach in the agriculture water demand in policy scenarios 4 and 5 the agriculture sector would experience a water shortage also there have been agricultural water shortages in some years in policy scenario 6 on the one hand the results also show that demand management strategies such as policy scenarios 6 and 2 without fossil waters withdrawal cannot significantly improve the future of the region on the other hand it should be noted that the available water resource cannot be a reliable resource under the occurrence of severe drought or even with no water demand management action especially agricultural demand management in the region in policies1 and 2 water inflow to hamoun lake improves only slightly and the average of dusty days is reduced 5 and 7 days in a year in comparison with b a u respectively in policy scenarios 3 4 and 5 hamoun lake receives no sufficient water and the average of dusty days reduces to 24 29 and 29 days per year respectively the minimum required flow is allocated to hamoun lake in order to stabilize the dust in policy scenario 6 and the average of dusty days is reduced to 19 days per year a comparison of the dust storm days under the selected policy scenarios shows that meeting the minimum environmental demand can reduce the dust storm days up to 50 affecting the resident s utility of sistan the results of policy scenario 6 show that the vegetation cover extension is an effective solution in stabilizing the soil of hamoun lake and reducing the dry area in this region therefore increasing the water inflow to the lake and the vegetation cover can significantly reduce dusty days based on the obtained results the two policy scenarios of 7 as the most pessimistic future condition and 6 as the most optimistic future condition are significantly important in planning to deal with the water shortage during the coming three decades in the area policy scenario 3 is continued for the three time sequences of pre exploitation exploitation mode and post failure cessation of exploitation as shown in fig 7 the results show that the population and agricultural water demand have been increased in the exploitation mode this water resource has met the demands and there is no shortage in the region but in the post failure period agricultural water demand will remain high water shortage has increased to a greater extent than in the pre operation period which is due to the socioeconomic development in this region accordingly the population which can be known as a sign of the region s development reached its peak and then declined obviously by managing the exploitation from these resources we can give the opportunity of recovering these aquifers and delaying or even preventing the arrival of the breaking point generally the results show that if appropriate management policies are not conducted and usage of fossil water does not happen in the region the problems will not be solved therefore extraction from fossil aquifers policy scenario 3 can make it possible to increase the water supply thus decreasing its shortage however an increase in water supply from fossil aquifers leads to an increase in demand in addition the reduction of water loss by increased agricultural irrigation efficiency and evaporation is the other most efficient policy in the area therefore it is necessary to manage water extraction from fossil aquifers and water loss in the long term policy scenario 7 shows the sistan region s severe drought conditions the water storage of chahnimeh reservoirs is sufficient to satisfy domestic water demand temporarily just for the first 2 5 years of the drought period allocating no water to agricultural and environmental sectors makes the living conditions difficult in the villages leading to a dramatic decline in the residents utility in this situation the average dusty days will be increased to 15 days per year table 5 presents the performance indices of different water sectors under different management policy scenarios in the b a u policy scenario vulnerability and reliability indices show that the region has faced severe agricultural and environmental water shortages during the simulation period in this table the green highlighted cells represent the best possible value and the red ones represent the worst possible result of the policy scenarios for each performance criteria based on this table policy scenario 6 is the best in terms of the agricultural aspect also policy scenarios 3 and 4 are the most preferred solutions in other words in the agricultural sector the rel and res indices in the policy scenarios 3 and 4 are equal to 1 also their vul and max def indices are lower than other policy scenarios improved slightly than b a u therefore si for the agricultural sector shows the sustainable conditions in the exploitation of fossil aquifers and demand management of the agricultural sector if fossil water is not extracted agricultural demand management modifying the cultivation pattern and reducing water loss policy scenarios 1 and 2 have suitable impacts in these policy scenarios the agricultural vul index shows that the agricultural water shortage and water stress compared to b a u have decreased over time in terms of the environmental sector in all policy scenarios the rel and res s indices are close to 0 and only under policy scenario 6 which supplies the minimum environmental flow the values of these indices have the highest possible amount equal to 1 in these circumstances the vul and consequently the si indices would have the ideal amount due to the allocation of water from specific reservoirs triple chahnimeh reservoirs to drinking water supply rel and res indices are high and have the lowest values of vul and max def producing the maximum si generally different si indices express important points to achieve the sustainability of water resources in the region 1 the exploitation of fossil aquifers and demand management by increasing irrigation efficiency and reducing water loss from reservoirs have a great impact on the sustainability of the agricultural sector and thus the farmers economy 2 sustainable water resources can be achieved in two ways i to be extracted without restrictions and ii the fossil water extraction management being conceivable only in the case of complementary designs 3 meeting the minimum environmental demand is the best way to promote public health and rehabilitation parts of hamoun 6 discussion in this study the developed model facilitates valuable insights into sistan s problems and system s long run behaviors as opposed to quantitative snapshots of the system behavior making them practical tools for participatory modeling policy screening and high level adaptive managing mirchi 2013 the main driver behind the current water shortage in sistan is unreliable water supply which leads to hampered economic development threatened ecosystems and worsened human health the results show disastrous depletion of the surface water inflow by the mid next century if the current development trends are held on the upstream basin in the future even if the conditions are considered to be fixed in the upstream basin the real issue for the decision makers in sistan will be remained unresolved how different water demands agricultural or domestic would be met while the water inflow from afghanistan will not be sufficient in this condition the use of fossil water can be used as an alternative for better management of the region from a managerial perspective extracting water from fossil aquifers for water supply demand in sistan has the features of the limits to growth archetype fig 8 according to this archetype the initial successful continuous growth loses its effectiveness and balancing feedback loops take over and slow down the system s behavior over time by limiting factors typically the limiting factor is an internal or external variable of a system that opposes significant changes and limits or stops the changes in the system fig 8 for example extracting from the aquifers can lead to initial successful accelerating socioeconomic growth however their excessive use can finally impose several negative impacts such as declined water tables increased extracting costs worsened water quality and conflict among water users therefore it can fully be considered as the limit of that system fig 9 this archetype explains that intense short term effort that leads to short term success can be just as dangerous in the long run as being unsuccessful or with no effort building the future by identifying growth engines and potential hazards and aligning with long term prospects will make it possible to be prepared in advance for adverse conditions and eliminate them before they become a threat from a practical perspective using fossil water can increase the hopes for reconstruction and certainty of the water supply in sistan however extracting excessive amounts of fossil water can lead it to a critical level increasing the extraction cost that reduces the demand for fossil water balancing loop as shown in fig 9 water demand growth can continue successful growth until fossil water extraction becomes uneconomical or impossible limiting factors which in turn reduces growth slow down growth in an extreme case if the growth engine bourns out and the non renewable aquifer becomes completely exhausted the engine of the economy may suddenly stop and fail if one does not plan for limits plans for failure a combination of remedies outlined for sistan should be planned to strengthen the water resources management system the results inferred from the model for various water resource programs and policy scenarios show that sistan s current problems cannot be solved merely by hydraulic reformations or chahnimeh reservoirs development water supply oriented the obtained results are in line with previous works for example farrokhzad et al 2020 showed that urgent improvement of current policies in this region is necessary otherwise the condition of agriculture and the environment could get worse to deal with this situation he suggested various policies such as reducing evaporation from reservoirs increasing irrigation efficiency using shortage optimization controlling population and preventing the cultivation of all the arable land in order to improve the socioeconomic and environmental situation of the region apart from the conservation policies shahbazbegian and bagheri 2016 shahbazbegian and bagheri 2016 show that even with an average annual flow of 2000 mcm in the helmand river hamon lake could not survive from drying they also noted that the economic dependence of the region on the agricultural sector the largest consumer of water and the low productivity of this sector will force iranian decision makers to negotiate with afghanistan shahbazbegian and bagheri 2016 shahbazbegian and bagheri 2016 thus as previously stated by beek et al 2008 water planners in iran should change their last decades main policies and look for better remedies accepting the choice of a political one however several investment projects and the development of water infrastructure upstream the helmand basin show afghanistan s seriousness in controlling hirmand river flow as an effective political lever on iran the limitation in access to reliable information is one of the main obstacles in the study of transboundary basins access to downstream fossil water aquifers in iran could put afghanistan in a new hydro political position and will affect the conflict between the two countries this point is accepted in the present study as a limitation afghanistan can exert this conflict through greater control over surface water resources which affects the socioeconomic conditions of both countries in order to alleviate this challenge the results of this study show that a combination of water demand management evaporation losses and fossil water extraction can be efficient those remedies may lead to 1 sustainable access to water resources beyond the demands for long term 2 sustainable fossil aquifer with groundwater extractions less than or equal to fossil aquifer s critical level 3 protection of environmental resources and wetlands e g hamoun lake and reducing its consequences in the area 4 protecting the area from drought concerns without worrying about different water seeking sectors and contentions with neighboring cities over transferred water resources 5 decreasing sandstorms and cooling the air in the wetlands with more water thus benefitting from the natural region for recreation and festivities from what has been done it can be concluded that although the use of supply oriented policies for improving the condition of the region is necessary but not solely sufficient these solutions must be accompanied by demand management approaches in other words effective implementation of demand management solutions is a basic prerequisite for ensuring the success of supply driven solutions in addition due to lower costs iran s decision makers should pursue water diplomacy much more seriously than providing new water alternative resources 7 conclusions in the water resources systems the high number of complicated subsystems either dependent on each other or independent has made the process of decision making more difficult achieving comprehensive knowledge of the problems and the mechanism of feedback is important in order to predict the long term behavior of the system appropriately the dynamics of the systems is an appropriate method for integrated management of the water resources and the region in the future sd provides a method based on flexibility and realistic orientation identifying and taking care of the intrinsic uncertainties in the management of the water resources making use of fossil aquifers to solve the concurrent water stress in the sistan area follows the archetypal features of the limits to growth system the supply oriented management plan through the fossil water withdrawal serves as a reliable source until the withdrawal reaches a critical level what has caused the fossil water resources to reach their critical supply capacity as a source of water supply for the sistan desert system is the problem of uncontrolled extraction and inefficient irrigation methods immediately after the start of the fossil aquifer extraction too much water is pumped at once the problem will become more challenging if the long time outcomes and environmental damages are taken into account water resources and agricultural managers in sistan are urged to focus on the improvement of the agricultural water efficiency and reducing the evaporation of water reservoirs to ensure that the highest reliability and the lowest vulnerability within the system are achieved interpretation of the simulation results of this study shows that fossil aquifers alone cannot solve the problem of water scarcity in the area therefore it should be noted that to manage the assessed imbalance the existing uncertainty can be controlled by increasing the amount of supply but reducing the amount of demand is also necessary the proposed approach can be further strengthened and extended from several aspects since there is an urgent need to move from supply oriented passive management in the region towards the policies of demand oriented management so that water shortage cannot be felt so much increasing people s awareness about water shortage should be one of the integral and permanent parts of managing water resources in planning demand management in the region so that the region must get closer to the balancing point between supply and demand although reforming the cultivation pattern of the crops and improvement of water optimization is one of the most important effective policies in irrigation water consumption it is not a permanent solution nevertheless the appropriateness of this policy in increasing the system reliability and decreasing its vulnerability compared to the present systems must be further investigated investigating the conflict despite many uncertainties and lack of access to reliable information in the basin can be considered in future research declaration of competing interest the
