introduction among emerging pollutants drugs are probably the main concern of regulatory authorities due to their huge consume drugs their metabolites and their degradation products could reach the environment mainly due to poor removal rates in waste water treatment plants wwtp and by improper disposal of unused medicines kümmerer 2009 the presence of these compounds in the environment has been extensively reported petrie et al 2015 geissen et al 2015 ebele et al 2017 sanganyado et al 2017 however although the great efforts made by regulatory authorities and scientific community not much is known about the impact of this kind of compounds on the environment and human health wong 2006 stanley et al 2006 2007 kasprzyk hordern 2010 ribeiro et al 2012 a great number of currently available drugs are chiral compounds and many of these are marketed as racemates enantiomers have different interactions with physiological chiral molecules leading to different biological responses that affect living organisms in different ways the enantioselectivity in ecotoxicity and biodegradation processes is evident and comparable to the events in medical biomedical fields kasprzyk hordern 2010 ribeiro et al 2014a the biodegradability defined as the capacity of a molecule to be degraded by microorganisms forming more simple final products is an essential parameter to know the risk that involves the dispersion of a compound into the environment this property depends on the chemical structure of the compound as well as on the physicochemical conditions under which the degradation process takes place biodegradability assays are designed to test a chemical substance as the sole carbon source in a mixed inoculum thouand 2014 the oecd tests for ready biodegradability have been devised as screening methods to determine whether a chemical is potentially easily biodegradable which contribute to gain knowledge in the field of water and environmental research there are evidences of enantioselective biodegradation of chiral compounds in the environment the quantification of the enantiomeric fractions ef during the biodegradation process is of key importance to evaluate the health and environmental risk however there is not much research done on this subject some studies have been focused on the ef evaluation directly in wastewaters they involve drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals vázquez roig et al 2014 kasprzyk hordem and baker 2012 amphetamines evans et al 2016 and seven selected chiral pharmaceuticals in wwtp influents and effluents ribeiro et al 2014b other approaches have been based on in vitro biodegradability assays they simulate the degradation processes of chemicals in soils surface waters or in activated sludge generally in the presence of oxygen kowalczyk et al 2015 the subsequent separation and determination of the individual enantiomers of the original compound or its metabolites in the test solution by analytical techniques mainly liquid chromatography allow the estimation of ef using this laboratory scale methodology enantioselective evaluation of biodegradation for fluoxetine and norfluoxetine ribeiro et al 2014b moreira et al 2014 amphetamine based compounds evans et al 2016 bagnall et al 2013 atenolol metoprolol and fluoxetine ribeiro et al 2013a alprenolol and propranolol ribeiro et al 2013b and venlafaxine li et al 2013 have been reported recently s evans et al reported an enantioselective biodegradation study involving chiral pharmaceuticals amphetamines beta blockers and antidepressants evans et al 2017 trimeprazine or alimemazine is a tricyclic antihistamine similar in structure to the phenothiazine antipsychotics but differing in the ring substitution and chain characteristics trimeprazine is not used clinically as an anti psychotic it is used principally as an anti emetic to prevent motion sickness or as an anti histamine in combination with other medications in cough and cold preparations trimeprazine is largely used as antipruritic agent but also for insomnia and oral premedication in paediatric day surgery drug information portal 2017 in this paper the enantioselective biodegradation of trimeprazine enantiomers is studied by means of a biodegradability assay in similar conditions to those recommended in oecd tests for this purpose experiments at three concentration levels of racemic trimeprazine are performed in batch conditions using an activated sludge inoculum from a local wwtp a rplc method for chiral separation of trimeprazine enantiomers is developed in the literature some references about the chiral separation of enantiomers of trimeprazine using electrophoretic lin et al 2005 martinez gomez et al 2007 and liquid chromatographic methods using chiral stationary phases van overbeke et al 1997 oguni et al 1995 sanchez et al 2012 have been reported complete separations of enantiomers of trimeprazine have been obtained using a α1 glycoprotein agp column and hydroorganic mobile

methanol 40 15 45 v v van overbeke et al 1997 to the best of our knowledge neither biodegradation nor enantioselective biodegradation for trimeprazine has been reported in the literature thus one aim of this work is to provide the first evidence of enantioselective biodegradation of this emergent contaminant additional objectives are i to connect the enantioselective biodegradation with the microbial growth ii to apply a curve fitting approach for concentration biodegradation and also for the first time enantiomeric fraction data over time in order to expand the usefulness of the results

sterile tubes were used samples mixtures containing 3000 μl of the corresponding working solution of rac trimeprazine inoculated with 100 μl of the activated sludge total sample volume of 3100 μl were prepared independent samples were prepared for each concentration level and each incubation time studied all experiments were done in duplicate using tubes of a volume five fold superior to guarantee the aeration of the cultures the samples were incubated on a shaking incubator 150 rpm at 20 c under natural light cycles at ten prefixed incubation times 0 1 2 3 4 7 10 14 18 and 23 days two test tubes of each concentration level were taken and when necessary to compensate solvent evaporation ultrapure water was added to get a total volume of 3100 μl then mixtures were vortex mixed for 20 s and an aliquot of 200 μl of each tube was taken to measure the od of the cultures at 600 nm after od measurement samples were frozen at 80 c until hplc analysis described in section 2 3 abiotic degradation of the enantiomers of trimeprazine was evaluated using 100 μl of ultrapure water instead of the activated sludge inoculum under the same conditions as samples prior to hplc analysis the samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was filtered experimental conditions used i e trimeprazine concentration and volume of inoculum were chosen according to oecd guidelines oecd 1992 2 5 precision studies precision statistics considering repeatability and intermediate precision conditions including the factor time were used according to an approach described elsewhere bonet domingo et al 2006 maroto et al 1999 duplicated results obtained from biotic assays were organized in a matrix xnrxns where nr are the number of replicates nr 2 and ns are the number of series or runs in this case incubation times the approach analyses the xnrxns data matrix by means of analysis of variance anova from the residual mean square msr and the between run mean square msrun the repeatability standard deviation sr between run standard deviation srun and standard deviation of the run mean or grand mean smean can be calculated using the following equations eqs 1 3 1 s r 2 ms r 2 s run 2 ms run ms r nr 3 s m e a n 2 m s r u n n r 2 6 biodegradation kinetics common biodegradation models proposed in the literature the nonlinear monod equation and its simplified version the michaelis menten like equation are unreliable approaches in terms of kinetic parameters accuracy this is due to the linear parameter correlation robinson and tiedje 1983 liu and zachara 2001 this is particularly evident for imprecise data low substrate concentration s and few incubation times t despite this both monod and michaelis menten like equations often provide good fit between the model s vs t fitted curve and the experimental data s vs t experimental data discrete points even with wrong estimates the aim in this work is not to estimate kinetic parameters that anyway could be unreliable but to be able to model the substrate concentration vs time s vs t experimental data in order to approach biodegradation vs time bd vs t or the enantiomeric fraction vs time ef vs t fitted curves the michaelis menten like equation does not account to the biomass concentration and the microbial yield coefficient necessary for the monod equation thus this equation was used as a simplified monod model in this work eq 4 4 ds dt v m s k s s where vm approaches is the maximum specific growth rate and ks approaches the half saturation constant for growth in the simplified approach vm is assumed constant strictly speaking it depends on the biomass concentration which in general varies with t an explicit solution for eq 4 can be written goudar and strevett 2000 based on the lambert w function s as a function of the time t s w t corless et al 1993 5 s k s w s 0 k s e s 0 v m t k s offset where s0 is the initial concentration of the compound eq 5 could provide estimations of vm and ks by nonlinear parameter estimation if degradation profiles do not reach zero an offset term can be considered for fitting the function to the experimental data her et al 2015 2 7 software and data processing for curve fitting purposes the nlinfit m function in matlab r2016b mathworks natick massachusetts has been used it estimates the coefficients of a nonlinear regression function using iterative least squares estimation algorithmic details of the explicit lambert w function eq 5 can be found in her et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 chiral chromatographic analysis for the separation of enantiomers of trimeprazine different polysaccharides stationary phases chiralart cellulose sc lux cellulose 1 lux cellulose 3 and lux amylose 2 were assayed see experimental section using an ammonium acetate ph 8 acetonitrile 40 60 0 1 diethylamine mobile phase only partial resolution of trimeprazine enantiomers were obtained using with chiralart cellulose sc and lux cellulose 1 stationary phases rs values of 0 5 and 0 3 respectively using these columns different chaotropic agents like potassium hexafluorophosphate and sodium perchlorate solutions were assayed the use of 100 mm potassium hexafluorophosphate and acetonitrile 60 40 v v mobile phases did not provide the separation of trimeprazine enantiomers in spite of the results reported by oguni and coworkers using a stationary phase similar to lux cellulose 1 oguni t al 1995 adequate resolution value rs 2 2 and retention times 13 6 and 14 8 min for the first e1 and the second e2 eluted enantiomers respectively for the enantiomers of trimeprazine were obtained using a lux cellulose 1 column as stationary phase and a 500 mm sodium perchlorate acetonitrile 60 40 v v mobile phase see fig 1 using these experimental conditions a concentration value of 1 mg l 1 of racemic trimeprazine 0 5 mg l 1 of each enantiomer was considered the limit of quantification peak areas below this concentration level were too low for quantification purposes i e they provide signal to noise ratio values below 10 for the present work the noise was measured from chromatograms of blank samples in the same regions as the peaks of trimeprazine enantiomers ribani et al 2007 the calibration curves of each enantiomer were obtained by injection of standard solutions containing racemic trimeprazine in the 1 30 mg l 1 range 5 concentration levels see section 2 2 table 1 shows the calibration statistics obtained for each enantiomer as can be observed for both enantiomers satisfactory results were obtained r2 0 99 3 2 enantioselective biodegradation results the biodegradability assays for the enantiomers of trimeprazine were performed in batch mode by duplicate at three concentration levels section 2 2 sample tubes containing trimeprazine and inoculum in msm medium were collected and analysed at different times 0 1 2 3 4 7 10 14 18 and 23 days similarly samples tubes containing trimeprazine in msm medium abiotic assays were analysed at the same times according to oecd oecd 1992 benzoic acid was used as reference substance to ensure that the microbial community in the test system is active a complete biodegradation of benzoic acid 20 mg l 1 was achieved in less than 48 h in the experimental conditions used indicating the adequacy of the inoculum and thus the validity of the trimeprazine assays fig 1 shows two chromatograms corresponding to t 0 and 18 days as can be observed the peak areas of the first e1 and second e2 eluting enantiomers of trimeprazine are lower in the second case this fact indicates that a degradation process has occurred moreover in the second chromatogram the peak area of e1 seems lower than those of e2 this suggests that an enantioselective biodegradation process has occurred fig 2 shows the concentration profiles s vs t experimental data two replicates of enantiomers at initial trimeprazine racemate concentration of 9 mg l 1 i e s0 4 5 mg l 1 as can be seen a similar concentration decay is observed during the first days for e1 and e2 enantiomers until day 4 however different profiles for the enantiomers are evident during the following days until the end of the experiment this behaviour could be attributed to a shift in the microbial communities during the biodegradation of trimeprazine biodegradation in communities of diverse microorganisms is a complex process combination of different effects kinetics especially when enantiomers are present competition enantiomerization etc where several degradation pathways could sequentially operate some being enantioselective and others not similar behaviour has been previously described for other compounds and it was attributed to time dependent changes in the composition of the microbial community evans et al 2017 anyway the enantioselective biodegradation mechanism is confirmed in fig 2 the results also indicate that the concentration profiles are stabilized at higher times so no further degradation is expected similar results not shown were obtained for the other concentration trimeprazine racemate concentrations assayed on the other hand abiotic assays indicate relatively low degradation in absence of inoculum 20 for the concentration levels studied these results indicates that abiotic elimination of the compound can be considered non significant iso 9888 1999 and the degradation estimated in biotic assays can be considered as biodegradation in order to control to the biomass growth the optical density od at 600 nm od600 profile was obtained the od600 can be considered proportional to the biomass growth shuler and kargi 2002 the od600 values in the range 0 1 were superimposed in fig 2 just for comparison purposes individual phases of the typical batch growth curve shuler and kargi 2002 can be perceived bearing in mind the experimental design used after an initial lag growth phase 2 days a short exponential phase 2 days is observed to continue with a stationary decline phase the last phase could explain the stabilization in the concentration profiles similar results were obtained with the other trimeprazine racemate concentrations interestingly when comparing both the concentration with od600 profiles it can be deduced that the stage of enantioselective biodegradation mainly coincides with the last growth phase more than with the exponential phase to obtain the enantiomeric fraction profiles of trimeprazine enantiomers the enantiomeric fraction ef was calculated for each incubation time according to bagnall et al 2012 6 e f s e 1 s e 1 s e 2 where s e1 and s e2 refers to the estimated concentration of enantiomers at a given incubation time e g s values in fig 2 fig 3 shows the mean ef values together with their standard deviation ef s for each time during the biodegradation process the horizontal line at ef 0 5 represents no enantioselectivity consistently with conclusions of fig 2 until day 4 ef values close to 0 5 are obtained differences could be attributed to the method imprecision only during the last growth phase ef values below 0 5 are observed and they are stabilized around 0 4 0 45 the results in fig 3 correspond to the intermediate concentration level 9 mg l 1 evaluated in this work comparable ef patterns were observed for the other two trimeprazine concentration levels studied in fact the grand mean of the ef values considering the five last incubation times where ef is almost constant were 0 44 0 03 0 43 0 04 and 0 43 0 05 for the low intermediate and high trimeprazine concentration levels studied respectively the error terms correspond to smean eq 3 this represents a clear evidence on a moderate enantioselectivity in the biodegradation process of trimeprazine with this activated sludge with a minimum ef i e maximum enantioselectivity around 0 44 independent of s0 further verification with sludges from other plants would be necessary to confirm if the results could be generalized 3 3 kinetic assessment of the data curve fitting in this work the model kinetic parameters the maximum specific growth rate vm and the half saturation constant for growth ks estimated from eq 5 were not taken into account since they cannot be considered accurate due to their linear correlation moreover errors can increase depending on the s0 ks ratio liu and zachara 2001 and ks is a priori unknown in addition when the degradation profiles do not reach zero as in this work an offset term in eq 5 has been proposed to model the entire profile her et al 2015 it is important to realize that this fact should alter the estimated parameters moreover it is possible that the experiment is conducted while the sludge is in an adaptation phase to the current conditions which could difficult the mathematical treatment of the data finally it is impossible to guarantee a unique kinetic behaviour during the entire process since communities of diverse microorganisms exist as stated before a deeper study on this matter is beyond the scope of this study the s vs t experimental data were adjusted to eq 5 including the offset term just with the purpose to obtain s vs t fitted curves that fit well the experimental data a suitable objective as stated in section 2 6 fig 2 shows the fitted models s vs t fitted curves solid lines from the s vs t fitted curves of two enantiomers derived using eq 5 an enantiomeric fraction versus time ef vs t fitted curve can be obtained considering eq 6 the ef vs t fitted curve is included in fig 3 despite the noticeable uncertainty of the ef data the fitted curve shows a reasonable agreement with the ef points the curves at the three concentration levels were similar ef vs t fitted curves provide a simple manner to estimate ef at different times or vice versa for instance the ef vs t fitted curves confirm the minimum ef value at 0 44 at the maximum t value to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that an ef vs t fitted curve to the experimental data has been reported similarly from the s vs t fitted curves curves for the percentage of biodegradation can also be estimated considering the expression bd 100 s0 s s0 fig 4 shows the biodegradation versus time bd vs t fitted curves obtained for each enantiomer at the three concentration levels evaluated for clarity experimental values are not included the time where the bd 50 line cross a biodegradation versus time fitted curve is an estimate of t1 2 bd vs t fitted curves provide a simple manner to estimate t1 2 values independently from the parameters as well as the bd estimates at different times or vice versa according to these plots at the highest concentration level curves 5 and 6 both enantiomers have similar half life 4 5 days being still negligible the enantioselectivity of the biodegradation for the intermediate concentration level curves 3 and 4 t1 2 differs between e1 and e2 4 5 and 6 days respectively with an incipient enantioselective biodegradation the most extreme situation occurs at the lowest concentration level curves 1 and 2 while e1 has t1 2 5 days e2 never reach the 50 of biodegradation t1 2 cannot be estimated the differences in the results obtained for the different substrate concentration levels could indicate that different mechanisms of biodegradation of trimeprazine enantiomers could exist on the other hand as can be observed in all cases maximum bd values increase with the concentration studied and as expected according to figs 1 and 2 e1 always reach higher bd values than e2 after the enantioselective biodegradation stage 3 4 precision study under intermediate precision conditions precision is often forgotten in biodegradation studies however in our opinion these data should be always provided for instance although beyond the aim of this work the imprecision on s data is probably the most critical variable affecting the quality of kinetic parameters estimation also it could serve to compare different biodegradation procedures it should be noted that both the analytical method and the biodegradation process as sources of uncertainty contribute to the overall precision the typical design and initial statistics for assessing method precision in such conditions is summarised in section 2 5 the xnrxns design is consistent with a unique concentration level however in the case of biodegradation data s changes with time due to the degradation process in these conditions only the sr statistic makes sense eq 1 for each enantiomer x2x10 matrices 2 replicates 10 days were built and processed via anova considering eq 1 the relative standard deviation expressed in percentage rsdr was then calculated according to eq 7 7 r s d r 100 m s r s 0 the rsdr results for each concentration level and enantiomer are shown in table 1 as can be seen the rsdr values range from 3 7 to 8 7 those values account the overall method imprecision including the biodegradation and the analytical processes this value habitually unreported is more relevant than the simply analytical method precision sometimes reported as part of a validation study the precision study can be extended to other variables different from concentrations in this work a precision study on ef which accounts for the degree of enantioselective biodegradation was performed considering the fact that the higher noise is concentrate in the last five times see fig 3 and that ef can be considered almost constant in this period the precision can be performed under intermediate precision conditions including the factor time section 2 5 thus the last ten ef data duplicate values for each concentration level studied was arranged into x2x5 matrices considering eqs 1 and 2 repeatability and between run standard deviations can be calculated as rsd according to eqs 8 and 9 8 r s d r 100 m s r e f 9 r s d r u n 100 m s r u n m s r n r e f where ef represents the grand mean of x calculated in section 3 2 as x contain the lowest ef values and imprecise data the worst case this procedure provides the maximum ef impression associated with the proposed method table 1 shows the precision estimates obtained to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a precision study including between days ef imprecision estimation have been reported table 1 reveals that rsdrun rsdr thus the use of only rsdr could provide a false idea of imprecision on the other hand the values of rsdr 5 and rsdrun 13 could be considered reasonably normal in the context of a biodegradation process they suggest that ef estimations can be satisfactorily used to evidence the magnitude of the enantioselectivity of the process 4 conclusions enantiomeric fractions and their standard deviation ef s at the three concentration levels of trimeprazine studied offer the first evidence of enantioselective biodegradation of trimeprazine the maximum enantioselectivity observed minimum ef value at three trimeprazine initial racemate concentration in the 5 20 range is 0 44 the biomass growth indirectly established by optical density at 600 nm od600 measurements suggests that the enantioselective biodegradation process is produced during the stationary decline stage more than in the exponential stage this is an interesting and novel outcome that deserves more attention we suggest future work with other substrates biological material to confirm this observation in order to establish if it s a non isolated fact the curve fitting method by means of michaelis menten like approach solved by the lambert w function approximation provides s vs t fitted curves that fit well the s t experimental data independently of the quality of the parameters furthermore they enable to obtain bd vs t and for the first time ef vs t fitted curves from bd vs t fitted curves a reasonable estimation of half life times can be obtained such estimation should be more secure than other based on estimated model parameters e g as usual when using first order kinetics which can be inaccurate the similarity between the ef vs t fitted curves at three concentration curves tested indicates that the enantioselectivity is independent from the concentration we suggest future work with other substrates biological material to confirm this observation the precision study on s repeatability conditions and for the first time on ef intermediate precision conditions suggests that moderate imprecision is observed future works focus on estimating the kinetic parameters via monod or simplified equations or also alternative models should take into account the s imprecision which affects the estimates accuracy on the other hand improvements in a biodegradation procedure could be controlled by precision studies by simply comparing the precision outputs the results obtained in this work correspond to ready biodegradability test obtained in a laboratory scale compatible with the oecd recommendations whose analyte and microorganisms amounts differ from those in the environment the moderate enantioselective biodegradation observed for trimeprazine can be considered as indicative of its potential degradation in most environments including biological sewage treatment plants according to oecd guidelines on the other hand a direct extrapolation of the results to the environmental or wastewater treatment scale should not be performed conflicts of interest none acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the spanish ministerio de economía y competitividad mineco and the european regional

introduction among emerging pollutants drugs are probably the main concern of regulatory authorities due to their huge consume drugs their metabolites and their degradation products could reach the environment mainly due to poor removal rates in waste water treatment plants wwtp and by improper disposal of unused medicines kümmerer 2009 the presence of these compounds in the environment has been extensively reported petrie et al 2015 geissen et al 2015 ebele et al 2017 sanganyado et al 2017 however although the great efforts made by regulatory authorities and scientific community not much is known about the impact of this kind of compounds on the environment and human health wong 2006 stanley et al 2006 2007 kasprzyk hordern 2010 ribeiro et al 2012 a great number of currently available drugs are chiral compounds and many of these are marketed as racemates enantiomers have different interactions with physiological chiral molecules leading to different biological responses that affect living organisms in different ways the enantioselectivity in ecotoxicity and biodegradation processes is evident and comparable to the events in medical biomedical fields kasprzyk hordern 2010 ribeiro et al 2014a the biodegradability defined as the capacity of a molecule to be degraded by microorganisms forming more simple final products is an essential parameter to know the risk that involves the dispersion of a compound into the environment this property depends on the chemical structure of the compound as well as on the physicochemical conditions under which the degradation process takes place biodegradability assays are designed to test a chemical substance as the sole carbon source in a mixed inoculum thouand 2014 the oecd tests for ready biodegradability have been devised as screening methods to determine whether a chemical is potentially easily biodegradable which contribute to gain knowledge in the field of water and environmental research there are evidences of enantioselective biodegradation of chiral compounds in the environment the quantification of the enantiomeric fractions ef during the biodegradation process is of key importance to evaluate the health and environmental risk however there is not much research done on this subject some studies have been focused on the ef evaluation directly in wastewaters they involve drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals vázquez roig et al 2014 kasprzyk hordem and baker 2012 amphetamines evans et al 2016 and seven selected chiral pharmaceuticals in wwtp influents and effluents ribeiro et al 2014b other approaches have been based on in vitro biodegradability assays they simulate the degradation processes of chemicals in soils surface waters or in activated sludge generally in the presence of oxygen kowalczyk et al 2015 the subsequent separation and determination of the individual enantiomers of the original compound or its metabolites in the test solution by analytical techniques mainly liquid chromatography allow the estimation of ef using this laboratory scale methodology enantioselective evaluation of biodegradation for fluoxetine and norfluoxetine ribeiro et al 2014b moreira et al 2014

alimemazine is a tricyclic antihistamine similar in structure to the phenothiazine antipsychotics but differing in the ring substitution and chain characteristics trimeprazine is not used clinically as an anti psychotic it is used principally as an anti emetic to prevent motion sickness or as an anti histamine in combination with other medications in cough and cold preparations trimeprazine is largely used as antipruritic agent but also for insomnia and oral premedication in paediatric day surgery drug information portal 2017 in this paper the enantioselective biodegradation of trimeprazine enantiomers is studied by means of a biodegradability assay in similar conditions to those recommended in oecd tests for this purpose experiments at three concentration levels of racemic trimeprazine

degradation of the enantiomers of trimeprazine was evaluated using 100 μl of ultrapure water instead of the activated sludge inoculum under the same conditions as samples prior to hplc analysis the samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was filtered experimental conditions used i e trimeprazine concentration and volume of inoculum were chosen according to oecd guidelines oecd 1992 2 5 precision studies precision statistics considering repeatability and intermediate precision conditions including the factor time were used according to an approach described elsewhere bonet domingo et al 2006 maroto et al 1999 duplicated results obtained from biotic assays were organized in a matrix xnrxns where nr are the number of replicates nr 2 and ns are the number of series or runs in this case incubation times the approach analyses the xnrxns data matrix by means of analysis of variance anova from the residual mean square msr and the between run mean square msrun the repeatability standard deviation sr between run standard deviation srun and standard deviation of the run mean or grand mean smean can be calculated using the following equations eqs 1 3 1 s

version the michaelis menten like equation are unreliable approaches in terms of kinetic parameters accuracy this is due to the linear parameter correlation robinson and tiedje 1983 liu and zachara 2001 this is particularly evident for imprecise data low substrate concentration s and few incubation times t despite this both monod and michaelis menten like equations often provide good fit between the model s vs t fitted curve and the experimental data s vs t experimental data discrete points even with wrong estimates the aim in this work is not to estimate kinetic parameters that anyway could be unreliable but to be able to model the substrate concentration vs time s vs t experimental data in order to approach biodegradation vs time bd vs t or the enantiomeric fraction vs time ef vs t fitted curves the michaelis menten like equation does not account to the biomass concentration and the microbial yield coefficient necessary for the monod equation thus this equation was used as a simplified monod model in this work eq 4 4 ds dt v m s k s s where vm approaches is the maximum specific growth rate and ks approaches the half saturation constant for growth in the simplified approach vm is assumed constant strictly speaking it depends on the biomass concentration which in general varies with t an explicit solution for eq 4 can be written goudar and strevett 2000 based on the lambert w function s as a function of the time t s w t corless et al 1993 5 s k s w s 0 k s e s 0 v m t k s offset where s0 is the initial concentration of the compound eq 5 could provide estimations of vm and ks by nonlinear parameter estimation if degradation profiles do not reach zero an offset term can be considered for fitting the function to the experimental data her et al 2015 2 7 software and data processing for curve fitting purposes the nlinfit m function in matlab r2016b mathworks natick massachusetts has been used it estimates the coefficients of a nonlinear regression function using iterative least squares estimation algorithmic details of the explicit lambert w function eq 5 can be found in her et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 chiral chromatographic analysis for the separation of enantiomers of trimeprazine different polysaccharides stationary phases chiralart cellulose sc lux cellulose 1 lux cellulose 3 and lux amylose 2 were assayed see experimental section using an ammonium acetate ph 8 acetonitrile 40 60 0 1 diethylamine mobile phase only partial resolution of trimeprazine enantiomers were obtained using with chiralart cellulose sc and lux cellulose 1 stationary phases rs values of 0 5 and 0 3 respectively using these columns different chaotropic agents like potassium hexafluorophosphate and sodium perchlorate solutions were assayed the use of 100 mm potassium hexafluorophosphate and acetonitrile 60 40 v v mobile phases did not provide the separation of trimeprazine enantiomers in spite of the results reported by oguni and coworkers using a stationary phase similar to lux cellulose 1 oguni t al 1995 adequate resolution value rs 2 2 and retention times 13 6 and 14 8 min for the first e1 and the second e2 eluted enantiomers respectively for the enantiomers of trimeprazine were obtained using a lux cellulose 1 column as stationary phase and a 500 mm sodium perchlorate acetonitrile 60 40 v v mobile phase see fig 1 using these experimental conditions a concentration value of 1 mg l 1 of racemic trimeprazine 0 5 mg l 1 of each enantiomer was considered the limit of quantification peak areas below this concentration level were too low for quantification purposes i e they provide signal to noise ratio values below 10 for the present work the noise was measured from chromatograms of blank samples in the same regions as the peaks of trimeprazine enantiomers ribani et al 2007 the calibration curves of each enantiomer were obtained by injection of standard solutions containing racemic trimeprazine in the 1 30 mg l 1 range 5 concentration levels see section 2 2 table 1 shows the calibration statistics obtained for each enantiomer as can be observed for both enantiomers satisfactory results were obtained r2 0 99 3 2 enantioselective biodegradation results the biodegradability assays for the enantiomers of trimeprazine were performed in batch mode by duplicate at three concentration levels section 2 2 sample tubes containing trimeprazine and inoculum in msm medium were collected and analysed at different times 0 1 2 3 4 7 10 14 18 and 23 days similarly samples tubes containing trimeprazine in msm medium abiotic assays were analysed at the same times according to oecd oecd 1992 benzoic acid was used as reference substance to ensure that the microbial community in the test system is active a complete biodegradation of benzoic acid 20 mg l 1 was achieved in less than 48 h in the experimental conditions used indicating the adequacy of the inoculum and thus the validity of the trimeprazine assays fig 1 shows two chromatograms corresponding to t 0 and 18 days as can be observed the peak areas of the first e1 and second e2 eluting enantiomers of trimeprazine are lower in the second case this fact indicates that a degradation process has occurred moreover in the second chromatogram the peak area of e1 seems lower than those of e2 this suggests that an enantioselective biodegradation process has occurred fig 2 shows the concentration profiles s vs t experimental data two replicates of enantiomers at initial trimeprazine racemate concentration of 9 mg l 1 i e s0 4 5 mg l 1 as can be seen a similar concentration decay is observed during the first days for e1 and e2 enantiomers until day 4 however different profiles for the enantiomers are evident during the following days until the end of the experiment this behaviour could be attributed to a shift in the microbial communities during the biodegradation of trimeprazine biodegradation in communities of diverse microorganisms is a complex process combination of different effects kinetics especially when enantiomers are present competition enantiomerization etc where several degradation pathways could sequentially operate some being enantioselective and others not similar behaviour has been previously described for other compounds and it was attributed to time dependent changes in the composition of the microbial community evans et al 2017 anyway the enantioselective biodegradation mechanism is confirmed in fig 2 the results also indicate that the concentration profiles are stabilized at higher times so no further degradation is expected similar results not shown were obtained for the other concentration trimeprazine racemate concentrations assayed on the other hand abiotic assays indicate relatively low degradation in absence of inoculum 20 for the concentration levels studied these results indicates that abiotic elimination of the compound can be considered non significant iso 9888 1999 and the degradation estimated in biotic assays can be considered as biodegradation in order to control to the biomass growth the optical density od at 600 nm od600 profile was obtained the od600 can be considered proportional to the biomass growth shuler and kargi 2002 the od600 values in the range 0 1 were superimposed in fig 2 just for comparison purposes individual phases of the typical batch growth curve shuler and kargi 2002 can be perceived bearing in mind the experimental design used after an initial lag growth phase 2 days a short exponential phase 2 days is observed to continue with a stationary decline phase the last phase could explain the stabilization in the concentration profiles similar results were obtained with the other trimeprazine racemate concentrations interestingly when comparing both the concentration with od600 profiles it can be deduced that the stage of enantioselective biodegradation mainly coincides with the last growth phase more than with the exponential phase to obtain the enantiomeric fraction profiles of trimeprazine enantiomers the enantiomeric fraction ef was calculated for each incubation time according to bagnall et al 2012 6 e f s e 1 s e 1 s e 2 where s e1 and s e2 refers to the estimated concentration of enantiomers at a given incubation time e g s values in fig 2 fig 3 shows the mean ef values together with their standard deviation ef s for each time during the biodegradation process the horizontal line at ef 0 5 represents no enantioselectivity consistently with conclusions of fig 2 until day 4 ef values close to 0 5 are obtained differences could be attributed to the method imprecision only during the last growth phase ef values below 0 5 are observed and they are stabilized around 0 4 0 45 the results in fig 3 correspond to the intermediate concentration level 9 mg l 1 evaluated in this work comparable ef patterns were observed for the other two trimeprazine concentration levels studied in fact the grand mean of the ef values considering the five last incubation times where ef is almost constant were 0 44 0 03 0 43 0 04 and 0 43 0 05 for the low intermediate and high trimeprazine concentration levels studied respectively the error terms correspond to smean eq 3 this represents a clear evidence on a moderate enantioselectivity in the biodegradation process of trimeprazine with this activated sludge with a minimum ef i e maximum enantioselectivity around 0 44 independent of s0 further verification with sludges from other plants would be necessary to confirm if the results could be generalized 3 3 kinetic assessment of the data curve fitting in this work the model kinetic parameters the maximum specific growth rate vm and the half saturation constant for growth ks estimated from eq 5 were not taken into account since they cannot be considered accurate due to their linear correlation moreover errors can increase depending on the s0 ks ratio liu and zachara 2001 and ks is a priori unknown in addition when the degradation profiles do not reach zero as in this work an offset term in eq 5 has been proposed to model the entire profile her et al 2015 it is important to realize that this fact should alter the estimated parameters moreover it is possible that the experiment is conducted while the sludge is in an adaptation phase to the current conditions which could difficult the mathematical treatment of the data finally it is impossible to guarantee a unique kinetic behaviour during the entire process since communities of diverse microorganisms exist as stated before a deeper study on this matter is beyond the scope of this study the s vs t experimental data were adjusted to eq 5 including the offset term just with the purpose to obtain s vs t fitted curves that fit well the experimental data a suitable objective as stated in section 2 6 fig 2 shows the fitted models s vs t fitted curves solid lines from the s vs t fitted curves of two enantiomers derived using eq 5 an enantiomeric fraction versus time ef vs t fitted curve can be obtained considering eq 6 the ef vs t fitted curve is included in fig 3 despite the noticeable uncertainty of the ef data the fitted curve shows a reasonable agreement with the ef points the curves at the three concentration levels were similar ef vs t fitted curves provide a simple manner to estimate ef at different times or vice versa for instance the ef vs t fitted curves confirm the minimum ef value at 0 44 at the maximum t value to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that an ef vs t fitted curve to the experimental data has been reported similarly from the s vs t fitted curves curves for the percentage of biodegradation can also be estimated considering the expression bd 100 s0 s s0 fig 4 shows the biodegradation versus time bd vs t fitted curves obtained for each enantiomer at the three concentration levels evaluated for clarity experimental values are not included the time where the bd 50 line cross a biodegradation versus time fitted curve is an estimate of t1 2 bd vs t fitted curves provide a simple manner to estimate t1 2 values independently from the parameters as well as the bd estimates at different times or vice versa according to these plots at the highest concentration level curves 5 and 6 both enantiomers have similar half life 4 5 days being still negligible the enantioselectivity of the biodegradation for the intermediate concentration level curves 3 and 4 t1 2 differs between e1 and e2 4 5 and 6 days respectively with an incipient enantioselective biodegradation the most extreme situation occurs at the lowest concentration level curves 1 and 2 while e1 has t1 2 5 days e2 never reach the 50 of biodegradation t1 2 cannot be estimated the differences in the results obtained for the different substrate concentration levels could indicate that different mechanisms of biodegradation of trimeprazine enantiomers could exist on the other hand as can be observed in all cases maximum bd values increase with the concentration studied and as expected according to figs 1 and 2 e1 always reach higher bd values than e2 after the enantioselective biodegradation stage 3 4 precision study under intermediate precision conditions precision is often forgotten in biodegradation studies however in our opinion these data should be always provided for instance although beyond the aim of this work the imprecision on s data is probably the most critical variable affecting the quality of kinetic parameters estimation also it could serve to compare different biodegradation procedures it should be noted that both the analytical method and the biodegradation process as sources of uncertainty contribute to the overall precision the typical design and initial statistics for assessing method precision in such conditions is summarised in section 2 5 the xnrxns design is consistent with a unique concentration level however in the case of biodegradation data s changes with time due to the degradation process in these conditions only the sr statistic makes sense eq 1 for each enantiomer x2x10 matrices 2 replicates 10 days were built and processed via anova considering eq 1 the relative standard deviation expressed in percentage rsdr was then calculated according to eq 7 7 r s d r 100 m s r s 0 the rsdr results for each concentration level and enantiomer are shown in table 1 as can be seen the rsdr values range from 3 7 to 8 7 those values account the overall method imprecision including the biodegradation and the analytical processes this value habitually unreported is more relevant than the simply analytical method precision sometimes reported as part of a validation study the precision study can be extended to other variables different from concentrations in this work a precision study on ef which accounts for the degree of enantioselective biodegradation was performed considering the fact that the higher noise is concentrate in the last five times see fig 3 and that ef can be considered almost constant in this period the precision can be performed under intermediate precision conditions including the factor time section 2 5 thus the last ten ef data duplicate values for each concentration level studied was arranged into x2x5 matrices considering eqs 1 and 2 repeatability and between run standard deviations can be calculated as rsd according to eqs 8 and 9 8 r s d r 100 m s r e f 9 r s d r u n 100 m s r u n m s r n r e f where ef represents the grand mean of x calculated in section 3 2 as x contain the lowest ef values and imprecise data the worst case this procedure provides the maximum ef impression associated with the proposed method table 1 shows the precision estimates obtained to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a precision study including between days ef imprecision estimation have been reported table 1 reveals that rsdrun rsdr thus the use of only rsdr could provide a false idea of imprecision on the other hand the values of rsdr 5 and rsdrun 13 could be considered reasonably normal in the context of a biodegradation process they suggest that ef estimations can be satisfactorily used to evidence the magnitude of the enantioselectivity of the process 4 conclusions enantiomeric fractions and their standard deviation ef s at the three concentration levels of trimeprazine studied offer the first evidence of enantioselective biodegradation of trimeprazine the maximum enantioselectivity observed minimum ef value at three trimeprazine initial racemate concentration in the 5 20 range is 0 44 the biomass growth indirectly established by optical density at 600 nm od600 measurements suggests that the enantioselective biodegradation process is produced during the stationary decline stage more than in the exponential stage this is an interesting and novel outcome that deserves more attention we suggest future work with other substrates biological material to confirm this observation in order to establish if it s a non isolated fact the curve fitting method by means of michaelis menten like approach solved by the lambert w function approximation provides s vs t fitted curves that fit well the s t experimental data independently of the quality of the parameters furthermore they enable to obtain bd vs t and for the first time ef vs t fitted curves from bd vs t fitted curves a reasonable estimation of half life times can be obtained such estimation should be more secure than other based on estimated model parameters e g as usual when using first order kinetics which can be inaccurate the similarity between the ef vs t fitted curves at three concentration curves tested indicates that the enantioselectivity is independent from the concentration we suggest future work with other substrates biological material to confirm this observation the precision study on s repeatability conditions and for the first time on ef intermediate precision conditions suggests that moderate imprecision is observed future works focus on estimating the kinetic parameters via monod or simplified equations or also alternative models should take into account the s imprecision which affects the estimates accuracy on the other hand improvements in a biodegradation procedure could be controlled by precision studies by simply comparing the precision outputs the results obtained in this work correspond to ready biodegradability test obtained in a laboratory scale compatible with the oecd recommendations whose analyte and microorganisms amounts differ from those in the environment the moderate enantioselective biodegradation observed for trimeprazine can be considered as indicative of its potential degradation in most environments including biological sewage treatment plants according to oecd guidelines on the other hand a direct extrapolation of the results to the environmental or wastewater treatment scale should not be performed conflicts of interest none acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the spanish ministerio de economía y competitividad mineco and the european regional

19496,forward osmosis fo offers to be a very promising technology for the removal of trace organic compounds trocs from contaminated wastewater and with the recent developments in fo membranes the effect of both a higher water flux and reverse salt flux on the rejection of trocs needs to be explored in this study two novel thin film composite tfc membranes with greater water permeability and selectivity than the benchmark cellulose tri acetate cta membrane were compared at bench scale in terms of trocs permeability by probing the solute membrane interactions that dictate the transport of trocs through the two membranes in the absence and presence of a draw solution several conclusions were drawn firstly steric hindrance is the main trocs transport limiting mechanism through tfc membranes unless the negative membrane surface charge is significant in which case electrostatic interactions can dominate over steric hindrance secondly the increase in ionic strength induced by the draw solution in the vicinity of and perhaps inside the membrane seems to favour the rejection of trocs by shrinking the membrane pores or by shielding the negative surface charge lastly during fo operation solute concentration polarisation becomes detrimental when working at high water fluxes whereas the reverse solute flux has no direct impact on the transport of trocs through the membrane

when salt removal is required as well and reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf have already been implemented as tertiary treatment technologies taheran et al 2016 forward osmosis fo has been proposed as a novel promising membrane process in fo water is driven across a semi permeable membrane by an osmotic pressure gradient therefore the main advantage over nf and ro is that it operates at low or no hydraulic pressure cath et al 2006 given its low fouling propensity and high rejection of dissolved contaminants fo can be directly applied to complex solutions without extensive pre treatment in addition when fo is coupled with a draw solute recovery process fresh water can be produced advancing water reuse opportunities lutchmiah et al 2014 numerous studies focusing on the rejection of trocs by fo membranes have all indicated very high levels of rejection both in the bench and pilot scale alturki et al 2013 coday et al 2014 hancock et al 2011 since fo membranes resemble conceptually and chemically those employed in ro and nf the mechanisms responsible for the rejections of organic solutes were found to be very similar these depend mainly on the nature of the organic compound the physicochemical properties of the membrane and the feedwater characteristics and have been reported in the case of ro to be a combination of steric hindrance hydrophobic membrane affinity and electrostatic interactions bellona et al 2004 jin et al 2012 investigated the rejection of trocs by two different types of fo membranes cellulose triacetate cta and thin film composite tfc membranes the transport of trocs through the benchmark cta membranes was found to be mainly governed by steric effects with hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions playing minor roles for example charged trocs with a large hydrated radius have consistently shown lower permeability in cta membranes than neutral trocs d haese et al 2013 on the other hand tfc membranes have shown better overall rejections due to improved membrane physicochemical properties such as greater negative surface charge more hydrophobic character and smaller hydrated pore sizes xie et al 2014 a unique component of the fo process that has not been extensively researched in relation to trocs rejection is the draw solution it provides the osmotic pressure to drive water across the membrane but also leads to an unwanted reverse diffusion of draw solute into the feed termed reverse solute flux rsf achilli et al 2010 in most cta vs tfc experiments that were carried out at comparable water fluxes the effect of rsf was not taken into account so far the few studies aimed at identifying the role of the draw solution in the rejection of trocs have given contradicting results the draw solution has been found to simultaneously hinder and facilitate the permeation of trocs both directly and indirectly by altering the membrane physicochemical characteristics such as pore size surface charge and surface tension the first extensive investigations on the effect of draw solute on the permeation of trocs were conducted by xie et al 2012 they observed a higher permeation of trocs with mgso4 and glucose as the draw solute compared to nacl since mgso4 and glucose have significantly lower membrane diffusion coefficients than nacl the differences were attributed to a hindered forward diffusion of trocs by rsf this hindering effect was also observed in the rejection of boron by fo membranes forward boron flux was found to be inversely proportional to rsf by the draw solution kim et al 2012 in contrast d haese 2017 reported a decrease in the permeability of trocs through cta when using mgso4 instead of nacl as the draw solute he argued that if the fluxes were coupled large differences would be seen between the permeability of trocs in the presence of rsf and in the absence of rsf a phenomenon that was not observed in his study more recently kim et al 2017 also reported no direct correlation between the permeability of trocs through cta membranes and rsf and deduced that the difference in permeability obtained using different draw solutes was due to the different water fluxes generated by the draw solutions nonetheless a draw solute dependent rejection was reported for some of the predominantly smaller trocs d haese 2017 rather than flux coupling a hypothesis was formed based on the draw solute partitioning into the membrane and modulating the average effective membrane pore size partitioning of chloride and sodium ions into the membrane is thought to suppress the pore hydration layers increasing the average pore size and consequently allowing smaller compounds to pass through xie et al 2014 sulphate and magnesium ions on the other hand have large hydrated radii and partition into the membrane to a lower extent thus having a lower influence on the average pore size and the permeability of low molecular weight organic compounds another hypothesis that was proposed by d haese 2017 was an increase in the lewis basic nature of the membranes when draw solutes partition into it especially draw solutes containing sulphates since most organic compounds are also lewis basic the solute membrane affinity reduces due to decreased polar solute membrane interactions these draw solution induced changes on the physiochemical nature of tfc membranes have not been studied yet fo membranes are also known to have a negative surface charge particularly tfc membranes as they contain a larger proportion of negatively charged functional groups on the surface valladares linares et al 2011 hence numerous studies have reported a better rejection of anionic compounds due to an electrostatic repulsion by the membrane and a lower rejection of cationic compounds due to an opposite attraction force blandin et al 2016 jin et al 2012 however d haese 2017 reported a consistently higher rejection of cationic trocs by cta membranes other trends that he observed were a greater permeation of anionic trocs when using a draw solute with a more mobile anion e g mgcl2 and a greater permeation of cationic trocs when using a draw solute with a more mobile cation e g na2so4 d haese 2017 these results were explained mechanistically by donnan dialysis to maintain electro neutrality across the membrane the rapid migration of draw solute ions to the feed side is balanced by an equivalent migration of same charged trocs to the draw side kong et al 2014 also reported an ion exchange mechanism during fo operation with negatively charged organic compounds although donnan dialysis suitably describes the role of rsf on the permeability of charged trocs through cta membranes the impact of rsf on novel tfc membranes has yet to be explored the main objective of this study was to improve the current understanding of the influence of draw solute on the transport of trace organic compounds through tfc fo membranes two novel high water flux tfc membranes were initially characterised to determine their water and draw solute permeability as well as their selectivity consequently a series of trocs diffusion experiments were performed with both membranes to determine the permeability of trocs at increasing membrane ionic strength the first experiments of the series were carried out in the absence of any draw salt to isolate the underlying solute membrane interactions then by adding salt equally in both feed and draw solutions the effect of increasing the membrane ionic strength on the solute membrane interactions was evaluated lastly in order to see the direct effect of rsf on the permeation of trocs normal fo experiments with nacl in the draw solution were performed in all the experiments nine trocs covering a broad range of size hydrophobicity and electrical charge were chosen to probe the three main solute membrane interactions steric hindrance hydrophobic membrane affinity and electrostatic interactions 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and membranes two tfc flat sheet membranes and a cta membrane were used in this study since the name of the manufacturers cannot be divulged they are named tfc 1 tfc 2 and cta herein two inorganic salts were used as draw solutes nacl and mgcl₂ both obtained from scharlau spain a mix of 9 trocs with a range of physico chemical properties were selected to represent different charge molecular weight mw minimal projected surface area mpsa and hydrophobicity logd as listed in table s1 these compound properties were chosen to probe solute membrane interactions such as steric electrostatic and hydrophobic affinity the trocs were obtained from sigma aldrich at 97 purity and above hplc grade acetonitrile was used to prepare stock solutions of each compound at a concentration of 500 mg l which were stored at 4 c employing such organic stock solutions helps to accurately dissolve trocs that are otherwise difficult to dissolve 2 2 system set up all the experiments in this study were performed with a bench scale cross flow membrane cell unit with symmetric draw and feed channels 16 4 4 4 0 15 cm and an effective membrane area of 72 cm2 both flow channels were fitted with mesh spacers the cell unit was connected to a feed and a draw reservoir from which feed and draw solutions were re circulated with a peristaltic pump watson marlow at a flow rate of 0 3 l min in order to maintain a cross flow velocity cfv of 7 6 cm s this cross flow velocity was chosen to reduce the effect of external concentration polarisation whilst avoiding pressure drops through the channels although the membrane cells were operated in counter current mode the transmembrane pressure that can be introduced in this mode was small in comparison with the osmotic pressures used in this study a scheme of the fo set up is given in fig s1 the changing volume of the feed solution was recorded by data logging the weight of the feed reservoir water flux through the membrane was then determined from the permeated volume of water using the following equation 1 j w v f f v f 0 a m t where v f f is the final volume of the feed reservoir v f 0 is the initial volume of the feed reservoir a m is the effective membrane area and t is the duration of each stage conductivity meters connected to a programmable logic controller plc were placed in both reservoirs to continuously measure conductivity conductivity was converted to concentration by means of calibration curves the concentrations of draw solute in the feed and draw solutions were then used to measure the reverse salt flux with the following mass balance equation 2 j rsf c f f v f 0 j w a m t c f 0 v f 0 a m t where c f f is the final feed solution concentration of salt c f 0 is the initial feed solution concentration of salt v f 0 is the initial volume of the feed reservoir j w is the transmembrane water flux a m is the effective membrane area and t is the duration of each stage the experimental setup was equipped with a draw solution re concentration system which consisted in a pump controlled by the plc that re circulated draw solution through a funnel filled with solid draw solute and back into the draw reservoir if the conductivity of the draw solution decreased below a set point the pump was automatically activated to restore the original concentration 2 3 membrane characterisation all the membranes used in this study tfc 1 tfc 2 and the conventional cta membrane are asymmetric and the configuration used throughout the study was with the active layer facing the feed solution the membranes were characterised by the fo only method developed by tiraferri et al 2013 which enables to determine the intrinsic parameters of the membranes water permeability coefficient a salt permeability coefficient b and the structural parameter s without any applied pressure the method was the following the draw solution salt concentration was increased step wise in a number ni of fo stages each lasting 15 min to obtain a total of ni experimental water fluxes j w i e x p and ni experimental reverse salt fluxes j s i e x p the experimentally obtained data was then fitted to the current solution diffusion model by minimizing the global error the global error e is defined as the non dimensional sum of the offsets in the water and salt fluxes 3 e e w e s i 1 n j w i exp j w i calc j w exp n 2 i 1 n j s i exp j s i calc j s exp n 2 where n is the number of stages exp is experimental flux calc is the calculated flux and j e x p n is the mean experimental water or salt flux over the ni fo stages the minimization algorithm was implemented using solver microsoft excel with the following input parameters average draw and feed solution salt concentrations in each stage obtained from the conductivity of the reservoirs salt diffusion coefficient of the bulk draw solution obtained from literature experimental water and salt fluxes calculated using equations 1 and 2 and the initial guesses for the parameters to be determined 2 4 chemical analysis an hplc uv agilent 1200 instrument fitted with a c18 column microsorb mv 100 5 250 4 6 mm and working temperature of 30 c was used to determine the concentrations of the trocs in the samples this instrument required no extensive pre treatment of the samples which were injected directly with a volume of 100 μg l in order to obtain a good separation of the compound elution peaks the selected trocs were divided into three groups based on their retention time and physico chemical properties table s2 each group was analysed with a different isocratic elution method which consisted in a specific mobile phase mixture and an eluent flow rate of 1 ml min less hydrophobic compounds were analysed with a higher aqueous to organic h2o ch3cn mobile phase mixture whereas more hydrophobic compounds with a lower h2o ch3cn ratio to ensure no overlapping of elution peaks the peaks were quantified by calculating the peak area and the concentration of each compound was then obtained from a calibration curve the lower limit of quantification for all trocs was approximately 20 μg l 2 5 experimental plan 2 5 1 membrane saturation adsorption of the organic compounds onto the membrane is the greatest limitation of this study it is considered the first step in the transport of organic compounds and can lead to an underestimation of the permeability kimura et al 2003 therefore determining trocs permeability coefficients once the membrane is saturated with the target compounds is recommended plakas and karabelas 2012 in order to achieve membrane saturation the pristine membrane coupons were exposed to the 9 organic compounds for 24 h by spiking the feed and draw solutions with 1 mg l of the mix of all 9 trocs then prior to each individual experiment the system was washed for 1 h with di water to remove any residual trocs from the system tubing and the membrane samples of the feed and draw solutions taken after the washing procedure repeatedly showed insignificant concentrations of trocs certifying that washing protocol was effective 2 5 2 trocs diffusion experiments in di water d di water the first part of the study consisted in determining the diffusion of trocs through the two novel tfc membranes in the absence of a draw solute these experiments termed d di water were carried out to identify the solute membrane interactions that are involved in the diffusive transport of the organic solutes as described in the chemical analysis section in order to analyse the samples efficiently the selected trocs were spiked in the feed solution in three different groups at a concentration of 1 mg l therefore for each experiment three 24 h runs were carried out each with a different group of trocs and with 1 l of di water in both feed and draw compartments a total of three samples were taken for each run two from the feed solution at time 0 and time 24 h and one from the draw solution at time 24 h the draw solution was sampled only at the end because initial concentrations of trocs in the draw solution were expected to be insignificant all samples were frozen and subsequently analysed by hplc uv the absence of a water flux and reverse salt flux during these tests was confirmed by the negligible change in feed solution weight and conductivity in this study instead of evaluating the rejection of the trocs by the membranes the permeability of trocs was used as the value for comparison as it includes both diffusive and convective transport kim et al 2007a in the absence of a water flux the permeability describes the diffusive transport of solutes whilst in the presence of a water flux the permeability describes both diffusive and convective transport of solutes to calculate the membrane permeability coefficient of the trocs btrocs from the diffusion experiments the following pseudo state derivation of fick s law was applied as described by kim et al 2007a b 4 b trocs v f v d v f v d 1 a m t ln c f 0 c d 0 c f t c d t where v f is the feed solution volume v d draw solution volume a m is the membrane surface area t is time c f 0 is the initial feed solution concentration of

diffusion experiments at increasing ionic strength d 0 1m nacl d 0 5m nacl d 0 5m mgcl2 the diffusion experiments in di water were complemented with diffusion experiments at higher membrane ionic strengths also in the absence of water and reverse salt fluxes these were aimed at determining the impact of the draw salt on the solute membrane interactions involved in the diffusive transport of trocs higher membrane ionic strengths were achieved by increasing the concentration of nacl in both feed and draw solutions initially to 0 1m and then to 0 5m additionally 0 5m mgcl2 was also tested since the mg2 ion has a double positive charge a higher ionic strength and a larger hydrated size therefore affecting membrane surface charge and diffusivity to a greater extent since the salt concentrations were maintained equal on both the feed and the draw solutions no osmotic pressure difference developed and the water flux and reverse solute flux were kept at a minimum these experiments were performed in a similar way to the d di water experiments they were all carried out in three runs each with a different group of trocs in the feed solution and lasting 24 h the membrane permeability coefficients btrocs were determined with equation 4 2 5 4 fo filtration experiments fo 0 1m nacl fo 0 07m nacl the final set of experiments determined the permeability of trocs through the two tfc membranes during fo operation in the presence of a forward water flux and reverse salt flux by comparing the permeability of trocs during fo operation to the diffusion experiments the effect of both water and reverse salt fluxes on the transport of trocs could be analysed in order to maintain a transmembrane water flux of approximately 10 l m 2 h 1 throughout the experiments the draw solution was made up of 0 1m nacl and 0 07m nacl for tfc 1 and tfc 2 respectively these concentrations were determined experimentally in both cases the feed solution consisted of 3 l di water spiked with each of the three groups of trocs and re circulated for 24 h to avoid dilution of the draw solution by the permeation of water and maintain the same osmotic driving force the automatic re concentration system was employed water and reverse salt fluxes during the experiments were determined using equations 1 and 2 whereas the permeability coefficients btrocs were calculated with the following expression adapted from the solution diffusion model wijmans and baker 1995 5 b trocs j w c p t c f t c p t where j w is the water flux c f t is the feed solution concentration of trocs at time t and c p t is the permeate concentration of trocs at time t which can be obtained with the following mass transfer equation 6 c p t v d t c d t v d 0 c d 0 j w a m t where v d t is the volume of draw solution at time t and v d 0 is the volume of draw solution at time 0 h 2 6 determining solute membrane interactions in order to identify the solute membrane interactions that dictate the different transport of trocs through the two membranes relationships between the permeability coefficients and the properties of the selected trocs e g molecular weight mw minimal projected surface area mpsa hydrophobicity logd and electrical charge were determined by means of the pearson r and spearman s rank ρ correlation whilst the pearson coefficient is used to identify linear correlations the spearman s rank identifies monotonic linear or non linear relationships a relationship was confirmed when the correlations reached values 0 75 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterisation the two selected membranes tfc 1 and tfc 2 and the benchmark cta membrane were characterised according to tiraferri s 2013 fo only method water fluxes and reverse salt fluxes were determined at increasing draw solution nacl concentrations and then the intrinsic water permeability draw solute permeability and the structural parameter of each membrane were determined these were compared to each other and the values obtained from literature according to table 1 both tfc membranes were found to have much higher water a and draw solute b permeability coefficients than the cta membrane this difference arises from the polymer structure of the active layer al in cta membranes the al consists of unlinked polymer chains with a free volume fraction of around 4 5 ong et al 2013 whereas in tfc membranes the al is not only thinner but it is also made up of a cross linked insoluble polyamide network which has a larger free volume fraction of 7 9 and results in a higher diffusivity of solvent and solutes li and chung 2013 only one previous study has reported permeability and structural parameter values of high flux tfc membranes these were found to be 2 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for a 0 43 0 54 l m 2 h 1 for b and 276 344 μm for s compared to these values the water and draw solute permeability coefficients of the tested tfc membranes are greater whereas the structural parameter is lower this variability can either be attributed to the different characterisation method employed in their study which uses pressurised conditions or to the novelty of the membrane type using 0 1m nacl as the draw solution produced exceptionally high average water fluxes of 9 0 and 16 5 lmh for tfc 1 and tfc 2 respectively although the difference between the water permeability coefficients of tfc 1 and tfc 2 is almost three fold the difference in water flux is only double because tfc 2 suffers from greater internal concentration polarisation because of its higher transmembrane flux the average reverse salt fluxes at a draw solution concentration of 0 1m nacl were also relatively high for both membranes 29 mmol m2h and 55 mmol m2h for tfc 1 and tfc 2 respectively this water flux reverse salt flux trade off is a limiting factor in the development of thinner and more porous tfc membranes wei et al 2011 as an efficient parameter to evaluate fo performance the water draw salt selectivity a b ratio of both tfc membranes was calculated the greater selectivity value of tfc 2 compared to tfc 1 suggests that the former would be favourable in applications that require a high water production whereas the lower permeability of draw salt through tfc 1 suggests that it has a lower free volume fraction and therefore acts as a stronger barrier to solutes 3 2 trocs diffusion experiments in di water d di water in this section the permeability coefficients of the selected trocs through the two tfc membranes were determined from diffusion tests in the absence of a draw solute the results illustrated in fig 1 do not indicate an overall higher permeability of trocs through any of the two membranes but rather a large disparity among the different trocs these differences were explored by calculating the pearson s and spearman s rank correlations between the permeability coefficients and the properties of the organic compounds table 2 the pearson coefficient for the tfc 1 membrane during the d di water test revealed a negative linear correlation between the dimensional parameters of the trocs mw and mpsa and their permeability suggesting that solute size is a strong determinant in solute transport through tfc 1 this agrees with previous studies on earlier tfc membranes which have identified the average hydrated pore size as a dominant transport limiting parameter blandin et al 2016 xie et al 2014 on the other hand there seemed to be no correlation between the permeability of trocs and their hydrophobicity or charge indicating that hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between compounds and the membrane were insignificant since the membrane was saturated with the trocs prior to the experiments adsorption of trocs to the membrane surface was probably avoided during the diffusion tests in contrast the tfc 2 membrane followed a strong charge based trend that overshadowed steric effects as indicated by the strong relationship between permeability and charge r of 0 91 and ρ of 0 97 negatively charged compounds resulted in very low permeability coefficients 0 3 0 6 10 8 m s whereas positively charged compounds although significantly bulkier than the neutral compounds permeated to a much greater extent 114 179 10 8 m s based on the findings on earlier tfc membranes the strong electrostatic effects observed for tfc 2 are caused by a greater negative membrane surface charge which generates an electrostatic repulsion towards anionic compounds and an opposite electrostatic attraction towards cationic compounds previously reported as charge concentration polarisation verliefde et al 2008 neutral compounds on the other hand were not affected by these electrostatic interactions and their permeability was mainly governed by steric hindrance and hydrophobic affinity to the membrane for example acetaminophen s small molecular size and low logd value resulted in a higher permeability coefficient compared to other neutral and charged compounds 3 3 trocs diffusion experiments at increasing ionic strength d 0 1m nacl d 0 5m nacl d 0 5m mgcl2 after the diffusion experiments without the presence of salts the permeability coefficients of trocs were determined at increasing ionic strength at concentrations of 0 1m nacl 0 5m nacl and 0 5m mgcl2 in both feed and draw solutions to investigate solute membrane interactions under these changed conditions table s3 for cta membranes it has been reported that an increase in membrane ionic strength encourages the permeation of smaller trocs due to de swelling of the membrane a reduction of the membrane pore hydration layer nghiem et al 2006 however the opposite was observed for the tfc 1 membrane at concentrations of 0 1m and 0 5m nacl the permeability of the majority of trocs reduced fig 2 a and according to the pearson and spearman s coefficients size became a stronger determinant for their transport table 2 it has been previously shown that for composite membranes used in ro and nf filtration processes increasing the membrane ionic strength shrinks the membrane pores resulting in a lower permeability of organic compounds bellona et al 2004 braghetta et al 1997 hence this lowering of the average pore sizes at increased ionic strength could partly explain the reduced permeability of some of the trocs through the tfc 1 membrane with a concentration of 0 5m mgcl2 the lower partitioning of mg2 ions into the membrane due to a larger hydrated radius was expected to have a weaker shrinking effect therefore the trocs permeability coefficients when using 0 5m mgcl2 were expected to lie between those obtained from the d di water and d 0 5m nacl experiments whereas this was the case for negatively charged compounds the permeability of positively charged trocs and sulfamethoxazole did not follow these trends as described in the section 3 2 the diffusion of trocs through the tfc 2 membrane was strongly influenced by electrostatic interactions with the membrane surface the importance of these electrostatic interactions on the transport of trocs through tfc 2 seemed to diminish at increasing membrane ionic strength as shown in fig 2b permeability of negatively charged compounds increased whereas the permeability of positive compounds decreased it has been found that partitioning of salts into composite membranes shields and thus reduces the effective membrane surface charge significantly nghiem et al 2006 hence it explains the reduced electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged compounds and reduced electrostatic attraction of positive compounds when increasing ionic strength in addition the pearson s coefficients demonstrated a stronger correlation between solute size and permeability suggesting that steric hindrance becomes the more dominant transport limiting mechanism table 2 compared to 0 5m nacl ionic strength using 0 5m mgcl2 led to an even greater permeability of negatively charged trocs and a lower permeability of positively charged trocs except trimethoprim it is known that the double charge of mg2 ions shields the membrane negative surface charge to a greater extent childress and elimelech 1996 resulting in a further weakening of electrostatic interactions between the membrane and the charged solutes neutral compounds on the other hand had similar permeability coefficients to when 0 5m nacl was used because the membrane surface charge does not affect their transport 3 4 fo filtration experiments fo 0 1m nacl fo 0 07m nacl the final set of experiments consisted in determining the permeability coefficients of the selected trocs in the presence of a water flux and a reverse salt flux using a draw solution of 0 1m and 0 07m nacl for tfc 1 and tfc 2 respectively enabled to generate a similar water flux across both membranes the results from these experiments were then compared to the diffusion tests d di water and d 0 1m nacl to draw conclusions on the effect of both water and reverse salt flux on the permeability of trocs table s3 in comparison to the d 0 1m nacl experiments the permeability of most trocs through tfc 1 increased during fo operation jw of 8 10lmh and a rsf of 30 mmol m 2h 1 and according to the correlations in table 2 the importance of solute size on transport reduced despite using high cross flow velocities 7 6 cm s to avoid external solute concentration polarisation the indiscriminate increase in permeability of most compounds observed for tfc 1 could be attributed to this convectional transport induced by the water flux fig 3 a the presence of solute concentration polarisation means that the effect of rsf on solute transport could not be isolated but should be minor in comparison to the differences observed in solute permeability considering that rsf for tfc 1 at a draw solution concentration of 0 1m was only 29 mmol m2h complementary experiments at higher cross flow velocities and higher rsf would clarify the effect of rsf on forward trocs diffusion hindered forward transport of solutes by rsf would be marked by a reduction in permeability of all trocs particularly neutral compounds whereas donnan dialysis would be observed by an increase in permeability of anionic solutes due to a favourable exchange with chloride anions and an opposite effect for cationic compounds unlike with the tfc 1 membrane the permeability of trocs during the fo experiments with tfc 2 jw of 11 13 lmh and a rsf of 50 mmol m 2h 1 were not affected by the convective transport of the water flux as can be seen in fig 3b the permeability coefficients of neutral compounds were similar to those obtained during the diffusion test with 0 1m nacl whilst the permeability of positively charged trocs increased and the permeability of negatively charged trocs decreased it is clear that electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged membrane and the charged solutes were predominant again in the fo experiments an observation that is further supported by the pearson and spearman s rank correlations table 2 considering that during the fo experiment the maximum nacl concentration that established in the feed side due to rsf was approximately 0 005m nacl the shielding effect of the draw solute on the membrane surface charge was likely to be much weaker than in the d 0 1m nacl experiments this suggests that rsf could have an impact on the permeability of trocs by shielding the tfc 2 membrane surface charge only when a high concentration of draw solution is employed for example 0 5m a graphical summary of the transport mechanisms in the different experiments of sections discussed in section 3 2 3 4 has been provided in fig 4 4 conclusions compared to cta membranes both of the novel tfc membranes tested are superior in terms of water permeability as well as water draw solute selectivity between the two selected membranes tfc 2 produces higher water fluxes but is offset by a higher permeability of solutes despite the fact that both tfc membranes have a similar structure and membrane chemistry type the permeability of trocs for the two membranes differed significantly through tfc 1 the transport of trocs was governed by steric factors in a similar way to cta membranes partitioning of draw solute into tfc 1 resulted in smaller membrane pore sizes due to a de swelling effect thus lowering the permeability of both neutral and charged trocs in the presence of a water flux and rsf trocs permeated more due to convective transport to the membrane surface but were unaffected by rsf on the other hand tfc 2 s greater negative surface charge was reflected as strong electrostatic interactions between trocs and the membrane which dictated the transport of trocs through tfc 2 a shielding effect by draw solute partitioning into the membrane decreased these electrostatic interactions leading to steric and hydrophobic transport mechanisms to prevail in an fo process this shielding is expected to occur only at high draw solution concentrations otherwise the electrostatic interactions between the organic solutes and the membrane surface are largely unaffected by rsf acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the support from the european regional development fund feder under the catalan feder operative program 2007 2013 and mineco through the da3a

19496,forward osmosis fo offers to be a very promising technology for the removal of trace organic compounds trocs from contaminated wastewater and with the recent developments in fo membranes the effect of both a higher water flux and reverse salt flux on the rejection of trocs needs to be explored in this study two novel thin film composite tfc membranes with greater water permeability and selectivity than the benchmark cellulose tri acetate cta membrane were compared at bench scale in terms of trocs permeability by probing the solute membrane interactions that dictate the transport of trocs through the two membranes in the absence and presence of a draw solution several conclusions were drawn firstly steric hindrance is the main trocs transport limiting mechanism through tfc membranes unless the negative membrane surface charge is significant in which case electrostatic interactions can dominate over steric hindrance secondly the increase in ionic strength induced by the draw solution in the vicinity of and perhaps inside the membrane seems to favour the rejection of trocs by shrinking the membrane pores or by shielding the negative surface charge lastly during fo operation solute concentration polarisation becomes detrimental when working at high water fluxes whereas the reverse solute flux has no direct impact on the transport of trocs through the membrane

conceptually and chemically those employed in ro and nf the mechanisms responsible for the rejections of organic solutes were found to be very similar these depend mainly on the nature of the organic compound the physicochemical properties of the membrane and the feedwater characteristics and have been reported in the case of ro to be a combination of steric hindrance hydrophobic membrane affinity and electrostatic interactions bellona et al 2004 jin et al 2012 investigated the rejection of trocs by two different types of fo membranes cellulose triacetate cta and thin film composite tfc membranes the transport of trocs through the benchmark cta membranes was found to be mainly governed by steric effects with hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions playing minor roles for example charged trocs with a large hydrated radius have consistently shown lower permeability in cta membranes than neutral trocs d haese et al 2013 on the other hand tfc membranes have shown better overall rejections due to improved membrane physicochemical properties such as greater negative surface charge more hydrophobic character and smaller hydrated pore sizes xie et al 2014 a unique component of the fo process that has not been extensively researched in relation to trocs rejection is the draw solution it provides the osmotic pressure to drive water across the membrane but also leads to an unwanted reverse diffusion of draw solute into the feed termed reverse solute flux rsf achilli et al 2010 in most cta vs tfc experiments that were carried out at comparable water fluxes the effect of rsf was not taken into account so far the few studies aimed at identifying the role of the draw solution in the rejection of trocs have given contradicting results the draw solution has been found to simultaneously hinder and facilitate the permeation of trocs both directly and indirectly by altering the membrane physicochemical characteristics such as pore size surface charge and surface tension the first extensive investigations on the effect of draw solute on the permeation of trocs were conducted by xie et al 2012 they observed a higher permeation of trocs with mgso4 and glucose as the draw solute compared to nacl since mgso4 and glucose have significantly lower membrane diffusion coefficients than nacl the differences were attributed to a hindered forward diffusion of trocs by rsf this hindering effect was also observed in the rejection of boron by fo membranes forward boron flux was found to be inversely proportional to rsf by the draw solution kim et al 2012 in contrast d haese 2017 reported a decrease in the permeability of trocs through cta when using mgso4 instead of nacl as the draw solute he argued that if the fluxes were coupled large differences would be seen between the permeability of trocs in the presence of rsf and in the absence of rsf a phenomenon that was not observed in his study more recently kim et al 2017 also reported no direct correlation between the permeability of trocs through cta membranes and rsf and deduced that the difference in permeability obtained using different draw solutes was due to the different water fluxes generated by the draw solutions nonetheless a draw solute dependent rejection was reported for some of the predominantly smaller trocs d haese 2017 rather than flux coupling a hypothesis was formed based on the draw solute partitioning into the membrane and modulating the average effective membrane pore size partitioning of chloride and sodium ions into the membrane is thought to suppress the pore hydration layers increasing the average pore size and consequently allowing smaller compounds to pass through xie et al 2014 sulphate and magnesium ions on the other hand have large hydrated radii and partition into the membrane to a lower extent thus having a lower influence on the average pore size and the permeability of low molecular weight organic compounds another hypothesis that was proposed by d haese 2017 was an increase in the lewis basic nature of the membranes when draw solutes partition into it especially draw solutes containing sulphates since most organic compounds are also lewis basic the solute membrane affinity reduces due to decreased polar solute membrane interactions these draw solution induced changes on the physiochemical nature of tfc membranes have not been studied yet fo membranes are also known to have a negative surface charge particularly tfc membranes as they contain a larger proportion of negatively charged functional groups on the surface valladares linares et al 2011 hence numerous studies have reported a better rejection of anionic compounds due to an electrostatic repulsion by the membrane and a lower rejection of cationic compounds due to an opposite attraction force blandin et al 2016 jin et al 2012 however d haese 2017 reported a consistently higher rejection of cationic trocs by cta membranes other trends that he observed were a greater permeation of anionic trocs when using a draw solute with a more mobile anion e g mgcl2 and a greater permeation of cationic trocs when using a draw solute with a more mobile cation e g na2so4 d haese 2017 these results were explained mechanistically by donnan dialysis to maintain electro neutrality across the membrane the rapid migration of draw solute ions to the feed side is balanced by an equivalent migration of same charged trocs to the draw side kong et al 2014 also reported an ion exchange mechanism during fo operation with negatively charged organic compounds although donnan dialysis suitably describes the role of rsf on the permeability of charged trocs through cta membranes the impact of rsf on novel tfc membranes has yet to be explored the main objective of this study was to improve the current understanding of the influence of draw solute on the transport of trace organic compounds through tfc fo membranes two novel high water flux tfc membranes were initially characterised to determine their water and draw solute permeability as well as their selectivity consequently a series of trocs diffusion experiments were performed with both membranes to determine the permeability of trocs at increasing membrane ionic strength the first experiments of the series were carried out in the absence of any draw salt to isolate the underlying solute membrane interactions then by adding salt equally in both feed and draw solutions the effect of increasing the membrane ionic strength on the solute membrane interactions was evaluated lastly in order to see the direct effect of rsf on the permeation of trocs normal fo experiments with nacl in the draw solution were performed in all the experiments nine trocs covering a broad range of size hydrophobicity and electrical charge were chosen to probe the three main solute membrane interactions steric hindrance hydrophobic membrane affinity and electrostatic interactions 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and membranes two tfc flat sheet membranes and a cta membrane were used in this study since the name of the manufacturers cannot be divulged they are named tfc 1 tfc 2 and cta herein two inorganic salts were used as draw solutes nacl and mgcl₂ both obtained from scharlau spain a mix of 9 trocs with a range of physico chemical properties were selected to represent different charge molecular weight mw minimal projected surface area mpsa and hydrophobicity logd as listed in table s1 these compound properties were chosen to probe solute membrane interactions such as steric electrostatic and hydrophobic affinity the trocs were obtained from sigma aldrich at 97 purity and above hplc grade acetonitrile was used to prepare stock solutions of each compound at a concentration of 500 mg l which were stored at 4 c employing such organic stock solutions helps to accurately dissolve trocs that are otherwise difficult to dissolve 2 2 system set up all the experiments in this study were performed with a bench scale cross flow membrane cell unit with symmetric draw and feed channels 16 4 4 4 0 15 cm and an effective membrane area of 72 cm2 both flow channels were fitted with mesh spacers the cell unit was connected to a feed and a draw reservoir from which feed and draw solutions were re circulated with a peristaltic pump watson marlow at a flow rate of 0 3 l min in order to maintain a cross flow velocity cfv of 7 6 cm s this cross flow velocity was chosen to reduce the effect of external concentration polarisation whilst avoiding pressure drops through the channels although the membrane cells were operated in counter current mode the transmembrane pressure that can be introduced in this mode was small in comparison with the osmotic pressures used in this study a scheme of the fo set up is given in fig s1 the changing volume of the feed solution was recorded by data logging the weight of the feed reservoir water flux through the membrane was then determined from the permeated volume of water using the following equation 1 j w v f f v f 0 a m t where v f f is the final volume of the feed reservoir v f 0 is the initial volume of the feed reservoir a m is the effective membrane area and t is the duration of each stage conductivity meters connected to a programmable logic controller plc were placed in both reservoirs to continuously measure conductivity conductivity was converted to concentration by means of calibration curves the concentrations of draw solute in the feed and draw solutions were then used to measure the reverse salt flux with the following mass balance equation 2 j rsf c f f v f 0 j w a m t c f 0 v f 0 a m t where c f f is the final feed solution concentration of salt c f 0 is the initial feed solution concentration of salt v f 0 is the initial volume of the feed reservoir j w is the transmembrane water flux a m is the effective membrane area and t is the duration of each stage the experimental setup was equipped with a draw solution re concentration system which consisted in a pump controlled by the plc that re circulated draw solution through a funnel filled with solid draw solute and back into the draw reservoir if the conductivity of the draw solution decreased below a set point the pump was automatically activated to restore the original concentration 2 3 membrane characterisation all the membranes used in this study tfc 1 tfc 2 and the conventional cta membrane are asymmetric and the configuration used throughout the study was with the active layer facing the feed solution the membranes were characterised by the fo only method developed by tiraferri et al 2013 which enables to determine the intrinsic parameters of the membranes water permeability coefficient a salt permeability coefficient b and the structural parameter s without any applied pressure the method was the following the draw solution salt concentration was increased step wise in a number ni of fo stages each lasting 15 min to obtain a total of ni experimental water fluxes j w i e x p and ni experimental reverse salt fluxes j s i e x p the experimentally obtained data was then fitted to the current solution diffusion model by minimizing the global error the global error e is defined as the non dimensional sum of the offsets in the water and salt fluxes 3 e e w e s i 1 n j w i exp j w i calc j w exp n 2 i 1 n j s i exp j s i calc j s exp n 2 where n is the number of stages exp is experimental flux calc is the calculated flux and j e x p n is the mean experimental water or salt flux over the ni fo stages the minimization algorithm was implemented using solver microsoft excel with the following input parameters average draw and feed solution salt concentrations in each stage obtained from the conductivity of the reservoirs salt diffusion coefficient of the bulk draw solution obtained from literature experimental water and salt fluxes calculated using equations 1 and 2 and the initial guesses for the parameters to be determined 2 4 chemical analysis an hplc uv agilent 1200 instrument fitted with a c18 column microsorb mv 100 5 250 4 6 mm and working temperature of 30 c was used to determine the concentrations of the trocs in the samples this instrument required no extensive pre treatment of the samples which were injected directly with a volume of 100 μg l in order to obtain a good separation of the compound elution peaks the selected trocs were divided into three groups based on their retention time and physico chemical properties table s2 each group was analysed with a different isocratic elution method which consisted in a specific mobile phase mixture and an eluent flow rate of 1 ml min less hydrophobic compounds were analysed with a higher aqueous to organic h2o ch3cn mobile phase mixture whereas more hydrophobic compounds with a lower h2o ch3cn ratio to ensure no overlapping of elution peaks the peaks were quantified by calculating the peak area and the concentration of each compound was then obtained from a calibration curve the lower limit of quantification for all trocs was approximately 20 μg l 2 5 experimental plan 2 5 1 membrane saturation adsorption of the organic compounds onto the membrane is the greatest limitation of this study it is considered the first step in the transport of organic compounds and can lead to an underestimation of the permeability kimura et al 2003 therefore determining trocs permeability coefficients once the membrane is saturated with the target compounds is recommended plakas and karabelas 2012 in order to achieve membrane saturation the pristine membrane coupons were exposed to the 9 organic compounds for 24 h by spiking the feed and draw solutions with 1 mg l of the mix of all 9 trocs then prior to each individual experiment the system was washed for 1 h with di water to remove any residual trocs from the system tubing and the membrane samples of the feed and draw solutions taken after the washing procedure repeatedly showed insignificant concentrations of trocs certifying that washing protocol was effective 2 5 2 trocs diffusion experiments in di water d di water the first part of the study consisted in determining the diffusion of trocs through the two novel tfc membranes in the absence of a draw solute these experiments termed d di water were carried out to identify the solute membrane interactions that are involved in the diffusive transport of the organic solutes as described in the chemical analysis section in order to analyse the samples efficiently the selected trocs were spiked in the feed solution in three different groups at a concentration of 1 mg l therefore for each experiment three 24 h runs were carried out each with a different group of trocs and with 1 l of di water in both feed and draw compartments a total of three samples were taken for each run two from the feed solution at time 0 and time 24 h and one from the draw solution at time 24 h the draw solution was sampled only at the end because initial concentrations of trocs in the draw solution were expected to be insignificant all samples were frozen and subsequently analysed by hplc uv the absence of a water flux and reverse salt flux during these tests was confirmed by the negligible change in feed solution weight and conductivity in this study instead of evaluating the rejection of the trocs by the membranes the permeability of trocs was used as the value for comparison as it includes both diffusive and convective transport kim et al 2007a in the absence of a water flux the permeability describes the diffusive transport of solutes whilst in the presence of a water flux the permeability describes both diffusive and convective transport of solutes to calculate the membrane permeability coefficient of the trocs btrocs from the diffusion experiments the following pseudo state derivation of fick s law was applied as described by kim et al 2007a b 4 b trocs v f v d v f v d 1 a m t ln c f 0 c d 0 c f t c d t where v f is the feed solution volume v d draw solution volume a m is the membrane surface area t is time c f 0 is the initial feed solution concentration of trocs c d 0 is the initial draw solution concentration of trocs c f t is the feed solution concentration of trocs at time t and c d t is the draw solution concentration of trocs at time t 2 5 3 trocs diffusion experiments at increasing ionic strength d 0 1m nacl d 0 5m nacl d 0 5m mgcl2 the diffusion experiments in di water were complemented with diffusion experiments at higher membrane ionic strengths also in the absence of water and reverse salt fluxes these were aimed at determining the impact of the draw salt on the solute membrane interactions involved in the diffusive transport of trocs higher membrane ionic strengths were achieved by increasing the concentration of nacl in both feed and draw solutions initially to 0 1m and then to 0 5m additionally 0 5m mgcl2 was also tested since the mg2 ion has a double positive charge a higher ionic strength and a larger hydrated size therefore affecting membrane surface charge and diffusivity to a greater extent since the salt concentrations were maintained equal on both the feed and the draw solutions no osmotic pressure difference developed and the water flux and reverse solute flux were kept at a minimum these experiments were performed in a similar way to the d di water experiments they were all carried out in three runs each with a different group of trocs in the feed solution and lasting 24 h the membrane permeability coefficients btrocs were determined with equation 4 2 5 4 fo filtration experiments fo 0 1m nacl fo 0 07m nacl the final set of experiments determined the permeability of trocs through the two tfc membranes during fo operation in the presence of a forward water flux and reverse salt flux by comparing the permeability of trocs during fo operation to the diffusion experiments the effect of both water and reverse salt fluxes on the transport of trocs could be analysed in order to maintain a transmembrane water flux of approximately 10 l m 2 h 1 throughout the experiments the draw solution was made up of 0 1m nacl and 0 07m nacl for tfc 1 and tfc 2 respectively these concentrations were determined experimentally in both cases the feed solution consisted of 3 l di water spiked with each of the three groups of trocs and re circulated for 24 h to avoid dilution of the draw solution by the permeation of water and maintain the same osmotic driving force the automatic re concentration system was employed water and reverse salt fluxes during the experiments were determined using equations 1 and 2 whereas the permeability coefficients btrocs were calculated with the following expression adapted from the solution diffusion model wijmans and baker 1995 5 b trocs j w c p t c f t c p t where j w is the water flux c f t is the feed solution concentration of trocs at time t and c p t is the permeate concentration of trocs at time t which can be obtained with the following mass transfer equation 6 c p t v d t c d t v d 0 c d 0 j w a m t where v d t is the volume of draw solution at time t and v d 0 is the volume of draw solution at time 0 h 2 6 determining solute membrane interactions in order to identify the solute membrane interactions that dictate the different transport of trocs through the two membranes relationships between the permeability coefficients and the properties of the selected trocs e g molecular weight mw minimal projected surface area mpsa hydrophobicity logd and electrical charge were determined by means of the pearson r and spearman s rank ρ correlation whilst the pearson coefficient is used to identify linear correlations the spearman s rank identifies monotonic linear or non linear relationships a relationship was confirmed when the correlations reached values 0 75 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterisation the two selected membranes tfc 1 and tfc 2 and the benchmark cta membrane were characterised according to tiraferri s 2013 fo only method water fluxes and reverse salt fluxes were determined at increasing draw solution nacl concentrations and then the intrinsic water permeability draw solute permeability and the structural parameter of each membrane were determined these were compared to each other and the values obtained from literature according to table 1 both tfc membranes were found to have much higher water a and draw solute b permeability coefficients than the cta membrane this difference arises from the polymer structure of the active layer al in cta membranes the al consists of unlinked polymer chains with a free volume fraction of around 4 5 ong et al 2013 whereas in tfc membranes the al is not only thinner but it is also made up of a cross linked insoluble polyamide network which has a larger free volume fraction of 7 9 and results in a higher diffusivity of solvent and solutes li and chung 2013 only one previous study has reported permeability and structural parameter values of high flux tfc membranes these were found to be 2 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for a 0 43 0 54 l m 2 h 1 for b and 276 344 μm for s compared to these values the water and draw solute permeability coefficients of the tested tfc membranes are greater whereas the structural parameter is lower this variability can either be attributed to the different characterisation method employed in their study which uses pressurised conditions or to the novelty of the membrane type using 0 1m nacl as the draw solution produced exceptionally high average water fluxes of 9 0 and 16 5 lmh for tfc 1 and tfc 2 respectively although the difference between the water permeability coefficients of tfc 1 and tfc 2 is almost three fold the difference in water flux is only double because tfc 2 suffers from greater internal concentration polarisation because of its higher transmembrane flux the average reverse salt fluxes at a draw solution concentration of 0 1m nacl were also relatively high for both membranes 29 mmol m2h and 55 mmol m2h for tfc 1 and tfc 2 respectively this water flux reverse salt flux trade off is a limiting factor in the development of thinner and more porous tfc membranes wei et al 2011 as an efficient parameter to evaluate fo performance the water draw salt selectivity a b ratio of both tfc membranes was calculated the greater selectivity value of tfc 2 compared to tfc 1 suggests that the former would be favourable in applications that require a high water production whereas the lower permeability of draw salt through tfc 1 suggests that it has a lower free volume fraction and therefore acts as a stronger barrier to solutes 3 2 trocs diffusion experiments in di water d di water in this section the permeability coefficients of the selected trocs through the two tfc membranes were determined from diffusion tests in the absence of a draw solute the results illustrated in fig 1 do not indicate an overall higher permeability of trocs through any of the two membranes but rather a large disparity among the different trocs these differences were explored by calculating the pearson s and spearman s rank correlations between the permeability coefficients and the properties of the organic compounds table 2 the pearson coefficient for the tfc 1 membrane during the d di water test revealed a negative linear correlation between the dimensional parameters of the trocs mw and mpsa and their permeability suggesting that solute size is a strong determinant in solute transport through tfc 1 this agrees with previous studies on earlier tfc membranes which have identified the average hydrated pore size as a dominant transport limiting parameter blandin et al 2016 xie et al 2014 on the other hand there seemed to be no correlation between the permeability of trocs and their hydrophobicity or charge indicating that hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between compounds and the membrane were insignificant since the membrane was saturated with the trocs prior to the experiments adsorption of trocs to the membrane surface was probably avoided during the diffusion tests in contrast the tfc 2 membrane followed a strong charge based trend that overshadowed steric effects as indicated by the strong relationship between permeability and charge r of 0 91 and ρ of 0 97 negatively charged compounds resulted in very low permeability coefficients 0 3 0 6 10 8 m s whereas positively charged compounds although significantly bulkier than the neutral compounds permeated to a much greater extent 114 179 10 8 m s based on the findings on earlier tfc membranes the strong electrostatic effects observed for tfc 2 are caused by a greater negative membrane surface charge which generates an electrostatic repulsion towards anionic compounds and an opposite electrostatic attraction towards cationic compounds previously reported as charge concentration polarisation verliefde et al 2008 neutral compounds on the other hand were not affected by these electrostatic interactions and their permeability was mainly governed by steric hindrance and hydrophobic affinity to the membrane for example acetaminophen s small molecular size and low logd value resulted in a higher permeability coefficient compared to other neutral and charged compounds 3 3 trocs diffusion experiments at increasing ionic strength d 0 1m nacl d 0 5m nacl d 0 5m mgcl2 after the diffusion experiments without the presence of salts the permeability coefficients of trocs were determined at increasing ionic strength at concentrations of 0 1m nacl 0 5m nacl and 0 5m mgcl2 in both feed and draw solutions to investigate solute membrane interactions under these changed conditions table s3 for cta membranes it has been reported that an increase in membrane ionic strength encourages the permeation of smaller trocs due to de swelling of the membrane a reduction of the membrane pore hydration layer nghiem et al 2006 however the opposite was observed for the tfc 1 membrane at concentrations of 0 1m and 0 5m nacl the permeability of the majority of trocs reduced fig 2 a and according to the pearson and spearman s coefficients size became a stronger determinant for their transport table 2 it has been previously shown that for composite membranes used in ro and nf filtration processes increasing the membrane ionic strength shrinks the membrane pores resulting in a lower permeability of organic compounds bellona et al 2004 braghetta et al 1997 hence this lowering of the average pore sizes at increased ionic strength could partly explain the reduced permeability of some of the trocs through the tfc 1 membrane with a concentration of 0 5m mgcl2 the lower partitioning of mg2 ions into the membrane due to a larger hydrated radius was expected to have a weaker shrinking effect therefore the trocs permeability coefficients when using 0 5m mgcl2 were expected to lie between those obtained from the d di water and d 0 5m nacl experiments whereas this was the case for negatively charged compounds the permeability of positively charged trocs and sulfamethoxazole did not follow these trends as described in the section 3 2 the diffusion of trocs through the tfc 2 membrane was strongly influenced by electrostatic interactions with the membrane surface the importance of these electrostatic interactions on the transport of trocs through tfc 2 seemed to diminish at increasing membrane ionic strength as shown in fig 2b permeability of negatively charged compounds increased whereas the permeability of positive compounds decreased it has been found that partitioning of salts into composite membranes shields and thus reduces the effective membrane surface charge significantly nghiem et al 2006 hence it explains the reduced electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged compounds and reduced electrostatic attraction of positive compounds when increasing ionic strength in addition the pearson s coefficients demonstrated a stronger correlation between solute size and permeability suggesting that steric hindrance becomes the more dominant transport limiting mechanism table 2 compared to 0 5m nacl ionic strength using 0 5m mgcl2 led to an even greater permeability of negatively charged trocs and a lower permeability of positively charged trocs except trimethoprim it is known that the double charge of mg2 ions shields the membrane negative surface charge to a greater extent childress and elimelech 1996 resulting in a further weakening of electrostatic interactions between the membrane and the charged solutes neutral compounds on the other hand had similar permeability coefficients to when 0 5m nacl was used because the membrane surface charge does not affect their transport 3 4 fo filtration experiments fo 0 1m nacl fo 0 07m nacl the final set of experiments consisted in determining the permeability coefficients of the selected trocs in the presence of a water flux and a reverse salt flux using a draw solution of 0 1m and 0 07m nacl for tfc 1 and tfc 2 respectively enabled to generate a similar water flux across both membranes the results from these experiments were then compared to the diffusion tests d di water and d 0 1m nacl to draw conclusions on the effect of both water and reverse salt flux on the permeability of trocs table s3 in comparison to the d 0 1m nacl experiments the permeability of most trocs through tfc 1 increased during fo operation jw of 8 10lmh and a rsf of 30 mmol m 2h 1 and according to the correlations in table 2 the importance of solute size on transport reduced despite using high cross flow velocities 7 6 cm s to avoid external solute concentration polarisation the indiscriminate increase in permeability of most compounds observed for tfc 1 could be attributed to this convectional transport induced by the water flux fig 3 a the presence of solute concentration polarisation means that the effect of rsf on solute transport could not be isolated but should be minor in comparison to the differences observed in solute permeability considering that rsf for tfc 1 at a draw solution concentration of 0 1m was only 29 mmol m2h complementary experiments at higher cross flow velocities and higher rsf would clarify the effect of rsf on forward trocs diffusion hindered forward transport of solutes by rsf would be marked by a reduction in permeability of all trocs particularly neutral compounds whereas donnan dialysis would be observed by an increase in permeability of anionic solutes due to a favourable exchange with chloride anions and an opposite effect for cationic compounds unlike with the tfc 1 membrane the permeability of trocs during the fo experiments with tfc 2 jw of 11 13 lmh and a rsf of 50 mmol m 2h 1 were not affected by the convective transport of the water flux as can be seen in fig 3b the permeability coefficients of neutral compounds were similar to those obtained during the diffusion test with 0 1m nacl whilst the permeability of positively charged trocs increased and the permeability of negatively charged trocs decreased it is clear that electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged membrane and the charged solutes were predominant again in the fo experiments an observation that is further supported by the pearson and spearman s rank correlations table 2 considering that during the fo experiment the maximum nacl concentration that established in the feed side due to rsf was approximately 0 005m nacl the shielding effect of the draw solute on the membrane surface charge was likely to be much weaker than in the d 0 1m nacl experiments this suggests that rsf could have an impact on the permeability of trocs by shielding the tfc 2 membrane surface charge only when a high concentration of draw solution is employed for example 0 5m a graphical summary of the transport mechanisms in the different experiments of sections discussed in section 3 2 3 4 has been provided in fig 4 4 conclusions compared to cta membranes both of the novel tfc membranes tested are superior in terms of water permeability as well as water draw solute selectivity between the two selected membranes tfc 2 produces higher water fluxes but is offset by a higher permeability of solutes despite the fact that both tfc membranes have a similar structure and membrane chemistry type the permeability of trocs for the two membranes differed significantly through tfc 1 the transport of trocs was governed by steric factors in a similar way to cta membranes partitioning of draw solute into tfc 1 resulted in smaller membrane pore sizes due to a de swelling effect thus lowering the permeability of both neutral and charged trocs in the presence of a water flux and rsf trocs permeated more due to convective transport to the membrane surface but were unaffected by rsf on the other hand tfc 2 s greater negative surface charge was reflected as strong electrostatic interactions between trocs and the membrane which dictated the transport of trocs through tfc 2 a shielding effect by draw solute partitioning into the membrane decreased these electrostatic interactions leading to steric and hydrophobic transport mechanisms to prevail in an fo process this shielding is expected to occur only at high draw solution concentrations otherwise the electrostatic interactions between the organic solutes and the membrane surface are largely unaffected by rsf acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the support from the european regional development fund feder under the catalan feder operative program 2007 2013 and mineco through the da3a

19497,understanding the temporal dynamics of multi species biofilms in drinking water distribution systems dwds is essential to ensure safe high quality water reaches consumers after it passes through these high surface area reactors this research studied the succession characteristics of fungal and bacterial communities under controlled environmental conditions fully representative of operational dwds microbial communities were observed to increase in complexity after one month of biofilm development but they did not reach stability after three months changes in cell numbers were faster at the start of biofilm formation and tended to decrease over time despite the continuing changes in bacterial community composition fungal diversity was markedly less than bacterial diversity and had a lag in responding to temporal dynamics a core mixed community of bacteria including pseudomonas massillia and sphingomonas and the fungi acremonium and neocosmopora were present constantly and consistently in the biofilms over time and conditions studied monitoring and managing biofilms and such ubiquitous core microbial communities are key control strategies to ensuring the delivery of safe drinking water via the current ageing dwds infrastructure graphical abstract image 1 keywords fungal bacterial interactions biofilm drinking water selection succession 1 introduction the delivery of high quality safe drinking water depends to a large extent on the optimal operation of the transportation infrastructure known as drinking water distribution systems dwds dwds are complex pipe networks which function as dynamic ecosystems where microorganisms dominated by those attached within biofilms on the inner pipe surfaces are involved in a range of processes that ultimately determine the quality of the delivered water microbial dynamics in any ecosystem are determined by interactions between microorganisms and environmental factors however within dwds these microbial dynamics and their temporal variation regarding inter taxa biofilms remain largely unexplored most dwds management strategies consider only planktonic microorganisms free organisms transported in the bulk water reinforced by legislation that only obliges water utilities to analyse bulk water samples from service reservoirs and customer taps and using plate counting techniques and faecal indicators as a measurement of failures in the system however the majority of the microbial biomass in dwds is found attached to the inner surfaces of pipes forming microbial consortiums known as biofilms rather than in the water column flemming 1998 biofilms provide advantages to embedded microorganisms including sharing of nutrients and metabolic products and facilitation of resistance to environmental stress chao et al 2015 microorganisms within biofilms can be associated with several processes occurring in dwds biofilms can affect directly the infrastructure via biocorrosion of metal pipes wang et al 2012 and or modify general water characteristics lehtola et al 2004 and trigger discolouration events through the mobilisation of the attached biofilm into the bulk water husband et al 2016 another major concern is the potential for biofilms to act as reservoirs of opportunistic pathogens wingender and flemming 2011 douterelo et al 2014a the most widespread strategies used to control microorganisms in the bulk water of dwds is the quality of the water as it leaves the treatment works and or the use of a disinfectant residual in the bulk water mainly chlorine or chloramine the efficiency of these strategies to control biofilm formation and properties is limited schwering et al 2013 there are no standard methods to monitor or control the growth of biofilms in dwds and despite their importance biofilms are normally neglected when management and control strategies are designed biofilm formation is a successional process martiny et al 2003 prest et al 2016 beginning when free living microorganisms colonize and attach to pipe surfaces growing whilst generating extracellular polymeric substances eps and modifying the pipe environment in a way that supports or excludes the incorporation of other microorganisms into the biofilm however most of the studies reporting data on the microbiology of dwds occur over relatively short time frames simoes et al 2010

is the fact that biofilms are formed by a complex amalgamate of microorganisms microbiologists working in dwds often focus on one taxonomic group predominately bacteria revetta et al 2010 liu et al 2014a vaz moreira et al 2017 or a specific group of bacteria gomez alvarez et al 2016 despite evidence that other microbial taxa such as fungi viruses and amoeba are present in biofilms wingender and flemming 2011 buse et al 2013 ashbolt 2015 fish et al 2015 douterelo et al 2016a knowledge on the interactions between different microbial strains in actual biofilms is still at its infancy understanding how the full microbial consortium forms how different microbial strains interact when these interactions start and who the main drivers of change are remains largely unknown advances in microscopy and molecular methods are now available that allow a better understanding of microbial communities dynamics including new sequencing platforms the aim of the research reported here was to study the dynamics and temporal patterns of fully representative dwds biofilm community development and succession over a three month period we particularly aimed to study correlations between bacteria and fungi and biofilm cellular developmental rates that have been traditionally overlooked in drinking water studies such bacterial fungal community characteristics and their impact upon biofilm development formation needs to be understood in order to find patterns of microbial behaviour that can inform modelling and management strategies such as disinfectant residual 2 methods in order to meet the specific aims a holistic approach was adopted combining environmental physico chemical analysis microscopy and molecular methods to study the process of biofilm formation and maturation these were applied to samples obtained from the pipe wall of a full scale temperature controlled experimental pipe facility that fully replicates the conditions of an operational dwds this study comprises a range of methods that allow characterization at physiological cell volume and spread and phylogenetic levels gene quantification and taxonomic characterization yielding a more comprehensive understanding of microbial dynamics over time 2 1 experimental facility the experiment was carried out using a dwds test facility which comprised a pipe loop fed with water from the local water supply via an independent tank and pump fig 1 which recirculated water around the pipe loop an independent system residence time of 24 h was set using a trickle feed and drain to provide representative water quality the pipe loop consists of 9 5 21 4 m long coils of 79 3 mm internal diameter high density polyethylene hdpe pipe thus has a total length of 203 m such that pipe surface area is dominant over ancillaries fig 1b hdpe was selected as it is a prevalent and representative material used in dwds world wide who 2006 the room temperature of the experimental facility was set to 16 c for all results reported here this is representative of average spring and summer water temperatures in uk dwds before experiments commenced the pipe loop was set to an initial state by disinfection with 20 mg l of rodolite h rodol ltd liverpool uk a solution of sodium hypochlorite with less than 16 free chlorine then the system was run at maximum flow rate 4 2 l s for 24 h and flushed afterwards at the maximum flow rate with fresh water until the levels of chlorine were similar to those of the local tap water after disinfecting the system sterile pwg coupons deines et al 2010 were fitted along and around the sample length of the pipe loop the pwg coupons have an insert suitable for direct microscopy observations and an outer part that allows for obtaining biofilm biomass for subsequent molecular analysis fig 1a for the experiments reported here a varied flow hydraulic profile was applied based on daily patterns observed in real dwds in the uk the regime follows a typical domestic dominated diurnal pattern with night time low flow of 0 2 l s and morning peak flow of 0 5 l s this is the low varied flow regime originally reported and used in husband et al 2008 the daily regime was repeated for a growth phase of 84 days 2 2 physico chemical analysis of water quality triplicate bulk water samples were collected on days 0 14 34 42 52 70 and 84 during the growth phase free chlorine was measured on site at the time of sampling using a hach dr 2010 spectrophotometer measurements of temperature and ph were also made on site at the time of sampling using a hanna h1991003 m water samples for total organic carbon toc iron and manganese were sent to an independent accredited laboratory alcontrol laboratories rotherham uk for analysis turbidity was constantly measured by an ati a15 76 turbidity monitor ati delph uk installed in the experimental facility 2 3 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm clsm was used to obtain images of biofilm and enable the quantification of the cell coverage on the coupon surfaces three coupons were studied for each sampling day from day 0 used as a control to days 14 34 42 52 70 and 84 for this analysis the insert of the pwg coupon was removed and fixed in 5 formaldehyde for 24 h and then transferred to phosphate buffer solution pbs and stored at 4 c until analysed after fixing the inserts were stained with 20 μmol l 1 syto 63 a cell permeative nucleic acid stain molecular probes invitrogen uk for 30 min at room temperature imaging was performed using a zeiss lsm 510 meta confocal florescent microscope at the kroto imaging facility at the university of sheffield and the lsm 510 image examiner software zeiss uk each insert was imaged for seven random fields of view fov to generate lambda z stacks from which the cell stain signal was isolated and quantified as described in detail in fish et al 2015 the images were then processed to obtain a relative quantification of the cell coverage i e volume of cells and their spread at each layer fish et al 2015 the resultant dataset was analysed using python and r to calculate the volume and spread of the cells see fish et al 2015 for detailed methods for each sample day replication was n 21 apart from day 0 n 20 and day 82 n 19 where fov were corrupted or removed as an outlier differences among days in biofilm cell volume and spread were tested statistically using non parametric tests the kruskall wallis test for comparison of all time points and a tukey and kramer nemenyi test for pairwise comparisons between two specific time points 2 4 dna extraction to extract biofilm dna from the coupons the outer area of each coupon was brushed to remove biofilm following the procedure used by deines et al 2010 after brushing biofilm suspensions were concentrated by filtering through 0 22 μm nitrocellulose membrane filters millipore corp as previously explained douterelo et al 2013 biofilm samples taken over the course of the experiment n 18 were then preserved in the dark at 80 c until dna was extracted to extract dna a method based on proteinase k digestion followed by a standard phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol extraction was used neufeld et al 2007 2 5 q pcr real time pcr was used to quantify changes in the number of bacterial 16s and fungal its gene copies over time see table 1 for primer details quantification of samples involved the use of internal standard curves prepared by using a serial dilution of each targeted gene amplified from biofilm samples obtained from a previous experiment in the same test loop facility for each gene a standard was generated by running pcrs using the primers in table 1 then purifying via gel purification qiagen gel extraction kit and combining the purified amplicons into one dwds biofilm standard per gene the number of gene copies in each standard was determined by quantifying the dna content via a nanodrop 8000 spectrophotometer thermo scientific uk and calculating gene copies using the equation gene number 6 023 1023 copies mol 1 concentration of standard g μl 1 mw g mol 1 where 6 023 1023 is avogadro s constant mw is the molecular weight of the targeted gene standards no template controls and samples were amplified in triplicate via qpcr reactions according to the quantifast sybr green pcr kit qiagen uk briefly qpcr reactions were 25 μl in total volume which contained 12 5 μl of quantifast sybr green pcr mastermix 9 μl of nuclease free water ambion warrington uk 1 25 μl of each primer 10 μm table 1 and 1 μl of dna template real time pcr was carried out using an applied biosystems stepone qpcr machine and the cycling conditions advised in the qiagen kit 95 c for 5 min then 35 cycles of 95 c for 10 s 60 c for 30 s melting curve analysis was also run for bacterial gene qpcrs only the number of gene copies was determined using the stepone software 2 6 illumina sequencing sequencing was performed by illumina miseq technology with the paired end protocol by mr dna laboratory tx usa using primers 28f gagtttgatcntggctcag and 519 rgtnttacngcggckgctg and the fungal 18s rrna gene was amplified using ssufungif tggagggcaagtctggtg ssufungir tcggcatagtttatggttaag hume et al 2012 paired end reads were merged and de noised to remove short sequences singletons and noisy reads chimeras were detected using uchime edgar et al 2011 and removed from further analysis sequences were clustered in operational taxonomic units otus and selected using uparse edgar 2013 taxonomic assignments were made with usearch global alignment program edgar 2013 the software past v3 12 hammer et al 2008 was used to estimate alpha diversity at 97 sequence similarity and the shannon diversity index chao i and dominance h were calculated briefly the shannon index h measures diversity and indicates the proportion of otus abundance to the whole community this index varies from 0 for communities with only a single taxon to higher values max 5 in this study chao 1 is an estimate of total richness and estimates total number of otus in a community based upon the number of rare otus found in a sample chao 1984 in a sample with many singletons the probability of having more undetected otus is higher and the chao 1 index will estimate greater richness than for a sample without rare otus the evenness of a sample is a measure of the distribution of the otus in a community and communities dominated by one or few otus have low evenness the dominance index 1 simpson index ranges from 0 all taxa are equally present to 1 one taxon dominates the community completely harper 1999 approximate confidence intervals for these indexes were computed with a bootstrap procedure default 9999 and a 95 confidence interval was then calculated bray curtis dissimilarity matrixes at 97 sequence similarity cut off were calculated and visualised using non metric multi dimensional scaling mds diagrams generated using the software past v3 12 hammer et al 2008 stress of the non metric mds was determined to estimate the statistical fit stress varies between 0 and 1 with values near 0 indicating better fit the analysis of group similarities anosim was performed based on bray curtis dissimilarity distance matrices to test the differences in community composition among groups of samples using the software primer6 clarke and warwick 2005 from this analysis gobal r statistic values were calculated showing the strength of the impact that the factors analysed had on the samples in this case time days global r values vary between 0 and 1 where 1 indicates high separation of the samples between levels of the factor time and 0 indicates no separation 2 7 statistical analysis of microbiological parameters and key taxonomic groups correlations between microbiological parameters were explored by spearman s rank non parametric correlations using spss statistics 24 ibm usa alpha diversity metrics the relative abundance of the most representative taxonomic class and the measurement of cells and genes for bacteria and fungi respectively were used as biological parameters in the establishment of correlations 3 results 3 1 water physico chemical analysis as shown in table 2 ph values were near neutral 7 08 7 99 for all the samples over time temperature ranged between 14 6 and 15 9 c for all samples within an average of 15 0 4 c free chlorine levels were slighted elevated on day 0 this was due to initial filling of the system with fresh water that has a slightly higher residual than is ultimately established with the 24 h residence time from the trickle drain and feed and the use of an elevated residual over night from cleaning to the start of the experiment this elevated value was less than the final water quality leaving the local water treatment works and dropped to the experimental level within 24 h the average chlorine residual in the system was then maintained at 0 42 0 2 mg l higher turbidity levels were observed on day 0 1 51 ntu but subsequently were consistently at an average of 0 05 0 03 ntu this slight elevation is again associated with the filling of the system and upstream effects from the external network supplying the laboratories toc values were stable over time ranging from 1 13 to 1 83 mg l iron was the physico chemical factor that fluctuated the most with minimum values of 9 9 μg l on day 34 to a maximum of 37 0 μg l on day 84 manganese levels were very low over time generally below detection limits 3 6 μg l except for day 14 which was 0 1 μg l higher 3 2 volume and spread of cells fig 2 shows the volume and spread of cells within the dwds biofilms over the 84 day period note that fig 2a and b are the same data plotted on different vertical scales in order to visualise the variability of all the samples over the 3 months studied as anticipated the cell volume within the dwds biofilms increased from day 0 throughout the experiment as the biofilm developed fig 2a and significant difference were observed among data time points kruskall wallis χ2 80 80 p value 0 01 this increase in the cells volume was not linear rather the volume oscillates with cell volume dropping at day 52 to volumes comparable to those seen at day 14 fig 2b however no significant differences were detected using the pairwise comparison nemeyi test among day 52 and any other time points following this reduction in cells the final two sample points day 70 and 84 have the greatest median cell volume fig 2a and b although day 70 biofilms had a greater cell volume than day 84 fig 2c shows the spread metric calculated from the biofilm clsm data spread was calculated as volume divided by area covered fish et al 2015 to provide a measure of spread or compactness of the biofilm irrespective of the total volume and uncertainty in defining the edges of the distribution across the z stack while the trends when all time points are compared were statistically significant kruskal wallis χ2 26 411 p value 0 05 it is notable that the data shows again an oscillating pattern this pattern appears to be inverse and slightly lagged behind the volume data when time points were compared pairwise statistically significant differences nemeyi test p value 0 05 were observed only between day 70 samples and the other sampling days with the exception of day 0 and day 14 3 3 bacterial and fungal gene quantification the number of bacterial 16s rrna gene copies fig 3 a increased from day 0 no genes were quantified to day 42 reaching a maximum of 1 16 107 16s rrna gene copies mm 2 after day 42 the number of gene copies decreases steadily over the rest of the experiment despite this decline the day 84 samples had a greater number of 16s rrna genes than the day 14 samples throughout the 84 day period the fungal its gene fig 3b was present at least two magnitudes less than the bacterial gene was its genes mm 2 were 10000 in biofilms from days 0 42 by day 52 gene copies had increased reaching a peak at day 70 max 30000 its genes mm 2 this pattern highlights a lag of 20 30 days in the fungi population reaching the maximum quantification in comparison to the bacteria where a peak was reached at day 42 similarly to the bacteria fungal gene copies decreased after this peak but the day 84 biofilms had similar its gene copies as the day 14 samples if the lagged growth and decline trends in bacteria and fungi fig 3a and b gene copies are combined with some weighting for relative size of organism it is possible that the cyclic trend in dna cellular volume fig 2a and b could be explained 3 4 microbial community structure 3 4 1 rarefaction analysis the rarefaction analysis fig 4 yields insights into the sequencing effort and compares the diversity of the observed number of otus at 97 sequence similarity cut off in all the samples over time most of the samples independently of the time of sampling showed rarefaction curves that did not reach a plateau this trend in the curves was particularly marked for fungal communities fig 4b where the samples analysed showed a steeper slope when compared with bacteria suggesting that further sequencing and time series would be needed to reach a full taxonomic representation of the microbial communities this data can also be associated to the fact that biofilm communities did not reach a mature or stable state after three months of development in the system 3 4 2 taxonomic analysis the dominant bacterial class fig 5 a over time in the biofilm samples was proteobacteria and within it betaproteobacteria representing a 70 of the total community on day 34 samples gammaproteobacteria 5 67 and alphaproteobacteria 6 28 were the most abundant classes however the percentages of each of these bacterial classes clearly varied over time and there was high variability between replicates for each day with day 14 having the most extreme example of this the fungal community fig 5b was dominated by ascomycota 10 75 and sordaryomicetes 14 75 but day 14 samples from two coupons 31 and 37 were dissimilar to the other samples and were dominated by dothideomycetes 22 63 and saccharomyctes yeast and yeast like fungi 7 9 saccharomycetes were dominant in the first stages of biofilm development until day 42 and then this fungal group was not substantially represented in the community at genus level fig 6 a massilia max 62 and pseudomonas max 64 were highly abundant on the first days of biofilm development it is notable that on day 14 one of the replicates coupon 9 showed a different microbial community when compared with the other two samples despite of being biological replicates these two samples from day 14 had a higher relative abundance of pseudomonas 38 64 this genus was dominant in the community composition and showed percentages similar to those on day 42 on day 42 samples showed a more diverse community enriched coincident in time with a peak in the cell volume fig 2 a and b with genera such as nevskia methylophilus sphingomonas variovorax and limnohabitants the most abundant genera in fungal communities fig 6b at all sampling times were acremonium 8 70 and neocosmospora 17 77 but in two of the coupons from day 14 31 and 37 there was high abundance of letendraea 36 and cladosporium 19 24 the fungal composition of these two samples was markedly different when compared with the most even structure observed for the samples at other time points this has been also observed as has been previously pointed for the bacterial communities of these two samples the studied succession finished with samples from day 84 showing a high abundance of the genus metacordyceps in the fungal community 2 12 mds analysis of bacteria based on the bray curtis similarity matrix of bacterial sequences with 97 similarity cut off is presented in fig 7 a variability in bacterial community distribution between sample points was observed but these differences were not significant anosim global r 0 143 p value 0 074 and there was no clear temporal pattern for fungi fig 7b the mds analysis revealed a tight clustering of the biofilm samples which corresponds to very little variation in community composition over time as shown in the anosim analysis r 0 023 p value 0 399 3 4 3 diversity and richness indicators fig 8 shows the richness i e number of different otus and diversity i e number of different otus taking into account their relative abundance of bacterial and fungal communities at 97 sequence similarity cut off when compared bacterial communities were more dynamic and diverse than fungi fungal communities showed limited diversity dominated by few taxonomic groups with little change over time when analysed separately the dominance indicator for bacterial communities decreased over time increasing slightly by day 70 and decreasing again by day 84 reaching a minimum value this trend suggests that initially there are a few bacteria that attach and colonize the pipe surfaces from which the biofilm develops towards a more diverse community with less dominating taxa this is supported by the patterns in diversity evenness and richness values however bacterial richness indicator did not change considerably over time fungal communities showed a clear dominance of certain otus which was less marked at the beginning of the data series studied and increased over time similarly evenness was higher for the first 42 days of biofilm development and subsequently fluctuated at lower level after that day the fungal communities were not very diverse with all samples having shannon index values below 2 richness 100 otus fluctuated only slightly among samples clearly few fungal otus dominated the composition of biofilms over time 3 5 correlations between microbiological data table 3 shows a matrix of the non parametric correlations between microbiological data and indicates statistically significant correlations at different p levels the diversity and richness indicators showed a significant positive correlation for bacteria but not for fungi only the number of fungal its genes correlated significantly with richness and diversity for that taxonomic group the cell volume did not significantly correlate with any of the other parameters when associations between different microbial groups were taken into account alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria tended to be correlated positively among them the microbial groups that correlated the most with other microorganisms were the bacteria actinobacteria cytophagia and the fungi dothideomycetes basiodioycota leotiomycetes and ascomycota this result shows that certain microbial groups are more or less likely to co exist within the studied biofilm samples 4 discussion biofilm development was monitored over a three month period and the characteristics of inter taxa interactions were studied to evaluate and detect patterns of temporal change and drivers of biofilm behaviour sequencing results indicated that biofilm developmental patterns were initially driven by bacteria fungi showed a lag response to temporal changes in terms of its gene copy numbers and the community structure displayed limited changes over time generally it was observed that an initial diverse community dominated by bacteria was able to attach and was embedded in the biofilm after one month of development biofilm diversity was temporally reduced coincident with a decrease in cell volume from days 42 52 likely due to a selective mechanism that ultimately yielded a higher diversity after two months development confirming the leading role of bacteria in the process of succession it was observed that the rise in diversity from 34 to 42 days corresponded with a peak in the number of 16s rrna gene copy numbers the observed diversity pattern could have been a result of competition with some bacteria fungi being out competed hence diversity decreasing but the resultant more mature biofilm then being a suitable niche for other cells to subsequently colonize hence diversity increasing again we hypothesize that the daily fluctuating hydraulic conditions were acting as a selective mechanism to shape microbial diversity and structure as has been previously observed in previous research carried out in the same system douterelo et al 2013 fish et al 2017 if daily patterns help to maintain natural diverse communities and more compact and stable biofilms this can have positive implications for the management of dwds safeguarding these systems from the incursion of non desirable microorganisms into biofilms and avoiding their survival and later mobilisation into bulk water the ability of microorganisms to respond to changing environmental conditions has been previously correlated with the bacterial genome size and with their cell volume yooseph et al 2010 here the dominant peak in cell volume day 70 on fig 2a corresponded to the peak in its gene numbers fig 3b which can be explained by the generally larger cell size of fungi particularly of filamentous fungi when forming hyphae if this hypothesis is correct fungi may be more resilient to change and persist over time explaining the limited change in diversity observed during the succession process and the observed lag between the peak in bacteria and fungi genes apparent when comparing fig 3a and b fungi can survive and grow in dwds within biofilms particularly at warmer temperature or in systems where the flow is low or stagnant siqueira et al 2012 douterelo et al 2016b oliveira et al 2016 the night time flow rate of the hydraulic regime selected for these experiments was at the upper end for those observed in 75 100 mm pipes in real systems thus fungi are possibly even more prevalent and important in real operational systems the challenge for water utilities is how to manage control these microorganisms since fungal walls protect cells against mechanical damage and stop the ingress of toxic molecules making these organisms even more resistant to environmental changes cole 1996 in addition fungi can form spores which increase their resistance to disinfection mamane gravetz and linden 2005 sonigo et al 2011 this study reinforces that fungi must be included in monitoring campaigns in dwds when assessing microbial risks it has been suggested that generally microbial communities tend to develop towards a stable community faust et al 2015 or plateau phase in this study no mature stable biofilm communities were established on the pipe walls after three months of development this result suggests that longer time periods may be needed to fully develop mature microbial communities in dwds however determining the scale of change to study succession in an ecosystem is challenging given that depending on the habitat community changes can be triggered by fluctuations in environmental conditions or by a transient perturbation that moves the system into an alternative steady state fierer et al 2010 the experimental dwds used in this study minimised any such transient perturbations by controlling hydraulics and offering a relatively stable physico chemical environment over time while the local source water treatment works and trunk main system prior to the laboratory facility will have had some variations over the 3 months table 2 indicates that these where minimal and they would have been gradual fluctuations rather than rapid dynamic changes hence the changes observed such as those on day 42 are most probably due to intrinsic biofilm processes related to microbial processes during development martiny et al 2003 studied the process of biofilm development over a 3 year period in a model distribution systems using fingerprinting and sanger sequencing to monitor bacterial communities using these methods martiny et al 2003 established that after 500 days the biofilm entered a stable state which was characterised by a greater richness of bacteria we have observed higher bacterial diversity at the final stages of biofilm formation but after three months of biofilm development our communities were not mature or stable we have observed that specific microbial taxa were dominant throughout the succession process with a core microbial population present in the biofilms over time but at different relative abundances thus it can be suggested that these particular microbial taxa are fundamental in directing the process of succession the taxa in this core community include the bacteria pseudomonas massillia and sphingomonas and the fungi acremonium and neocosmopora in a previous study the role of pseudomonas as primary and initial colonizer of the same experimental facility was established in the first 28 days of biofilm development douterelo et al 2014b and here its continual key role in shaping biofilm structure over a longer period of time has been confirmed species belonging to the genus pseudomonas might benefit from what is known as the founder effect as an initial member of biofilms in the pipe surface it will have the advantage over secondary colonizers and will remain dominant over time kelly et al 2014 the presence of core populations have been observed before in water meters of dwds ling et al 2016 biofilms of a chloraminated dwds kelly et al 2014 and in dwds of chlorinated systems douterelo et al 2017 kelly et al 2014 showed in chloraminated systems that the core community was enriched with methanotrophs and methylotrophs methylobacteria and methylophylus were also important representatives of bacterial communities over time in this study and the relative abundance of methylophylus increased after two months of biofilm development methylotrophic bacteria have been found in several drinking water related ecosystems mccoy and vanbriesen 2012 douterelo et al 2014b liu et al 2014b but the reasons behind their abundance in these systems are unclear however methylotrophic bacteria have been related with the generation of holoacetic acid which is a common disinfectant by product in chlorinated systems kelly et al 2014 therefore it is possible that this group is promoted due to the decay of residuals within dwds the fungi acremonium and neocosmopora were also forming part of the fungal bacteria core community acremonium is a filamentous fungus which has been previously isolated in water supply reservoirs drinking water treatment plants and in bulk water of drinking water distribution systems zacheus and martikainen 1995 pereira et al 2010 oliveira et al 2016 bai et al 2017 douterelo et al 2017 and has been associated with the occurrence of taste and odour issues in drinking water bai et al 2017 neocosmopora is commonly found in soils and some species are phytophatogenic aoki et al 2014 it has been found that neocomospora under laboratory conditions is able to uptake chloride miller and budd 1975 and can produce cyclosporine a fungal metabolite with antifungal activity these abilities can explain its supremacy over other microorganisms in mixed species microbial communities in chlorinated dwds this study confirms the presence of acremonium and neocomospora from the early stages of biofilm formation to a more developed biofilm in chlorinated systems forming core communities with bacteria despite of fungi involvement in the organoleptic deterioration of water act as potential pathogens and toxin producers fungi are usually omitted from drinking water regulation and there are no limits or standards regarding their presence in drinking water this study shows the ubiquity of fungi in forming mix species consortium with the most common bacteria in dwds biofilms taking into account these results further consideration should be given to these microorganisms in order to guarantee the delivery of good quality water and to control biofilm formation at the initial stages of development in dwds environmental stressors such as chlorine can influence successional trajectories in the early stages of succession fierer et al 2010 by increasing the abundance of taxa that are resistant to the particular stress and can subsequently modify the habitat by producing eps extracellular polymeric substances to protect the cells from oxidative stress besemer et al 2007 this study indicates the capability of microorganisms to proliferate despite the presence of chlorine residual throughout biofilm development from initial stages with low cell numbers and thinner and more environmentally exposed biofilms to more developed biofilms exhibiting larger biomass and diversity from these results it can be hypothesised that the microbial communities involved in initial attachment to the pipes are more resistant to chlorine then once more eps is produced other species which are less resistant can join the biofilm and survive within it protected against the action of chlorine by the eps hence the biofilm environment may favour more diverse communities over time this suggests that despite its widespread use to control planktonic microorgansims the application of chlorine to control the attached microbial life within dwds is questionable in agreement with our observations simões et al 2016 under controlled laboratory conditions studied the role of inter kingdom interactions in chlorine resistance and showed that associations between fungi and bacteria were ecologically beneficial and promoted resistance to disinfection the stable state of a biofilm is not entirely determined by external factors and interactions among microbial community members might play a key role in determining biofilm status faust et al 2015 these complex interactions between microorganisms and with their environment are key contributors to biofilm dynamics and are relatively unexplored in the context of dwds here the relative abundance of certain bacterial and fungal taxa correlated together including proteobacteria and basidiomycota table 3 both members of a core microbial community present continuously over the successional process in this study fungal bacteria associations can lead to changes in nutrient availability even in the case of dwds where the level of nutrients such as toc in the system are controlled to a certain extent the presence of certain taxa can ease nutrient limitation and it is well known that in other ecosystems bacterial and fungal consortium are able to increase nutrient bioavailability and mobilisation of key nutrients rashid et al 2016 and this can support the process of succession however if biofilms are to a certain extent self sufficient independently of the concentration of available nutrients in the bulk water manipulating or changing external nutrient parameters is not going to stop biofilm formation and development in dwds 5 conclusions diverse bacterial communities cohabiting with more stable fungal communities with the more common taxa ubiquitous and constantly present over time and a temporal variability that does not follow a specific pattern driven by bacteria to deal with the heterogeneity of the process of biofilm development in dwds and to model these systems the focus needs to be on targeting dominant and ubiquitous microorganisms in order to manage microbial risks in dwds we need to better understand the behaviour of these key microorganisms to design monitoring strategies and assess their use as bioindicators of overall biofilm status in the system acknowledgements the research reported here was

19497,understanding the temporal dynamics of multi species biofilms in drinking water distribution systems dwds is essential to ensure safe high quality water reaches consumers after it passes through these high surface area reactors this research studied the succession characteristics of fungal and bacterial communities under controlled environmental conditions fully representative of operational dwds microbial communities were observed to increase in complexity after one month of biofilm development but they did not reach stability after three months changes in cell numbers were faster at the start of biofilm formation and tended to decrease over time despite the continuing changes in bacterial community composition fungal diversity was markedly less than bacterial diversity and had a lag in responding to temporal dynamics a core mixed community of bacteria including pseudomonas massillia and sphingomonas and the fungi acremonium and neocosmopora were present constantly and consistently in the biofilms over time and conditions studied monitoring and managing biofilms and such ubiquitous core microbial communities are key control strategies to ensuring the delivery of safe drinking water via the current ageing dwds infrastructure graphical abstract image 1 keywords fungal bacterial interactions biofilm drinking water selection succession 1 introduction the delivery of high quality safe drinking water depends to a large extent on the optimal operation of the transportation infrastructure known as drinking water distribution systems dwds dwds are complex pipe networks which function as dynamic ecosystems where microorganisms dominated by those attached within biofilms on the inner pipe surfaces are involved in a range of processes that ultimately determine the quality of the delivered water microbial dynamics in any ecosystem are determined by interactions between microorganisms and environmental factors however within dwds these microbial dynamics and their temporal variation regarding inter taxa biofilms remain largely unexplored most dwds management strategies consider only planktonic microorganisms free organisms transported in the bulk water reinforced by legislation that only obliges water utilities to analyse bulk water samples from service reservoirs and customer taps and using plate counting techniques and faecal indicators as a measurement of failures in the system however the majority of the microbial biomass in dwds is found attached to the inner surfaces of pipes forming microbial consortiums known as biofilms rather than in the water column flemming 1998 biofilms provide advantages to embedded microorganisms including sharing of nutrients and metabolic products and facilitation of resistance to environmental stress chao et al 2015 microorganisms within biofilms can be associated with several processes occurring in dwds biofilms can affect directly the infrastructure via biocorrosion of metal pipes wang et al 2012 and or modify general water characteristics lehtola et al 2004 and trigger discolouration events through the mobilisation of the attached biofilm into the bulk water husband et al 2016 another major concern is the potential for biofilms to act as reservoirs of opportunistic pathogens wingender and flemming 2011 douterelo et al 2014a the most widespread strategies used to control microorganisms in the bulk water of dwds is the quality of the water as it leaves the treatment works and or the use of a disinfectant residual in the bulk water mainly chlorine or chloramine the efficiency of these strategies to control biofilm formation and properties is limited schwering et al 2013 there are no standard methods to monitor or control the growth of biofilms in dwds and despite their importance biofilms are normally neglected when management and control strategies are designed biofilm formation is a successional process martiny et al 2003 prest et al 2016 beginning when free living microorganisms colonize and attach to pipe surfaces growing whilst generating extracellular polymeric substances eps and modifying the pipe environment in a way that supports or excludes the incorporation of other microorganisms into the biofilm however most of the studies reporting data on the microbiology of dwds occur over relatively short time frames simoes et al 2010 douterelo et al 2013 and evaluate mainly the temporal spatial dynamics in bulk water samples hoefel et al 2005 van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 roeselers et al 2015 or biofilm growth in reactors gomes et al 2014 revetta et al 2016 improving our understanding of biofilm behaviour in these systems requires long term series data of the attached microbial phase commonly overlooked in dwds studies is the fact that biofilms are formed by a complex amalgamate of microorganisms microbiologists working in dwds often focus on one taxonomic group predominately bacteria revetta et al 2010 liu et al 2014a vaz moreira et al 2017 or a specific group of bacteria gomez alvarez et al 2016 despite evidence that other microbial taxa such as fungi viruses and amoeba are present in biofilms wingender and flemming 2011 buse et al 2013 ashbolt 2015 fish et al 2015 douterelo et al 2016a knowledge on the interactions between different microbial strains in actual biofilms is still at its infancy understanding how the full microbial consortium forms how different microbial strains interact when these interactions start and who the main drivers of change are remains largely unknown advances in microscopy and molecular methods are now available that allow a better understanding of microbial communities dynamics including new sequencing platforms the aim of the research reported here was to study the dynamics and temporal patterns of fully representative dwds biofilm community development and succession over a three month period we particularly aimed to study correlations between bacteria and fungi and biofilm cellular developmental rates that have been traditionally overlooked in drinking water studies such bacterial fungal community characteristics and their impact upon biofilm development formation needs to be understood in order to find patterns of microbial behaviour that can inform modelling and management strategies such as disinfectant residual 2 methods in order to meet the specific aims a holistic approach was adopted combining environmental physico chemical analysis microscopy and molecular methods to study the process of biofilm formation and maturation these were applied to samples obtained from the pipe wall of a full scale temperature controlled experimental pipe facility that fully replicates the conditions of an operational dwds this study comprises a range of methods that allow characterization at physiological cell volume and spread and phylogenetic levels gene quantification and taxonomic characterization yielding a more comprehensive understanding of microbial dynamics over time 2 1 experimental facility the experiment was carried out using a dwds test facility which comprised a pipe loop fed with water from the local water supply via an independent tank and pump fig 1 which recirculated water around the pipe loop an independent system residence time of 24 h was set using a trickle feed and drain to provide representative water quality the pipe loop consists of 9 5 21 4 m long coils of 79 3 mm internal diameter high density polyethylene hdpe pipe thus has a total length of 203 m such that pipe surface area is dominant over ancillaries fig 1b hdpe was selected as it is a prevalent and representative material used in dwds world wide who 2006 the room temperature of the experimental facility was set to 16 c for all results reported here this is representative of average spring and summer water temperatures in uk dwds before experiments commenced the pipe loop was set to an initial state by disinfection with 20 mg l of rodolite h rodol ltd liverpool uk a solution of sodium hypochlorite with less than 16 free chlorine then the system was run at maximum flow rate 4 2 l s for 24 h and flushed afterwards at the maximum flow rate with fresh water until the levels of chlorine were similar to those of the local tap water after disinfecting the system sterile pwg coupons deines et al 2010 were fitted along and around the sample length of the pipe loop the pwg coupons have an insert suitable for direct microscopy observations and an outer part that allows for obtaining biofilm biomass for subsequent molecular analysis fig 1a for the experiments reported here a varied flow hydraulic profile was applied based on daily patterns observed in real dwds in the uk the regime follows a typical domestic dominated diurnal pattern with night time low flow of 0 2 l s and morning peak flow of 0 5 l s this is the low varied flow regime originally reported and used in husband et al 2008 the daily regime was repeated for a growth phase of 84 days 2 2 physico chemical analysis of water quality triplicate bulk water samples were collected on days 0 14 34 42 52 70 and 84 during the growth phase free chlorine was measured on site at the time of sampling using a hach dr 2010 spectrophotometer measurements of temperature and ph were also made on site at the time of sampling using a hanna h1991003 m water samples for total organic carbon toc iron and manganese were sent to an independent accredited laboratory alcontrol laboratories rotherham uk for analysis turbidity was constantly measured by an ati a15 76 turbidity monitor ati delph uk installed in the experimental facility 2 3 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm clsm was used to obtain images of biofilm and enable the quantification of the cell coverage on the coupon surfaces three coupons were studied for each sampling day from day 0 used as a control to days 14 34 42 52 70 and 84 for this analysis the insert of the pwg coupon was removed and fixed in 5 formaldehyde for 24 h and then transferred to phosphate buffer solution pbs and stored at 4 c until analysed after fixing the inserts were stained with 20 μmol l 1 syto 63 a cell permeative nucleic acid stain molecular probes invitrogen uk for 30 min at room temperature imaging was performed using a zeiss lsm 510 meta confocal florescent microscope at the kroto imaging facility at the university of sheffield and the lsm 510 image examiner software zeiss uk each insert was imaged for seven random fields of view fov to generate lambda z stacks from which the cell stain signal was isolated and quantified as described in detail in fish et al 2015 the images were then processed to obtain a relative quantification of the cell coverage i e volume of cells and their spread at each layer fish et al 2015 the resultant dataset was analysed using python and r to calculate the volume and spread of the cells see fish et al 2015 for detailed methods for each sample day replication was n 21 apart from day 0 n 20 and day 82 n 19 where fov were corrupted or removed as an outlier differences among days in biofilm cell volume and spread were tested statistically using non parametric tests the kruskall wallis test for comparison of all time points and a tukey and kramer nemenyi test for pairwise comparisons between two specific time points 2 4 dna extraction to extract biofilm dna from the coupons the outer area of each coupon was brushed to remove biofilm following the procedure used by deines et al 2010 after brushing biofilm suspensions were concentrated by filtering through 0 22 μm nitrocellulose membrane filters millipore corp as previously explained douterelo et al 2013 biofilm samples taken over the course of the experiment n 18 were then preserved in the dark at 80 c until dna was extracted to extract dna a method based on proteinase k digestion followed by a standard phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol extraction was used neufeld et al 2007 2 5 q pcr real time pcr was used to quantify changes in the number of bacterial 16s and fungal its gene copies over time see table 1 for primer details quantification of samples involved the use of internal standard curves prepared by using a serial dilution of each targeted gene amplified from biofilm samples obtained from a previous experiment in the same test loop facility for each gene a standard was generated by running pcrs using the primers in table 1 then purifying via gel purification qiagen gel extraction kit and combining the purified amplicons into one dwds biofilm standard per gene the number of gene copies in each standard was determined by quantifying the dna content via a nanodrop 8000 spectrophotometer thermo scientific uk and calculating gene copies using the equation gene number 6 023 1023 copies mol 1 concentration of standard g μl 1 mw g mol 1 where 6 023 1023 is avogadro s constant mw is the molecular weight of the targeted gene standards no template controls and samples were amplified in triplicate via qpcr reactions according to the quantifast sybr green pcr kit qiagen uk briefly qpcr reactions were 25 μl in total volume which contained 12 5 μl of quantifast sybr green pcr mastermix 9 μl of nuclease free water ambion warrington uk 1 25 μl of each primer 10 μm table 1 and 1 μl of dna template real time pcr was carried out using an applied biosystems stepone qpcr machine and the cycling conditions advised in the qiagen kit 95 c for 5 min then 35 cycles of 95 c for 10 s 60 c for 30 s melting curve analysis was also run for bacterial gene qpcrs only the number of gene copies was determined using the stepone software 2 6 illumina sequencing sequencing was performed by illumina miseq technology with the paired end protocol by mr dna laboratory tx usa using primers 28f gagtttgatcntggctcag and 519 rgtnttacngcggckgctg and the fungal 18s rrna gene was amplified using ssufungif tggagggcaagtctggtg ssufungir tcggcatagtttatggttaag hume et al 2012 paired end reads were merged and de noised to remove short sequences singletons and noisy reads chimeras were detected using uchime edgar et al 2011 and removed from further analysis sequences were clustered in operational taxonomic units otus and selected using uparse edgar 2013 taxonomic assignments were made with usearch global alignment program edgar 2013 the software past v3 12 hammer et al 2008 was used to estimate alpha diversity at 97 sequence similarity and the shannon diversity index chao i and dominance h were calculated briefly the shannon index h measures diversity and indicates the proportion of otus abundance to the whole community this index varies from 0 for communities with only a single taxon to higher values max 5 in this study chao 1 is an estimate of total richness and estimates total number of otus in a community based upon the number of rare otus found in a sample chao 1984 in a sample with many singletons the probability of having more undetected otus is higher and the chao 1 index will estimate greater richness than for a sample without rare otus the evenness of a sample is a measure of the distribution of the otus in a community and communities dominated by one or few otus have low evenness the dominance index 1 simpson index ranges from 0 all taxa are equally present to 1 one taxon dominates the community completely harper 1999 approximate confidence intervals for these indexes were computed with a bootstrap procedure default 9999 and a 95 confidence interval was then calculated bray curtis dissimilarity matrixes at 97 sequence similarity cut off were calculated and visualised using non metric multi dimensional scaling mds diagrams generated using the software past v3 12 hammer et al 2008 stress of the non metric mds was determined to estimate the statistical fit stress varies between 0 and 1 with values near 0 indicating better fit the analysis of group similarities anosim was performed based on bray curtis dissimilarity distance matrices to test the differences in community composition among groups of samples using the software primer6 clarke and warwick 2005 from this analysis gobal r statistic values were calculated showing the strength of the impact that the factors analysed had on the samples in this case time days global r values vary between 0 and 1 where 1 indicates high separation of the samples between levels of the factor time and 0 indicates no separation 2 7 statistical analysis of microbiological parameters and key taxonomic groups correlations between microbiological parameters were explored by spearman s rank non parametric correlations using spss statistics 24 ibm usa alpha diversity metrics the relative abundance of the most representative taxonomic class and the measurement of cells and genes for bacteria and fungi respectively were used as biological parameters in the establishment of correlations 3 results 3 1 water physico chemical analysis as shown in table 2 ph values were near neutral 7 08 7 99 for all the samples over time temperature ranged between 14 6 and 15 9 c for all samples within an average of 15 0 4 c free chlorine levels were slighted elevated on day 0 this was due to initial filling of the system with fresh water that has a slightly higher residual than is ultimately established with the 24 h residence time from the trickle drain and feed and the use of an elevated residual over night from cleaning to the start of the experiment this elevated value was less than the final water quality leaving the local water treatment works and dropped to the experimental level within 24 h the average chlorine residual in the system was then maintained at 0 42 0 2 mg l higher turbidity levels were observed on day 0 1 51 ntu but subsequently were consistently at an average of 0 05 0 03 ntu this slight elevation is again associated with the filling of the system and upstream effects from the external network supplying the laboratories toc values were stable over time ranging from 1 13 to 1 83 mg l iron was the physico chemical factor that fluctuated the most with minimum values of 9 9 μg l on day 34 to a maximum of 37 0 μg l on day 84 manganese levels were very low over time generally below detection limits 3 6 μg l except for day 14 which was 0 1 μg l higher 3 2 volume and spread of cells fig 2 shows the volume and spread of cells within the dwds biofilms over the 84 day period note that fig 2a and b are the same data plotted on different vertical scales in order to visualise the variability of all the samples over the 3 months studied as anticipated the cell volume within the dwds biofilms increased from day 0 throughout the experiment as the biofilm developed fig 2a and significant difference were observed among data time points kruskall wallis χ2 80 80 p value 0 01 this increase in the cells volume was not linear rather the volume oscillates with cell volume dropping at day 52 to volumes comparable to those seen at day 14 fig 2b however no significant differences were detected using the pairwise comparison nemeyi test among day 52 and any other time points following this reduction in cells the final two sample points day 70 and 84 have the greatest median cell volume fig 2a and b although day 70 biofilms had a greater cell volume than day 84 fig 2c shows the spread metric calculated from the biofilm clsm data spread was calculated as volume divided by area covered fish et al 2015 to provide a measure of spread or compactness of the biofilm irrespective of the total volume and uncertainty in defining the edges of the distribution across the z stack while the trends when all time points are compared were statistically significant kruskal wallis χ2 26 411 p value 0 05 it is notable that the data shows again an oscillating pattern this pattern appears to be inverse and slightly lagged behind the volume data when time points were compared pairwise statistically significant differences nemeyi test p value 0 05 were observed only between day 70 samples and the other sampling days with the exception of day 0 and day 14 3 3 bacterial and fungal gene quantification the number of bacterial 16s rrna gene copies fig 3 a increased from day 0 no genes were quantified to day 42 reaching a maximum of 1 16 107 16s rrna gene copies mm 2 after day 42 the number of gene copies decreases steadily over the rest of the experiment despite this decline the day 84 samples had a greater number of 16s rrna genes than the day 14 samples throughout the 84 day period the fungal its gene fig 3b was present at least two magnitudes less than the bacterial gene was its genes mm 2 were 10000 in biofilms from days 0 42 by day 52 gene copies had increased reaching a peak at day 70 max 30000 its genes mm 2 this pattern highlights a lag of 20 30 days in the fungi population reaching the maximum quantification in comparison to the bacteria where a peak was reached at day 42 similarly to the bacteria fungal gene copies decreased after this peak but the day 84 biofilms had similar its gene copies as the day 14 samples if the lagged growth and decline trends in bacteria and fungi fig 3a and b gene copies are combined with some weighting for relative size of organism it is possible that the cyclic trend in dna cellular volume fig 2a and b could be explained 3 4 microbial community structure 3 4 1 rarefaction analysis the rarefaction analysis fig 4 yields insights into the sequencing effort and compares the diversity of the observed number of otus at 97 sequence similarity cut off in all the samples over time most of the samples independently of the time of sampling showed rarefaction curves that did not reach a plateau this trend in the curves was particularly marked for fungal communities fig 4b where the samples analysed showed a steeper slope when compared with bacteria suggesting that further sequencing and time series would be needed to reach a full taxonomic representation of the microbial communities this data can also be associated to the fact that biofilm communities did not reach a mature or stable state after three months of development in the system 3 4 2 taxonomic analysis the dominant bacterial class fig 5 a over time in the biofilm samples was proteobacteria and within it betaproteobacteria representing a 70 of the total community on day 34 samples gammaproteobacteria 5 67 and alphaproteobacteria 6 28 were the most abundant classes however the percentages of each of these bacterial classes clearly varied over time and there was high variability between replicates for each day with day 14 having the most extreme example of this the fungal community fig 5b was dominated by ascomycota 10 75 and sordaryomicetes 14 75 but day 14 samples from two coupons 31 and 37 were dissimilar to the other samples and were dominated by dothideomycetes 22 63 and saccharomyctes yeast and yeast like fungi 7 9 saccharomycetes were dominant in the first stages of biofilm development until day 42 and then this fungal group was not substantially represented in the community at genus level fig 6 a massilia max 62 and pseudomonas max 64 were highly abundant on the first days of biofilm development it is notable that on day 14 one of the replicates coupon 9 showed a different microbial community when compared with the other two samples despite of being biological replicates these two samples from day 14 had a higher relative abundance of pseudomonas 38 64 this genus was dominant in the community composition and showed percentages similar to those on day 42 on day 42 samples showed a more diverse community enriched coincident in time with a peak in the cell volume fig 2 a and b with genera such as nevskia methylophilus sphingomonas variovorax and limnohabitants the most abundant genera in fungal communities fig 6b at all sampling times were acremonium 8 70 and neocosmospora 17 77 but in two of the coupons from day 14 31 and 37 there was high abundance of letendraea 36 and cladosporium 19 24 the fungal composition of these two samples was markedly different when compared with the most even structure observed for the samples at other time points this has been also observed as has been previously pointed for the bacterial communities of these two samples the studied succession finished with samples from day 84 showing a high abundance of the genus metacordyceps in the fungal community 2 12 mds analysis of bacteria based on the bray curtis similarity matrix of bacterial sequences with 97 similarity cut off is presented in fig 7 a variability in bacterial community distribution between sample points was observed but these differences were not significant anosim global r 0 143 p value 0 074 and there was no clear temporal pattern for fungi fig 7b the mds analysis revealed a tight clustering of the biofilm samples which corresponds to very little variation in community composition over time as shown in the anosim analysis r 0 023 p value 0 399 3 4 3 diversity and richness indicators fig 8 shows the richness i e number of different otus and diversity i e number of different otus taking into account their relative abundance of bacterial and fungal communities at 97 sequence similarity cut off when compared bacterial communities were more dynamic and diverse than fungi fungal communities showed limited diversity dominated by few taxonomic groups with little change over time when analysed separately the dominance indicator for bacterial communities decreased over time increasing slightly by day 70 and decreasing again by day 84 reaching a minimum value this trend suggests that initially there are a few bacteria that attach and colonize the pipe surfaces from which the biofilm develops towards a more diverse community with less dominating taxa this is supported by the patterns in diversity evenness and richness values however bacterial richness indicator did not change considerably over time fungal communities showed a clear dominance of certain otus which was less marked at the beginning of the data series studied and increased over time similarly evenness was higher for the first 42 days of biofilm development and subsequently fluctuated at lower level after that day the fungal communities were not very diverse with all samples having shannon index values below 2 richness 100 otus fluctuated only slightly among samples clearly few fungal otus dominated the composition of biofilms over time 3 5 correlations between microbiological data table 3 shows a matrix of the non parametric correlations between microbiological data and indicates statistically significant correlations at different p levels the diversity and richness indicators showed a significant positive correlation for bacteria but not for fungi only the number of fungal its genes correlated significantly with richness and diversity for that taxonomic group the cell volume did not significantly correlate with any of the other parameters when associations between different microbial groups were taken into account alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria tended to be correlated positively among them the microbial groups that correlated the most with other microorganisms were the bacteria actinobacteria cytophagia and the fungi dothideomycetes basiodioycota leotiomycetes and ascomycota this result shows that certain microbial groups are more or less likely to co exist within the studied biofilm samples 4 discussion biofilm development was monitored over a three month period and the characteristics of inter taxa interactions were studied to evaluate and detect patterns of temporal change and drivers of biofilm behaviour sequencing results indicated that biofilm developmental patterns were initially driven by bacteria fungi showed a lag response to temporal changes in terms of its gene copy numbers and the community structure displayed limited changes over time generally it was observed that an initial diverse community dominated by bacteria was able to attach and was embedded in the biofilm after one month of development biofilm diversity was temporally reduced coincident with a decrease in cell volume from days 42 52 likely due to a selective mechanism that ultimately yielded a higher diversity after two months development confirming the leading role of bacteria in the process of succession it was observed that the rise in diversity from 34 to 42 days corresponded with a peak in the number of 16s rrna gene copy numbers the observed diversity pattern could have been a result of competition with some bacteria fungi being out competed hence diversity decreasing but the resultant more mature biofilm then being a suitable niche for other cells to subsequently colonize hence diversity increasing again we hypothesize that the daily fluctuating hydraulic conditions were acting as a selective mechanism to shape microbial diversity and structure as has been previously observed in previous research carried out in the same system douterelo et al 2013 fish et al 2017 if daily patterns help to maintain natural diverse communities and more compact and stable biofilms this can have positive implications for the management of dwds safeguarding these systems from the incursion of non desirable microorganisms into biofilms and avoiding their survival and later mobilisation into bulk water the ability of microorganisms to respond to changing environmental conditions has been previously correlated with the bacterial genome size and with their cell volume yooseph et al 2010 here the dominant peak in cell volume day 70 on fig 2a corresponded to the peak in its gene numbers fig 3b which can be explained by the generally larger cell size of fungi particularly of filamentous fungi when forming hyphae if this hypothesis is correct fungi may be more resilient to change and persist over time explaining the limited change in diversity observed during the succession process and the observed lag between the peak in bacteria and fungi genes apparent when comparing fig 3a and b fungi can survive and grow in dwds within biofilms particularly at warmer temperature or in systems where the flow is low or stagnant siqueira et al 2012 douterelo et al 2016b oliveira et al 2016 the night time flow rate of the hydraulic regime selected for these experiments was at the upper end for those observed in 75 100 mm pipes in real systems thus fungi are possibly even more prevalent and important in real operational systems the challenge for water utilities is how to manage control these microorganisms since fungal walls protect cells against mechanical damage and stop the ingress of toxic molecules making these organisms even more resistant to environmental changes cole 1996 in addition fungi can form spores which increase their resistance to disinfection mamane gravetz and linden 2005 sonigo et al 2011 this study reinforces that fungi must be included in monitoring campaigns in dwds when assessing microbial risks it has been suggested that generally microbial communities tend to develop towards a stable community faust et al 2015 or plateau phase in this study no mature stable biofilm communities were established on the pipe walls after three months of development this result suggests that longer time periods may be needed to fully develop mature microbial communities in dwds however determining the scale of change to study succession in an ecosystem is challenging given that depending on the habitat community changes can be triggered by fluctuations in environmental conditions or by a transient perturbation that moves the system into an alternative steady state fierer et al 2010 the experimental dwds used in this study minimised any such transient perturbations by controlling hydraulics and offering a relatively stable physico chemical environment over time while the local source water treatment works and trunk main system prior to the laboratory facility will have had some variations over the 3 months table 2 indicates that these where minimal and they would have been gradual fluctuations rather than rapid dynamic changes hence the changes observed such as those on day 42 are most probably due to intrinsic biofilm processes related to microbial processes during development martiny et al 2003 studied the process of biofilm development over a 3 year period in a model distribution systems using fingerprinting and sanger sequencing to monitor bacterial communities using these methods martiny et al 2003 established that after 500 days the biofilm entered a stable state which was characterised by a greater richness of bacteria we have observed higher bacterial diversity at the final stages of biofilm formation but after three months of biofilm development our communities were not mature or stable we have observed that specific microbial taxa were dominant throughout the succession process with a core microbial population present in the biofilms over time but at different relative abundances thus it can be suggested that these particular microbial taxa are fundamental in directing the process of succession the taxa in this core community include the bacteria pseudomonas massillia and sphingomonas and the fungi acremonium and neocosmopora in a previous study the role of pseudomonas as primary and initial colonizer of the same experimental facility was established in the first 28 days of biofilm development douterelo et al 2014b and here its continual key role in shaping biofilm structure over a longer period of time has been confirmed species belonging to the genus pseudomonas might benefit from what is known as the founder effect as an initial member of biofilms in the pipe surface it will have the advantage over secondary colonizers and will remain dominant over time kelly et al 2014 the presence of core populations have been observed before in water meters of dwds ling et al 2016 biofilms of a chloraminated dwds kelly et al 2014 and in dwds of chlorinated systems douterelo et al 2017 kelly et al 2014 showed in chloraminated systems that the core community was enriched with methanotrophs and methylotrophs methylobacteria and methylophylus were also important representatives of bacterial communities over time in this study and the relative abundance of methylophylus increased after two months of biofilm development methylotrophic bacteria have been found in several drinking water related ecosystems mccoy and vanbriesen 2012 douterelo et al 2014b liu et al 2014b but the reasons behind their abundance in these systems are unclear however methylotrophic bacteria have been related with the generation of holoacetic acid which is a common disinfectant by product in chlorinated systems kelly et al 2014 therefore it is possible that this group is promoted due to the decay of residuals within dwds the fungi acremonium and neocosmopora were also forming part of the fungal bacteria core community acremonium is a filamentous fungus which has been previously isolated in water supply reservoirs drinking water treatment plants and in bulk water of drinking water distribution systems zacheus and martikainen 1995 pereira et al 2010 oliveira et al 2016 bai et al 2017 douterelo et al 2017 and has been associated with the occurrence of taste and odour issues in drinking water bai et al 2017 neocosmopora is commonly found in soils and some species are phytophatogenic aoki et al 2014 it has been found that neocomospora under laboratory conditions is able to uptake chloride miller and budd 1975 and can produce cyclosporine a fungal metabolite with antifungal activity these abilities can explain its supremacy over other microorganisms in mixed species microbial communities in chlorinated dwds this study confirms the presence of acremonium and neocomospora from the early stages of biofilm formation to a more developed biofilm in chlorinated systems forming core communities with bacteria despite of fungi involvement in the organoleptic deterioration of water act as potential pathogens and toxin producers fungi are usually omitted from drinking water regulation and there are no limits or standards regarding their presence in drinking water this study shows the ubiquity of fungi in forming mix species consortium with the most common bacteria in dwds biofilms taking into account these results further consideration should be given to these microorganisms in order to guarantee the delivery of good quality water and to control biofilm formation at the initial stages of development in dwds environmental stressors such as chlorine can influence successional trajectories in the early stages of succession fierer et al 2010 by increasing the abundance of taxa that are resistant to the particular stress and can subsequently modify the habitat by producing eps extracellular polymeric substances to protect the cells from oxidative stress besemer et al 2007 this study indicates the capability of microorganisms to proliferate despite the presence of chlorine residual throughout biofilm development from initial stages with low cell numbers and thinner and more environmentally exposed biofilms to more developed biofilms exhibiting larger biomass and diversity from these results it can be hypothesised that the microbial communities involved in initial attachment to the pipes are more resistant to chlorine then once more eps is produced other species which are less resistant can join the biofilm and survive within it protected against the action of chlorine by the eps hence the biofilm environment may favour more diverse communities over time this suggests that despite its widespread use to control planktonic microorgansims the application of chlorine to control the attached microbial life within dwds is questionable in agreement with our observations simões et al 2016 under controlled laboratory conditions studied the role of inter kingdom interactions in chlorine resistance and showed that associations between fungi and bacteria were ecologically beneficial and promoted resistance to disinfection the stable state of a biofilm is not entirely determined by external factors and interactions among microbial community members might play a key role in determining biofilm status faust et al 2015 these complex interactions between microorganisms and with their environment are key contributors to biofilm dynamics and are relatively unexplored in the context of dwds here the relative abundance of certain bacterial and fungal taxa correlated together including proteobacteria and basidiomycota table 3 both members of a core microbial community present continuously over the successional process in this study fungal bacteria associations can lead to changes in nutrient availability even in the case of dwds where the level of nutrients such as toc in the system are controlled to a certain extent the presence of certain taxa can ease nutrient limitation and it is well known that in other ecosystems bacterial and fungal consortium are able to increase nutrient bioavailability and mobilisation of key nutrients rashid et al 2016 and this can support the process of succession however if biofilms are to a certain extent self sufficient independently of the concentration of available nutrients in the bulk water manipulating or changing external nutrient parameters is not going to stop biofilm formation and development in dwds 5 conclusions diverse bacterial communities cohabiting with more stable fungal communities with the more common taxa ubiquitous and constantly present over time and a temporal variability that does not follow a specific pattern driven by bacteria to deal with the heterogeneity of the process of biofilm development in dwds and to model these systems the focus needs to be on targeting dominant and ubiquitous microorganisms in order to manage microbial risks in dwds we need to better understand the behaviour of these key microorganisms to design monitoring strategies and assess their use as bioindicators of overall biofilm status in the system acknowledgements the research reported here was

19498,the development of phosphorus free and biodegradable scale inhibitors has been paid considerable attention two series of starch graft poly acrylic acid st g paa samples with different grafting ratios and grafted chain distributions that is the number and length of grafted paa chains on the starch backbone were designed and prepared in this study fourier transform infrared and 1h nuclear

and grafted chain distribution on the scale inhibition performance against calcium carbonate were investigated systematically structural morphology significantly influenced the scale inhibition performance of st g paa st g paa with relatively low grafting ratio 97 displayed better scale inhibition effect than samples with similar grafted chain distributions meanwhile under the similar grafting ratios samples with higher number of branched chains with shorter grafted chains displayed better antiscaling performance thus higher scale inhibition rate and lower corresponding optimal dose were obtained different scale inhibition mechanisms were involved in the effects of the structural morphology these mechanisms were investigated in detail from the molecular levels using scanning electron microscopy and x ray diffraction graphical abstract image keywords starch graft poly acrylic acid scale inhibition structural morphology grafting ratio grafted chain distribution inhibition mechanism 1 introduction scale inhibitor is a very important water treatment agent because scales commonly occur in desalination processes cooling water systems and oil fields boels et al 2012 feiner et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 this condition can cause many serious problems such as membrane fouling in desalination processes exacerbation of corrosion and reduced thermal conductivity of pipelines boels et al 2012 feiner et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 addition of scale inhibitor is an effective approach to control scale formation as a result of the various efficient effects of antiscalants such as chelation dispersion lattice distortion and threshold effects darton 2000 li et al 2011 the use of scale inhibitor allows reduction of membrane scaling stable operation of cooling water systems and high recovery in desalination processes greenlee et al 2010 li et al 2011 scale inhibitors could be classified as phosphorus containing and phosphorus free inhibitors with the former as the most popular inhibitors worldwide for their good cost effective performance lin and singer 2005 however inorganic or organic phosphonate increases the phosphorus content in water leading to heavy eutrophication and increased biofouling of membrane systems boels et al 2012 chaussemier et al 2015 thus many countries have limited the application of phosphorus containing scale inhibitors chaussemier et al 2015 guo et al 2014 low phosphorus or phosphorus free scale inhibitors are more favorable many synthetic polymeric scale inhibitors without phosphorus have been reported these inhibitors include poly acrylic acid poly maleic acid and their various copolymers amjad and koutsoukos 2014 dietzsch et al 2013 guo et al 2014 however these polymeric antiscalants are not biodegradable and some of these compounds are ter or tetra copolymers which are complex and costly amjad and koutsoukos 2014 dietzsch et al 2013 guo et al 2014 thus the development of green scale inhibitors which are phosphorus free biodegradable and inexpensive has attracted significant attention chaussemier et al 2015 hasson et al 2011 wang et al 2017 polyaspartic acid pasp and polyepoxysuccinic acid pesa are very famous green scale inhibitors chaussemier et al 2015 hasson et al 2011 yang et al 2007 these compounds contain abundant active functional groups such as carboxyl and amino groups and exhibit good scale inhibition performance due to their efficient chelation dispersion and lattice distortion chaussemier et al 2015 hasson et al 2011 moreover pasp and pesa are especially suitable for strongly basic and high hardness systems for membrane separation boiler water treatment circulating cooling water treatment and other fields chaussemier et al 2015 hasson et al 2011 yang et al 2007 polysaccharide such as starch st chitosan inulin and alginate is a class of natural polymers and also contains abundant functional groups including hydroxyl carboxyl and amino groups resulting in good chelation and dispersion effects boels and witkamp 2011 chaussemier et al 2015 guo et al 2013 lakshtanov et al 2011 tao et al 2016 wang et al 2017 moreover these natural polymers are inexpensive widely available and easily biodegradable compared to pasp and pesa thus polysaccharides have significant potential as green scale inhibitors boels and witkamp 2011 chaussemier et al 2015 guo et al 2013 lakshtanov et al 2011 wang et al 2017 however although the use of polysaccharides and their derivatives as antiscalants have been reported boels and witkamp 2011 chaussemier et al 2015 guo et al 2013 lakshtanov et al 2011 wang et al 2017 polysaccharide based scale inhibitors could not be used widely because of the difficulty in controlling their complex molecular structures to meet the application requirements such as molecular weight degree of functional groups substitution and its distribution on the polymer backbone and chain architectures linear branching and star like forms flory 1953 sperling 2006 the molecular structure substantially determines the final performance of a material flory 1953 based on an established structure activity relationship a suitable material could be prepared to achieve the desired performance and optimize its application however this strategy based on polysaccharide based antiscalants is rarely reported which limits the practical application of these antiscalants st is one of the very popular polysaccharides because of its abundant source and low cost bemiller and whistler 2009 however st could not be used directly as an antiscalant because of its poor water solubility given that anionic groups such as carboxylic and sulfonic groups usually play important roles in scale inhibition several anionic st based scale inhibitors have been reported using various chemical modifications guo et al 2013 wang et al 2017 these scale inhibitors were mainly obtained using oxidation or etherification and the anionic groups were distributed on the st backbone grafting copolymerization is also a useful modification process and could introduce functional groups onto st at branch chains fanta 1973 this approach results in distinct structural morphologies and significant application performances of grafted st derivatives therefore the relationship between the molecular structural morphology of a grafted st namely grafting ratio and grafted chain distribution and its scale inhibition properties is an interesting topic st graft poly acrylic acid st g paa is one of the simplest grafted st samples which contains abundant hydroxyl and carboxyl groups fanta 1973 st g paa may thus own good scale inhibition performance and have significant application potentials as a commercial scale inhibitor however little work concerning st g paa used as a scale inhibitor has been reported and studied systematically until now in this work various st g paa samples with different grafting ratios and grafted chain distributions were easily obtained in addition to the dose effect the effects of the structural morphology of st g paa on the scale inhibition efficiency ie of calcium carbonate caco3 were evaluated in detail furthermore the scale inhibition mechanisms were studied systematically from the molecular level based on changes in the apparent morphology and crystal structure of caco3 scale by scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray diffraction xrd accordingly the relationship between the molecular structural morphologies and scale inhibition performance of st g paa was established 2 experimental section 2 1 reagents st with weight average molecular weight of 1 5 105 g mol was supplied by jinhui corn development co ltd binzhou china acrylic acid aa r g tansoole tech co ltd was purified by vacuum distillation before use ammonium persulfate aps sodium borate acetone and hydrochloric acid are of analytical grade and obtained from shanghai lingfeng chemical reagent co ltd sodium bicarbonate a r and sodium hydroxide a r were from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd anhydrous calcium chloride a r was purchased from xilong chemical reagent co ltd and absolute ethyl alcohol 95 was from yasheng chemical co ltd wuxi china all other chemicals were from nanjing chemical reagent co ltd and used without further purification 2 2 preparation of st g paa st g paa was prepared according to a previous report liu and wei 2016 briefly 5 0 g of starch was dispersed in deionized water under mechanically stirring for 1 h at 70 c after sufficient gelatinization a desired amount of aps as the initiator was rapidly fed into the mixture at 55 c under nitrogen atmosphere then an aa monomer solution was added dropwise for 15 min after reacting for 3 h at 55 c the aqueous mixture was poured into 500 ml of 95 ethanol solution the excess salt and by products were removed by filtration and washing the crude product was obtained after drying in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 48 h soxhlet extraction was used to further remove impurities and acetone was used as the extractant after full drying the target product st g paa was prepared this method was also used to prepare st g paa samples with different grafting ratios and grafted chain distributions but amount of initiator and mass feeding ratios of st to aa were varied the mass of st was kept constant in each reaction the detailed preparation conditions are listed in table 1 2 3 characterization 2 3 1 instruments the following instruments were used to characterize the samples tensor 27 ftir spectrometer bruker germany

corporation japan operated at a voltage of 40 kv and current of 30 ma using cu kα radiation λ 0 15418 nm and a quanta 250 feg sem fei usa under an acceleration voltage of 5 kv 2 3 2 calculation of grafting ratio the grafting ratio of st g paa is the molar percentage of aa monomer to a saccharide ring of st in st g paa this value was measured by potentiometric titration katchalsky and spitnik 1947 and calculated as follows 1 grafting ratio w 1 72 w 0 162 100 where w 0 and w 1 are the masses of the st backbone and the grafted paa in st g paa respectively 2 3 3 evaluation of grafted chain distribution the grafted chain distribution of st g paa was characterized by the average number of grafted chain per graft copolymer n and the average number of the grafted monomers per grafted chain l however the actual n and l of a graft copolymer is very difficult to precisely determine using current characterization methods because various environmental factors affect the initiation efficiency of initiator and graft copolymerization efficiency fanta 1973 herein these two variables were roughly estimated theoretically using equations 2 and 3 on the basis of several assumptions according to our previous work liu et al 2017 the values are listed in table 1 2 n 2 η m aps m st m aps m st 3 l m aa m aa m st m st n where m aps m aa and m st are the masses of aps aa and st respectively m aps m aa and m st are the molar masses of aps aa and the saccharide ring of st respectively meanwhile η is the percentage of the actual disassociated aps and this value is approximately 3 4 in this study fmc corporation 2001 the series of st based samples were all obtained using almost the same conditions but with different masses of the monomer and initiator therefore all the theoretically estimated n and l had the same systematic errors and were comparable to the corresponding real values 2 4 scale inhibition performance of st g paa against caco3 scale static scale inhibition test was adopted to evaluate the scale inhibition performance of st g paa on the caco3 scale according to the national standard of china gb t16632 2008 cacl2 and nahco3 aqueous solution were thoroughly mixed in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask ca2 and hco3 have the same molar concentration of 5 mmol l then a certain amount of st g paa scale inhibitor was added to the resultant solution while the ph was adjusted to 8 0 the specimens were heated for 10 h in a water bath at 70 c after the reaction ended the solution was cooled to the room temperature and then filtered to remove precipitates edta standard solution was used to determine the concentration of ca2 in the filtrate a blank test was also conducted under the same conditions but without addition of scale inhibitors the antiscale efficiency of st g paa was calculated as follows zhang et al 2010 4 inhibition efficiency v 2 v 1 v 0 v 1 100 where v 0 ml is the consumed volume of edta solution to titrate the synthetic water sample without addition of scale inhibitors and incubation treatment v 1 and v 2 ml are the consumed volumes of edta solution in the absence and presence of scale inhibitors after the 10 h incubation at 70 c respectively the inhibition tests were all repeated at least 3 times and the final results were the average of three runs the relative errors of experimental results were below 5 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of st g paa various st g paa samples with different structural morphologies were prepared by adjusting the feeding masses of the aa monomer and aps initiator the ftir and 1h nmr spectra were measured to characterize the structures of the samples fig 1 the characteristic peak at 1558 cm 1 in the ftir spectra fig 1 a and b was due to carboxyl groups of the paa grafted chains zhu et al 2009 and new signals at 1 25 1 8 ppm and 2 2 ppm in the 1h nmr spectra of st g paa fig 1 c and d were attributed to ch2 and ch in the paa grafted chains respectively chen et al 2016 thus both spectra confirmed the successful formation of st g paas the grafting ratios of various st g paas were calculated according to the potentiometric titration method katchalsky and spitnik 1947 and the results are listed in table 1 accordingly the grafting ratios increased from st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 with increase in aa dose st g paa a to st g paa e had the same feeding masses of aa monomer and showed similar grafting ratios except for st g paa a this phenomenon might be due to the fact that st g paa a had a small amount of initiator resulting in relatively poor graft copolymerization efficiency and slightly low grafting ratio in addition the n and l values of the different st g paas were evaluated using theoretical estimation according to equations 2 and 3 respectively table 1 table 1 shows that the changes in l from st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 were consistent with those of the calculated grafting ratios moreover n theoretically increased but l decreased from st g paa a to st g paa e with increase in initiator due to more initiated free radicals to propagate the graft chains chen et al 2015 li et al 2013 pan 2011 thus two series of st g paa samples with different structural morphologies were obtained one series designated as st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 exhibited similar numbers of grafted chain but different grafting ratios the other series designated as st g paa b to st g paa e had similar grafting ratios but different numbers of grafted chain scheme 1 describes the different structural morphologies of the various st g paa samples 3 2 scale inhibition of st g paa 3 2 1 effects of dose then ies of st and the two series of st g paas against caco3 were investigated and the results are shown in fig 2 st showed almost no scale inhibition in the measured dose range after grafting paa the ie of the st g paa samples was significantly improved indicating that paa branched chains played important roles in the inhibition of caco3 scale this result was due to the introduced anionic carboxyl groups as scale inhibition active sites the ies of most st g paas initially increased with the dose however after reaching an optimum value their ies became constant or slightly decreased with dose except for st g paa a fig 2 at low doses the active sites on the antiscalant were insufficient to inhibit all calcium ions such as chelating effect further increase in dose would lead to the gradual saturation of the inhibition effect simultaneously the increase in polymeric concentration would be beneficial to improve the dissolution equilibrium of caco3 due to preferential formation of water soluble calcium coordination compounds with larger binding constants by chelation which effect reduced the concentration of free ca2 in solution and finally inhibited the formation of caco3 crystals butler et al 2006 additionally the paa branches of st g paa could also adsorb on the formed small scale caco3 nanocrystals via chelation of surface ca2 ions by dissociated coo groups disperse the nanocrystals through charge repulsion and or steric stabilization and inhibit precipitation chaussemier et al 2015 however flocculation caused by excessive antiscalants might hinder the scale inhibition effect and even promote the aggregation and formation of caco3 precipitate qiang et al 2013 in addition hydrogen bonds were more easily formed among st g paas at high polymeric content this phenomenon would consume the scale inhibition active sites namely carboxyl groups and reduce the final inhibition efficiency wang et al 2016 the unusual continuous increase in ie by st g paa a with dose fig 2 b might be due to the distinct macromolecular structure of this sample i e containing few number of grafted chains but long paa branched chain which would be discussed in detail in the following section 3 2 2 effects of grafting ratio in addition to the external factors the structural factors of antiscalants intrinsically affected their scale inhibition performance elias 1984 fu et al 2010 verraest et al 1996 wang et al 2016 grafting ratio is an important structural factor of graft copolymers the carboxyl content in st g paa directly related to grafting ratio had a great effect on the scale inhibition of st g paa in this case the ies of st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 with similar numbers of grafted chains but different grafting ratios are illustrated in fig 2 a accordingly the dependence of ie on grafting ratio is summarized in fig 3 a according to figs 2 a and 3 a when the grafting ratio was kept at a relatively low level 97 the scale inhibition effect of st g paa on caco3 st g paa 1 st g paa 2 and st g paa 3 was significant however the inhibition performance was evidently reduced with high grafting ratio resulting in increased optimal dose but decreased ie this phenomenon might be due to the fact that this polymeric antiscalant with suitable content of carboxyl groups could efficiently improve the dissolution equilibrium of caco3 chaussemier et al 2015 when the grafting ratio was too high 187 the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bond wang et al 2016 and the bridging flocculation effect of st g paa qiang et al 2013 caused by the increased molecular weight were both enhanced this phenomenon resulted in the weakened scale inhibition performance of st g paa with higher carboxyl contents macdougall et al 1996 3 2 3 effects of grafted chain distribution the effects of the grafted chain distribution were also studied table 1 shows that st g paa b to st g paa e had similar grafting ratios but different average numbers of grafted chain and their ies are exhibited in fig 2 b two stage increase in ie was observed with dose in st g paa especially for st g paa c st g paa d and st g paa e this result indicated multiple scale inhibition effects and underlying mechanisms the dependence of the ie on the grafted chain distribution in st g paa is shown in fig 3 b evident relationship was found between the scale inhibition performance of st g paa and the distribution of grafted paa side chains figs 2 b and 3 b with similar grafting ratios higher average number of paa grafted chains st g paa d and st g paa e resulted in better inhibition performance this phenomenon led to a sharper slope at the initial dose stage of scale inhibition fig 2 b lower optimal dose and higher inhibition efficiency thus the closer the spatial distance of the two adjacent paa grafted chains was the better the corresponding scale inhibition effect would be this result may be due to the positive synergistic effect of the two adjacent grafted chains on the efficient chelation of calcium ions which enhanced the stability of the ca st g paa complex and showed better scale inhibition performance mccartney and alexander 1958 moreover st g paa with higher average number of grafted chains contained more terminals of macromolecular chains which were usually more active fanta 1973 resulting in the higher activity of st g paa and higher scale inhibition performance st g paa a had a relatively low grafting ratio but very few grafted chains thus this compound was not able to reach the inhibition equilibrium in the measured dose range resulting in relatively poor inhibition performance in addition comparison of the two series of st g paa samples showed that st g paa with higher number of grafted chains generally exhibited more significant scale inhibition performance a sharper slope at the initial dose stage of scale inhibition and higher inhibition efficiency were obtained fig 2 thus the grafted chain distribution might be a more sensitive factor for the scale inhibition of st g paa 3 3 investigation of scale inhibition mechanisms 3 3 1 sem the scale inhibition mechanisms of st g paas were further investigated by directly observing the surface morphology of precipitated caco3 scales using sem figs 4 and 5 fig 4 shows the scanning electron micrographs of caco3 crystals obtained in the absence of antiscalants fig 4 a and those in the presence of various st g paa samples with different grafting ratios but similar grafted chain distribution st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 fig 4 b g the blank caco3 crystals had regular diamond shape fig 4 a which showed a calcite configuration zhang et al 2007b after adding various st g paas the formed caco3 scales mostly retained regular diamond shape and exhibited the same crystal configuration as that without scale inhibitor fig 4 b g this result indicates that st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 could not efficiently enter the crystal lattices during the normal growth of caco3 crystal thus the dominant scale inhibition mechanisms of these st g paas were not lattice distortion zhao et al 2016 chelation and dispersion effects played important roles in this case st g paas could not only chelate with free ca2 in solution butler et al 2006 but also adsorb on the formed caco3 nanocrystals via bonding of surface ca2 ions by dissociated coo groups the latter effect could well disperse the nanocrystals through charge repulsion and effectively inhibit precipitation chaussemier et al 2015 moreover these two effects would be weakened with increase in grafting ratios and molecular weight of st g paas because of their enhanced bridging flocculation and easy formation of intermolecular hydrogen bond qiang et al 2013 wang et al 2016 fig 5 shows the surface morphologies of the caco3 scales obtained in the presence of another series of st g paa samples with different grafted chain numbers but similar grafting ratios st g paa b to st g paa e contrary to the results obtained from st g paas with different grafting ratios st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 fig 4 many spherical or amorphous caco3 scales appeared in the precipitates with increasing average number of grafted paa chains fig 5 e and f this result indicated that under the same grafting ratio st g paa with more grafted chains on the st backbone facilitated the lattice twisted effect during caco3 crystal growth resulting in irregular scale shapes thus multiple inhibition effects and mechanisms including lattice distortion chelation and dispersion worked together resulting in significant scale inhibition performance fig 2 b in addition most caco3 scales obtained from st g paa a st g paa b and st g paa c with relatively low number of branched chain maintained a diamond like regular structure fig 5 b c and 5 d respectively indicating their very minor effect of lattice distortion 3 3 2 xrd the crystal structures of caco3 scales obtained under various conditions were further analyzed by xrd figs 6 and 7 caco3 normally has three kinds of crystal structures namely calcite aragonite and vaterite butler et al 2006 calcite is the most stable thermodynamically crystalline form followed by aragonite and vaterite butler et al 2006 gal et al 2002 kırboga and öner 2012 wang et al 2014 based on figs 6 a and 7 a the xrd characteristic diffraction peaks of the caco3 scale without addition of scale inhibitor were at 23 04 29 47 36 05 39 48 43 19 47 54 and 48 53 these values indicated that the blank caco3 crystal was mainly composed of calcite butler et al 2006 gal et al 2002 kırboga and öner 2012 wang et al 2014 fig 6 b g shows the xrd patterns of caco3 scale obtained in the presence of various st g paa samples with different grafting ratios but similar grafted chain distributions st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 accordingly most of the crystalline phases by st g paas with various grafting ratios were unchanged and very similar to that in the absence of antiscalant fig 6 a that is calcite phase these results further confirmed that chelation and dispersion were the dominant inhibition mechanisms for these st g paas zhao et al 2016 which were consistent with the sem results fig 4 xrd results of caco3 scales obtained in the presence of the other series of st g paas st g paa a to st g paa e fig 7 were also consistent with the sem results fig 5 several new diffraction peaks at 24 90 27 05 32 78 43 85 and 50 08 which were ascribed to vaterite butler et al 2006 gal et al 2002 kırboga and öner 2012 wang et al 2014 appeared in the xrd patterns of caco3 by st g paa d and st g paa e with higher number of grafted chains this result suggested a few unstable crystalline phases caused by lattice distortion existed fig 7 e and f moreover lattice distortion was obviously more significant in st g paa e with much more paa grafted chains under similar grafting ratio zhang et al 2007a paa grafted chains could adsorb onto the active crystal growth sites hinder the regular growth of the scale crystal and destroy the caco3 crystal structure and shape these effects are evidently enhanced in the st g paa samples with more paa grafted chains 3 3 3 analysis on molecular structure level the additional carboxyl groups on the paa branched chains of st g paa acted as the inhibition active sites to efficiently reduce scale formation however different st g paas with distinct molecular structural morphologies scheme 1 exhibited remarkably varied scale inhibition performances and followed various mechanisms normally under similar numbers of grafted chain st g paa with relatively low grafting ratio showed good scale inhibition performance against caco3 fig 2 a st g paa with high grafting ratio exhibited evidently reduced inhibition efficiency this phenomenon was due to the increased molecular weight which enhanced the bridging flocculation effect qiang et al 2013 and consumption of more carboxyl groups by the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bond wang et al 2016 at this time chelation and dispersion were the dominant mechanisms of these st g paas in the inhibition of caco3 in addition under similar grafting ratios st g paa with higher average grafted chain number exhibited better inhibition efficiency fig 2 b and multiple effects such as chelation dispersion and lattice distortion were involved in the inhibition of caco3 the lattice distortion of st g paa was obviously enhanced with increasing number of grafted chains zhang et al 2007a an extreme case was observed in carboxymethyl starch cms in which all carboxyl groups were distributed on the st backbone scheme 1 e this phenomenon was also similar to an ideal graft copolymerization i e when the amount of initiator is large enough each initiation site on the st backbone can only graft one aa based on our previous study wang et al 2017 most caco3 crystals obtained in the presence of cms changed into unstable vaterite phase this phenomenon might be due to two factors one factor is the positive synergistic effect of two adjacent carboxyl groups on the efficient chelation of calcium ions mccartney and alexander 1958 the other factor is that the terminal groups of macromolecular chains usually exhibit higher activity fanta 1973 thus higher number of grafted chains indicated more terminal groups causing higher activity and higher scale inhibition performance of st g paa st g paa a with few number of grafted chains but long paa branched chain exhibited weakened lattice distortion but enhanced dispersion although st g paa a showed worse scale inhibition performance than those with higher number of grafted chains but shorter length its inhibition efficiency exhibited distinct continuous growth fig 2 b 4 conclusion st g paa was employed as a green antiscalant because st was environment friendly and inexpensive in addition to the dose effect the effects of the structural morphology that is grafting ratio and grafted chain distribution of st g paa on its inhibition against caco3 were studied in detail two series of st g paa were designed and prepared by adjusting the feeding mass of aa monomer and aps initiator one series had similar numbers of grafted chains but different grafting ratios while the other had similar grafting ratios but different numbers of grafted chain based on the apparent inhibition performance direct observation of scale surface morphology by sem and determination of caco3 crystal structure by xrd st g paa with relatively low grafting ratio but higher number of grafted chain showed better inhibition performance than the other samples this phenomenon was due to the synergistic effect of two adjacent paa branched chains for efficient chelation effect and increased activity of st g paa as a result its higher number of terminal groups of branched chains moreover the grafted chain distribution of st g paa might be more significant than grafting ratio in further improving its scale inhibition performance in addition to chelation and dispersion lattice distortion was also involved with the increase in the number of grafted chains to a certain extent moreover the ie of st g paa significantly weakened with increase in grafting ratio 187 because of the increased molecular weight this phenomenon enhanced the bridging flocculation effect and consumption of more carboxyl groups by the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bond in short multiple short paa branches generally increased the effectiveness of st g paa in inhibiting precipitation of caco3 from solution this st g paa might be also efficient in reduction of scale deposition on pipes and membranes in real applications such as cooling water systems and membrane desalination processes due to its effective chelation dispersion and lattice distortion effects however more detailed investigation are preciously needed due to much more complicated situations in actual environments such as the interferences of coexisted various inorganic organic and biological matters 
19498,the development of phosphorus free and biodegradable scale inhibitors has been paid considerable attention two series of starch graft poly acrylic acid st g paa samples with different grafting ratios and grafted chain distributions that is the number and length of grafted paa chains on the starch backbone were designed and prepared in this study fourier transform infrared and 1h nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were used to further characterize the molecular structures of the st g paas in addition to dose the effects of the structural morphologies of st g paa namely grafting ratio and grafted chain distribution on the scale inhibition performance against calcium carbonate were investigated systematically structural morphology significantly influenced the scale inhibition performance of st g paa st g paa with relatively low grafting ratio 97 displayed better scale inhibition effect than samples with similar grafted chain distributions meanwhile under the similar grafting ratios samples with higher number of branched chains with shorter grafted chains displayed better antiscaling performance thus higher scale inhibition rate and lower corresponding optimal dose were obtained different scale inhibition mechanisms were involved in the effects of the structural morphology these mechanisms were investigated in detail from the molecular levels using scanning electron microscopy and x ray diffraction graphical abstract image keywords starch graft poly acrylic acid scale inhibition structural morphology grafting ratio grafted chain distribution inhibition

chelation dispersion lattice distortion and threshold effects darton 2000 li et al 2011 the use of scale inhibitor allows reduction of membrane scaling stable operation of cooling water systems and high recovery in desalination processes greenlee et al 2010 li et al 2011 scale inhibitors could be classified as phosphorus containing and phosphorus free inhibitors with the former as the most popular inhibitors worldwide for their good cost effective performance lin and singer 2005 however inorganic or organic phosphonate increases the phosphorus content in water leading to heavy eutrophication and increased biofouling of membrane systems boels et al 2012 chaussemier et al 2015 thus many countries have limited the application of phosphorus containing scale inhibitors chaussemier et al 2015 guo et al 2014 low phosphorus or phosphorus free scale inhibitors are more favorable many synthetic polymeric scale inhibitors without phosphorus have been reported these inhibitors include poly acrylic acid poly maleic acid and their various copolymers amjad and koutsoukos 2014 dietzsch et al 2013 guo et al 2014 however these polymeric antiscalants are not biodegradable and some of these compounds are ter or tetra copolymers which are complex and costly amjad and koutsoukos 2014 dietzsch et al 2013 guo et al 2014 thus the development of green scale inhibitors which are phosphorus free biodegradable and inexpensive has attracted significant attention chaussemier et al 2015 hasson et al 2011 wang et al 2017 polyaspartic acid pasp and polyepoxysuccinic acid pesa are very famous green scale inhibitors chaussemier et al 2015 hasson et al 2011 yang et al 2007 these compounds contain abundant active functional groups such as carboxyl

polymers are inexpensive widely available and easily biodegradable compared to pasp and pesa thus polysaccharides have significant potential as green scale inhibitors boels and witkamp 2011

this approach results in distinct structural morphologies and significant application performances of grafted st derivatives therefore the relationship between the molecular structural morphology of a grafted st namely grafting ratio and grafted chain distribution and its scale inhibition properties is an interesting topic st graft poly acrylic acid st g paa is one of the simplest grafted st samples which contains abundant hydroxyl and carboxyl groups fanta 1973 st g paa may thus own good scale inhibition performance and have significant application potentials as a commercial scale inhibitor however little work concerning st g paa used as a scale inhibitor has been reported and studied systematically until now in this work various st g paa samples with different grafting ratios and grafted chain distributions were easily obtained in addition to the dose effect the effects of the structural morphology of st g paa on the scale inhibition efficiency ie of calcium carbonate caco3 were evaluated in detail furthermore the scale inhibition mechanisms were studied systematically from the molecular level based on changes in the apparent morphology and crystal structure of caco3 scale by scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray diffraction xrd accordingly the relationship between the molecular structural morphologies and scale inhibition performance of st g paa was established 2 experimental section 2 1 reagents st with weight average molecular weight of 1 5 105 g mol was supplied by jinhui corn development co ltd binzhou china acrylic acid aa r g tansoole tech

alcohol 95 was from yasheng chemical co ltd wuxi china all other chemicals were from nanjing chemical reagent co ltd and used without further purification 2 2 preparation of st g paa st g paa was prepared according to a previous report liu and wei 2016 briefly 5 0 g of starch was dispersed in deionized water under mechanically stirring for 1 h at 70 c after sufficient gelatinization a desired amount of aps as the initiator was rapidly fed into the mixture at 55 c under nitrogen atmosphere then an aa monomer solution was added dropwise for 15 min after reacting for 3 h at 55 c the aqueous mixture was poured into 500 ml of 95 ethanol solution the excess salt and by products were removed by filtration and washing the crude product was obtained after drying in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 48 h soxhlet extraction was used to further remove impurities and acetone was used as the extractant after full drying the target product st g paa was prepared this method was also used to prepare st g paa samples with different grafting ratios and grafted chain distributions but amount of initiator and mass feeding ratios of st to aa were varied the mass of st was kept constant in each reaction the detailed preparation conditions are listed in table 1 2 3 characterization 2 3 1 instruments the following instruments were used to characterize the samples tensor 27 ftir spectrometer bruker germany

grafting ratio the grafting ratio of st g paa is the molar percentage of aa monomer to a saccharide ring of st in st g paa this value was measured by potentiometric titration katchalsky and spitnik 1947 and calculated as follows 1 grafting ratio w 1 72 w 0 162 100 where w 0 and w 1 are the masses of the st backbone and the grafted paa in st g paa respectively 2 3 3 evaluation of grafted chain distribution the grafted chain distribution of st g paa was characterized by the average number of grafted chain per graft copolymer n and the average number of the grafted monomers per grafted chain l however the actual n and l of a graft copolymer is very difficult to precisely determine using current characterization methods because various environmental factors affect the initiation efficiency of initiator and graft copolymerization efficiency fanta 1973 herein these two variables were roughly estimated theoretically using equations 2 and 3 on the basis of several assumptions according to our previous work liu et al 2017 the values are listed in table 1 2 n 2 η m aps m st m aps m st 3 l m aa m aa m st m st n where m aps m aa and m st are the masses of aps aa and st respectively m aps m aa and m st are the molar masses of aps aa and the saccharide ring of st respectively meanwhile η is the percentage of the actual disassociated aps and this value is approximately 3 4 in this study fmc corporation 2001 the series of st based samples were all obtained using almost the same conditions but with different masses of the monomer and initiator therefore all the theoretically estimated n and l had the same systematic errors and were comparable to the corresponding real values 2 4 scale inhibition performance of st g paa against caco3 scale static scale inhibition test was adopted to evaluate the scale inhibition performance of st g paa on the caco3 scale according to the national standard of china gb t16632 2008 cacl2 and nahco3 aqueous solution were thoroughly mixed in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask ca2 and hco3 have the same molar concentration of 5 mmol l then a certain amount of st g paa scale inhibitor was added to the resultant solution while the ph was adjusted to 8 0 the specimens were heated for 10 h in a water bath at 70 c after the reaction ended the solution was cooled to the room temperature and then filtered to remove precipitates edta standard solution was used to determine the concentration of ca2 in the filtrate a blank test was also conducted under the same conditions but without addition of scale inhibitors the antiscale efficiency of st g paa was calculated as follows zhang et al 2010 4 inhibition efficiency v 2 v 1 v 0 v 1 100 where v 0 ml is the consumed volume of edta solution to titrate the synthetic water sample without addition of scale inhibitors and incubation treatment v 1 and v 2 ml are the consumed volumes of edta solution in the absence and presence of scale inhibitors after the 10 h incubation at 70 c respectively the inhibition tests were all repeated at least 3 times and the final results were the average of three runs the relative errors of experimental results were below 5 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of st g paa various st g paa samples with different structural morphologies were prepared by adjusting the feeding masses of the aa monomer and aps initiator the ftir and 1h nmr spectra were measured to characterize the structures of the samples fig 1 the characteristic peak at 1558 cm 1 in the ftir spectra fig 1 a and b was due to carboxyl groups of the paa grafted chains zhu et al 2009 and new signals at 1 25 1 8 ppm and 2 2 ppm in the 1h nmr spectra of st g paa fig 1 c and d were attributed to ch2 and ch in the paa grafted chains respectively chen et al 2016 thus both spectra confirmed the successful formation of st g paas the grafting ratios of various st g paas were calculated according to the potentiometric titration method katchalsky and spitnik 1947 and the results are listed in table 1 accordingly the grafting ratios increased from st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 with increase in aa dose st g paa a to st g paa e had the same feeding masses of aa monomer and showed similar grafting ratios except for st g paa a this phenomenon might be due to the fact that st g paa a had a small amount of initiator resulting in relatively poor graft copolymerization efficiency and slightly low grafting ratio in addition the n and l values of the different st g paas were evaluated using theoretical estimation according to equations 2 and 3 respectively table 1 table 1 shows that the changes in l from st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 were consistent with those of the calculated grafting ratios moreover n theoretically increased but l decreased from st g paa a to st g paa e with increase in initiator due to more initiated free radicals to propagate the graft chains chen et al 2015 li et al 2013 pan 2011 thus two series of st g paa samples with different structural morphologies were obtained one series designated as st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 exhibited similar numbers of grafted chain but different grafting ratios the other series designated as st g paa b to st g paa e had similar grafting ratios but different numbers of grafted chain scheme 1 describes the different structural morphologies of the various st g paa samples 3 2 scale inhibition of st g paa 3 2 1 effects of dose then ies of st and the two series of st g paas against caco3 were investigated and the results are shown in fig 2 st showed almost no scale inhibition in the measured dose range after grafting paa the ie of the st g paa samples was significantly improved indicating that paa branched chains played important roles in the inhibition of caco3 scale this result was due to the introduced anionic carboxyl groups as scale inhibition active sites the ies of most st g paas initially increased with the dose however after reaching an optimum value their ies became constant or slightly decreased with dose except for st g paa a fig 2 at low doses the active sites on the antiscalant were insufficient to inhibit all calcium ions such as chelating effect further increase in dose would lead to the gradual saturation of the inhibition effect simultaneously the increase in polymeric concentration would be beneficial to improve the dissolution equilibrium of caco3 due to preferential formation of water soluble calcium coordination compounds with larger binding constants by chelation which effect reduced the concentration of free ca2 in solution and finally inhibited the formation of caco3 crystals butler et al 2006 additionally the paa branches of st g paa could also adsorb on the formed small scale caco3 nanocrystals via chelation of surface ca2 ions by dissociated coo groups disperse the nanocrystals through charge repulsion and or steric stabilization and inhibit precipitation chaussemier et al 2015 however flocculation caused by excessive antiscalants might hinder the scale inhibition effect and even promote the aggregation and formation of caco3 precipitate qiang et al 2013 in addition hydrogen bonds were more easily formed among st g paas at high polymeric content this phenomenon would consume the scale inhibition active sites namely carboxyl groups and reduce the final inhibition efficiency wang et al 2016 the unusual continuous increase in ie by st g paa a with dose fig 2 b might be due to the distinct macromolecular structure of this sample i e containing few number of grafted chains but long paa branched chain which would be discussed in detail in the following section 3 2 2 effects of grafting ratio in addition to the external factors the structural factors of antiscalants intrinsically affected their scale inhibition performance elias 1984 fu et al 2010 verraest et al 1996 wang et al 2016 grafting ratio is an important structural factor of graft copolymers the carboxyl content in st g paa directly related to grafting ratio had a great effect on the scale inhibition of st g paa in this case the ies of st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 with similar numbers of grafted chains but different grafting ratios are illustrated in fig 2 a accordingly the dependence of ie on grafting ratio is summarized in fig 3 a according to figs 2 a and 3 a when the grafting ratio was kept at a relatively low level 97 the scale inhibition effect of st g paa on caco3 st g paa 1 st g paa 2 and st g paa 3 was significant however the inhibition performance was evidently reduced with high grafting ratio resulting in increased optimal dose but decreased ie this phenomenon might be due to the fact that this polymeric antiscalant with suitable content of carboxyl groups could efficiently improve the dissolution equilibrium of caco3 chaussemier et al 2015 when the grafting ratio was too high 187 the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bond wang et al 2016 and the bridging flocculation effect of st g paa qiang et al 2013 caused by the increased molecular weight were both enhanced this phenomenon resulted in the weakened scale inhibition performance of st g paa with higher carboxyl contents macdougall et al 1996 3 2 3 effects of grafted chain distribution the effects of the grafted chain distribution were also studied table 1 shows that st g paa b to st g paa e had similar grafting ratios but different average numbers of grafted chain and their ies are exhibited in fig 2 b two stage increase in ie was observed with dose in st g paa especially for st g paa c st g paa d and st g paa e this result indicated multiple scale inhibition effects and underlying mechanisms the dependence of the ie on the grafted chain distribution in st g paa is shown in fig 3 b evident relationship was found between the scale inhibition performance of st g paa and the distribution of grafted paa side chains figs 2 b and 3 b with similar grafting ratios higher average number of paa grafted chains st g paa d and st g paa e resulted in better inhibition performance this phenomenon led to a sharper slope at the initial dose stage of scale inhibition fig 2 b lower optimal dose and higher inhibition efficiency thus the closer the spatial distance of the two adjacent paa grafted chains was the better the corresponding scale inhibition effect would be this result may be due to the positive synergistic effect of the two adjacent grafted chains on the efficient chelation of calcium ions which enhanced the stability of the ca st g paa complex and showed better scale inhibition performance mccartney and alexander 1958 moreover st g paa with higher average number of grafted chains contained more terminals of macromolecular chains which were usually more active fanta 1973 resulting in the higher activity of st g paa and higher scale inhibition performance st g paa a had a relatively low grafting ratio but very few grafted chains thus this compound was not able to reach the inhibition equilibrium in the measured dose range resulting in relatively poor inhibition performance in addition comparison of the two series of st g paa samples showed that st g paa with higher number of grafted chains generally exhibited more significant scale inhibition performance a sharper slope at the initial dose stage of scale inhibition and higher inhibition efficiency were obtained fig 2 thus the grafted chain distribution might be a more sensitive factor for the scale inhibition of st g paa 3 3 investigation of scale inhibition mechanisms 3 3 1 sem the scale inhibition mechanisms of st g paas were further investigated by directly observing the surface morphology of precipitated caco3 scales using sem figs 4 and 5 fig 4 shows the scanning electron micrographs of caco3 crystals obtained in the absence of antiscalants fig 4 a and those in the presence of various st g paa samples with different grafting ratios but similar grafted chain distribution st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 fig 4 b g the blank caco3 crystals had regular diamond shape fig 4 a which showed a calcite configuration zhang et al 2007b after adding various st g paas the formed caco3 scales mostly retained regular diamond shape and exhibited the same crystal configuration as that without scale inhibitor fig 4 b g this result indicates that st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 could not efficiently enter the crystal lattices during the normal growth of caco3 crystal thus the dominant scale inhibition mechanisms of these st g paas were not lattice distortion zhao et al 2016 chelation and dispersion effects played important roles in this case st g paas could not only chelate with free ca2 in solution butler et al 2006 but also adsorb on the formed caco3 nanocrystals via bonding of surface ca2 ions by dissociated coo groups the latter effect could well disperse the nanocrystals through charge repulsion and effectively inhibit precipitation chaussemier et al 2015 moreover these two effects would be weakened with increase in grafting ratios and molecular weight of st g paas because of their enhanced bridging flocculation and easy formation of intermolecular hydrogen bond qiang et al 2013 wang et al 2016 fig 5 shows the surface morphologies of the caco3 scales obtained in the presence of another series of st g paa samples with different grafted chain numbers but similar grafting ratios st g paa b to st g paa e contrary to the results obtained from st g paas with different grafting ratios st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 fig 4 many spherical or amorphous caco3 scales appeared in the precipitates with increasing average number of grafted paa chains fig 5 e and f this result indicated that under the same grafting ratio st g paa with more grafted chains on the st backbone facilitated the lattice twisted effect during caco3 crystal growth resulting in irregular scale shapes thus multiple inhibition effects and mechanisms including lattice distortion chelation and dispersion worked together resulting in significant scale inhibition performance fig 2 b in addition most caco3 scales obtained from st g paa a st g paa b and st g paa c with relatively low number of branched chain maintained a diamond like regular structure fig 5 b c and 5 d respectively indicating their very minor effect of lattice distortion 3 3 2 xrd the crystal structures of caco3 scales obtained under various conditions were further analyzed by xrd figs 6 and 7 caco3 normally has three kinds of crystal structures namely calcite aragonite and vaterite butler et al 2006 calcite is the most stable thermodynamically crystalline form followed by aragonite and vaterite butler et al 2006 gal et al 2002 kırboga and öner 2012 wang et al 2014 based on figs 6 a and 7 a the xrd characteristic diffraction peaks of the caco3 scale without addition of scale inhibitor were at 23 04 29 47 36 05 39 48 43 19 47 54 and 48 53 these values indicated that the blank caco3 crystal was mainly composed of calcite butler et al 2006 gal et al 2002 kırboga and öner 2012 wang et al 2014 fig 6 b g shows the xrd patterns of caco3 scale obtained in the presence of various st g paa samples with different grafting ratios but similar grafted chain distributions st g paa 1 to st g paa 6 accordingly most of the crystalline phases by st g paas with various grafting ratios were unchanged and very similar to that in the absence of antiscalant fig 6 a that is calcite phase these results further confirmed that chelation and dispersion were the dominant inhibition mechanisms for these st g paas zhao et al 2016 which were consistent with the sem results fig 4 xrd results of caco3 scales obtained in the presence of the other series of st g paas st g paa a to st g paa e fig 7 were also consistent with the sem results fig 5 several new diffraction peaks at 24 90 27 05 32 78 43 85 and 50 08 which were ascribed to vaterite butler et al 2006 gal et al 2002 kırboga and öner 2012 wang et al 2014 appeared in the xrd patterns of caco3 by st g paa d and st g paa e with higher number of grafted chains this result suggested a few unstable crystalline phases caused by lattice distortion existed fig 7 e and f moreover lattice distortion was obviously more significant in st g paa e with much more paa grafted chains under similar grafting ratio zhang et al 2007a paa grafted chains could adsorb onto the active crystal growth sites hinder the regular growth of the scale crystal and destroy the caco3 crystal structure and shape these effects are evidently enhanced in the st g paa samples with more paa grafted chains 3 3 3 analysis on molecular structure level the additional carboxyl groups on the paa branched chains of st g paa acted as the inhibition active sites to efficiently reduce scale formation however different st g paas with distinct molecular structural morphologies scheme 1 exhibited remarkably varied scale inhibition performances and followed various mechanisms normally under similar numbers of grafted chain st g paa with relatively low grafting ratio showed good scale inhibition performance against caco3 fig 2 a st g paa with high grafting ratio exhibited evidently reduced inhibition efficiency this phenomenon was due to the increased molecular weight which enhanced the bridging flocculation effect qiang et al 2013 and consumption of more carboxyl groups by the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bond wang et al 2016 at this time chelation and dispersion were the dominant mechanisms of these st g paas in the inhibition of caco3 in addition under similar grafting ratios st g paa with higher average grafted chain number exhibited better inhibition efficiency fig 2 b and multiple effects such as chelation dispersion and lattice distortion were involved in the inhibition of caco3 the lattice distortion of st g paa was obviously enhanced with increasing number of grafted chains zhang et al 2007a an extreme case was observed in carboxymethyl starch cms in which all carboxyl groups were distributed on the st backbone scheme 1 e this phenomenon was also similar to an ideal graft copolymerization i e when the amount of initiator is large enough each initiation site on the st backbone can only graft one aa based on our previous study wang et al 2017 most caco3 crystals obtained in the presence of cms changed into unstable vaterite phase this phenomenon might be due to two factors one factor is the positive synergistic effect of two adjacent carboxyl groups on the efficient chelation of calcium ions mccartney and alexander 1958 the other factor is that the terminal groups of macromolecular chains usually exhibit higher activity fanta 1973 thus higher number of grafted chains indicated more terminal groups causing higher activity and higher scale inhibition performance of st g paa st g paa a with few number of grafted chains but long paa branched chain exhibited weakened lattice distortion but enhanced dispersion although st g paa a showed worse scale inhibition performance than those with higher number of grafted chains but shorter length its inhibition efficiency exhibited distinct continuous growth fig 2 b 4 conclusion st g paa was employed as a green antiscalant because st was environment friendly and inexpensive in addition to the dose effect the effects of the structural morphology that is grafting ratio and grafted chain distribution of st g paa on its inhibition against caco3 were studied in detail two series of st g paa were designed and prepared by adjusting the feeding mass of aa monomer and aps initiator one series had similar numbers of grafted chains but different grafting ratios while the other had similar grafting ratios but different numbers of grafted chain based on the apparent inhibition performance direct observation of scale surface morphology by sem and determination of caco3 crystal structure by xrd st g paa with relatively low grafting ratio but higher number of grafted chain showed better inhibition performance than the other samples this phenomenon was due to the synergistic effect of two adjacent paa branched chains for efficient chelation effect and increased activity of st g paa as a result its higher number of terminal groups of branched chains moreover the grafted chain distribution of st g paa might be more significant than grafting ratio in further improving its scale inhibition performance in addition to chelation and dispersion lattice distortion was also involved with the increase in the number of grafted chains to a certain extent moreover the ie of st g paa significantly weakened with increase in grafting ratio 187 because of the increased molecular weight this phenomenon enhanced the bridging flocculation effect and consumption of more carboxyl groups by the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bond in short multiple short paa branches generally increased the effectiveness of st g paa in inhibiting precipitation of caco3 from solution this st g paa might be also efficient in reduction of scale deposition on pipes and membranes in real applications such as cooling water systems and membrane desalination processes due to its effective chelation dispersion and lattice distortion effects however more detailed investigation are preciously needed due to much more complicated situations in actual environments such as the interferences of coexisted various inorganic organic and biological matters 
19499,the survival of aquatic biota in stream ecosystems depends on both water quantity and quality and is particularly susceptible to degraded water quality in regulated rivers maintenance of environmental flows e flows for aquatic biota with optimum water quantity and quality is essential for sustainable ecosystem services especially in developing regions with insufficient stream monitoring of hydrology water quality and aquatic biota few e flow methods are available that closely link aquatic biota tolerances to pollutant concentrations in a simple and practical manner in this paper a new method was proposed to assess e flows that aimed to satisfy the requirements of aquatic biota for both the quantity and quality of the streamflow by linking fish tolerances to water quality criteria or the allowable concentration of pollutants for better operation of water projects and control of pollutants discharged into streams this paper presented two coefficients for streamflow adjustment and pollutant control assessment of e flows in the wei river the largest tributary of the yellow river shows that streamflow in dry seasons failed to meet e flow requirements pollutant influx exerted a large pressure on the aquatic ecosystem with pollutant concentrations much higher than that of the fish tolerance thresholds we found that both flow velocity and water temperature exerted great influences on the pollutant degradation rate flow velocity had a much greater influence on pollutant degradation than did the standard deviation of flow velocity this study provides new methods to closely link the tolerance of aquatic biota to water quality criteria for e flow assessment the recommended coefficients for streamflow adjustment and pollutant control to dynamically regulate streamflow and control pollutant discharge are helpful for river management and ecosystems rehabilitation the relatively low data requirement also makes the method easy to use efficiently in developing regions and thus this study has significant implications for managing flows in polluted and regulated rivers worldwide graphical abstract image 1 keywords streamflow

accurate and long term hydrological and or ecological data which are not yet broadly available for many rivers globally sanderson et al 2012 more importantly most e flow methods have focused principally on the quantity and delivery pattern of water while fewer methods are available for the assessment of water quality scherman et al 2003 pinilla agudelo et al 2014 the adapted ecological

levels of appropriate resource protection however these are not often linked to environmental flows palmer et al 2007 wepener and chapman 2012 pinilla agudelo et al 2014 far fewer studies link the

ecosystems from the point of the aquatic biota especially in regulated rivers of developing countries fish are long lived and sensitive to a wide range of stresses in terms of the aquatic ecosystem one of the most obvious and unacceptable effects of anthropogenic activities is the collapse of the riverine fish community due to uninformed river regulation strategies e g reduction in streamflow with attendant decrease in water quality stream flows that are adequate to maintain fisheries are usually sufficient to maintain macro invertebrates and other aquatic life fish communities are thus considered effective indicators of ecosystem health as successful spawning and survival during the early life stages of fish often dictate the strength of subsequent cohorts understanding the influence of natural flow regimes on the early life of fishes is vital to protecting fish populations in flow altered rivers balcombe et al 2006 streamflow alteration also plays important roles in

are generally believed to be of major evolutionary significance and they vary greatly in the intensity of flow velocity and predation stress langerhans 2009 increased flow velocity can increase the metabolic rate of fish within a certain velocity range asaeda and manatunge 2007 flow velocity can provide important cues for spawning at particular times of the year and eggs and larvae have distinct flow velocity requirements liu et al 2011 in the non spawning season there is usually no special requirement for velocity provided it is under the maximum velocity that a fish can tolerate fu et al

toxic cyanobacteria e g m aeruginosa which can have strong adverse effects on daphnia a key species in freshwater pelagic food webs and a major food for fish larva zhang et al 2009 in addition toxic pollutants impose direct threats to fish survival hence excessive pollutant concentrations in water exceeding the fish tolerance values ultimately decrease the number of fish species in general flow velocities and pollutant concentrations are the most important variables explaining opportunities for successful fish spawning liu et al 2011 additionally because streamflow greatly influences the concentration of a pollutant kumpanenko et al 2012 morales hernandez et al 2013 flow velocity as the core of streamflow is deemed one of the most highlighted variables in terms of river pollution control water quality criteria are often used to calculate the water environmental capacity wec a measure of the water s maximum capacity to accommodate a pollutant within a unit of time which can be classified into attenuation capacity and assimilation capacity caep 2003 attenuation and assimilation processes govern the concentration of a pollutant in streams and influence the speed of pollutant

degradation in streams can be indicated using the integrated degradation coefficient caep 2003 dang et al 2009 the most critical factors among all hydrological variables influencing pollutant degradation processes or the integrated degradation coefficient are flow velocity and stream flow gomes and wai 2014 for pollutant control strategies one can set the maximum allowable pollution levels water quality criteria for a river section to ensure the maximum level measured is less than the one set at the pollutant input point at the uppermost reach of the river section defined as the head control or downstream of the input at the lowermost reach of the river section defined as the end control under study end control can only serve to control pollutants while head control is helpful for water ecological remediation zhou et al 1999 dang et al 2009 due to its lower pollutant input allowances therefore head control will be adopted in this paper for better water quality delivery in the e flow assessment the objective of this paper is to present a practical e flow assessment method with fish tolerance closely linked to water quality criteria for streamflow regulation and pollutant control in data scarce rivers in this method water quality criteria were adjusted in relation to fish tolerance thresholds and employed to calculate water environmental capacity wec the variation in wec was dynamically fed back to the quantity of environmental flows whereby streamflows could be ecologically regulated and pollutants discharged into rivers could be reasonably controlled based on dynamical streamflow regulation and pollutant discharge control both quantity and quality of environmental flows were optimized 2 methodology 2 1 study area the wei river is the largest tributary of the yellow river china the wei river basin lying between 103 5 and 110 5 e and 33 5 37 5 n is located in a continental monsoon climatic zone the daily mean temperature ranges from 6 to 14 c with annual mean rainfall from 450 to 700 mm and annual mean evaporation ranging from 1000 to 2000 mm li et al 2014 in recent decades the whole basin has witnessed many serious high severity drought episodes with prolonged drought durations huang et al 2014 the wei river basin plays an important role in the development of west china it is the major region for agriculture industry and commerce in northwestern china song et al 2007 over the past decades intensive human activities have had a substantial negative impact on the wei river characterized by decreasing annual runoff and heavy pollution through increased extraction and unsustainable use of water zuo et al 2014 as a consequence 69 2 of the water quality observations exceeded the national water protection standards in 2009 and resulted in serious degradation of ecosystem function including reduced fish species richness contracted wetlands and decreased forest vegetation wu et al 2014b the main pollution issues in this region are chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh3 n levels biological oxygen demand bod5 volatile phenols and petroleum zhang et al 2012 among these cod as an indicator of organic pollutants in surface waters had the highest concentration over all sampling events in both wet and dry situations with values much greater than the other three indicators which severely threated fish assemblages and resulted in ecosystem function degradation li et al 2011 wu et al 2014b and is therefore worth special attention in future ecological rehabilitation studies therefore in this paper cod is used as a surrogate for water quality in the wei river study to protect the fish assemblages therein linjiacun ljc and xianyang xy are two important hydrological and water quality stations along the river the catchment of the river section from ljc to xy fig 1 encompasses important cities and a large agricultural area frequent drought spells plus high levels of water abstraction has impacted normal ecosystem functions additionally agricultural return water as well as industrial wastewater discharge and domestic sewage guo et al 2013 seriously affected the health of riverine ecosystems substantially restricting the sustainable development of the region to sustain local socio economic development the health of riverine ecosystems must be given the highest priority with the aim of protecting and rehabilitating their ecosystem functions to achieve this goal the assessment of streamflows for the environment e flows that considers both pollutant reduction and the tolerance of aquatic organisms to pollutant levelin riverine ecosystems is urgently needed 2 2 data data requirements for the method in the present study that do not need long term hydrological and water quality monitoring programs are considerably lower than traditional methods for e flow assessment the essential dataset includes dominant fish species and their tolerance to pollutants as well as some hydrological and water quality observations the dominant fish species is accessible by way of on site catch or fishery investigation while their tolerance values are available in published literature or online datasets 2 2 1 water quality indicators and streamflows water quality indicators cod and streamflows at the water quality stations ljc and xy and at sewage outlets water use canal and tributaries from jan 2007 to dec 2009 were provided by the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources mwr china all sewage outlets water use canals and tributaries were generalized as one virtual sewage outlet into the river gso in fig 2 to facilitate the calculation of e flows the mainstream section of the wei river between the two water quality stations ljc and xy was selected to study its e flows there are nine sewage outlets nine tributaries and two water abstraction canals along the 197 km length of this section of the river fig 1 all raw data were subjected to quality control before use with the quality control methods of smirnov et al 2000 2 2 2 fish species and their tolerances the study of wu et al 2014a on the fish community of the wei river reveals that five fish species misgurnus anguillicaudatus opsariichthys bidens pseudorasbora parva abbottina rivularis and carassius auratus dominate the fish community under intensive anthropogenic disturbances e g channelization and dam construction many native fish species are absent han et al 2008a b garcia et al 2011 gomes and wai 2014 chu et al 2015 gibson et al 2015 increasing the risk that there exists no target species for e flows calculation to reduce the absence risk dominant fish species instead of native fish species were selected as instream ecological target species to assess e flows requirements of the five fish species for flow velocity and cod were obtained from two sources one of which was the selected records from the integrated dataset of three extensive field campaigns in jinan city zhao et al 2015a jinan city is in the lower reach of the yellow river basin whereas the wei river is in the upper reach the other source was published literature the requirements are summarized in tables 1 and 2 in the three extensive field campaigns in jinan city attributes inclusive of 37 hydrologic physical and chemical parameters were measured concurrently with the fish sampling during three periods may 1st 20th august 2nd 21st and november 1st 20th 2014 the three periods cover the most variable possibilities of the attributes meanwhile 5084 fish were sampled and tested concurring with hydrological and water quality parameters measured at a total of 144 sites 2 3 methods for e flows assessment with streamflow regulation and pollutant control the method presented in this paper considers fish requirements for streamflow and water quality fig 3 the two output coefficients for streamflow regulation and water pollutant control are of use to river administrators and stakeholders for reducing negative impacts of streamflow regulation and pollutant discharge due to unreasonable urbanization agriculture mining and water extraction they can be of great help to maintain or rehabilitate the health of river ecosystems the determination of the ecological velocity v e or the flow velocity required to maintain the elementary functions of instream ecosystem components liu et al 2011 gopal 2013 is the core of the method from which environmental flow q e is determined via the adapted ecological hydraulic radius approach aehra liu et al 2011 river sections need to be generalized for the convenience of e flow calculation in the generalized river section e flows q e considering only water quantity were initially estimated using aehra subsequently based on the range of both v e and q e the water environmental capacity w range is then calculated and recommended using the weca method presented in this paper the recommended w range can be slightly adjusted by river administrators and stakeholders in special situations e g under a severe drought the adjustment of w is fed back to v e and then q e after several iterations of dynamic adjustments of w v e and q e a set of three variables is determined with which streamflow in the ucc reach fig 2a could be regulated using the streamflow regulation coefficient α the ratio of q e to river discharge through ucc and pollutants discharged into the river could be controlled by the pollutant control coefficient β the ratio of actual pollutant discharge to wec at gso 2 3 1 river section generalization in the present study the river is assumed to be one dimensional with point source pollutant and non point source pollutant discharges tributaries and water use canals defined as a single generalized sewage outlet gso the gso position can be calculated by the concentration of the studied pollutant a river section between two control cross sections is then generalized as in fig 2a the position of the generalized sewage outlet gso fig 2a can be determined by eq 1 derived from epac 2002 1 x 2 i 1 n q i c i e x i x i i 1 n q i c i e x i i stands for the number of actual sewage outlets or tributaries i 1 n n is the number of sewage outlets x i refers to the distance from the outlet to the dcc q i refers to the pollutant discharge rate at the i th outlet in m3 s 1 c i is the concentration of a specific pollutant corresponding to q i at the i th outlet in mg l 1 2 3 2 e flows assessment q e using the aehra the core of the aehra is the determination of ecological velocity v e in m s 1 the velocity requirements for fish species vary with season which can be determined by v e v l o w v high v low is the lowest threshold of velocity for the dominant fish species while v high is the highest threshold both v low and v high can be determined from the attributes given in table 1 having obtained the v e e flows q e in the river section can be estimated using the aehra eq 2 when cross sectional data were absent in a data scarce river they were obtained via the cross section generalization method in the aehra liu et al 2011 2 q e 1 n r e 2 3 a e j 1 2 with r e n 3 2 v e

m2 n roughness or manning s n which is dimensionless j hydraulic slope in with q e river administrators can regulate streamflows through the ucc q 0 by using the streamflow regulation coefficient α q e q 0 for the purpose of pollutant dilution and the rehabilitation of its ecology then a recommended range of α l o w α high was suggested to river administrators or stakeholders for streamflow regulation after iterations of adjustment on w fig 3 2 3 3 water environmental capacity calculation with streamflow regulation and pollutant control by linking fish tolerance to water quality criteria herein we put forward a new method for water environmental capacity assessment weca with streamflow regulation and pollutant control in a river section wec as a measure of the water s maximum capacity to accommodate a pollutant within a unit of time in a river section is mainly subjected to rate of streamflows which can be regulated based on the coefficient α q e q 0 the coefficient will also induce the regulation of mean flow velocity u in m s 1 the magnitude of the flow velocity positively influences the value of the integrated degradation coefficient of a pollutant which determines the rate of dilution and the degradation efficiency of the pollutant and in turn influences wec in the river section fig 2a if the pollutant concentration in the cross section of a generalized sewage outlet gso in fig 2a equals the water quality criteria i e c c s fig 2b we can express the total mass of the pollutant in a river section as eq 3 based on the mass conservation law and the first order kinetics formula c c 0 e k t kadlec and knight 1996 3 q 0 c 0 w q 0 q c s q 0 c 0 1 e k x 1 86 4 u where the left side is the total mass of the pollutant in a river section and the right side is the total pollutant capacity for dilution and degradation under conditions of pollutant control the total mass of the pollutant is assumed to never exceed the total pollutant capacity in the river w stands for wec in g s 1 k is the integrated degradation coefficient measuring the rate at which the environment can remove a pollutant in d 1 u is the average flow velocity in a river section in m s 1 x 1 is the distance of the generalized sewage outlet from the ucc in km fig 2 accordingly wec w can be solved as 4 w q 0 q c s q 0 c 0 e k x 1 86 4 u wherein the fish tolerance to pollutant concentration integrated threshold in table 2 is embodied in the water quality criteria c s which is achieved by satisfying both requirements of fish species and river functions to pollutant concentration the previous value of c s for a pollutant is modified to a level tolerated by the dominant fish species the previous c s value is the minimum of all css for river functions e g water use for agriculture industry swimming etc the criteria css are drawn from water quality standards e g the chinese national environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 epac 2002 whereby the previous c s value for cod is 30 mg l 1 for the section ljc xy with a river function for agricultural and industrial water supply when pollutant discharge into rivers exceeds the water environmental capacity w pollutant control is the most appropriate way to maintain the pollutant concentration within that of the fish tolerance threshold values u in eq 4 is initialized by v e v l o w v high in table 1 and accordingly w w l o w w high are calculated based on eq 4 with w l o w the wec calculated using the lower u value and w high the wec using the higher u value in the next iteration of calculation the value of u is expected to be dynamically adjusted with w which is regulated by river administrators or stakeholders based on a pollutant control coefficient here the cod measured pollutant control coefficient is defined as β w a w with β β l o w β high in accordance with the range w l o w w high w a in g s 1 is the actual pollutant discharge at the gso which can be calculated using eq 5 that we derived from the generalized river model fig 2 and mass conservation law with any pollutant control coefficient β selected by river administrators the value of u can be calculated iteratively with eq 4 the recalculated u is fed back to the calculation of the streamflow regulation coefficient α as fig 2 shows 5 w a i 1 n q i c i e k x i x 86 4 u a where x is the distance of the gso from the dcc and x i is the distance of the i th sewage outlet from the dcc w a includes those pollutant discharges from point and non point sources and tributaries water abstraction can be regarded as the opposite of tributaries data of which come from field observations or model simulations a non point source pollutant is estimated with the storm runoff based mean concentration method li et al 2011 u a is the actual mean flow velocity in the studied river section and can be calculated as the average of the flow velocity observed at the ucc and dcc the above mentioned cod measured pollutant control coefficient β can greatly facilitate the practical operation of pollutant discharge control if necessary the coefficient β measured by other indicators e g nh3 n bod5 can also be calculated to facilitate the control of pollutant discharged into rivers in the present study a recommended range of β l o w β high would be highly acceptable to river administrators and stakeholders 3 results 3 1 river section generalization and water quality criteria modification according to the conceptual model in fig 2 all outlets into from the river section ljc xy were generalized as one virtual outlet gso 3 06 km upstream from station xy the river section between stations ljc and xy fig 1 is the water source for both industry and agriculture hence the c s cod for river function is 30 mg l 1 according to the national environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 epac 2002 while the maximum cod levels that the five fish species opsariichthys bidens carassius auratus pseudorasbora parva misgurnus anguillicaudatus and abbottina rivularis can tolerate were respectively 19 2 130 6 64 5 28 3 and 64 5 mg l 1 the minimum of maximum values the above five values was 19 2 mg l 1 most likely the maximum of minimum values of cod levels that the five fish species can tolerate is 8 94 mg l 1 as listed in table 2 thus the range for fish species ranged between 8 94 and 19 2 mg l 1 therefore the c s of 30 mg l 1 for the studied river section was modified to range between 8 94 and 19 2 mg l 1 after the fish tolerance to cod level was integrated 3 2 e flows assessment and streamflow regulation in the river section ljc xy drifting fish roe of opsariichthys bidens table 1 will sink onto the riverbed and perish when the flow velocity is lower than 0 8 m s 1 zhao et al 2010 therefore in the fish spawning season from june to august flow velocity must be kept higher than 0 8 m s 1 for the roe of o bidens to survive even though the velocity of 0 8 m s 1 is higher than the critical velocity of adult o bidens they could seek shelter in the lower velocity deep water habitat or near the river bank accordingly the following ecological velocity for fish in the wei river is recommended higher than 0 8 m s 1 from june to august and between 0 30 and 0 34 m s 1 in the other months table 1 the ecological velocity ranges of 0 30 0 34 m s 1 were determined by the coupling of optimal velocity vopt and critical velocity vcrit the minimum optimal velocity which can satisfy all the five fish species is 0 30 m s 1 and the maximum optimal value is 0 34 m s 1 the critical velocity for the fish abbottina rivularis is 0 34 m s 1 a higher velocity than which would pose a higher survival risk to the species and its larvae on integrating the cod level requirements for the five fish species with the standard cod level 30 mg l 1 as shown in table 2 e flows and the corresponding streamflow regulation coefficients were calculated using eq 2 for aehra fig 4 the e flow magnitude varied by month and remained high during the period from july through september fig 4 to satisfy e flows streamflows must be regulated with the coefficient ranging between low and high α values generally streamflow necessitates higher regulation in dry seasons than in wet seasons in detail higher streamflows q 0 in most of the wet season from july through september necessitated a lower streamflow regulation while lower streamflows in the other season oct june required higher regulation moreover the difference between α low and α high in the wet season was small whereas the difference in the dry season was large due to the lower streamflow q 0 plus the higher e flow q e 3 3 wec calculation and cod measured pollutant control the wec process for cod was similar to that of the e flows fig 4 and was heavily affected by streamflow q 0 fig 5 the process remained high when the streamflow was high during the wet season while in the dry season it remained low most of the time to keep the cod level within the tolerance range of the five fish species the cod discharged into rivers had to be reduced greatly with the coefficients β low and β high the two coefficients were heavily affected by streamflow they remained lower with little reduction in wet seasons than in dry seasons the difference between β low and β high was small during most years from 2007 to 2009 3 4 the integrated degradation coefficient and its influencing factors water temperature flow velocities and river length for pollutants to mix dilute and degrade are important sources of uncertainties in the estimation of the integrated degradation coefficient k su 2006 liu et al 2007 wang et al 2012 our calculations show that the value of k for cod decreased with river length in detail k decreased abruptly in the initial 3 km of the flow path while the decreasing trend slowed down and k plateaued within a river length of 4 10 km in other words the minimum river length threshold must be a priority to obtain a steady k value therefore the minimum mixing length caep 2003 to ensure that pollutants mixed uniformly in the study river was 10 km to explore the role of water temperature and flow velocity in the variation of k the two factors variation processes and relationships with k are illustrated in fig 6 the river sections ljc xy and downstream of xy xy hx were studied to demonstrate the influences of t w and u on k taking into account the influences of the above two factors on k liu et al 2007 suggested that the optimized k value in july 2006 for cod near station xy was 1 03 d 1 which was similar to our results in july 2007 2009 where the k values for cod were 0 38 0 83 d 1 upstream of station xy and 0 70 1 27 d 1 downstream of this station fig 8 g likewise su 2006 studied the cod degradation process near station xy based on a water quality dataset from 1992 to 2001 and derived the highest k value for cod of 1 43 d 1 which was similar to the highest value of 1 36 d 1 in aug 2007 in the present study fig 6c variations in water temperature and flow velocity explained the above differences water temperature near station xy in july 2006 was 26 03 c with a flow velocity of 0 46 m s 1 liu et al 2007 while the water temperature in july 2007 was 22 11 c with a flow velocity of 0 97 m s 1 which led to a higher k value for cod 1 27 d 1 as shown in fig 6d and e water temperature and flow velocity had the closest relationships with k fig 6a and b in both sections k exponentially increased with water temperature while the upstream section ljc xy had a slower k increase than that in the downstream section xy hx fig 6a contrary to water temperature flow velocity drove k to increase logarithmically fig 6b flow velocity in the upstream section had smaller influences on k compared with that in the downstream section in brief the influences of water temperature and flow velocity on the integrated degradation coefficient were remarkably substantial and influences on the downstream section were even greater than that in the upstream section both flow velocity and its standard deviation are important in explaining water quality variation gomes and wai 2014 the speed of pollutant degradation or the integrated degradation coefficient is critically influenced by attenuation and assimilation processes our analyses of the relationships between the degradation coefficient of cod and flow velocity as well as their derivatives revealed that flow velocity itself u had a much greater influence on the degradation coefficient k than the standard deviation of flow velocity u sd based on temporal variations fig 6b vs fig 7a in both the upstream section ljc xy and downstream section xy hx the correlations of k u fig 6b had higher correlation coefficients r2 than the k u sd fig 7a variations in u sd had greater influences on the degradation coefficient k mean fig 7a than its standard deviation k sd fig 7b with higher trend slopes in both the up and downstream river sections to summarize the mean flow velocity had a much greater influence on the attenuation and assimilation processes of water quality than did the standard deviation of the flow velocity 4 discussion the method presented in this paper successfully integrates the requirements of fish species and pollution control into the e flow assessment the presence of streamflow adjustments and pollutant control coefficients in the method makes it easy to use and substantially helpful to river administrators and stake holders in many aspects e g reduction of noxious odors and sulfide problems rauch and kleidorfer 2014 decrease of higher pollutant tolerant species and increase of lower pollutant tolerant species zhao et al 2010 gradually increasing biodiversity and rehabilitating aquatic ecosystems 4 1 rationale for the selection of the key water quality indicator agriculture and industry occupy predominant positions in the development of the wei river basin song et al 2007 which resulted in heavy pollution that seriously degraded its ecosystem function wu et al 2014b for instance large nitrogen sources are typically associated with agricultural activities in most regions craig et al 2008 of all water quality indicators chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh3 n biological oxygen demand bod5 volatile phenols and petroleum are five principal indicators in this basin zhang et al 2012 intensive human disturbance of the soil through agricultural tilling resulted in high cod levels in both water and sediment samples from the wei river chen et al 2003 li et al 2011 because cod is used to indicate organic pollutants in surface waters its sources consist of soil particles agricultural chemicals fertilizer and natural organic substances from disturbed surface soils in the wei river basin li et al 2011 it should be noted that cod with the highest concentration of all of the main water quality indicators li et al 2011 exerted the most stress on fish communities in the wei river and contributed greatly to ecosystem function degradation negatively influencing fish communities wetlands and forest vegetation wu et al 2014a b in addition we studied the influences of hydrological physical and chemical habitat factors on fish species in jinan city downstream of our study area showing that both forms of cod codmn codcr or permanganate index chemical oxygen demand see fig 2 in zhao et al 2015a had the highest biplot scores in the canonical correspondence analysis cca of the chemical habitat factors moreover codmn was highly correlated with codcr and nh3 n with correlation coefficients greater than 0 51 therefore codmn was selected to be one of the seven key habitat factors determining fish communities thus cod should be given the highest priority in future ecological rehabilitation programs and deserves a role as a surrogate of water quality for e flows studies in the wei river similarly water quality indicators were also studied by gomes and wai 2014 where eight indicators were selected as surrogates of water quality they were unable to nominate one or two principal water quality indicators as surrogates because in their research land use in the mountainous area was devoid of medium to large scale industries which differed greatly from the agriculture and industry dominated wei river basin additionally the total catchment area of 4 21 km2 in their research was far less than 135 000 km2 of the wei river basin li et al 2011 which differed greatly spatially and therefore resulted in different surrogates for water quality in the two study areas in brief the multiple surrogates for water quality in gomes and wai 2014 are appropriate for a catchment with little agricultural and industrial activities these surrogates in a large scale basin such as in the present study do not feature prominently compared with cod thus cod is deemed a suitable water quality surrogate for large scale basins with heavy pollution resulting from agricultural and industrial activities chen et al 2003 li et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 as exemplified by the wei river basin 4 2 divergence in e flow assessment over the three years 2007 2009 the annual streamflow q 0 continued to decrease fig 4 especially during the wet season july october q 0 in the 2008 wet season was half that of 2007 and q 0 in the 2009 wet season was a quarter that of 2007 statistically more than 80 of the months need increasing the streamflow magnitude to satisfy e flows requirement on quantity through reducing water use for agriculture and industry etc or diverting water from outside the watershed many water diversion projects e g the south to north water transfer project in shaanxi province have been put into practice in our study area but most diverted water were used by industry with a small portion used for ecological remediation chang and jiang 2011 therefore it is possible to satisfy e flows quantity requirements by referring to the streamflow regulation coefficients presented in this study song et al 2007 studied e flows for the wei river by considering streamflow quantity requirements for aquatic biotopes seepage evaporation pollutant self purification and sediment transportation their results showed that the e flows for physical habitat maintenance near station ljc ranged from 51 1 to 100 2 m3 s 1 in the wet season while they ranged from 38 7 to 71 5 m3 s 1 in the dry season january june and november december our results ranged from 43 0 to 148 96 m3 s 1 in the wet season and from 39 95 to 131 59 m3 s 1 in the dry season on average our results were higher than those in song et al 2007 in which they used the montana or tennant method tennant 1976 to calculate the e flows for aquatic ecosystems a minimum 10 of the averaged measured streamflow was regarded as being necessary for maintenance of aquatic ecosystems a minimum e flow value may not be enough to maintain a healthy physical habitat arthington et al 2006 moreover the method song et al 2007 used for physical habitat maintenance is more appropriate for rivers without human impacts and is generally used as a rough verification of other approaches liu et al 2011 where human impacts exist according to chen et al 2013 most e flow methods such as the instream flow incremental methodology ifim have been subject to criticism because of their inability to consider discharge biomass relationships however when considering these relationships large data requirements limit the construction of stress response relationships in data scarce rivers where the required information is not yet broadly available regionally or globally bobbi et al 2014 moreover the failure to integrate water quality into e flow assessments restricts their applicability to catchments with poor water quality because the e flow assessment includes not only water quantity but also water quality brisbane declaration 2007 scherman et al 2003 used water quality information biological assessment information and toxicological data to assess the water quality component of environmental flow assessments hart et al 1999 defined a concentration response relationship between a driving water quality parameter and ecosystem health paredes arquiola et al 2014 integrated three essential components i e water quantity water quality and habitat suitability for aquatic species into e flow assessment but the complex sub models limit their application especially in developing countries as they require substantial detailed monitoring data of water quantity quality and ecology the method presented in this paper deems fish species as the basic attribute and closely couples their requirements with water quality by the re establishment of water quality criteria concerning their tolerance levels moreover our method recommends both pollutant control and streamflow regulation measures to satisfy e flows which is more practical than the pollutant dilution self purification approach recommended by song et al 2007 under a background of decreasing runoff and heavy pollutant inputs in their research e flows accounted for 41 5 77 5 of total streamflow in the wei river in the wet season and 56 1 87 0 in the dry season the simple percentages without dynamic regulation on both streamflow and pollutant discharge into rivers may have presented heavy constraints to regional development under decreasing streamflows and worsening water quality scenarios the method presented in this paper with two coefficients recommended for dynamic streamflow regulation and pollutant discharge control can help reduce water use and is helpful for river administrators and stake holders to retain or rehabilitate the diversity of river ecosystems in addition the relatively low data requirement of our model makes it easy to use in rivers all over the world it should be noted that the range of flows in our results is small because there were not sufficient target species and streamflow data available under the condition of lacking detailed monitoring on taxa and habitat if the constant small range of flows was strictly maintained without introducing bankfull or pulse flows harmful events e g extinction of some other taxa would be triggered as a naturally variable regime of flow is required to sustain freshwater ecosystems poff et al 2010 therefore under certain circumstances bankfull and pulse flows are expected to be introduced beside the small range of flows in order to sustain much more taxa since most adult fish could seek lower velocity shelters moreover there is no differentiation between native and invasive fish species due to few invasive species reported in our study area actually invasive species as the second cause of the extinction of world fish result in declines and extinctions of native species which greatly reduces the native fish diversity clavero and garcía berthou 2005 mitigating the impact of invasive species and preventing future invasions to reduce the native fish diversity loss should be given the top priority hermoso et al 2011 had the difference of flow velocity requirement and pollutant tolerance between native and invasive species been known it would be of great help to regulate streamflow and control pollutant discharge using the method in this paper to foster native species replacing invasive species whereby to prevent the proliferation of invasive species 4 3 uncertainties in the weca model few weca models consider the head control of pollutant discharge among these we selected two head control models the zhou model by zhou et al 1999 and the dang model by dang et al 2009 to compare our models the wecs for cod were calculated and compared fig 8 monthly river discharge datasets greater than zero were selected from 1998 to 2003 the zhou model dang model and our model displayed similar trends in the rates of wec for cod with the values of wec calculated with our model lying between them the comparisons revealed that our model is practical and robust in assessing water environment capacities though some uncertainties may still exist to reduce uncertainties in the method in this paper determinations of ecological velocity v e and integrated degradation coefficient k necessitate much more intensive information on the relationships between biomass and velocity k and velocity and k and water temperature based on long term datasets of velocity water quality and ecosystems furthermore to efficiently rehabilitate aquatic ecosystem hotspots pollutant removal should be effectively identified by employing appropriate methods such as in craig et al 2008 with which the pollutant control coefficient recommended in our method could be more practical and the recommended streamflow regulation coefficient could be more efficient to be more effective stream rehabilitation should be conducted as complementary to land based best management practices craig et al 2008 the weca model which takes cod as a pollutant indicator to assess water environment capacity in a river section performed satisfactorily in terms of the degradable organic pollutants however it was not tested for inorganic pollutants there are many inorganic pollutants in waters e g heavy metals which can persist for long periods altering aquatic community structure and their interaction with organic matter still remains unclear castro català et al 2016 wojtkowska et al 2016 chemical concentrations alone are insufficient to demonstrate their adverse environmental effects castro català et al 2016 therefore the weca model may not be applicable when it comes to inorganic non degradable pollutants 5 conclusion a new method to integrate both the requirements of the ecosystem and pollution control into e flow assessment closely couples the water quantity and quality requirements of aquatic ecosystems this is accomplished by modifying water quality criteria with fish pollutant tolerance concentrations traditional water quality criteria for pollutants are usually determined for water use types e g for industry agriculture and drinking which are subject to human needs in this paper the tolerance of fish to pollutant concentrations was integrated into the determination of water quality criteria with which the water environmental capacity wec of a river section could be calculated considering both human and ecosystem requirements applications of the method in the wei river the largest tributary of the yellow river china suggest that the actual streamflow in dry seasons failed to meet e flows thus multi river or inter river sections of water resource allocations are required to meet human and environmental demands pollutant levels e g chemical oxygen demand cod exerted a strong influence on the aquatic ecosystem with pollutant concentrations much higher than the tolerance threshold of the dominant fish species moreover analysis of the integrated degradation coefficient suggests a river length of 10 km in the wei river is required for pollutants to mix completely moreover both water temperature and flow velocity exerted great influences on the integrated degradation coefficient which were greater in the downstream than in the upstream sections of the wei river the advantages of the method in this paper include the ease of operation and relatively lower data requirement as well as the recommended streamflow regulation and pollution control coefficients these attributes give the method great potential to be widely used in developing countries regions which may lack long term hydrological water quality and or ecological datasets acknowledgements we thank

19499,the survival of aquatic biota in stream ecosystems depends on both water quantity and quality and is particularly susceptible to degraded water quality in regulated rivers maintenance of environmental flows e flows for aquatic biota with optimum water quantity and quality is essential for sustainable ecosystem services especially in developing regions with insufficient stream monitoring of hydrology water quality and aquatic biota few e flow methods are available that closely link aquatic biota tolerances to pollutant concentrations in a simple and practical manner in this paper a new method was proposed to assess e flows that aimed to satisfy the requirements of aquatic biota for both the quantity and quality of the streamflow by linking fish tolerances to water quality criteria or the allowable concentration of pollutants for better operation of water projects and control of pollutants discharged into streams this paper presented two coefficients for streamflow adjustment and pollutant control assessment of e flows in the wei river the largest tributary of the yellow river shows that streamflow in dry seasons failed to meet e flow requirements pollutant influx exerted a large pressure on the aquatic ecosystem with pollutant concentrations much higher than that of the fish tolerance thresholds we found that both flow velocity and water temperature exerted great influences on the pollutant degradation rate flow velocity had a much greater influence on pollutant degradation than did the standard deviation of flow velocity this study provides new methods to closely link the tolerance of aquatic biota to water quality criteria for e flow assessment the recommended coefficients for streamflow adjustment and pollutant control to dynamically regulate streamflow and control pollutant discharge are helpful for river management and ecosystems rehabilitation the relatively low data requirement also makes the method easy to use efficiently in developing regions and thus this study has significant implications for managing flows in polluted and regulated rivers worldwide graphical abstract image 1 keywords streamflow

these ecosystems was proposed to retain natural streamflow or discharge q regimes in rivers poff et al 2010 this is a key principle for maintaining freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem processes and for achieving environmentally sustainable water resource management goals acreman and ferguson 2010 there are more than 200 methods for e flow assessment liu et al 2011 but most methods require accurate and long term hydrological and or ecological data which are not yet broadly available for many rivers globally sanderson et al 2012 more importantly most e flow methods have focused principally on the quantity and delivery pattern of water while fewer methods are available for the assessment of water quality scherman et al 2003 pinilla agudelo et al 2014 the adapted ecological hydraulic radius approach aehra requiring few hydrological and or ecological data uses the hydraulic radius one of properties of a channel that controls water discharge as a surrogate for hydraulic habitat and has the potential to calculate e flows in consideration of the requirements of a river s dynamic balance pollutant transport and dominant species in an aquatic ecosystem liu et al 2011 gopal 2013 however only fish responses to the variance in hydrological habitat e g flow velocity and water level are considered while fish responses or tolerance to the variance in water quality habitat have not yet been included scientists have recognized that water quantity is important because the structure and function of a riverine ecosystem as well as many adaptations of its biota are jointly determined by water quantity and quality nilsson and renofalt 2008 the most common approach to water quality protection is the use of water quality criteria allowing for the selection of levels of appropriate resource protection however these are not often linked to environmental flows palmer et al 2007 wepener and chapman 2012 pinilla agudelo et al 2014 far fewer studies link the river biota s responses or tolerances to pollutant concentration variations for the assessment of e flows pinilla agudelo et al 2014 which are urgently needed to retain or rehabilitate healthy aquatic ecosystems from the point of the aquatic biota especially in regulated rivers of developing countries fish are long lived and sensitive to a wide range of stresses in terms of the aquatic ecosystem one of the most obvious and unacceptable effects of anthropogenic activities is the collapse of the riverine fish community due to uninformed river regulation strategies e g reduction in streamflow with attendant decrease in water quality stream flows that are adequate to maintain fisheries are usually sufficient to maintain macro invertebrates and other aquatic life fish communities are thus considered effective indicators of ecosystem health as successful spawning and survival during the early life stages of fish often dictate the strength of subsequent cohorts understanding the influence of natural flow regimes on the early life of fishes is vital to protecting fish populations in flow altered rivers balcombe et al 2006 streamflow alteration also plays important roles in fish body shape changes periodic life history strategy and fish community structure and patterns meyers and belk 2014 doledec et al 2015 lamouroux and olivier 2015 pool and olden 2015 in a river streamflow or discharge q changes linearly and positively with flow velocity u under a constant cross sectional flow area a i e q a u flow velocity is therefore at the core of discharge besides flow velocity and the associated physical forces collectively represent the most important environmental factors affecting the organisms of running waters ahmadi nedushan et al 2006 fish habitat conditions are generally believed to be of major evolutionary significance and they vary greatly in the intensity of flow velocity and predation stress langerhans 2009 increased flow velocity can increase the metabolic rate of fish within a certain velocity range asaeda and manatunge 2007 flow velocity can provide important cues for spawning at particular times of the year and eggs and larvae have distinct flow velocity requirements liu et al 2011 in the non spawning season there is usually no special requirement for velocity provided it is under the maximum velocity that a fish can tolerate fu et al 2012 as one of important communities sustaining fish algae are often influenced by the concentration of nutrient pollutants heavily nutrient polluted waters often accelerates the rampant growth of toxic cyanobacteria e g m aeruginosa which can have strong adverse effects on daphnia a key species in freshwater pelagic food webs and a major food for fish larva zhang et al 2009 in addition toxic pollutants impose direct threats to fish survival hence excessive pollutant concentrations in water exceeding the fish tolerance values ultimately decrease the number of fish species in general flow velocities and pollutant concentrations are the most important variables explaining opportunities for successful fish spawning liu et al 2011 additionally because streamflow greatly influences the concentration of a pollutant kumpanenko et al 2012 morales hernandez et al 2013 flow velocity as the core of streamflow is deemed one of the most highlighted variables in terms of river pollution control water quality criteria are often used to calculate the water environmental capacity wec a measure of the water s maximum capacity to accommodate a pollutant within a unit of time which can be classified into attenuation capacity and assimilation capacity caep 2003 attenuation and assimilation processes govern the concentration of a pollutant in streams and influence the speed of pollutant removal gomes and wai 2014 the former refers to the processes of pollutant concentration reduction through dilution mixing and or dispersion while the latter is the association of pollutants with photosynthetic and heterotrophic organisms e g algae vegetation microbes as well as pollutant sorption to sediments craig et al 2008 ranalli and macalady 2010 stamati et al 2010 the speed of pollutant degradation in streams can be indicated using the integrated degradation coefficient caep 2003 dang et al 2009 the most critical factors among all hydrological variables influencing pollutant degradation processes or the integrated degradation coefficient are flow velocity and stream flow gomes and wai 2014 for pollutant control strategies one can set the maximum allowable pollution levels water quality criteria for a river section to ensure the maximum level measured is less than the one set at the pollutant input point at the uppermost reach of the river section defined as the head control or downstream of the input at the lowermost reach of the river section defined as the end control under study end control can only serve to control pollutants while head control is helpful for water ecological remediation zhou et al 1999 dang et al 2009 due to its lower pollutant input allowances therefore head control will be adopted in this paper for better water quality delivery in the e flow assessment the objective of this paper is to present a practical e flow assessment method with fish tolerance closely linked to water quality criteria for streamflow regulation and pollutant control in data scarce rivers in this method water quality criteria were adjusted in relation to fish tolerance thresholds and employed to calculate water environmental capacity wec the variation in wec was dynamically fed back to the quantity of environmental flows whereby streamflows could be ecologically regulated and pollutants discharged into rivers could be reasonably controlled based on dynamical streamflow regulation and pollutant discharge control both quantity and quality of environmental flows were optimized 2 methodology 2 1 study area the wei river is the largest tributary of the yellow river china the wei river basin lying between 103 5 and 110 5 e and 33 5 37 5 n is located in a continental monsoon climatic zone the daily mean temperature ranges from 6 to 14 c with annual mean rainfall from 450 to 700 mm and annual mean evaporation ranging from 1000 to 2000 mm li et al 2014 in recent decades the whole basin has witnessed many serious high severity drought episodes with prolonged drought durations huang et al 2014 the wei river basin plays an important role in the development of west china it is the major region for agriculture industry and commerce in northwestern china song et al 2007 over the past decades intensive human activities have had a substantial negative impact on the wei river characterized by decreasing annual runoff and heavy pollution through increased extraction and unsustainable use of water zuo et al 2014 as a consequence 69 2 of the water quality observations exceeded the national water protection standards in 2009 and resulted in serious degradation of ecosystem function including reduced fish species richness contracted wetlands and decreased forest vegetation wu et al 2014b the main pollution issues in this region are chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh3 n levels biological oxygen demand bod5 volatile phenols and petroleum zhang et al 2012 among these cod as an indicator of organic pollutants in surface waters had the highest concentration over all sampling events in both wet and dry situations with values much greater than the other three indicators which severely threated fish assemblages and resulted in ecosystem function degradation li et al 2011 wu et al 2014b and is therefore worth special attention in future ecological rehabilitation studies therefore in this paper cod is used as a surrogate for water quality in the wei river study to protect the fish assemblages therein linjiacun ljc and xianyang xy are two important hydrological and water quality stations along the river the catchment of the river section from ljc to xy fig 1 encompasses important cities and a large agricultural area frequent drought spells plus high levels of water abstraction has impacted normal ecosystem functions additionally agricultural return water as well as industrial wastewater discharge and domestic sewage guo et al 2013 seriously affected the health of riverine ecosystems substantially restricting the sustainable development of the region to sustain local socio economic development the health of riverine ecosystems must be given the highest priority with the aim of protecting and rehabilitating their ecosystem functions to achieve this goal the assessment of streamflows for the environment e flows that considers both pollutant reduction and the tolerance of aquatic organisms to pollutant levelin riverine ecosystems is urgently needed 2 2 data data requirements for the method in the present study that do not need long term hydrological and water quality monitoring programs are considerably lower than traditional methods for e flow assessment the essential dataset includes dominant fish species and their tolerance to pollutants as well as some hydrological and water quality observations the dominant fish species is accessible by way of on site catch or fishery investigation while their tolerance values are available in published literature or online datasets 2 2 1 water quality indicators and streamflows water quality indicators cod and streamflows at the water quality stations ljc and xy and at sewage outlets water use canal and tributaries from jan 2007 to dec 2009 were provided by the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources mwr china all sewage outlets water use canals and tributaries were generalized as one virtual sewage outlet into the river gso in fig 2 to facilitate the calculation of e flows the mainstream section of the wei river between the two water quality stations ljc and xy was selected to study its e flows there are nine sewage outlets nine tributaries and two water abstraction canals along the 197 km length of this section of the river fig 1 all raw data were subjected to quality control before use with the quality control methods of smirnov et al 2000 2 2 2 fish species and their tolerances the study of wu et al 2014a on the fish community of the wei river reveals that five fish species misgurnus anguillicaudatus opsariichthys bidens pseudorasbora parva abbottina rivularis and carassius auratus dominate the fish community under intensive anthropogenic disturbances e g channelization and dam construction many native fish species are absent han et al 2008a b garcia et al 2011 gomes and wai 2014 chu et al 2015 gibson et al 2015 increasing the risk that there exists no target species for e flows calculation to reduce the absence risk dominant fish species instead of native fish species were selected as instream ecological target species to assess e flows requirements of the five fish species for flow velocity and cod were obtained from two sources one of which was the selected records from the integrated dataset of three extensive field campaigns in jinan city zhao et al 2015a jinan city is in the lower reach of the yellow river basin whereas the wei river is in the upper reach the other source was published literature the requirements are summarized in tables 1 and 2 in the three extensive field campaigns in jinan city attributes inclusive of 37 hydrologic physical and chemical parameters were measured concurrently with the fish sampling during three periods may 1st 20th august 2nd 21st and november 1st 20th 2014 the three periods cover the most variable possibilities of the attributes meanwhile 5084 fish were sampled and tested concurring with hydrological and water quality parameters measured at a total of 144 sites 2 3 methods for e flows assessment with streamflow regulation and pollutant control the method presented in this paper considers fish requirements for streamflow and water quality fig 3 the two output coefficients for streamflow regulation and water pollutant control are of use to river administrators and stakeholders for reducing negative impacts of streamflow regulation and pollutant discharge due to unreasonable urbanization agriculture mining and water extraction they can be of great help to maintain or rehabilitate the health of river ecosystems the determination of the ecological velocity v e or the flow velocity required to maintain the elementary functions of instream ecosystem components liu et al 2011 gopal 2013 is the core of the method from which environmental flow q e is determined via the adapted ecological hydraulic radius approach aehra liu et al 2011 river sections need to be generalized for the convenience of e flow calculation in the generalized river section e flows q e considering only water quantity were initially estimated using aehra subsequently based on the range of both v e and q e the water environmental capacity w range is then calculated and recommended using the weca method presented in this paper the recommended w range can be slightly adjusted by river administrators and stakeholders in special situations e g under a severe drought the adjustment of w is fed back to v e and then q e after several iterations of dynamic adjustments of w v e and q e a set of three variables is determined with which streamflow in the ucc reach fig 2a could be regulated using the streamflow regulation coefficient α the ratio of q e to river discharge through ucc and pollutants discharged into the river could be controlled by the pollutant control coefficient β the ratio of actual pollutant discharge to wec at gso 2 3 1 river section generalization in the present study the river is assumed to be one dimensional with point source pollutant and non point source pollutant discharges tributaries and water use canals defined as a single generalized sewage outlet gso the gso position can be calculated by the concentration of the studied pollutant a river section between two control cross sections is then generalized as in fig 2a the position of the generalized sewage outlet gso fig 2a can be determined by eq 1 derived from epac 2002 1 x 2 i 1 n q i c i e x i x i i 1 n q i c i e x i i stands for the number of actual sewage outlets or tributaries i 1 n n is the number of sewage outlets x i refers to the distance from the outlet to the dcc q i refers to the pollutant discharge rate at the i th outlet in m3 s 1 c i is the concentration of a specific pollutant corresponding to q i at the i th outlet in mg l 1 2 3 2 e flows assessment q e using the aehra the core of the aehra is the determination of ecological velocity v e in m s 1 the velocity requirements for fish species vary with season which can be determined by v e v l o w v high v low is the lowest threshold of velocity for the dominant fish species while v high is the highest threshold both v low and v high can be determined from the attributes given in table 1 having obtained the v e e flows q e in the river section can be estimated using the aehra eq 2 when cross sectional data were absent in a data scarce river they were obtained via the cross section generalization method in the aehra liu et al 2011 2 q e 1 n r e 2 3 a e j 1 2 with r e n 3 2 v e 3 2 j 3 4 q e is e flow in m3 s 1 r e refers to the watercourse hydraulic radius ratio between cross sectional flow area and its wetted perimeter corresponding to v e in m a e flow area for e flows in m2 n roughness or manning s n which is dimensionless j hydraulic slope in with q e river administrators can regulate streamflows through the ucc q 0 by using the streamflow regulation coefficient α q e q 0 for the purpose of pollutant dilution and the rehabilitation of its ecology then a recommended range of α l o w α high was suggested to river administrators or stakeholders for streamflow regulation after iterations of adjustment on w fig 3 2 3 3 water environmental capacity calculation with streamflow regulation and pollutant control by linking fish tolerance to water quality criteria herein we put forward a new method for water environmental capacity assessment weca with streamflow regulation and pollutant control in a river section wec as a measure of the water s maximum capacity to accommodate a pollutant within a unit of time in a river section is mainly subjected to rate of streamflows which can be regulated based on the coefficient α q e q 0 the coefficient will also induce the regulation of mean flow velocity u in m s 1 the magnitude of the flow velocity positively influences the value of the integrated degradation coefficient of a pollutant which determines the rate of dilution and the degradation efficiency of the pollutant and in turn influences wec in the river section fig 2a if the pollutant concentration in the cross section of a generalized sewage outlet gso in fig 2a equals the water quality criteria i e c c s fig 2b we can express the total mass of the pollutant in a river section as eq 3 based on the mass conservation law and the first order kinetics formula c c 0 e k t kadlec and knight 1996 3 q 0 c 0 w q 0 q c s q 0 c 0 1 e k x 1 86 4 u where the left side is the total mass of the pollutant in a river section and the right side is the total pollutant capacity for dilution and degradation under conditions of pollutant control the total mass of the pollutant is assumed to never exceed the total pollutant capacity in the river w stands for wec in g s 1 k is the integrated degradation coefficient measuring the rate at which the environment can remove a pollutant in d 1 u is the average flow velocity in a river section in m s 1 x 1 is the distance of the generalized sewage outlet from the ucc in km fig 2 accordingly wec w can be solved as 4 w q 0 q c s q 0 c 0 e k x 1 86 4 u wherein the fish tolerance to pollutant concentration integrated threshold in table 2 is embodied in the water quality criteria c s which is achieved by satisfying both requirements of fish species and river functions to pollutant concentration the previous value of c s for a pollutant is modified to a level tolerated by the dominant fish species the previous c s value is the minimum of all css for river functions e g water use for agriculture industry swimming etc the criteria css are drawn from water quality standards e g the chinese national environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 epac 2002 whereby the previous c s value for cod is 30 mg l 1 for the section ljc xy with a river function for agricultural and industrial water supply when pollutant discharge into rivers exceeds the water environmental capacity w pollutant control is the most appropriate way to maintain the pollutant concentration within that of the fish tolerance threshold values u in eq 4 is initialized by v e v l o w v high in table 1 and accordingly w w l o w w high are calculated based on eq 4 with w l o w the wec calculated using the lower u value and w high the wec using the higher u value in the next iteration of calculation the value of u is expected to be dynamically adjusted with w which is regulated by river administrators or stakeholders based on a pollutant control coefficient here the cod measured pollutant control coefficient is defined as β w a w with β β l o w β high in accordance with the range w l o w w high w a in g s 1 is the actual pollutant discharge at the gso which can be calculated using eq 5 that we derived from the generalized river model fig 2 and mass conservation law with any pollutant control coefficient β selected by river administrators the value of u can be calculated iteratively with eq 4 the recalculated u is fed back to the calculation of the streamflow regulation coefficient α as fig 2 shows 5 w a i 1 n q i c i e k x i x 86 4 u a where x is the distance of the gso from the dcc and x i is the distance of the i th sewage outlet from the dcc w a includes those pollutant discharges from point and non point sources and tributaries water abstraction can be regarded as the opposite of tributaries data of which come from field observations or model simulations a non point source pollutant is estimated with the storm runoff based mean concentration method li et al 2011 u a is the actual mean flow velocity in the studied river section and can be calculated as the average of the flow velocity observed at the ucc and dcc the above mentioned cod measured pollutant control coefficient β can greatly facilitate the practical operation of pollutant discharge control if necessary the coefficient β measured by other indicators e g nh3 n bod5 can also be calculated to facilitate the control of pollutant discharged into rivers in the present study a recommended range of β l o w β high would be highly acceptable to river administrators and stakeholders 3 results 3 1 river section generalization and water quality criteria modification according to the conceptual model in fig 2 all outlets into from the river section ljc xy were generalized as one virtual outlet gso 3 06 km upstream from station xy the river section between stations ljc and xy fig 1 is the water source for both industry and agriculture hence the c s cod for river function is 30 mg l 1 according to the national environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 epac 2002 while the maximum cod levels that the five fish species opsariichthys bidens carassius auratus pseudorasbora parva misgurnus anguillicaudatus and abbottina rivularis can tolerate were respectively 19 2 130 6 64 5 28 3 and 64 5 mg l 1 the minimum of maximum values the above five values was 19 2 mg l 1 most likely the maximum of minimum values of cod levels that the five fish species can tolerate is 8 94 mg l 1 as listed in table 2 thus the range for fish species ranged between 8 94 and 19 2 mg l 1 therefore the c s of 30 mg l 1 for the studied river section was modified to range between 8 94 and 19 2 mg l 1 after the fish tolerance to cod level was integrated 3 2 e flows assessment and streamflow regulation in the river section ljc xy drifting fish roe of opsariichthys bidens table 1 will sink onto the riverbed and perish when the flow velocity is lower than 0 8 m s 1 zhao et al 2010 therefore in the fish spawning season from june to august flow velocity must be kept higher than 0 8 m s 1 for the roe of o bidens to survive even though the velocity of 0 8 m s 1 is higher than the critical velocity of adult o bidens they could seek shelter in the lower velocity deep water habitat or near the river bank accordingly the following ecological velocity for fish in the wei river is recommended higher than 0 8 m s 1 from june to august and between 0 30 and 0 34 m s 1 in the other months table 1 the ecological velocity ranges of 0 30 0 34 m s 1 were determined by the coupling of optimal velocity vopt and critical velocity vcrit the minimum optimal velocity which can satisfy all the five fish species is 0 30 m s 1 and the maximum optimal value is 0 34 m s 1 the critical velocity for the fish abbottina rivularis is 0 34 m s 1 a higher velocity than which would pose a higher survival risk to the species and its larvae on integrating the cod level requirements for the five fish species with the standard cod level 30 mg l 1 as shown in table 2 e flows and the corresponding streamflow regulation coefficients were calculated using eq 2 for aehra fig 4 the e flow magnitude varied by month and remained high during the period from july through september fig 4 to satisfy e flows streamflows must be regulated with the coefficient ranging between low and high α values generally streamflow necessitates higher regulation in dry seasons than in wet seasons in detail higher streamflows q 0 in most of the wet season from july through september necessitated a lower streamflow regulation while lower streamflows in the other season oct june required higher regulation moreover the difference between α low and α high in the wet season was small whereas the difference in the dry season was large due to the lower streamflow q 0 plus the higher e flow q e 3 3 wec calculation and cod measured pollutant control the wec process for cod was similar to that of the e flows fig 4 and was heavily affected by streamflow q 0 fig 5 the process remained high when the streamflow was high during the wet season while in the dry season it remained low most of the time to keep the cod level within the tolerance range of the five fish species the cod discharged into rivers had to be reduced greatly with the coefficients β low and β high the two coefficients were heavily affected by streamflow they remained lower with little reduction in wet seasons than in dry seasons the difference between β low and β high was small during most years from 2007 to 2009 3 4 the integrated degradation coefficient and its influencing factors water temperature flow velocities and river length for pollutants to mix dilute and degrade are important sources of uncertainties in the estimation of the integrated degradation coefficient k su 2006 liu et al 2007 wang et al 2012 our calculations show that the value of k for cod decreased with river length in detail k decreased abruptly in the initial 3 km of the flow path while the decreasing trend slowed down and k plateaued within a river length of 4 10 km in other words the minimum river length threshold must be a priority to obtain a steady k value therefore the minimum mixing length caep 2003 to ensure that pollutants mixed uniformly in the study river was 10 km to explore the role of water temperature and flow velocity in the variation of k the two factors variation processes and relationships with k are illustrated in fig 6 the river sections ljc xy and downstream of xy xy hx were studied to demonstrate the influences of t w and u on k taking into account the influences of the above two factors on k liu et al 2007 suggested that the optimized k value in july 2006 for cod near station xy was 1 03 d 1 which was similar to our results in july 2007 2009 where the k values for cod were 0 38 0 83 d 1 upstream of station xy and 0 70 1 27 d 1 downstream of this station fig 8 g likewise su 2006 studied the cod degradation process near station xy based on a water quality dataset from 1992 to 2001 and derived the highest k value for cod of 1 43 d 1 which was similar to the highest value of 1 36 d 1 in aug 2007 in the present study fig 6c variations in water temperature and flow velocity explained the above differences water temperature near station xy in july 2006 was 26 03 c with a flow velocity of 0 46 m s 1 liu et al 2007 while the water temperature in july 2007 was 22 11 c with a flow velocity of 0 97 m s 1 which led to a higher k value for cod 1 27 d 1 as shown in fig 6d and e water temperature and flow velocity had the closest relationships with k fig 6a and b in both sections k exponentially increased with water temperature while the upstream section ljc xy had a slower k increase than that in the downstream section xy hx fig 6a contrary to water temperature flow velocity drove k to increase logarithmically fig 6b flow velocity in the upstream section had smaller influences on k compared with that in the downstream section in brief the influences of water temperature and flow velocity on the integrated degradation coefficient were remarkably substantial and influences on the downstream section were even greater than that in the upstream section both flow velocity and its standard deviation are important in explaining water quality variation gomes and wai 2014 the speed of pollutant degradation or the integrated degradation coefficient is critically influenced by attenuation and assimilation processes our analyses of the relationships between the degradation coefficient of cod and flow velocity as well as their derivatives revealed that flow velocity itself u had a much greater influence on the degradation coefficient k than the standard deviation of flow velocity u sd based on temporal variations fig 6b vs fig 7a in both the upstream section ljc xy and downstream section xy hx the correlations of k u fig 6b had higher correlation coefficients r2 than the k u sd fig 7a variations in u sd had greater influences on the degradation coefficient k mean fig 7a than its standard deviation k sd fig 7b with higher trend slopes in both the up and downstream river sections to summarize the mean flow velocity had a much greater influence on the attenuation and assimilation processes of water quality than did the standard deviation of the flow velocity 4 discussion the method presented in this paper successfully integrates the requirements of fish species and pollution control into the e flow assessment the presence of streamflow adjustments and pollutant control coefficients in the method makes it easy to use and substantially helpful to river administrators and stake holders in many aspects e g reduction of noxious odors and sulfide problems rauch and kleidorfer 2014 decrease of higher pollutant tolerant species and increase of lower pollutant tolerant species zhao et al 2010 gradually increasing biodiversity and rehabilitating aquatic ecosystems 4 1 rationale for the selection of the key water quality indicator agriculture and industry occupy predominant positions in the development of the wei river basin song et al 2007 which resulted in heavy pollution that seriously degraded its ecosystem function wu et al 2014b for instance large nitrogen sources are typically associated with agricultural activities in most regions craig et al 2008 of all water quality indicators chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh3 n biological oxygen demand bod5 volatile phenols and petroleum are five principal indicators in this basin zhang et al 2012 intensive human disturbance of the soil through agricultural tilling resulted in high cod levels in both water and sediment samples from the wei river chen et al 2003 li et al 2011 because cod is used to indicate organic pollutants in surface waters its sources consist of soil particles agricultural chemicals fertilizer and natural organic substances from disturbed surface soils in the wei river basin li et al 2011 it should be noted that cod with the highest concentration of all of the main water quality indicators li et al 2011 exerted the most stress on fish communities in the wei river and contributed greatly to ecosystem function degradation negatively influencing fish communities wetlands and forest vegetation wu et al 2014a b in addition we studied the influences of hydrological physical and chemical habitat factors on fish species in jinan city downstream of our study area showing that both forms of cod codmn codcr or permanganate index chemical oxygen demand see fig 2 in zhao et al 2015a had the highest biplot scores in the canonical correspondence analysis cca of the chemical habitat factors moreover codmn was highly correlated with codcr and nh3 n with correlation coefficients greater than 0 51 therefore codmn was selected to be one of the seven key habitat factors determining fish communities thus cod should be given the highest priority in future ecological rehabilitation programs and deserves a role as a surrogate of water quality for e flows studies in the wei river similarly water quality indicators were also studied by gomes and wai 2014 where eight indicators were selected as surrogates of water quality they were unable to nominate one or two principal water quality indicators as surrogates because in their research land use in the mountainous area was devoid of medium to large scale industries which differed greatly from the agriculture and industry dominated wei river basin additionally the total catchment area of 4 21 km2 in their research was far less than 135 000 km2 of the wei river basin li et al 2011 which differed greatly spatially and therefore resulted in different surrogates for water quality in the two study areas in brief the multiple surrogates for water quality in gomes and wai 2014 are appropriate for a catchment with little agricultural and industrial activities these surrogates in a large scale basin such as in the present study do not feature prominently compared with cod thus cod is deemed a suitable water quality surrogate for large scale basins with heavy pollution resulting from agricultural and industrial activities chen et al 2003 li et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 as exemplified by the wei river basin 4 2 divergence in e flow assessment over the three years 2007 2009 the annual streamflow q 0 continued to decrease fig 4 especially during the wet season july october q 0 in the 2008 wet season was half that of 2007 and q 0 in the 2009 wet season was a quarter that of 2007 statistically more than 80 of the months need increasing the streamflow magnitude to satisfy e flows requirement on quantity through reducing water use for agriculture and industry etc or diverting water from outside the watershed many water diversion projects e g the south to north water transfer project in shaanxi province have been put into practice in our study area but most diverted water were used by industry with a small portion used for ecological remediation chang and jiang 2011 therefore it is possible to satisfy e flows quantity requirements by referring to the streamflow regulation coefficients presented in this study song et al 2007 studied e flows for the wei river by considering streamflow quantity requirements for aquatic biotopes seepage evaporation pollutant self purification and sediment transportation their results showed that the e flows for physical habitat maintenance near station ljc ranged from 51 1 to 100 2 m3 s 1 in the wet season while they ranged from 38 7 to 71 5 m3 s 1 in the dry season january june and november december our results ranged from 43 0 to 148 96 m3 s 1 in the wet season and from 39 95 to 131 59 m3 s 1 in the dry season on average our results were higher than those in song et al 2007 in which they used the montana or tennant method tennant 1976 to calculate the e flows for aquatic ecosystems a minimum 10 of the averaged measured streamflow was regarded as being necessary for maintenance of aquatic ecosystems a minimum e flow value may not be enough to maintain a healthy physical habitat arthington et al 2006 moreover the method song et al 2007 used for physical habitat maintenance is more appropriate for rivers without human impacts and is generally used as a rough verification of other approaches liu et al 2011 where human impacts exist according to chen et al 2013 most e flow methods such as the instream flow incremental methodology ifim have been subject to criticism because of their inability to consider discharge biomass relationships however when considering these relationships large data requirements limit the construction of stress response relationships in data scarce rivers where the required information is not yet broadly available regionally or globally bobbi et al 2014 moreover the failure to integrate water quality into e flow assessments restricts their applicability to catchments with poor water quality because the e flow assessment includes not only water quantity but also water quality brisbane declaration 2007 scherman et al 2003 used water quality information biological assessment information and toxicological data to assess the water quality component of environmental flow assessments hart et al 1999 defined a concentration response relationship between a driving water quality parameter and ecosystem health paredes arquiola et al 2014 integrated three essential components i e water quantity water quality and habitat suitability for aquatic species into e flow assessment but the complex sub models limit their application especially in developing countries as they require substantial detailed monitoring data of water quantity quality and ecology the method presented in this paper deems fish species as the basic attribute and closely couples their requirements with water quality by the re establishment of water quality criteria concerning their tolerance levels moreover our method recommends both pollutant control and streamflow regulation measures to satisfy e flows which is more practical than the pollutant dilution self purification approach recommended by song et al 2007 under a background of decreasing runoff and heavy pollutant inputs in their research e flows accounted for 41 5 77 5 of total streamflow in the wei river in the wet season and 56 1 87 0 in the dry season the simple percentages without dynamic regulation on both streamflow and pollutant discharge into rivers may have presented heavy constraints to regional development under decreasing streamflows and worsening water quality scenarios the method presented in this paper with two coefficients recommended for dynamic streamflow regulation and pollutant discharge control can help reduce water use and is helpful for river administrators and stake holders to retain or rehabilitate the diversity of river ecosystems in addition the relatively low data requirement of our model makes it easy to use in rivers all over the world it should be noted that the range of flows in our results is small because there were not sufficient target species and streamflow data available under the condition of lacking detailed monitoring on taxa and habitat if the constant small range of flows was strictly maintained without introducing bankfull or pulse flows harmful events e g extinction of some other taxa would be triggered as a naturally variable regime of flow is required to sustain freshwater ecosystems poff et al 2010 therefore under certain circumstances bankfull and pulse flows are expected to be introduced beside the small range of flows in order to sustain much more taxa since most adult fish could seek lower velocity shelters moreover there is no differentiation between native and invasive fish species due to few invasive species reported in our study area actually invasive species as the second cause of the extinction of world fish result in declines and extinctions of native species which greatly reduces the native fish diversity clavero and garcía berthou 2005 mitigating the impact of invasive species and preventing future invasions to reduce the native fish diversity loss should be given the top priority hermoso et al 2011 had the difference of flow velocity requirement and pollutant tolerance between native and invasive species been known it would be of great help to regulate streamflow and control pollutant discharge using the method in this paper to foster native species replacing invasive species whereby to prevent the proliferation of invasive species 4 3 uncertainties in the weca model few weca models consider the head control of pollutant discharge among these we selected two head control models the zhou model by zhou et al 1999 and the dang model by dang et al 2009 to compare our models the wecs for cod were calculated and compared fig 8 monthly river discharge datasets greater than zero were selected from 1998 to 2003 the zhou model dang model and our model displayed similar trends in the rates of wec for cod with the values of wec calculated with our model lying between them the comparisons revealed that our model is practical and robust in assessing water environment capacities though some uncertainties may still exist to reduce uncertainties in the method in this paper determinations of ecological velocity v e and integrated degradation coefficient k necessitate much more intensive information on the relationships between biomass and velocity k and velocity and k and water temperature based on long term datasets of velocity water quality and ecosystems furthermore to efficiently rehabilitate aquatic ecosystem hotspots pollutant removal should be effectively identified by employing appropriate methods such as in craig et al 2008 with which the pollutant control coefficient recommended in our method could be more practical and the recommended streamflow regulation coefficient could be more efficient to be more effective stream rehabilitation should be conducted as complementary to land based best management practices craig et al 2008 the weca model which takes cod as a pollutant indicator to assess water environment capacity in a river section performed satisfactorily in terms of the degradable organic pollutants however it was not tested for inorganic pollutants there are many inorganic pollutants in waters e g heavy metals which can persist for long periods altering aquatic community structure and their interaction with organic matter still remains unclear castro català et al 2016 wojtkowska et al 2016 chemical concentrations alone are insufficient to demonstrate their adverse environmental effects castro català et al 2016 therefore the weca model may not be applicable when it comes to inorganic non degradable pollutants 5 conclusion a new method to integrate both the requirements of the ecosystem and pollution control into e flow assessment closely couples the water quantity and quality requirements of aquatic ecosystems this is accomplished by modifying water quality criteria with fish pollutant tolerance concentrations traditional water quality criteria for pollutants are usually determined for water use types e g for industry agriculture and drinking which are subject to human needs in this paper the tolerance of fish to pollutant concentrations was integrated into the determination of water quality criteria with which the water environmental capacity wec of a river section could be calculated considering both human and ecosystem requirements applications of the method in the wei river the largest tributary of the yellow river china suggest that the actual streamflow in dry seasons failed to meet e flows thus multi river or inter river sections of water resource allocations are required to meet human and environmental demands pollutant levels e g chemical oxygen demand cod exerted a strong influence on the aquatic ecosystem with pollutant concentrations much higher than the tolerance threshold of the dominant fish species moreover analysis of the integrated degradation coefficient suggests a river length of 10 km in the wei river is required for pollutants to mix completely moreover both water temperature and flow velocity exerted great influences on the integrated degradation coefficient which were greater in the downstream than in the upstream sections of the wei river the advantages of the method in this paper include the ease of operation and relatively lower data requirement as well as the recommended streamflow regulation and pollution control coefficients these attributes give the method great potential to be widely used in developing countries regions which may lack long term hydrological water quality and or ecological datasets acknowledgements we thank
