19725,the widespread adoption of engineered wetlands designed for water treatment is hindered by uncertainties in system reliability resilience and management associated with coupled biological and physical processes to better understand how shallow unit process open water wetlands self colonize and evolve we analyzed the composition of the microbial community in benthic biomats from system establishment through approximately 3 years of operation our analysis was conducted across three parallel demonstration scale 7500 m2 cells located within the prado constructed wetlands in southern california they received water from the santa ana river 5 9 0 2 mg l no3 n a water body where the flow is dominated by municipal wastewater effluent from may to november phylogenetic inquiry and microscopy confirmed that diatoms and an associated aerobic bacterial community facilitated early colonization after approximately nine months of operation coinciding with late summer an anaerobic community emerged with the capability for nitrate attenuation varying the hydraulic residence time hrt from 1 to 4 days the subsequent year resulted in modest ecological changes across the three parallel cells that were most evident in the outlet regions of the cells the community that established at this time was comparatively stable for the remaining years of operation and converged with one that had previously formed approximately 550 km 350 miles away in a pilot scale 400 m2 wetland in northern california that system received denitrified 20 7 0 7 mg l no3 n secondary treated municipal wastewater for 5 years of operation establishment of a core microbiome between the two systems revealed a strong overlap of both aerobic and anaerobic taxa with approximately 50 of the analyzed bacterial sequences shared between the two sites additionally the same species of diatom stauirsa construens var venter was prolific in both systems as the putative dominant primary producer our results indicate that despite differences in scale geographic location and source waters the shallow open water wetland design can select for a rapid convergence of microbial structure and functionality associated with the self colonizing benthic biomat this resulting biomat matures over the first growing season with operational parameters such as hrt further exerting a modest selective bias on community succession graphical abstract image 1 keywords constructed wetlands microbial ecology water treatment 1 introduction constructed wetlands designed for water treatment have evolved from traditional vegetated surface flow wetlands to further capitalize upon the natural interplay between macrophytic and microbial processes inherent in a variety of managed natural systems faulwetter et al 2009 jasper et al 2013 kadlec and wallace 2009 reddy and d angelo 1994 designs now incorporate variables including aquatic plants introduced geomedia depth hydraulic properties and subsurface flow in order to address regional climate challenges optimal contaminant removal and other practitioner goals for example the selection of different plant types has been shown to result in varying denitrification potential bastviken et al 2003 while geomedia amendments such as zeolite have proven to increase the abundance of ammonium oxidizing microorganisms gorra et al 2007 research on wetland biogeochemistry has largely focused on carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycling reddy and delaune 2008 and is still evolving as our understanding of microbial nutrient cycling pathways increases hu et al 2014 jones et al 2017 zhu et al 2010 more applied research in engineered systems has investigated the microbially mediated removal of trace organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals that are minimally attenuated within municipal wastewater treatment plants jasper et al 2014a li et al 2014 onesios et al 2009 verlicchi and zambello 2014 while the removal of these trace organic contaminants is in part attributed to microorganisms investigations into how environmental conditions hijosa valsero et al 2010 jasper et al 2014a removal pathways and microbial diversity impact treatment efficiency are ongoing a myriad of factors have been shown to affect microbial community composition in freshwater wetlands including influent properties arroyo et al 2015 whether the wetland was naturally established or constructed ansola et al 2014 sediment properties peralta et al 2013 previous land use hartman et al 2008 peralta et al 2010 geographical location and vegetation type angeloni et al 2006 menon et al 2013 yarwood et al 2016 this can lead to challenges in design guidelines and inconsistencies in treatment performance and permitting hence the ability to design wetlands and predict the resultant microbial community and functionality would be beneficial to the increased adoption of constructed wetlands and other natural treatment systems fortunately combined molecular biological and bioinformatic approaches enable a new level of comparison within and across systems where the effects of operational variables and design parameters on the microbial community can be further explored in building upon this theme we have focused research on a novel macrophyte free design employing a shallow unit process open water wetland system with a geotextile liner that is naturally colonized with a photosynthetic periphyton like biomat jasper et al 2014a while visually similar to waste stabilization ponds this shallow design was intended for photolytic degradation of organic pollutants jasper and sedlak 2013 and pathogen inactivation nguyen et al 2015 silverman et al 2015 however during pilot scale operation it became apparent that the microbial assemblage within the self colonizing biomat facilitated organic pollutant and nitrate attenuation rates that rivaled and in many cases exceeded that of more traditional engineered vegetated wetlands jasper et al 2014b 2014a this study focuses on the establishment and colonization of a series of parallel demonstration scale shallow unit process open water wetlands over almost three years and their comparison to a smaller 5 of the area pilot scale system that remained operational for approximately five years the demonstration scale wetland cells are located in corona ca and receive effluent dominated santa ana river water while the pilot scale system was located approximately 350 miles to the north in discovery bay ca and received secondary treated nitrified wastewater bear et al 2017 jasper and sedlak 2013 while there were pronounced differences in geographic location scale and receiving water properties the constructs maintained an analogous design and were operated in a temperate mediterranean climate both systems employed a barrier at the ground surface to prevent macrophyte growth and a shallow water level of 20 25 cm was maintained in order to maximize sunlight penetration of the water column the objectives of our present study were twofold 1 to understand ecological processes involved in the establishment and succession of the biomat community within this constructed natural treatment system and 2 to determine if differences in scale receiving waters and geographic location would impact the structure and functionality of the benthic biomat the work was guided by an overarching hypothesis that despite differences in scale and geographic location similarly designed and managed unit process open water wetland cells would establish analogous naturally colonized benthic biomats with similar ecological signatures and associated water treatment functionalities 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the pilot scale system was built and operated as a 20 m 20 m serpentine configuration from 2009 to 2014 in discovery bay ca as depicted in fig si 1 this unit process wetland was constructed as a baffled cell and received nitrified wastewater effluent 20 7 0 7 mg l no3 n from a proximal wastewater treatment facility the larger demonstration scale system began operation in december of 2013 and is a subset of the longer operating prado constructed wetlands that are managed by the orange county water district these unit process cells are still in operation with microbial analyses concluding in october of 2016 this larger scale managed natural treatment system is situated within the constructed wetlands near the prado dam in southern california and consists of three 30 m 260 m cells running in parallel fig si 1 the wetlands receive water from the santa ana river 5 9 0 2 mg l no3 n which is dominated by municipal wastewater effluent from may to november further comparison of select inlet water and system design parameters can be found in table 1 discovery bay was half lined with cement and half with geotextile material and had a hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 3 days the prado system is fully lined with a permeable geotextile material and was established with an initial hrt of approximately 2 days after the first year of operation december 2013 december 2014 these prado wetland cells were adjusted to have different hrts of 1 2 and 4 days the prado construct experienced a disturbance when a deeper upstream equalization pond which allows for influent flow control was reconstructed in january of 2015 during which time flow ceased and residual water remained in the cells for approximately 2 weeks additionally there was a pronounced duckweed colonization event in september 2015 in which duckweed covered 90 of the water surface area for much of that month 2 2 biomat collection with a goal of investigating temporal trends biomat samples from the three parallel prado shallow open water cells were collected approximately monthly after establishment from december 2013 through 2015 four additional sampling events were conducted between august and october 2016 biomat was collected from the inlet middle and outlet regions of each of the 3 parallel cells shown in si fig 1 in 50 ml conical tubes for a total of nine samples per month biomat material from the discovery bay wetland cell was sampled on may 5th 2014 that corresponded to approximately 5 years after the start of operation samples were collected in triplicate in 4 equally spaced locations along the horizontal transect of the wetland and further discretized as a function of three different depths within the laminar biomat jones et al 2017 biomat samples from both wetland locations were immediately chilled and then transported by overnight courier to the laboratory where they were centrifuged decanted and archived at 20 c samples then remained frozen until thawed for further processing and analysis 2 3 freeze dried archives and scanning electron microscopy archived samples were thawed in batches and then freeze dried in a labconco freezone6 in order to normalize extraction by dry weight as well as to archive samples for future microscopic or other analyses jones et al 2017 freeze dried samples from both wetlands were placed on carbon tape and gold sputtered with a hummer iv sputtering system images were taken with a jeol jsm 700f field emission scanning electron microscope fesem pictures were adjusted for contrast 2 4 dna extraction and 16s rrna gene sequencing dna extractions were performed using the powersoil biofilm dna extraction kit on 0 0025 g of freeze dried biomat amplification purification and normalization of samples for 16s rrna gene sequencing was performed in accordance with published methods using dual indexed primers 515f and 806r caporaso et al 2011 for the v4 region fig si 2 with minor modifications to the protocol which exclude the bioanalyzer steps and include an additional concentration step kozich et al 2013 briefly 2 μl of extracted dna was amplified with dual indexed primers for 30 cycles phusion master mix new england biolabs amplicons were normalized and purified with the sequalprep normalization plate kit normalized amplicons were pooled and concentrated with amicon ultra 0 5 ml 30k centrifugal filter devices pooled concentrates were quantified and sequenced by the biofrontiers institute at cu boulder using the illumina miseq platform with a v2 2 250 cycle reagent kit 2 5 bioinformatic analyses processing of demultiplexed raw sequences was performed with qimme 1 9 as previously described jones et al 2017 after processing and quality filtering the illumina 16s rrna gene reads a total of 7 287 041 paired end sequences were obtained from 280 samples subsequently 8 samples with fewer than 8000 sequences were dropped from analysis sampling depth then ranged from 8681 to 837 508 sequences per sample unfortunately 34 samples 5 15 2015 8 21 2015 prado were identified as compromised due to a thawing event during shipping and prior to dna extraction after confirmation of significant community abnormalities from sequencing these samples were removed from further analysis the remaining analysis was performed on 197 samples from prado and 36 samples from discovery bay analyses were based off of a rarefied operation taxonomic unit otu table with 8681 randomly selected sequences per sample except for differential abundance tests for which a negative binomial model was used to normalize counts for each sample mcmurdie and holmes 2014 to evaluate and visualize compositional changes across time at prado and compare community structure to discovery bay we utilized a weighted and unweighted unifrac distance matrix lozupone and knight 2005 followed by principal coordinate analysis and detrended coordinate analysis when temporal data displayed a horse shoe effect statistical differences in weighted unifrac distances were determined using the anosim test and considered significant when p values were less than 0 05 alpha diversity was calculated using both shannon diversity and observed otu measures to account for both evenness and richness across samples differential abundance analyses were used to identify cladal shifts between the inlet and outlet samples at prado using deseq2 love et al 2014 after converting the unrarefied otu table to a deseq object otus were clustered at the family taxonomic level families with total counts across all samples less than 500 were removed to focus on the more abundant families p values were generated using the wald test adjusted for multiple comparisons using the procedure of benjamini and hochberg 1995 and considered significant if less than 0 01 to assess cladal similarities between the mature prado samples those taken from august october 2016 and the discovery bay samples we created core microbiomes defined as the otus that were present in at least 90 and 100 of all samples at both locations demutiplexed sequences are available in the national center for biotechnology information short read archive ncbi sra under project number prjna390172 3 results 3 1 colonization and temporal trends of the prado biomat analysis of community composition at the prado wetland over the study period of approximately three years dec 2013 oct 2016 revealed distinct taxa that underwent significant changes in relative abundance until maturation within a month of system startup a green biofilm began to establish on the geotextile liner phylogenetic sequencing revealed that the 16s rrna plastid gene harbored within the chloroplast of diatoms stramenopiles was present at this early stage and remained throughout the study period fig 1 while diatom chloroplast 16s sequences initially accounted for 18 of sequences relative sequence abundance fluctuated throughout operation with a range of 0 3 37 6 the lowest abundance was observed shortly after the cessation of flow in january 2015 to enable forebay reconstruction while the highest abundance was observed during the last sampling events in october 2016 it should be noted that this interpretation is grounded on amplification of 16s plastid sequences harbored within chloroplasts hence quantification is biased when contrasting bacterial and eukaryotic community members and should rather be interpreted as comparative temporal trends of diatom chloroplast presence to better understand system evolution and establishment the top 20 most abundant bacterial and archaeal families found within the prado biomat were tracked with time for the inlet biomat samples derived across the three cells fig 2 the three parallel cells in this inlet region were highly similar to one another as analyzed in the next section trends revealed a relative stability for many families within the system including rhodobacteraceae verrucomicrobiaceae and flavobacteriaceae families containing the strict anaerobes anaerolinaceae methanobacteriaceae and methanosarcinales had initial relative abundances of less than 0 1 but all increased to 3 5 after 9 months this trend is likely due to an increased accumulation of the biomat which had an approximate depth of 2 3 cm in the inlet region and tapering off to 1 cm near the outlet after this establishment phase the top 20 most abundant families show little variation for the remaining two years of sample collection and analysis further insight into the establishment and stability of the microbial community within the biomat was gained by observing diversity and richness over time fig si 3 shannon diversity and species richness analyses revealed a sharp increase after 4 months of operation which also coincided with the spring season and associated increases in light intensity and temperature interestingly there was a sharp decrease in shannon diversity from year 2 to year 3 while species richness remained stable during this time 3 2 prado community spatial association and effects of hydraulic residence time a high degree of similarity was present within the microbial biomats when comparing communities between the three mature prado wetland cells in the summer of 2016 in order to differentiate temporal versus spatial effects on community shifts a detrended correspondence analysis fig 3 and principle coordinate analysis fig si 5 were performed using a weighted unifrac distance matrix due to the severe horseshoe effect in the principle coordinate analysis typically caused by temporal data podani and miklós 2002 the detrended correspondence analysis was chosen as the better representation of the unifrac distance matrix in comparing the wetland cells as a whole our analysis revealed no significant difference in community between the cells fig 3 p 949 r 0 008 anosim the analysis further confirmed that time defined by month is an important driver of community clustering p 001 r 0 720 anosim while the three parallel wetland cells at prado maintained similarity there was local community variation within the longitudinal transect of the cells that was associated with changes in hydraulic residence during the first year of operation at prado when the cells all maintained the same hrt community composition did not vary as a function of location between the three parallel cells anosim inlet p 914 middle p 978 outlet p 667 however when analyzing the mature biomat samples during the late summer of 2016 approximately two years after the hrt across the cells was manipulated to establish parallel systems with residences of 1 4 days a difference in community profile was found as a function of longitudinal position i e inlet middle and outlet between the three cells fig si 4 p 001 r 0 155 anosim more specifically when single locations were discretely contrasted between these three cells neither the inlet nor middle samples varied fig si 4 inlet p 569 r 0 034 middle p 221 r 0 101 anosim however the outlet communities significantly differed across cells as a function of hrt fig si 4 p 002 r 0 405 anosim by contrasting differential abundance across the cells fig 4 taxa exhibited a higher variance between inlet and outlet locations as the hrt became longer i e the cell with a 1 day hrt was most similar throughout the families rhodocyclacea crenotrichacea and candidate family chthoniabacteraceae were found to be more abundant in the outlets than in the inlet for all 3 different hrts while oscillochloridacea chlamydomonadacea rhodospirillaceae and desulfobacteriacea were found to be more abundant in the inlet regions with the cells having 2 and 4 day retention times fig 4 3 3 comparison of biomat between pilot and demonstration scale systems in order to better understand how system design influences microbial colonization and by extension the reproducibility of establishing analogous managed natural treatment wetland constructs biomat samples derived from the pilot scale open water cell in discovery bay that were collected in may of 2014 were compared to the time series samples collected from the prado wetland described in prior sections this comparison was conducted with a detrended correspondence analysis fig 3 and principle coordinate analysis fig si 5 using a weighted unifrac distance matrix consistent with the rapid establishment of the prado community and its comparative stability within the first year of operation this biomat was highly similar to that of discovery bay the pilot system operated for 5 years prior to sampling is approximately 5 of the size of an individual prado cell and is located 550 km to the north of the demonstration scale prado shallow unit process open water wetland construct the discovery bay engineered system has previously been studied with respect to seasonal nitrate removal rates and mechanisms jasper et al 2014b jones et al 2017 as well as trace organic attenuation jasper et al 2014a functionally nitrate removal rates between the two systems were highly similar table 1 highlighting that construction of these two systems resulted in analogous functional nitrate removal bear et al 2017 despite differences in latitudinal separation scales of operation and receiving waters phylogenetic analyses revealed that the last 4 biomat sample collections from prado during the late summer and fall of 2016 significantly clustered with the discovery bay samples harvested from the mature biomat in the late spring of 2014 when contrasted with the earlier biomat samples derived from prado p 001 r 0 186 anosim taking this into consideration a core microbiome analysis was performed between biomats derived from the two different wetland systems fig 5 at 100 ubiquity 36 different otus accounting for 38 2 of the total sequences were shared between prado and discovery bay while at 90 ubiquity 102 otus were identified accounting for 47 8 of the total sequences the most abundant taxonomies in core microbiomes across the sites belonged to diatom chloroplast while sinobacteraceae luteolibacter and various anerolinaceae were also prominent members overall this core community is more enriched in the mature prado wetlands as it comprises 42 of the total relative abundance compared to 35 at discovery bay however the different core community members appear to have relative abundances in analogous ratios generating a microbial fingerprint that is representative of this type of biomat the diatoms were also highly similar with respect to both identity and abundance between the two systems the relative abundance of diatomaceous chloroplast sequences in discovery bay in the spring of 2014 was 18 0 4 8 while there was considerable temporal variation across the broader prado sampling time period fig 1 overall abundance was similar at 15 1 8 4 visual analysis of the biomat samples using fesem confirmed the ubiquity of diatoms at both wetlands importantly these diatoms appeared to be the same species as based on morphological interpretation relating to frustule and valve structure fig 6 the diatoms in the discover bay biomat were previously identified as stauirsa construens var venter jasper et al 2014a 4 discussion prior research in the discovery bay pilot system revealed a unit process shallow open water natural treatment wetland design that holds promise for increased attenuation of trace organics pathogens and nitrate when contrasted with more traditional vegetated engineered wetland systems jasper et al 2014b 2014a nguyen et al 2015 however in moving toward broader adoption it is critical to understand the timeframe and processes associated with establishment and whether this design can be replicated to enable similar microbial ecologic selection and by extension targeted functionality at a variety of scales locations and receiving waters complementary work into functional treatment attributes has revealed that the pilot and demonstration scale systems exhibit analogous nitrate removal rates despite different influent concentrations both systems were able to achieve 90 nitrate removal 70 removal of select beta blockers and 2 3 log removal of pathogen indicators organisms during the summer months additionally models based on the pilot scale system for trace organic pollutants and pathogen indicators were able to accurately predict performance of the demonstration scale system over the course of the year bear et al 2017 by monitoring the prado shallow open water wetland systems from their initial establishment through almost 3 years of operation our ecologically focused study has the unique capability to explore and understand natural ecological colonization and succession as well as investigate if a similarly designed larger scale and geographically distinct system that receives different source waters can select for and host a similar microbial community as the resultant photosynthetic biomats were colonized without any active promotion or inoculation the work also contributes to our broader understanding of the cosmopolitan nature of microorganisms hedlund and staley 2004 and their relevance to the adoption design and establishment of natural treatment systems during the initial colonization of the prado system the most abundant families of bacteria were dominated by aerobic or facultative guilds such as comamonadaceae willems et al 1991 cyclobacteriaceae flavobacteriaceae bernardet et al 2002 chitinophagaceae kampfer et al 2011 and acetobacteraceae kersters et al 2006 fig 2 after approximately 9 months members belonging to strictly anaerobic guilds including fermentative microorganisms such as anerolinaceae yamada 2006 and caldilineaceae sekiguchi 2003 as well as the methanogens methanosarcinaceae and methanobacteriaceae krieg et al 2010 increased in presence this can be explained by vertical stratification associated with biomat growth where a sufficient depth needs to be reached to develop this anaerobic layer within the biomat in support of this vertical stratification theory analysis of community shifts as a function of depth within the biomat located at the discovery bay wetland revealed a pronounced difference between the photosynthesizing surficial community and that below notably this stratification resulted in a subsurface reducing community that was capable of supporting denitrification anammox sulfate reduction and methanogenesis jones et al 2017 this spatial shift in community structure is also consistent with a temporal shift characterized by less nitrate removal during the early months of biomat establishment bear et al 2017 after this initial colonization period a predictive model based on seasonality and removal rates for the pilot scale shallow open water system closely matched actual nitrate removal rates in the demonstration scale prado cells these results collectively support the concept that this vertically stratified assemblage with suboxic zones amenable to denitrification and anammox needs a sufficient temporal period of operation and growth to establish microbial colonization across the three prado demonstration scale cells was highly similar during the first year of operation when the flow rate and other operating conditions were maintained fig 3 in the second year hydraulic residence was manipulated to operate at approximately 1 2 and 4 days across the three different parallel systems biomat community profiles in the outlet portion of the wetland cells revealed a modest divergence as a function of hrt when contrasting the three parallel cells fig 4 and fig si 4 whereas the community in the earlier reaches of the three cells transits remained highly similar a possible explanation is that differing nutrient gradients or some analogous selection by resource limitation is driving this shift during the summer months 90 of the nitrate is removed in the cell with a 4 day hrt versus only 65 removal in the cell with a 1 day hrt bear et al 2017 hence we suggest that potential effects of microbial selection and kinetics of removal should be considered when optimizing operational parameters such as hydraulic residence and system geometry for nitrate removal goals and system resilience another perturbation to hrt occurred during the reconstruction of the equalization forebay in january of 2015 where water remained in the three cells for approximately 2 weeks prior to reestablishing flow just before the hrts were varied there was only a slight microbial community shift in the system as a whole figs 2 and 3 however diatom presence did plummet during that window fig 1 diatom 16s chloroplast relative abundance also dropped in the first summer of establishment which could be caused by several variables including limited sunlight penetration due to surficial duckweed planktonic algae blooms observed in early to mid summer and predation the final sampling points in the late summer and fall of 2016 revealed an average relative abundance greater than for discovery bay despite minor disturbance events treatment capabilities remained similar bear et al 2017 indicating that the microbial community within these wetlands is ecologically and functionally robust this highlights the potential to manage these natural treatment systems to handle intermittent flow events that might result from seasonal hydrological disruptions while suggesting a potential application toward other types of impaired waters such as storm water or agricultural runoff which would be more variable than comparably consistent flows received from wastewater effluent or wastewater effluent impaired rivers such as the santa ana in addition to hrt it appears seasonality played a modest role in the shifts observed during the first year of operation alpha diversity measurements revealed an increase in shannon diversity and observed richness by 15 and 18 respectively after 4 months of operation which coincided with the onset of warmer spring temperatures in april fig si 3 however a gap in the summer months of 2015 combined with the wetland community evolution over the first year make it difficult to draw firm conclusions based on season other wetland microbial studies have found little seasonal effect on microbial community compositions despite large differences in metabolic rates clément et al 2002 juottonen et al 2008 supporting our finding of relative community stability after the biomat s first growing season correspondence analysis fig 3 revealed that after the 9 month stabilization period the samples from the prado demonstration scale system began to converge with the more mature pilot scale system though differences were present established prado biomat samples from 2014 to 2016 largely clustered with one another as well as those derived from the mature discovery bay pilot scale system to explore this similarity further a core microbiome was established across these two systems that revealed a shared phylogenetic fingerprint fig 5 major guilds identified included aerobic and anaerobic community members such as putative fermenters methanogens and algal symbionts as previously documented jones et al 2017 the two shallow open water wetland systems established highly similar communities sharing approximately 50 of their sequences suggesting a strong analogue to the precedent established for more actively engineered and managed systems that are ubiquitous in wastewater treatment for perspective core microbiomes established for mixed liquor of wastewater treatment aeration basins running in parallel were found to share 50 60 of the sequences analyzed ibarbalz et al 2014 while core microbiomes from aeration basins from six full scale municipal treatment plants demonstrated a similarity in the same range griffin and wells 2017 while designed for primary wastewater treatment with higher organic loading aerobic stabilization ponds maintain some similarities in design and comparison to communities residing in these ponds using terminal restriction length polymorphism revealed similar phyla including gammaproteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and verrumicrobia belila et al 2012 however the main photosynthetic microorganisms were planktonic algae and purple sulfur bacteria revealing a more stark contrast with the diatoms that overwhelmingly dominate the shallow open water wetlands within our natural water treatment wetland constructs the chloroplasts housed within resident diatoms contributed to a large proportion of the similarity across wetlands fig 5 they were present within the first month of operation at prado and accounted for the greatest abundance of sequences in both wetland systems 18s sequencing analysis and associated databases of the v4 region are becoming more robust for tracking eukaryotic algal and fungal aquatic communities comeau et al 2016 panzer et al 2015 as these methods and sequencing technology continue to progress a combined analysis of bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic communities could further our understanding of ecological trends within this assemblage parada et al 2016 in studies of benthic lake diatoms ph trophic status and water depth have been identified as the three largest driving factors in diatom community composition soininen 2007 these factors are systemically embedded in the shallow open water unit process wetland design and appear to strongly select for the diatom species staurosira construens var venter jasper et al 2014a this species has been previously identified in florida lakes fragilariia construens var venter as living in mesophilic to eutrophic and alkaliphilic conditions whitmore 1989 consistent with the properties of the shallow open water system table 1 the inlet ph at the discovery bay wetland was higher than at prado however both are alkaline and oscillate diurnally within the cell ca ph 7 5 9 5 as a result of photosynthetic oxygen production while the influent nitrate is about three times higher at discovery bay than at prado both wetlands would be classified as eutrophic environments richardson and jørgensen 1996 water column depth 20 cm vs 25 cm is also similar in both systems and diatoms tend to grow benthically in lakes until the water depth reaches 60 cm after which they favor planktonic growth round et al 1990 the separation of the biomat from the bottom soil by using some form of liner also seems important for biomat establishment anecdotally this can be observed in areas of the prado wetland that lack a geotextile liner and no diatomaceous biomat formation is seen yet the water depth and nutrient concentrations are similar to those of the shallow open water cells however the type of liner material seems less important than its presence as the discovery bay pilot system was half lined with a geotextile liner and half cement and both regions maintained similar biomat communities diatoms have co evolved with bacteria for over 200 million years resulting in close symbiotic relationships bacterial families such as luteolibacter rhodobacteraceae sinobacteriaceae and uncultivated c111 are all represented in the core microbiome and all are known to have members that are algal symbionts gutierrez et al 2013 li et al 2015 ohshiro et al 2012 park et al 2013 pujalte et al 2014 it is likely these aerobic organisms are directly benefiting from the diatom community through their production of extracellular polymeric substance and other metabolite production amin et al 2012 primary production in diatoms may also indirectly support the anaerobic community by creating a carbon rich environment through extracellular polymeric substance production hoagland et al 1993 this labile organic input could in turn contribute to the robust denitrification rates observed in these shallow open water wetlands jasper et al 2014b 5 conclusions the shallow open water wetland system design selects for a highly analogous microbial community despite differences in geographic location size and influent waters when deployed in the mediterranean climate of california the photosynthetic biomat that forms within this construct develops a highly similar communities consisting of bacteria and the same species of diatom this community is presumably selected by the design constraints of water depth 20 25 cm establishment of a barrier between the ground and water column on which the benthic biomat can colonize and nitrogen rich waters after initial colonization and establishment which coincides with the warmer and higher sunlight intensity summer months and approximately 9 months of operation community shifts are more modest and start to converge with the community found within a geographically distinct open water cell wetland biomat additionally variation in hrt can cause modest community shifts along the flow path with longer hrts causing greater divergence these demonstration scale insights reveal that contaminant attenuation and ecological parameters should both be considered in future system design and operation

19725,the widespread adoption of engineered wetlands designed for water treatment is hindered by uncertainties in system reliability resilience and management associated with coupled biological and physical processes to better understand how shallow unit process open water wetlands self colonize and evolve we analyzed the composition of the microbial community in benthic biomats from system establishment through approximately 3 years of operation our analysis was conducted across three parallel demonstration scale 7500 m2 cells located within the prado constructed wetlands in southern california they received water from the santa ana river 5 9 0 2 mg l no3 n a water body where the flow is dominated by municipal wastewater effluent from may to november phylogenetic inquiry and microscopy confirmed that diatoms and an associated aerobic bacterial community facilitated early colonization after approximately nine months of operation coinciding with late summer an anaerobic community emerged with the capability for nitrate attenuation varying the hydraulic residence time hrt from 1 to 4 days the subsequent year resulted in modest ecological changes across the three parallel cells that were most evident in the outlet regions of the cells the community that established at this time was comparatively stable for the remaining years of operation and converged with one that had previously formed approximately 550 km 350 miles away in a pilot scale 400 m2 wetland in northern california that system received denitrified 20 7 0 7 mg l no3 n secondary treated municipal wastewater for 5 years of operation establishment of a core microbiome between the two systems revealed a strong overlap of both aerobic and anaerobic taxa with approximately 50 of the analyzed bacterial sequences shared between the two sites additionally the same species of diatom stauirsa construens var venter was prolific in both systems as the putative dominant primary producer our results indicate that despite differences in scale geographic location and source waters the shallow open water wetland design can select for a rapid convergence of microbial structure and functionality associated with the self colonizing benthic biomat this resulting biomat matures over the first growing season with operational parameters such as hrt further exerting a modest selective bias on community succession graphical abstract image 1 keywords constructed wetlands microbial ecology water treatment 1 introduction constructed wetlands designed for water treatment have evolved from traditional vegetated surface flow wetlands to further capitalize upon the natural interplay between macrophytic and microbial processes inherent in a variety of managed natural systems faulwetter et al 2009 jasper et al 2013 kadlec and wallace 2009 reddy and d angelo 1994 designs now incorporate variables including aquatic plants introduced geomedia depth hydraulic properties and subsurface flow in order to address regional climate challenges optimal contaminant removal and other practitioner goals for example the selection of different plant types has been shown to result in varying denitrification potential bastviken et al 2003 while geomedia amendments such as zeolite have proven to increase the abundance of ammonium oxidizing microorganisms gorra et al 2007 research on wetland biogeochemistry has largely focused on carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycling reddy and delaune 2008 and is still evolving as our understanding of microbial nutrient cycling pathways increases hu et al 2014 jones et al 2017 zhu et al 2010 more applied research in engineered systems has investigated the microbially mediated removal of trace organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals that are minimally attenuated within municipal wastewater treatment plants jasper et al 2014a li et al 2014 onesios et al 2009 verlicchi and zambello 2014 while the removal of these trace organic contaminants is in part attributed to microorganisms investigations into how environmental conditions hijosa valsero et al 2010 jasper et al 2014a removal pathways and microbial diversity impact treatment efficiency are ongoing a myriad of factors have been shown to affect microbial community composition in freshwater wetlands including influent properties arroyo et al 2015 whether the wetland was naturally established or constructed ansola et al 2014 sediment properties peralta et al 2013 previous land use hartman et al 2008 peralta et al 2010 geographical location and vegetation type angeloni et al 2006 menon et al 2013 yarwood et al 2016 this can lead to challenges in design guidelines and inconsistencies in treatment performance and permitting hence the ability to design wetlands and predict the resultant microbial community and functionality would be beneficial to the increased adoption of constructed wetlands and other natural treatment systems fortunately combined molecular biological and bioinformatic approaches enable a new level of comparison within and across systems where the effects of operational variables and design parameters on the microbial community can be further explored in building upon this theme we have focused research on a novel macrophyte free design employing a shallow unit process open water wetland system with a geotextile liner that is naturally colonized with a photosynthetic periphyton like biomat jasper et al 2014a while visually similar to waste stabilization ponds this shallow design was intended for photolytic degradation of organic pollutants jasper and sedlak 2013 and pathogen inactivation nguyen et al 2015 silverman et al 2015 however during pilot scale operation it became apparent that the microbial assemblage within the self colonizing biomat facilitated organic pollutant and nitrate attenuation rates that rivaled and in many cases exceeded that of more traditional engineered vegetated wetlands jasper et al 2014b 2014a this study focuses on the establishment and colonization of a series of parallel demonstration scale shallow unit process open water wetlands over almost three years and their comparison to a smaller 5 of the area pilot scale system that remained operational for approximately five years the demonstration scale wetland cells are located in corona ca and receive effluent dominated santa ana river water while the pilot scale system was located approximately 350 miles to the north in discovery bay ca and received secondary treated nitrified wastewater bear et al 2017 jasper and sedlak 2013 while there were pronounced differences in geographic location scale and receiving water properties the constructs maintained an analogous design and were operated in a temperate mediterranean climate both systems employed a barrier at the ground surface to prevent macrophyte growth and a shallow water level of 20 25 cm was maintained in order to maximize sunlight penetration of the water column the objectives of our present study were twofold 1 to understand ecological processes involved in the establishment and succession of the biomat community within this constructed natural treatment system and 2 to determine if differences in scale receiving waters and geographic location would impact the structure and functionality of the benthic biomat the work was guided by an overarching hypothesis that despite differences in scale and geographic location similarly designed and managed unit process open water wetland cells would establish analogous naturally colonized benthic biomats with similar ecological signatures and associated water treatment functionalities 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the pilot scale system was built and operated as a 20 m 20 m serpentine configuration from 2009 to 2014 in discovery bay ca as depicted in fig si 1 this unit process wetland was constructed as a baffled cell and received nitrified wastewater effluent 20 7 0 7 mg l no3 n from a proximal wastewater treatment facility the larger demonstration scale system began operation in december of 2013 and is a subset of the longer operating prado constructed wetlands that are managed by the orange county water district these unit process cells are still in operation with microbial analyses concluding in october of 2016 this larger scale managed natural treatment system is situated within the constructed wetlands near the prado dam in southern california and consists of three 30 m 260 m cells running in parallel fig si 1 the wetlands receive water from the santa ana river 5 9 0 2 mg l no3 n which is dominated by municipal wastewater effluent from may to november further comparison of select inlet water and system design parameters can be found in table 1 discovery bay was half lined with cement and half with geotextile material and had a hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 3 days the prado system is fully lined with a permeable geotextile material and was established with an initial hrt of approximately 2 days after the first year of operation december 2013 december 2014 these prado wetland cells were adjusted to have different hrts of 1 2 and 4 days the prado construct experienced a disturbance when a deeper upstream equalization pond which allows for influent flow control was reconstructed in january of 2015 during which time flow ceased and residual water remained in the cells for approximately 2 weeks additionally there was a pronounced duckweed colonization event in september 2015 in which duckweed covered 90 of the water surface area for much of that month 2 2 biomat collection with a goal of investigating temporal trends biomat samples from the three parallel prado shallow open water cells were collected approximately monthly after establishment from december 2013 through 2015 four additional sampling events were conducted between august and october 2016 biomat was collected from the inlet middle and outlet regions of each of the 3 parallel cells shown in si fig 1 in 50 ml conical tubes for a total of nine samples per month biomat material from the discovery bay wetland cell was sampled on may 5th 2014 that corresponded to approximately 5 years after the start of operation samples were collected in triplicate in 4 equally spaced locations along the horizontal transect of the wetland and further discretized as a function of three different depths within the laminar biomat jones et al 2017 biomat samples from both wetland locations were immediately chilled and then transported by overnight courier to the laboratory where they were centrifuged decanted and archived at 20 c samples then remained frozen until thawed for further processing and analysis 2 3 freeze dried archives and scanning electron microscopy archived samples were thawed in batches and then freeze dried in a labconco freezone6 in order to normalize extraction by dry weight as well as to archive samples for future microscopic or other analyses jones et al 2017 freeze dried samples from both wetlands were placed on carbon tape and gold sputtered with a hummer iv sputtering system images were taken with a jeol jsm 700f field emission scanning electron microscope fesem pictures were adjusted for contrast 2 4 dna extraction and 16s rrna gene sequencing dna extractions were performed using the powersoil biofilm dna extraction kit on 0 0025 g of freeze dried biomat amplification purification and normalization of samples for 16s rrna gene sequencing was performed in accordance with published methods using dual indexed primers 515f and 806r caporaso et al 2011 for the v4 region fig si 2 with minor modifications to the protocol which exclude the bioanalyzer steps and include an additional concentration step kozich et al 2013 briefly 2 μl of extracted dna was amplified with dual indexed primers for 30 cycles phusion master mix new england biolabs amplicons were normalized and purified with the sequalprep normalization plate kit normalized amplicons were pooled and concentrated with amicon ultra 0 5 ml 30k centrifugal filter devices pooled concentrates were quantified and sequenced by the biofrontiers institute at cu boulder using the illumina miseq platform with a v2 2 250 cycle reagent kit 2 5 bioinformatic analyses processing of demultiplexed raw sequences was performed with qimme 1 9 as previously described jones et al 2017 after processing and quality filtering the illumina 16s rrna gene reads a total of 7 287 041 paired end sequences were obtained from 280 samples subsequently 8 samples with fewer than 8000 sequences were dropped from analysis sampling depth then ranged from 8681 to 837 508 sequences per sample unfortunately 34 samples 5 15 2015 8 21 2015 prado were identified as compromised due to a thawing event during shipping and prior to dna extraction after confirmation of significant community abnormalities from sequencing these samples were removed from further analysis the remaining analysis was performed on 197 samples from prado and 36 samples from discovery bay analyses were based off of a rarefied operation taxonomic unit otu table with 8681 randomly selected sequences per sample except for differential abundance tests for which a negative binomial model was used to normalize counts for each sample mcmurdie and holmes 2014 to evaluate and visualize compositional changes across time at prado and compare community structure to discovery bay we utilized a weighted and unweighted unifrac distance matrix lozupone and knight 2005 followed by principal coordinate analysis and detrended coordinate analysis when temporal data displayed a horse shoe effect statistical differences in weighted unifrac distances were determined using the anosim test and considered significant when p values were less than 0 05 alpha diversity was calculated using both shannon diversity and observed otu measures to account for both evenness and richness across samples differential abundance analyses were used to identify cladal shifts between the inlet and outlet samples at prado using deseq2 love et al 2014 after converting the unrarefied otu table to a deseq object otus were clustered at the family taxonomic level families with total counts across all samples less than 500 were removed to focus on the more abundant families p values were generated using the wald test adjusted for multiple comparisons using the procedure of benjamini and hochberg 1995 and considered significant if less than 0 01 to assess cladal similarities between the mature prado samples those taken from august october 2016 and the discovery bay samples we created core microbiomes defined as the otus that were present in at least 90 and 100 of all samples at both locations demutiplexed sequences are available in the national center for biotechnology information short read archive ncbi sra under project number prjna390172 3 results 3 1 colonization and temporal trends of the prado biomat analysis of community composition at the prado wetland over the study period of approximately three years dec 2013 oct 2016 revealed distinct taxa that underwent significant changes in relative abundance until maturation within a month of system startup a green biofilm began to establish on the geotextile liner phylogenetic sequencing revealed that the 16s rrna plastid gene harbored within the chloroplast of diatoms stramenopiles was present at this early stage and remained throughout the study period fig 1 while diatom chloroplast 16s sequences initially accounted for 18 of sequences relative sequence abundance fluctuated throughout operation with a range of 0 3 37 6 the lowest abundance was observed shortly after the cessation of flow in january 2015 to enable forebay reconstruction while the highest abundance was observed during the last sampling events in october 2016 it should be noted that this interpretation is grounded on amplification of 16s plastid sequences harbored within chloroplasts hence quantification is biased when contrasting bacterial and eukaryotic community members and should rather be interpreted as comparative temporal trends of diatom chloroplast presence to better understand system evolution and establishment the top 20 most abundant bacterial and archaeal families found within the prado biomat were tracked with time for the inlet biomat samples derived across the three cells fig 2 the three parallel cells in this inlet region were highly similar to one another as analyzed in the next section trends revealed a relative stability for many families within the system including rhodobacteraceae verrucomicrobiaceae and flavobacteriaceae families containing the strict anaerobes anaerolinaceae methanobacteriaceae and methanosarcinales had initial relative abundances of less than 0 1 but all increased to 3 5 after 9 months this trend is likely due to an increased accumulation of the biomat which had an approximate depth of 2 3 cm in the inlet region and tapering off to 1 cm near the outlet after this establishment phase the top 20 most abundant families show little variation for the remaining two years of sample collection and analysis further insight into the establishment and stability of the microbial community within the biomat was gained by observing diversity and richness over time fig si 3 shannon diversity and species richness analyses revealed a sharp increase after 4 months of operation which also coincided with the spring season and associated increases in light intensity and temperature interestingly there was a sharp decrease in shannon diversity from year 2 to year 3 while species richness remained stable during this time 3 2 prado community spatial association and effects of hydraulic residence time a high degree of similarity was present within the microbial biomats when comparing communities between the three mature prado wetland cells in the summer of 2016 in order to differentiate temporal versus spatial effects on community shifts a detrended correspondence analysis fig 3 and principle coordinate analysis fig si 5 were performed using a weighted unifrac distance matrix due to the severe horseshoe effect in the principle coordinate analysis typically caused by temporal data podani and miklós 2002 the detrended correspondence analysis was chosen as the better representation of the unifrac distance matrix in comparing the wetland cells as a whole our analysis revealed no significant difference in community between the cells fig 3 p 949 r 0 008 anosim the analysis further confirmed that time defined by month is an important driver of community clustering p 001 r 0 720 anosim while the three parallel wetland cells at prado maintained similarity there was local community variation within the longitudinal transect of the cells that was associated with changes in hydraulic residence during the first year of operation at prado when the cells all maintained the same hrt community composition did not vary as a function of location between the three parallel cells anosim inlet p 914 middle p 978 outlet p 667 however when analyzing the mature biomat samples during the late summer of 2016 approximately two years after the hrt across the cells was manipulated to establish parallel systems with residences of 1 4 days a difference in community profile was found as a function of longitudinal position i e inlet middle and outlet between the three cells fig si 4 p 001 r 0 155 anosim more specifically when single locations were discretely contrasted between these three cells neither the inlet nor middle samples varied fig si 4 inlet p 569 r 0 034 middle p 221 r 0 101 anosim however the outlet communities significantly differed across cells as a function of hrt fig si 4 p 002 r 0 405 anosim by contrasting differential abundance across the cells fig 4 taxa exhibited a higher variance between inlet and outlet locations as the hrt became longer i e the cell with a 1 day hrt was most similar throughout the families rhodocyclacea crenotrichacea and candidate family chthoniabacteraceae were found to be more abundant in the outlets than in the inlet for all 3 different hrts while oscillochloridacea chlamydomonadacea rhodospirillaceae and desulfobacteriacea were found to be more abundant in the inlet regions with the cells having 2 and 4 day retention times fig 4 3 3 comparison of biomat between pilot and demonstration scale systems in order to better understand how system design influences microbial colonization and by extension the reproducibility of establishing analogous managed natural treatment wetland constructs biomat samples derived from the pilot scale open water cell in discovery bay that were collected in may of 2014 were compared to the time series samples collected from the prado wetland described in prior sections this comparison was conducted with a detrended correspondence analysis fig 3 and principle coordinate analysis fig si 5 using a weighted unifrac distance matrix consistent with the rapid establishment of the prado community and its comparative stability within the first year of operation this biomat was highly similar to that of discovery bay the pilot system operated for 5 years prior to sampling is approximately 5 of the size of an individual prado cell and is located 550 km to the north of the demonstration scale prado shallow unit process open water wetland construct the discovery bay engineered system has previously been studied with respect to seasonal nitrate removal rates and mechanisms jasper et al 2014b jones et al 2017 as well as trace organic attenuation jasper et al 2014a functionally nitrate removal rates between the two systems were highly similar table 1 highlighting that construction of these two systems resulted in analogous functional nitrate removal bear et al 2017 despite differences in latitudinal separation scales of operation and receiving waters phylogenetic analyses revealed that the last 4 biomat sample collections from prado during the late summer and fall of 2016 significantly clustered with the discovery bay samples harvested from the mature biomat in the late spring of 2014 when contrasted with the earlier biomat samples derived from prado p 001 r 0 186 anosim taking this into consideration a core microbiome analysis was performed between biomats derived from the two different wetland systems fig 5 at 100 ubiquity 36 different otus accounting for 38 2 of the total sequences were shared between prado and discovery bay while at 90 ubiquity 102 otus were identified accounting for 47 8 of the total sequences the most abundant taxonomies in core microbiomes across the sites belonged to diatom chloroplast while sinobacteraceae luteolibacter and various anerolinaceae were also prominent members overall this core community is more enriched in the mature prado wetlands as it comprises 42 of the total relative abundance compared to 35 at discovery bay however the different core community members appear to have relative abundances in analogous ratios generating a microbial fingerprint that is representative of this type of biomat the diatoms were also highly similar with respect to both identity and abundance between the two systems the relative abundance of diatomaceous chloroplast sequences in discovery bay in the spring of 2014 was 18 0 4 8 while there was considerable temporal variation across the broader prado sampling time period fig 1 overall abundance was similar at 15 1 8 4 visual analysis of the biomat samples using fesem confirmed the ubiquity of diatoms at both wetlands importantly these diatoms appeared to be the same species as based on morphological interpretation relating to frustule and valve structure fig 6 the diatoms in the discover bay biomat were previously identified as stauirsa construens var venter jasper et al 2014a 4 discussion prior research in the discovery bay pilot system revealed a unit process shallow open water natural treatment wetland design that holds promise for increased attenuation of trace organics pathogens and nitrate when contrasted with more traditional vegetated engineered wetland systems jasper et al 2014b 2014a nguyen et al 2015 however in moving toward broader adoption it is critical to understand the timeframe and processes associated with establishment and whether this design can be replicated to enable similar microbial ecologic selection and by extension targeted functionality at a variety of scales locations and receiving waters complementary work into functional treatment attributes has revealed that the pilot and demonstration scale systems exhibit analogous nitrate removal rates despite different influent concentrations both systems were able to achieve 90 nitrate removal 70 removal of select beta blockers and 2 3 log removal of pathogen indicators organisms during the summer months additionally models based on the pilot scale system for trace organic pollutants and pathogen indicators were able to accurately predict performance of the demonstration scale system over the course of the year bear et al 2017 by monitoring the prado shallow open water wetland systems from their initial establishment through almost 3 years of operation our ecologically focused study has the unique capability to explore and understand natural ecological colonization and succession as well as investigate if a similarly designed larger scale and geographically distinct system that receives different source waters can select for and host a similar microbial community as the resultant photosynthetic biomats were colonized without any active promotion or inoculation the work also contributes to our broader understanding of the cosmopolitan nature of microorganisms hedlund and staley 2004 and their relevance to the adoption design and establishment of natural treatment systems during the initial colonization of the prado system the most abundant families of bacteria were dominated by aerobic or facultative guilds such as comamonadaceae willems et al 1991 cyclobacteriaceae flavobacteriaceae bernardet et al 2002 chitinophagaceae kampfer et al 2011 and acetobacteraceae kersters et al 2006 fig 2 after approximately 9 months members belonging to strictly anaerobic guilds including fermentative microorganisms such as anerolinaceae yamada 2006 and caldilineaceae sekiguchi 2003 as well as the methanogens methanosarcinaceae and methanobacteriaceae krieg et al 2010 increased in presence this can be explained by vertical stratification associated with biomat growth where a sufficient depth needs to be reached to develop this anaerobic layer within the biomat in support of this vertical stratification theory analysis of community shifts as a function of depth within the biomat located at the discovery bay wetland revealed a pronounced difference between the photosynthesizing surficial community and that below notably this stratification resulted in a subsurface reducing community that was capable of supporting denitrification anammox sulfate reduction and methanogenesis jones et al 2017 this spatial shift in community structure is also consistent with a temporal shift characterized by less nitrate removal during the early months of biomat establishment bear et al 2017 after this initial colonization period a predictive model based on seasonality and removal rates for the pilot scale shallow open water system closely matched actual nitrate removal rates in the demonstration scale prado cells these results collectively support the concept that this vertically stratified assemblage with suboxic zones amenable to denitrification and anammox needs a sufficient temporal period of operation and growth to establish microbial colonization across the three prado demonstration scale cells was highly similar during the first year of operation when the flow rate and other operating conditions were maintained fig 3 in the second year hydraulic residence was manipulated to operate at approximately 1 2 and 4 days across the three different parallel systems biomat community profiles in the outlet portion of the wetland cells revealed a modest divergence as a function of hrt when contrasting the three parallel cells fig 4 and fig si 4 whereas the community in the earlier reaches of the three cells transits remained highly similar a possible explanation is that differing nutrient gradients or some analogous selection by resource limitation is driving this shift during the summer months 90 of the nitrate is removed in the cell with a 4 day hrt versus only 65 removal in the cell with a 1 day hrt bear et al 2017 hence we suggest that potential effects of microbial selection and kinetics of removal should be considered when optimizing operational parameters such as hydraulic residence and system geometry for nitrate removal goals and system resilience another perturbation to hrt occurred during the reconstruction of the equalization forebay in january of 2015 where water remained in the three cells for approximately 2 weeks prior to reestablishing flow just before the hrts were varied there was only a slight microbial community shift in the system as a whole figs 2 and 3 however diatom presence did plummet during that window fig 1 diatom 16s chloroplast relative abundance also dropped in the first summer of establishment which could be caused by several variables including limited sunlight penetration due to surficial duckweed planktonic algae blooms observed in early to mid summer and predation the final sampling points in the late summer and fall of 2016 revealed an average relative abundance greater than for discovery bay despite minor disturbance events treatment capabilities remained similar bear et al 2017 indicating that the microbial community within these wetlands is ecologically and functionally robust this highlights the potential to manage these natural treatment systems to handle intermittent flow events that might result from seasonal hydrological disruptions while suggesting a potential application toward other types of impaired waters such as storm water or agricultural runoff which would be more variable than comparably consistent flows received from wastewater effluent or wastewater effluent impaired rivers such as the santa ana in addition to hrt it appears seasonality played a modest role in the shifts observed during the first year of operation alpha diversity measurements revealed an increase in shannon diversity and observed richness by 15 and 18 respectively after 4 months of operation which coincided with the onset of warmer spring temperatures in april fig si 3 however a gap in the summer months of 2015 combined with the wetland community evolution over the first year make it difficult to draw firm conclusions based on season other wetland microbial studies have found little seasonal effect on microbial community compositions despite large differences in metabolic rates clément et al 2002 juottonen et al 2008 supporting our finding of relative community stability after the biomat s first growing season correspondence analysis fig 3 revealed that after the 9 month stabilization period the samples from the prado demonstration scale system began to converge with the more mature pilot scale system though differences were present established prado biomat samples from 2014 to 2016 largely clustered with one another as well as those derived from the mature discovery bay pilot scale system to explore this similarity further a core microbiome was established across these two systems that revealed a shared phylogenetic fingerprint fig 5 major guilds identified included aerobic and anaerobic community members such as putative fermenters methanogens and algal symbionts as previously documented jones et al 2017 the two shallow open water wetland systems established highly similar communities sharing approximately 50 of their sequences suggesting a strong analogue to the precedent established for more actively engineered and managed systems that are ubiquitous in wastewater treatment for perspective core microbiomes established for mixed liquor of wastewater treatment aeration basins running in parallel were found to share 50 60 of the sequences analyzed ibarbalz et al 2014 while core microbiomes from aeration basins from six full scale municipal treatment plants demonstrated a similarity in the same range griffin and wells 2017 while designed for primary wastewater treatment with higher organic loading aerobic stabilization ponds maintain some similarities in design and comparison to communities residing in these ponds using terminal restriction length polymorphism revealed similar phyla including gammaproteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and verrumicrobia belila et al 2012 however the main photosynthetic microorganisms were planktonic algae and purple sulfur bacteria revealing a more stark contrast with the diatoms that overwhelmingly dominate the shallow open water wetlands within our natural water treatment wetland constructs the chloroplasts housed within resident diatoms contributed to a large proportion of the similarity across wetlands fig 5 they were present within the first month of operation at prado and accounted for the greatest abundance of sequences in both wetland systems 18s sequencing analysis and associated databases of the v4 region are becoming more robust for tracking eukaryotic algal and fungal aquatic communities comeau et al 2016 panzer et al 2015 as these methods and sequencing technology continue to progress a combined analysis of bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic communities could further our understanding of ecological trends within this assemblage parada et al 2016 in studies of benthic lake diatoms ph trophic status and water depth have been identified as the three largest driving factors in diatom community composition soininen 2007 these factors are systemically embedded in the shallow open water unit process wetland design and appear to strongly select for the diatom species staurosira construens var venter jasper et al 2014a this species has been previously identified in florida lakes fragilariia construens var venter as living in mesophilic to eutrophic and alkaliphilic conditions whitmore 1989 consistent with the properties of the shallow open water system table 1 the inlet ph at the discovery bay wetland was higher than at prado however both are alkaline and oscillate diurnally within the cell ca ph 7 5 9 5 as a result of photosynthetic oxygen production while the influent nitrate is about three times higher at discovery bay than at prado both wetlands would be classified as eutrophic environments richardson and jørgensen 1996 water column depth 20 cm vs 25 cm is also similar in both systems and diatoms tend to grow benthically in lakes until the water depth reaches 60 cm after which they favor planktonic growth round et al 1990 the separation of the biomat from the bottom soil by using some form of liner also seems important for biomat establishment anecdotally this can be observed in areas of the prado wetland that lack a geotextile liner and no diatomaceous biomat formation is seen yet the water depth and nutrient concentrations are similar to those of the shallow open water cells however the type of liner material seems less important than its presence as the discovery bay pilot system was half lined with a geotextile liner and half cement and both regions maintained similar biomat communities diatoms have co evolved with bacteria for over 200 million years resulting in close symbiotic relationships bacterial families such as luteolibacter rhodobacteraceae sinobacteriaceae and uncultivated c111 are all represented in the core microbiome and all are known to have members that are algal symbionts gutierrez et al 2013 li et al 2015 ohshiro et al 2012 park et al 2013 pujalte et al 2014 it is likely these aerobic organisms are directly benefiting from the diatom community through their production of extracellular polymeric substance and other metabolite production amin et al 2012 primary production in diatoms may also indirectly support the anaerobic community by creating a carbon rich environment through extracellular polymeric substance production hoagland et al 1993 this labile organic input could in turn contribute to the robust denitrification rates observed in these shallow open water wetlands jasper et al 2014b 5 conclusions the shallow open water wetland system design selects for a highly analogous microbial community despite differences in geographic location size and influent waters when deployed in the mediterranean climate of california the photosynthetic biomat that forms within this construct develops a highly similar communities consisting of bacteria and the same species of diatom this community is presumably selected by the design constraints of water depth 20 25 cm establishment of a barrier between the ground and water column on which the benthic biomat can colonize and nitrogen rich waters after initial colonization and establishment which coincides with the warmer and higher sunlight intensity summer months and approximately 9 months of operation community shifts are more modest and start to converge with the community found within a geographically distinct open water cell wetland biomat additionally variation in hrt can cause modest community shifts along the flow path with longer hrts causing greater divergence these demonstration scale insights reveal that contaminant attenuation and ecological parameters should both be considered in future system design and operation

19726,a broad number of natural and synthetic progestins are widely used in human and veterinary therapies although progestins exhibit adverse effects in aquatic organisms information about environmental occurrence and fate have been limited to several compounds hampering the accuracy of risk assessments of the compounds in this study a selective and sensitive analytical method was established to simultaneously determine 19 natural and 42 synthetic progestins in environmental waters and the synthetic progestins included 19 nortestosterone 17α hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone derivatives all of the target compounds were effectively separated using an hss t3 column and the recoveries for effluent and river samples were 80 115 and 75 105 respectively the detection limits for the 61 analytes were in the range of 0 05 0 60 ng l and 0 03 0 40 ng l for the effluent and river samples respectively the developed method is applied to analyze the target progestogens in sewage effluent and river water samples from beijing the detected concentrations of natural progesterone metabolites 3α hydroxy 5β tetrahydroprogesterone were up to 63 times higher than those of the parent compound of the three groups of synthetic progestins the progesterone derivatives were detected for the first time and had the highest concentrations followed by the 19 nortestosterone and 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives in contrast to previous studies the predominant derivative compounds of 19 nortestosterone were found to be 19 nortestosterone gestodene and mifepristone and those of

affect the fertility and reproduction of fish in addition to reduced fecundity ng ges and net have been found to lead to masculinization phenomena and induced male secondary sex characteristics in female fish and amphibians zeilinger et al 2009 paulos et al 2010 runnalls et al 2013 hoffmann and kloas 2012 safholm et al 2012 therefore the presence of progestins in the environment poses an ecological risk to aquatic organisms and deserves greater attention in contrast to estrogen a broad number of natural and synthetic progestins have been reported in organisms or used in human and veterinary therapies natural progestins which are secreted naturally by humans and vertebrates include p and more than 30 metabolites these metabolites could still show biological activity for example 20β dihydroprogesterone 20β dhp induced 25 50 of progestogen activity bińkowska and woroń 2015 compared to p hydroxylated metabolites e g 17α 20β dihydroxyprogesterone and 17α 20β dohp are more important in fish and are well known inducers of final oocyte maturation in female fish additionally at concentrations as low as 0 3 ng l 17α 20β dohp these hydroxylated metabolites can act as hormonal odorants and reproductive pheromones affecting the reproductive physiology and behavior in many fish species sorensen et al 1995 synthetic progestins include 19 nortestosterone derivatives from testosterone 17α hydroxyprogesterone 17α ohp derivatives and p derivatives more than 40 synthetic progestins are found in various oral contraceptive brands and a number of medical applications with a content that is generally up to 100 fold higher than that of estrogen zeilinger et al 2009 some synthetic progestins including ng net and ges reduced egg production in fathead minnows at environmentally relevant concentrations 0 8 1 0 ng l zeilinger et al 2009 paulos et al 2010 runnalls et al 2013 despite the great variety of therapeutic applications and the induced adverse effects of progestins environmental investigations have only focused on a limited number of these compounds sewage and river water measurements have so far been made mostly for natural p and synthetic net ng medroxyprogesterone mp and medroxyprogesterone acetate mpa and few information is available for cpa kumar et al 2015 fent 2015 no information about environmental occurrence is available for ges which has reported endocrine and reproduction toxicities runnalls et al 2013 furthermore the co exposure of progestins could have additive adverse effects in fish zucchi et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 it is therefore essential to analyze a broad number of natural and synthetic progestins to obtain a more complete picture of the environmental contamination and to further assess the environmental risks some analytical methods have used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms methods combined with off line chang et al 2009 2011 2008 liu et al 2011 vulliet et al 2008 al odaini et al 2010 or on line esperanza et al 2004 guedes alonso et al 2014 fayad et al 2013 solid phase extraction spe in these studies the target compounds only included four natural and nine synthetic progestins which were investigated in river water ground water wastewater treatment effluents and river sediment in china japan france spain canada and malaysia chang et al 2008 liu et al 2011 vulliet et al 2008 al odaini et al 2010 esperanza et al 2004 guedes alonso et al 2014 fayad et al 2013 the number of target progestins detected with the available analytical methods was much smaller than the 60 natural and synthetic progestins which may occur in the environment in this study we aimed to develop a sensitive and reliable ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms method combined with spe for the simultaneous analysis of 19 natural fig 1 and 42 synthetic progestins in river and effluent samples the 42 synthetic progestins included 16 p derivatives 12 19 nortestosterone derivatives and 14 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives and all these compounds were structurally related as shown in figs 2 4 it should be noted that of the 61 target progestins 43 are isomer compounds belonging to eleven groups therefore effective chromatographic separation is very important for the unequivocal identification of this broad number of isomers the developed method was applied to the river water and effluent samples collected in beijing the predominant progestins were identified and the occurrences of these compounds were investigated in the aquatic environment the results revealed the characterization of a broad number of progestins in environmental waters 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and reagents sixty one progestins full names and abbreviations shown in table

its tributaries in beijing china fig 5 river wenyu and its tributaries cover the most populated area of beijing china and the land cover is principally urban land two 24 h composite stp effluent samples were collected the two stps are located on the river qing and tonghui respectively and their effluents are directly discharged into the tributaries and finally enter the river wenyu all water samples were collected in precleaned 2 l amber glass bottles formaldehyde final concentration 1 v v was immediately added to the water samples which were sealed without headspace chilled and transported to the laboratory all samples were filtered and extracted within 6 h of sample collection to avoid blocking the spe cartridges suspended materials were removed from the samples by filtration through a glass fiber pad gf f 0 7 μm before cartridge extraction after filtration 1 l of river water or effluent samples was spiked with six isotope labeled standards at concentrations of 100 ng l the oasis hlb cartridge was pre conditioned with 6 ml of etoac 6 ml of acn and 12 ml of hplc grade water after passing the water samples through the cartridges at a flow rate of 10 15 ml min they were washed with 10 ml of hplc grade water and then dried under a flow of nitrogen the retained compounds were eluted from the cartridge with 6 ml of etoac acn 50 50 v v the eluent was collected and dried under a gentle nitrogen stream and reconstituted by using 200 μl methanol for uplc ms ms analysis 2 3 uplc ms ms analysis the lc apparatus was an acquity ultra performance lc system waters milford ma usa separation was conducted using a acquity uplc hss t3 100 mm 2 1 mm 1 7 μm particle size the column was maintained at 40 c and the flow rate and injection volume were 0 3 ml min and 2 μl respectively methanol a and 0 1 formic acid in ultrapure water b were used as the mobile phases the initial gradient of 60 a was increased to 70 in 8 min 85 in 5 min 100 in 1 min and kept for 3 min followed by a decrease to 60 a in 0 5 min and held for 3 min to allow re equilibration mass spectrometry was performed using a waters xevo tq s triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source waters usa in positive ion mode a flow injection of a standard solution of each compound was used to find the optimum conditions in the esi source and the average parameters selected were source temperature 150 c desolvation temperature 450 c capillary voltage 3 00 kv desolvation gas flow 900 l h and cone gas flow 150 l h quantitative analysis of the target progestins was performed using uplc ms ms in multi selected reaction monitoring mrm in the mrm transitions the dwell times were automatically selected at 15 35 ms based on the chromatographic separation and peak width table s2 the inter scan delay and inter channel delay were 3 and 5 ms respectively data acquisition was performed with masslynx 4 1 micromass manchester u k the signal to noise s n ratios were calculated on the unsmoothed chromatogram and the threshold of the ms was 25 counts 2 4 method performance identification of the analytes was accomplished by comparing the retention time within 2 and the ratio within 20 of the two selected mrm ion transition with those of standards to automatically correct the losses of analytes during sample preparation and the matrix induced change in ionization and to compensate for variations in instrument response from injection to injection an internal standard method was applied in the quantitative analysis of the target compounds the six mixed isotope labeled internal standard solution p d9 eth 13c2 cpa d3 mfp d3 ng d6 and mga d3 was spiked before sample extraction the internal standards corresponding to the quantification of each progestin were listed in table 1 a calibration curve was obtained by plotting the ratios of the analyte signal to the internal standard signal as a function of their concentration ratios the response factors obtained from the calibration curve were then applied to calculate the analyte concentrations all equipment rinses were done with methanol to avoid sample contamination and laboratory blanks were analyzed to assess potential sample contamination recovery experiments were done by spiking standard solutions to effluent water from two stps and a pooled river water sample analyte addition was made with the criterion of at least three times the original concentration that was determined prior to the fortification experiment since matrix effect is a general problem in lc ms ms analysis we evaluated the extent of signal suppression or enhancement by spiking standards into the extracts of water samples the matrix effect observed for each analyte was calculated using the percentage of signal intensity in the sample matrix versus the signal of the same concentration in methanol since many target analytes were detected in effluent and river water samples limits of detections lods and limit of quantifications loqs could not be measured based on the standard error of the estimate mcardell et al 2003 zuehlke et al 2004 rodil et al 2005 lindqvista et al 2005 therefore the lods and loqs were estimated based on the peak to peak noise of the baseline near the analyte peak obtained by analyzing field samples the lods and loqs were determined as the concentration with a minimum s n ratio of 3 and 10 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 lc ms ms analysis the 19 natural progestins and 42 synthetic progestins including 19 nortestosterone 17α hydroxyprogesterone and p derivatives were simultaneously analyzed by ms ms in the mrm mode the two abundant mrm transitions cone voltage and collision energies were optimized for each analyte by infusing the standard solutions into the mass spectrometer table 1 all of the precursor ions were protonated molecular ions m h under ms ms conditions most natural progestins and synthetic p derivatives generated abundant product ions at m z 97 and 109 which can be formed due to cleavages in the a and b rings the synthetic 19 nortestosterone derivatives without a methyl group at c 10 also produced ions at m z 109 but an ion of m z 97 was not observed suggesting that the substitution of the methyl group was important for the cleavage of the a ring the 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives involved an ester linkage at the 17α hydroxyl group position the abundant product ions were generated through the loss of the ester m h 60 and subsequent cleavage of the coch3 group at c 17 m h 60 43 except for mp and mpa which had a methyl substitution at c 6 and exhibited an abundant ion at m z 123 in addition to the typical abundant ions other product ions for the above four groups of natural and synthetic progestins were mainly generated by the loss of h2o 18 da hf 20 da and hcl 36 da chromatographic separation is important for the unequivocal identification of the 61 target progestins because many of the target compounds were isomers with identical precursor and product ions in previous studies methanol and acn solvents were applied to separate four natural progestins p 17α ohp 21α ohp and 17α 20β dohp and nine synthetic progestins ng mp mpa net cpa 17 ohp eth 17 ohpa and mga on c18 reverse phase columns chang et al 2008 liu et al 2011 vulliet et al 2008 al odaini et al 2010 unfortunately the use of c18 column chemistry could not effectively separate the 11 groups of isomers in this study as shown in fig s1 a the beh phenyl and hss t3 columns were further evaluated the beh phenyl column produced even worse separations especially for the more polar analytes fig s1 b by comparison the hss t3 column afforded the best retention and separation of all of the target analytes fig s2 furthermore good separation of the target analytes on hss t3 column leads to two to four fold increase in signal intensity compared to the beh c18 column a possible reason for the better performance of the hss t3 column could be the greater retention of the analytes leading to a higher ms ionization efficiency with the increasing organic content of the mobile phase new and chan 2008 we also assessed the composition of the mobile phase and additives because electrospray ionization esi is largely dependent on the solvent conditions a methanol water mixture containing formic acid was used because this mobile phase composition produced a three to four fold increase in the signal intensity compared to the mobile phase of acetonitrile water containing acetic acid as shown in fig s2 this optimized method resulted in the effective separation and sensitive determination of a much higher number of the progestins than has so far reported in the literature 3 2 sample extraction because the concentrations of progestins in the environment fall in the range of picograms to low nanograms per liter an efficient sample preparation was required spe was included to concentrate the target progestins and reduce sample complexity water samples were passed through glass microfiber filters before extraction and the partitioning of progestins to the suspended particulates were assessed by analyzing filtrates and filter retained particulates of spiked water samples as shown in the fig s3 only 0 05 5 8 of the target analytes were partitioned onto the filter retained particulates in river water and sewage effluent samples similar low adsorption percentages 7 2 were also reported for 18 hormones 5 estrogens 9 androgens and 4 progestins in surface water runoff samples in a recent study havens et al 2016 suggesting that the water soluble progestins are not prone to adsorption to the suspended particulates oasis hlb cartridges contain a unique copolymer sorbent that possesses hydrophilic and lipophilic groups and these cartridges have been widely used to extract progestins in surface and sewage treatment waters chang et al 2009 2011 2008 liu et al 2011 vulliet et al 2008 al odaini et al 2010 methanol and etoac are frequently used as solvents for eluting p net ng mp and mpa from the hlb cartridges chang et al 2009 2011 2008 liu et al 2011 vulliet et al 2008 al odaini et al 2010 and the two solvents were tested for the 61 target compounds we studied table s3 similar to previous work these two solvents also showed good recoveries for p net ng mp mpa cpa 17α ohp eth 17α ohpa and mga however methanol only eluted 23 68 of five natural progestins 5β dh 17 ohp 3α 5α thp 3α 5β thp 3β 5α thp and 3β 5α thp and two p derivatives 6β bp and 11α ohpt etoac also produced low recoveries 25 69 for the six natural metabolites 3α 5α thp 3α 5β thp 3β 5α thp 3β 5α thp 6β bp and 11α ohpt and the two 19 nortestosterone derivatives mfp and 16α mp considering that acn was efficient for eluting steroid hormones from hlb cartridges chang et al 2009 acn was further tested interestingly we found that acn had high recoveries 75 96 for compounds 3α 5α thp 3α 5β thp 3β 5α thp 3β 5α thp 6β bp 11α ohpt mfp and 16α mp that could not be effectively recovered by elution with methanol or etoac however acn produced low recoveries 43 65 for compounds 5β dh 17 ohp nte and 17α 20α dohp that were easily eluted from the hlb cartridge by etoac therefore we determined that a mixture of etoac acn for elution was optimal for co extracting all 61 progestins with good recoveries of 71 98 before loading the samples into the spe cartridge we evaluated the water conditions such as the water ph value and loading volume the ph was found to have no effect on the extraction of all analytes we tested the loading volumes of 500 and 1000 ml with river water and stp effluent samples and no breakthrough was found these results led us to choose a sample volume of 1000 ml for river water and stp effluent 3 3 method performance the recovery experiments were conducted using pooled samples from two wastewater treatment plant effluents and pooled samples from four river samples at the sites w1 qw bw and tw as shown in table 2 the recoveries of all target compounds from the effluent and river samples were 80 115 and 75 105 respectively the relative standard deviation rsd values were less than 17 in all of the spiked samples the extent of signal suppression and enhancement in the uplc esi ms ms detection was evaluated by spiking extracts of the pooled river and effluent samples with a standard solution the matrix effect observed with each analyte was calculated using the percentage signal intensity in the sample matrix versus the signal for the same concentration in methanol the response ratios for all target analytes in pooled effluent and river samples were 92 112 and 90 116 respectively table 2 suggesting no significant matrix effect affected the analysis the lod and loq of the method were calculated for each analyte based on the s n near the target peak the loqs of the analytes in the effluent and river samples were 0 05 0 60 ng l and 0 03 0 40 ng l respectively table 2 the loq values in this study were lower than those reported for an on line spe lc ms ms method 20 50 ng l for p ng and net in effluent fayad et al 2013 and off line spe gc ms method 2 ng l for p in effluent esperanza et al 2004 a similar sensitivity was also obtained by a previous off line spe lc ms ms method for nt net eth ng and mp in effluent 0 1 1 03 ng l and surface water 0 08 0 33 ng l liu et al 2011 no contamination of blanks was detected throughout the determination procedure for the 61 progestins we analyzed a series of calibration standard solutions was prepared for target analytes to evaluate the dynamic linear response of the analysis all of the analytes showed good linearity in the range of 0 1 200 μg l and the coefficients of determination were typically greater than 0 99 both intra and inter day precisions of the uplc ms ms instrument were examined for the intra day precision a standard solution 10 μg l of each analyte was injected successively seven times the rsd was in the 1 0 11 range for all analytes 3 4 application to environmental samples to determine the environmental concentrations of natural and synthetic progestins we applied the developed method to river samples collected from beijing china fig 5 for the 19 natural compounds the parent compound p and 15 natural progestin metabolites were detected with concentrations ranging from 0 03 17α 20β dohp to 112 3α 5β thp ng l table s4 the detection frequencies for p and seven metabolites 20α dhp 3α 5β thp 6α ohp 17α ohp 17α 20α dohp 17α 20β dohp and 5β dh 17 ohp were as high as 88 100 to our knowledge previous studies have mainly focused on the parent natural progestin p only one study investigated three different metabolites 21α ohp 17α ohp and 17α 20β dohp and the detected concentrations 0 15 1 4 ng l were a little higher than the parent p 0 06 0 37 ng l in the two effluent samples and one surface water sample from japan chang et al 2008 in this study the predominant metabolites were found to be 20α dhp 3α 5β thp 6α ohp and 5β dh 17 ohp and their concentrations were as high as 112 ng l which is 63 times that of the parent p 0 14 4 5 ng l these concentration levels demonstrate the importance of monitoring metabolites as well as the parent compounds and more work is need to study the occurrence and risk posed by these metabolites in the environment of the three groups of 42 synthetic progestins 7 p derivatives 5 19 nortestosterone and 5 17α hydroxyprogesterone were detected in the river samples table s4 the concentrations of p derivatives were the highest among the three groups the detected concentrations were 0 32 21 ng l for dgt 0 14 27 ng l for 16 dhp 0 12 6 1 ng l for deltap 0 10 154 ng l for 6 kp 0 09 38 ng l for 11 kp 0 60 38 ng l for 1 dh 11 kp and 0 04 9 6 ng l 6β bp the detection frequencies of dgt 16 dhp deltap and 6 kp were 88 100 followed by 11 kp at 59 6β bp at 59 and 1 dh 11 kp at 35 to our knowledge this is the first report of the occurrence of the synthetic progestins in river water it is interesting to note that the distributions of p derivatives were similar to those of the natural progestins fig 6 a and b both the natural progestins and synthetic progesterone derivatives exhibited the highest concentrations in samples collected from the sites qw bw wq and wb and the trend of increasing concentrations of the compounds along the three rivers was similar the similar distribution is consistent with the fact that the two groups of compounds both have structures derived from p and these compounds with high concentrations and detection frequencies deserve more attention in future studies the relatively low concentrations of the 19 nortestosterone progestins net 0 11 0 78 ng l nt 3 0 23 ng l eth 4 3 5 1 ng l ges 0 61 8 3 ng l mfp 0 05 25 ng l were detected in the river samples and the detection frequencies were 24 for net 76 for nt 12 for eth 100 for ges and 70 for mfp in previous investigations net and ng were the two major 19 nortestosterone progestins that were considered and the reported concentrations of these two compounds were highly variable with nd measured up to 38 ng l in the surface water in this study the concentration of ng was under detection limits and low concentrations of net were detected in the river water by comparison we found high concentrations and detection frequencies of nt eth ges and mfp the concentrations of nt dominated the total concentrations of the 19 nortestosterone derivatives and it was mainly detected in the water samples from the qing river and wenyu river nt has been shown to be effective in treating anemia osteoporosis and some forms of neoplasia including breast cancer and also acts as a progestin based contraceptive it is used medically in the form of esters such as nt decanoate and nt phenylpropionate which are rapidly hydrolyzed into nt once in the circulation the detected nt in the water samples is the hydrolyzed products of ester prodrugs it should also be noted that ges was detected in all of the river water samples consistent with its wide usage in human therapies the detected ges concentrations often exceeded the level 1 ng l found to reduce egg production in the fathead minnow the detected 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives had the lowest concentrations epi mpa cpa 15β ohcpa mga and dma were respectively found at 0 10 0 71 ng l 0 07 2 0 ng l 0 14 0 54 ng l 0 04 0 33 ng l and 0 10 0 56 ng l with a frequency of 35 100 mpa and mp are the major 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives that have been considered in previous investigations but very few surface water detections of mpa have been found above the detection limit kumar et al 2015 similarly we did not detect mpa and mp in river water but epi mpa 82 and mga 100 were frequently detected in addition the metabolite 15β ohcpa were detected at concentrations similar to the parent compound cpa 15β ohcpa has similar or even greater antiandrogen activity relative to cpa and could pose a high ecological risk to aquatic organisms in addition to the river samples we also analyzed two stp composite effluents for one week we found that the concentrations of all of the target progestins were much lower than those in some of the river samples and the profiles of the effluents were different from those in the water samples with high concentrations of progestins these results indicate that the stp effluents were not the main source of progestins in this area and suggest that untreated discharged wastewater can lead to the high concentrations of target pollutants found in river water 4 conclusions a selective and sensitive method was developed for simultaneous determination of 61 natural and synthetic progestins in effluent and river samples concentrations of p metabolites in environmental waters were much higher than those of the natural parent compounds the dominant compounds of synthetic progestins 19 nortestosterone and 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives were different from previous reports the p derivatives one group of synthetic progestins were first reported in the environmental waters and their concentrations were much higher compared to 19 nortestosterone and 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives occurrences of the progestins studied

19726,a broad number of natural and synthetic progestins are widely used in human and veterinary therapies although progestins exhibit adverse effects in aquatic organisms information about environmental occurrence and fate have been limited to several compounds hampering the accuracy of risk assessments of the compounds in this study a selective and sensitive analytical method was established to simultaneously determine 19 natural and 42 synthetic progestins in environmental waters and the synthetic progestins included 19 nortestosterone 17α hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone derivatives all of the target compounds were effectively separated using an hss t3 column and the recoveries for effluent and river samples were 80 115 and 75 105 respectively the detection limits for the 61 analytes were in the range of 0 05 0 60 ng l and 0 03 0 40 ng l for the effluent and river samples respectively the developed method is applied to analyze the target progestogens in sewage effluent and river water samples from beijing the detected concentrations of natural progesterone metabolites 3α hydroxy 5β tetrahydroprogesterone were up to 63 times higher than those of the parent compound of the three groups of synthetic progestins the progesterone derivatives were detected for the first time and had the highest concentrations followed by the 19 nortestosterone and 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives in contrast to previous studies the predominant derivative compounds of 19 nortestosterone were found to be 19 nortestosterone gestodene and mifepristone and those of 17α hydroxyprogesterone were 6 epi medroxy progesterone 17 acetate and melengestrol acetate the toxicities and environmental risk of these emerging progestins deserves more attention in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords progestins river water effluent uplc ms ms chromatographic separation 1 introduction over the past two decades environmental research has focused on steroid hormones that occur in the aquatic environment due to their potential endocrine disrupting effects defraipont and sorensen 1993 zheng et al 1997 sorensen et al 2005 while estrogens have received most of the attention khim et al 2001 schulz et al 2007 muncke et al 2007 atkinson et al 2011 recent studies have reported progestins to be another important group of endocrine disrupting chemicals it has been documented that various natural and synthetic progestins are widely used in human and veterinary therapies or as growth promoters kuster et al 2009 sitruk warea and nath 2010 and can be discharged into the aqueous environment via sewage treatment plants stps or from stock farm run off liu et al 2012 progestins have also been frequently reported to exhibit adverse effects in aquatic vertebrates especially fish kumar et al 2015 fent 2015 some natural progesterone p and synthetic progestins norgestrel ng norethisterone net gestodene ges cyproterone acetate cpa have been shown to affect the fertility and reproduction of fish in addition to reduced fecundity ng ges and net have been found to lead to masculinization phenomena and induced male secondary sex characteristics in female fish and amphibians zeilinger et al 2009 paulos et al 2010 runnalls et al 2013 hoffmann and kloas 2012 safholm et al 2012 therefore the presence of progestins in the environment poses an ecological risk to aquatic organisms and deserves greater attention in contrast to estrogen a broad number of natural and synthetic progestins have been reported in organisms or used in human and veterinary therapies natural progestins which are secreted naturally by humans and vertebrates include p and more than 30 metabolites these metabolites could still show biological activity for example 20β dihydroprogesterone 20β dhp induced 25 50 of progestogen activity bińkowska and woroń 2015 compared to p hydroxylated metabolites e g 17α 20β dihydroxyprogesterone and 17α 20β dohp are more important in fish and are well known inducers of final oocyte maturation in female fish additionally at concentrations as low as 0 3 ng l 17α 20β dohp these hydroxylated metabolites can act as hormonal odorants and reproductive pheromones affecting the reproductive physiology and behavior in many fish species sorensen et al 1995 synthetic progestins include 19 nortestosterone derivatives from testosterone 17α hydroxyprogesterone 17α ohp derivatives and p derivatives more than 40 synthetic progestins are found in various oral contraceptive brands and a number of medical applications with a content that is generally up to 100 fold higher than that of estrogen zeilinger et al 2009 some synthetic progestins including ng net and ges reduced egg production in fathead minnows at environmentally relevant concentrations 0 8 1 0 ng l zeilinger et al 2009 paulos et al 2010 runnalls et al 2013 despite the great variety of therapeutic applications and the induced adverse effects of progestins environmental investigations have only focused on a limited number of these compounds sewage and river water measurements have so far been made mostly for natural p and synthetic net ng medroxyprogesterone mp and medroxyprogesterone acetate mpa and few information is available for cpa kumar et al 2015 fent 2015 no information about environmental occurrence is available for ges which has reported endocrine and reproduction toxicities runnalls et al 2013 furthermore the co exposure of progestins could have additive adverse effects in fish zucchi et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 it is therefore essential to analyze a broad number of natural and synthetic progestins to obtain a more complete picture of the environmental contamination and to further assess the environmental risks some analytical methods have used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms methods combined with off line chang et al 2009 2011 2008 liu et al 2011 vulliet et al 2008 al odaini et al

al odaini et al 2010 esperanza et al 2004 guedes alonso et al 2014 fayad et al 2013 the number of target progestins detected with the available analytical methods was much smaller than the 60 natural

method combined with spe for the simultaneous analysis of 19 natural fig 1 and 42 synthetic progestins in river and effluent samples the 42 synthetic progestins included 16 p derivatives 12 19 nortestosterone derivatives and 14 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives and all these compounds were structurally related as shown in figs 2 4 it should be noted that of the 61 target progestins 43 are isomer compounds belonging to eleven groups therefore effective chromatographic separation is very important for the unequivocal identification of this broad number of isomers the developed method was applied to the river water and effluent samples collected in beijing the predominant progestins were identified and the occurrences of these compounds were investigated in the aquatic environment the results revealed the characterization of a broad number of progestins in environmental waters 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and reagents sixty one progestins full names and abbreviations shown in table

its tributaries in beijing china fig 5 river wenyu and its tributaries cover the most populated area of beijing china and the land cover is principally urban land two 24 h composite stp effluent samples were collected the two stps are located on the river qing and tonghui respectively and their effluents are directly discharged into the tributaries and finally enter the river wenyu all water samples were collected in precleaned 2 l amber glass bottles formaldehyde final concentration 1 v v was immediately added to the water samples which were sealed without headspace chilled and transported to the laboratory all samples were filtered and extracted within 6 h of sample collection to avoid blocking the spe cartridges suspended materials were removed from the samples by filtration through a glass fiber pad gf f 0 7 μm before cartridge extraction after filtration 1 l of river water or effluent samples was spiked with six isotope labeled standards at concentrations of 100 ng l the oasis hlb cartridge was pre conditioned with 6 ml of etoac 6 ml of acn and 12 ml of hplc grade water after passing the water samples through the cartridges at a flow rate of 10 15 ml min they were washed with 10 ml of hplc grade water and then dried under a flow of nitrogen the retained compounds were eluted from the cartridge with 6 ml of etoac acn 50 50 v v the eluent was collected and dried under a gentle nitrogen stream and reconstituted by using 200 μl methanol for uplc ms ms analysis 2 3 uplc ms ms analysis the lc apparatus was an acquity ultra performance lc system waters milford ma usa separation was conducted using a acquity uplc hss t3 100 mm 2 1 mm 1 7 μm particle size the column was maintained at 40 c and the flow rate and injection volume were 0 3 ml min and 2 μl respectively methanol a and 0 1 formic acid in ultrapure water b were used as the mobile phases the initial gradient of 60 a was increased to 70 in 8 min 85 in 5 min 100 in 1 min and kept for 3 min followed by a decrease to 60 a in 0 5 min and held for 3 min to allow re equilibration mass spectrometry was performed using a waters xevo tq s triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source waters usa in positive ion mode a flow injection of a standard solution of each compound was used to find the optimum conditions in the esi source and the average parameters selected were source temperature 150 c desolvation temperature 450 c capillary voltage 3 00 kv desolvation gas flow 900 l h and cone gas flow 150 l h quantitative analysis of the target progestins was performed using uplc ms ms in multi selected reaction monitoring mrm in the mrm transitions the dwell times were automatically selected at 15 35 ms based on the chromatographic separation and peak width table s2 the inter scan delay and inter channel delay were 3 and 5 ms respectively data acquisition was performed with masslynx 4 1 micromass manchester u k the signal to noise s n ratios were calculated on the unsmoothed chromatogram and the threshold of the ms was 25 counts 2 4 method performance identification of the analytes was accomplished by comparing the retention time within 2 and the ratio within 20 of the two selected mrm ion transition with those of standards to automatically correct the losses of analytes during sample preparation and the matrix induced change in ionization and to compensate for variations in instrument response from injection to injection an internal standard method was applied in the quantitative analysis of the target compounds the six mixed isotope labeled internal standard solution p d9 eth 13c2 cpa d3 mfp d3 ng d6 and mga d3 was spiked before sample extraction the internal standards corresponding to the quantification of each progestin were listed in table 1 a calibration curve was obtained by plotting the ratios of the analyte signal to the internal standard signal as a function of their concentration ratios the response factors obtained from the calibration curve were then applied to calculate the analyte concentrations all equipment rinses were done with methanol to avoid sample contamination and laboratory blanks were analyzed to assess potential sample contamination recovery experiments were done by spiking standard solutions to effluent water from two stps and a pooled river water sample analyte addition was made with the criterion of at least three times the original concentration that was determined prior to the fortification experiment since matrix effect is a general problem in lc ms ms analysis we evaluated the extent of signal suppression or enhancement by spiking standards into the extracts of water samples the matrix effect observed for each analyte was calculated using the percentage of signal intensity in the sample matrix versus the signal of the same concentration in methanol since many target analytes were detected in effluent and river water samples limits of detections lods and limit of quantifications loqs could not be measured based on the standard error of the estimate mcardell et al 2003 zuehlke et al 2004 rodil et al 2005 lindqvista et al 2005 therefore the lods and loqs were estimated based on the peak to peak noise of the baseline near the analyte peak obtained by analyzing field samples the lods and loqs were determined as the concentration with a minimum s n ratio of 3 and 10 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 lc ms ms analysis the 19 natural progestins and 42 synthetic progestins including 19 nortestosterone 17α hydroxyprogesterone and p derivatives were simultaneously analyzed by ms ms in the mrm mode the two abundant mrm transitions cone voltage and collision energies were optimized for each analyte by infusing the standard solutions into the mass spectrometer table 1 all of the precursor ions were protonated molecular ions m h under ms ms conditions most natural progestins and synthetic p derivatives generated abundant product ions at m z 97 and 109 which can be formed due to cleavages in the a and b rings the synthetic 19 nortestosterone derivatives without a methyl group at c 10 also produced ions at m z 109 but an ion of m z 97 was not observed suggesting that the substitution of the methyl group was important for the cleavage of the a ring the 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives involved an ester linkage at the 17α hydroxyl group position the abundant product ions were generated through the loss of the ester m h 60 and subsequent cleavage of the coch3 group at c 17 m h 60 43 except for mp and mpa which had a methyl substitution at c 6 and exhibited an abundant ion at m z 123 in addition to the typical abundant ions other product ions for the above four groups of natural and synthetic progestins were mainly generated by the loss of h2o 18 da hf 20 da and hcl 36 da chromatographic separation is important for the unequivocal identification of the 61 target progestins because many of the target compounds were isomers with identical precursor and product ions in previous studies methanol and acn solvents were applied to separate four natural progestins p 17α ohp 21α ohp and 17α 20β dohp and nine synthetic progestins ng mp mpa net cpa 17 ohp eth 17 ohpa and mga on c18 reverse phase columns chang et al 2008 liu et al 2011 vulliet et al 2008 al odaini et al 2010 unfortunately the use of c18 column chemistry could not effectively separate the 11 groups of isomers in this study as shown in fig s1 a the beh phenyl and hss t3 columns were further evaluated the beh phenyl column produced even worse separations especially for the more polar analytes fig s1 b by comparison the hss t3 column afforded the best retention and separation of all of the target analytes fig s2 furthermore good separation of the target analytes on hss t3 column leads to two to four fold increase in signal intensity compared to the beh c18 column a possible reason for the better performance of the hss t3 column could be the greater retention of the analytes leading to a higher ms ionization efficiency with the increasing organic content of the mobile phase new and chan 2008 we also assessed the composition of the mobile phase and additives because electrospray ionization esi is largely dependent on the solvent conditions a methanol water mixture containing formic acid was used because this mobile phase composition produced a three to four fold increase in the signal intensity compared to the mobile phase of acetonitrile water containing acetic acid as shown in fig s2 this optimized method resulted in the effective separation and sensitive determination of a much higher number of the progestins than has so far reported in the literature 3 2 sample extraction because the concentrations of progestins in the environment fall in the range of picograms to low nanograms per liter an efficient sample preparation was required spe was included to concentrate the target progestins and reduce sample complexity water samples were passed through glass microfiber filters before extraction and the partitioning of progestins to the suspended particulates were assessed by analyzing filtrates and filter retained particulates of spiked water samples as shown in the fig s3 only 0 05 5 8 of the target analytes were partitioned onto the filter retained particulates in river water and sewage effluent samples similar low adsorption percentages 7 2 were also reported for 18 hormones 5 estrogens 9 androgens and 4 progestins in surface water runoff samples in a recent study havens et al 2016 suggesting that the water soluble progestins are not prone to adsorption to the suspended particulates oasis hlb cartridges contain a unique copolymer sorbent that possesses hydrophilic and lipophilic groups and these cartridges have been widely used to extract progestins in surface and sewage treatment waters chang et al 2009 2011 2008 liu et al 2011 vulliet et al 2008 al odaini et al 2010 methanol and etoac are frequently used as solvents for eluting p net ng mp and mpa from the hlb cartridges chang et al 2009 2011 2008 liu et al 2011 vulliet et al 2008 al odaini et al 2010 and the two solvents were tested for the 61 target compounds we studied table s3 similar to previous work these two solvents also showed good recoveries for p net ng mp mpa cpa 17α ohp eth 17α ohpa and mga however methanol only eluted 23 68 of five natural progestins 5β dh 17 ohp 3α 5α thp 3α 5β thp 3β 5α thp and 3β 5α thp and two p derivatives 6β bp and 11α ohpt etoac also produced low recoveries 25 69 for the six natural metabolites 3α 5α thp 3α 5β thp 3β 5α thp 3β 5α thp 6β bp and 11α ohpt and the two 19 nortestosterone derivatives mfp and 16α mp considering that acn was efficient for eluting steroid hormones from hlb cartridges chang et al 2009 acn was further tested interestingly we found that acn had high recoveries 75 96 for compounds 3α 5α thp 3α 5β thp 3β 5α thp 3β 5α thp 6β bp 11α ohpt mfp and 16α mp that could not be effectively recovered by elution with methanol or etoac however acn produced low recoveries 43 65 for compounds 5β dh 17 ohp nte and 17α 20α dohp that were easily eluted from the hlb cartridge by etoac therefore we determined that a mixture of etoac acn for elution was optimal for co extracting all 61 progestins with good recoveries of 71 98 before loading the samples into the spe cartridge we evaluated the water conditions such as the water ph value and loading volume the ph was found to have no effect on the extraction of all analytes we tested the loading volumes of 500 and 1000 ml with river water and stp effluent samples and no breakthrough was found these results led us to choose a sample volume of 1000 ml for river water and stp effluent 3 3 method performance the recovery experiments were conducted using pooled samples from two wastewater treatment plant effluents and pooled samples from four river samples at the sites w1 qw bw and tw as shown in table 2 the recoveries of all target compounds from the effluent and river samples were 80 115 and 75 105 respectively the relative standard deviation rsd values were less than 17 in all of the spiked samples the extent of signal suppression and enhancement in the uplc esi ms ms detection was evaluated by spiking extracts of the pooled river and effluent samples with a standard solution the matrix effect observed with each analyte was calculated using the percentage signal intensity in the sample matrix versus the signal for the same concentration in methanol the response ratios for all target analytes in pooled effluent and river samples were 92 112 and 90 116 respectively table 2 suggesting no significant matrix effect affected the analysis the lod and loq of the method were calculated for each analyte based on the s n near the target peak the loqs of the analytes in the effluent and river samples were 0 05 0 60 ng l and 0 03 0 40 ng l respectively table 2 the loq values in this study were lower than those reported for an on line spe lc ms ms method 20 50 ng l for p ng and net in effluent fayad et al 2013 and off line spe gc ms method 2 ng l for p in effluent esperanza et al 2004 a similar sensitivity was also obtained by a previous off line spe lc ms ms method for nt net eth ng and mp in effluent 0 1 1 03 ng l and surface water 0 08 0 33 ng l liu et al 2011 no contamination of blanks was detected throughout the determination procedure for the 61 progestins we analyzed a series of calibration standard solutions was prepared for target analytes to evaluate the dynamic linear response of the analysis all of the analytes showed good linearity in the range of 0 1 200 μg l and the coefficients of determination were typically greater than 0 99 both intra and inter day precisions of the uplc ms ms instrument were examined for the intra day precision a standard solution 10 μg l of each analyte was injected successively seven times the rsd was in the 1 0 11 range for all analytes 3 4 application to environmental samples to determine the environmental concentrations of natural and synthetic progestins we applied the developed method to river samples collected from beijing china fig 5 for the 19 natural compounds the parent compound p and 15 natural progestin metabolites were detected with concentrations ranging from 0 03 17α 20β dohp to 112 3α 5β thp ng l table s4 the detection frequencies for p and seven metabolites 20α dhp 3α 5β thp 6α ohp 17α ohp 17α 20α dohp 17α 20β dohp and 5β dh 17 ohp were as high as 88 100 to our knowledge previous studies have mainly focused on the parent natural progestin p only one study investigated three different metabolites 21α ohp 17α ohp and 17α 20β dohp and the detected concentrations 0 15 1 4 ng l were a little higher than the parent p 0 06 0 37 ng l in the two effluent samples and one surface water sample from japan chang et al 2008 in this study the predominant metabolites were found to be 20α dhp 3α 5β thp 6α ohp and 5β dh 17 ohp and their concentrations were as high as 112 ng l which is 63 times that of the parent p 0 14 4 5 ng l these concentration levels demonstrate the importance of monitoring metabolites as well as the parent compounds and more work is need to study the occurrence and risk posed by these metabolites in the environment of the three groups of 42 synthetic progestins 7 p derivatives 5 19 nortestosterone and 5 17α hydroxyprogesterone were detected in the river samples table s4 the concentrations of p derivatives were the highest among the three groups the detected concentrations were 0 32 21 ng l for dgt 0 14 27 ng l for 16 dhp 0 12 6 1 ng l for deltap 0 10 154 ng l for 6 kp 0 09 38 ng l for 11 kp 0 60 38 ng l for 1 dh 11 kp and 0 04 9 6 ng l 6β bp the detection frequencies of dgt 16 dhp deltap and 6 kp were 88 100 followed by 11 kp at 59 6β bp at 59 and 1 dh 11 kp at 35 to our knowledge this is the first report of the occurrence of the synthetic progestins in river water it is interesting to note that the distributions of p derivatives were similar to those of the natural progestins fig 6 a and b both the natural progestins and synthetic progesterone derivatives exhibited the highest concentrations in samples collected from the sites qw bw wq and wb and the trend of increasing concentrations of the compounds along the three rivers was similar the similar distribution is consistent with the fact that the two groups of compounds both have structures derived from p and these compounds with high concentrations and detection frequencies deserve more attention in future studies the relatively low concentrations of the 19 nortestosterone progestins net 0 11 0 78 ng l nt 3 0 23 ng l eth 4 3 5 1 ng l ges 0 61 8 3 ng l mfp 0 05 25 ng l were detected in the river samples and the detection frequencies were 24 for net 76 for nt 12 for eth 100 for ges and 70 for mfp in previous investigations net and ng were the two major 19 nortestosterone progestins that were considered and the reported concentrations of these two compounds were highly variable with nd measured up to 38 ng l in the surface water in this study the concentration of ng was under detection limits and low concentrations of net were detected in the river water by comparison we found high concentrations and detection frequencies of nt eth ges and mfp the concentrations of nt dominated the total concentrations of the 19 nortestosterone derivatives and it was mainly detected in the water samples from the qing river and wenyu river nt has been shown to be effective in treating anemia osteoporosis and some forms of neoplasia including breast cancer and also acts as a progestin based contraceptive it is used medically in the form of esters such as nt decanoate and nt phenylpropionate which are rapidly hydrolyzed into nt once in the circulation the detected nt in the water samples is the hydrolyzed products of ester prodrugs it should also be noted that ges was detected in all of the river water samples consistent with its wide usage in human therapies the detected ges concentrations often exceeded the level 1 ng l found to reduce egg production in the fathead minnow the detected 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives had the lowest concentrations epi mpa cpa 15β ohcpa mga and dma were respectively found at 0 10 0 71 ng l 0 07 2 0 ng l 0 14 0 54 ng l 0 04 0 33 ng l and 0 10 0 56 ng l with a frequency of 35 100 mpa and mp are the major 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives that have been considered in previous investigations but very few surface water detections of mpa have been found above the detection limit kumar et al 2015 similarly we did not detect mpa and mp in river water but epi mpa 82 and mga 100 were frequently detected in addition the metabolite 15β ohcpa were detected at concentrations similar to the parent compound cpa 15β ohcpa has similar or even greater antiandrogen activity relative to cpa and could pose a high ecological risk to aquatic organisms in addition to the river samples we also analyzed two stp composite effluents for one week we found that the concentrations of all of the target progestins were much lower than those in some of the river samples and the profiles of the effluents were different from those in the water samples with high concentrations of progestins these results indicate that the stp effluents were not the main source of progestins in this area and suggest that untreated discharged wastewater can lead to the high concentrations of target pollutants found in river water 4 conclusions a selective and sensitive method was developed for simultaneous determination of 61 natural and synthetic progestins in effluent and river samples concentrations of p metabolites in environmental waters were much higher than those of the natural parent compounds the dominant compounds of synthetic progestins 19 nortestosterone and 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives were different from previous reports the p derivatives one group of synthetic progestins were first reported in the environmental waters and their concentrations were much higher compared to 19 nortestosterone and 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives occurrences of the progestins studied suggest a need for more work on the toxicities of these progestins and the risks they pose to environmental organisms acknowledgements the authors are grateful for financial support by the national

19727,algal growth causes a drastic change in aquatic conditions over a diel cycle which may induce sensitive feedback systems in sediments causing p release in this study a microcosm experiment was performed using a suction sampler rhizon to observe changes in soluble reactive phosphorus srp and soluble fe ii concentrations in the top 20 mm sediment layer on a 3 h time interval at different phases of harmful algal bloom hab development the results showed that the algal blooms prevailed up to 15 days after incubation after which the process of bloom collapse proceeded until the 70th day the concentrations of pore water soluble fe ii and srp increased throughout the incubation period compared to day 1 maximum increases of 214 in soluble fe ii and 387 in srp were observed at night during the bloom and collapse periods respectively the diffusive fluxes of fe and p at the sediment water interface swi generally corresponded to their changes in concentrations hourly fluctuation in soluble fe ii and srp concentrations were observed with two distinct concentration peaks occurred at 21 00 p m and 06 00 a m or 03 00 a m respectively these findings suggest that fe p coupling mechanisms are responsible for the release of p from sediments during the collapse period soluble fe ii concentrations were suppressed by the increase of labile s ii at night meanwhile srp concentrations were decoupled from fe cycling with small fluctuations 11 rsd on an hourly timescale and the decomposition of algae was a dominant source contributing to the release of p from sediments these results significantly improved the understanding of processes and mechanisms behind the stimulated release of p from sediments during habs graphical abstract image 1 keywords harmful algal blooms habs diffusive gradients in thin films sediments phosphorus iron eutrophication 1 introduction water eutrophication presents a global challenge in environmental management often resulting in undesirable harmful algal blooms habs in water bodies conley et al 2009 xu et al 2010 habs destroy the balance of ecosystems threaten human health and cause agricultural and recreation based economic loss paerl et al 2011 watzin et al 2006 phosphorus p has long been regarded as the most limiting nutrient controlling algal blooms in freshwaters carpenter 2008 huser et al 2016 schindler et al 2008 2016 more recent studies have revealed that both nitrogen n and p are key limiting factors lewis et al 2011 xu et al 2010 their roles vary seasonally and geographically p limitation generally occurs in spring followed by appearance of n limitation in summer and fall paerl et al 2016 one major reason for this dual limitation paradigm is that the concentration of p in water bodies can be sustained by the release of p from sediments while loss of n through denitrification is considerable in warm seasons paerl et al 2014 xu et al 2015 the release of p from freshwater sediments has been recognized for at least 80 years since einsele 1936 and mortimer 1941 proposed that the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides was responsible for the release of sediment p the internal loading of p is a major factor influencing the recovery of water bodies from eutrophication after that external p inputs were controlled and reduced ho and michalak 2017 jeppesen et al 2005 paytan et al 2017 in this case internal p loading maintains the persistence of habs causing water bodies recovery to be delayed for typically 10 15 years nürnberg et al 2013 paytan et al 2017 søndergaard et al 2013 a recent modelling study based on the temporal bayesian hierarchical framework bhm showed that the sediment exchange of p not external p loading determined the p limitation for habs in hyper eutrophic lake dianchi china wu et al 2017 the release intensity of p from sediments is notably enhanced during hab events with this phenomenon having been investigated intensively in laboratory simulation experiments and field studies gao et al 2013 gaoa 2012 giles et al 2016 smith et al 2011 xie et al 2003 a positive feedback loop has been proposed where habs drive the release of p from sediments which in turn fuels the prolonging of bloom life spans to date two major factors have been identified as drivers for the release of p from sediments during algal blooms firstly the elevation of ph values in the water column and upper sediment layer due to algal photosynthesis promoting the desorption of p o 4 3 ions bound to sediment solids due to oh competition gao et al 2012 2014 xie and xie 2002 secondly the formation of anoxic condition at the sediment water interface swi during habs causes the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides and the release of fe bound p pearce et al 2013 smith et al 2011 wang et al 2016 this redox driven release of p is generally verified by simultaneous accumulations of soluble fe ii and mn above the swi giles et al 2016 smith et al 2011 smolders et al 2017 furthermore the decomposition of algal appears during habs or following the algal blooms collapse resulting in the release of p from the degraded algal cells han et al 2015 zhu et al 2013 there is much debate about what mechanisms are dominant in the stimulation of p release from sediments during habs ph and oxygen levels in the water column are highly affected by algal photosynthesis and as sunlight intensity varies greatly within a day this pattern drives the changes in ph and do observed in the water column which can induce drastic changes to water chemistry and the mobility of p in the upper sediment layer when considering the primary role of fe redox cycle on p mobility ding et al 2016 the simultaneous monitoring of fe and p in both water and sediments on an hourly scale will greatly promote understanding of feedback mechanisms between habs and sediments this form of monitoring has been performed previously in overlying waters to the diel or hourly scales confirming the importance of ph and redox driven p release gao et al 2014 giles et al 2016 smith et al 2011 although to our knowledge no hourly scale data is available for sediments in the present study a 70 day incubation experiment was performed with the addition of algae using intact sediment cores to simulate the environmental habs scenario a suction sampler rhizon was used to investigate the changes in concentrations of soluble fe ii and srp in the upper 20 mm sediment layer on 3 h timescales at different algal growth phases microelectrodes and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt were used to obtain the change in distribution of ph do as well as the diffusion fluxes of fe p and sulfide s ii at the sediment water interface swi to a diel scale based on these high frequency measurements the mechanisms of stimulation of p release from sediments during habs were assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 hourly and diel scale sampling strategy several techniques have been developed for the analysis of sediments to a high temporal spatial resolution such as microelectrode high resolution dialysis hr peeper and dgt systems ding et al 2013 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2012 zhang et al 1995 these techniques have allowed the measurements of parameters at spatial resolutions between submillimeter and millimeter scales although the time required for analysis ranges from several hours to days ding et al 2015 santner et al 2015 the uses of passive sampling probes such as hr peeper or dgt systems are destructive to sediments due to insertion of probes none of these systems can repeatedly obtain the hourly scale data on concentrations of soluble fe ii or srp in a single sediment assay accordingly few studies have reported chemical parameters in sediments to hourly and diel scales in the present study we applied a rhizon sampler which uses a suction technique fig 1 e to perform hourly scale sampling of pore waters for the simultaneous measurements of srp and soluble fe ii rhizon sampling is originally applied to extract soil seepage water and then to perform sampling of sediment pore water geurts et al 2010 seeberg elverfeldt et al 2005 rhizon sampling is an effective and convenient method to obtain pore water samples directly from sediments with minimal disturbance to the sediment structure and no potential contamination from the surrounding air chen and hur 2015 shotbolt 2010 preliminary experiments were performed using a sediment core stabilized in the dark for 2 months to ensure that rhizon samplers could be effectively applied to the measurement of srp and soluble fe ii in sediments to a 3 h temporal scale with the variation rsd observed in srp and soluble fe ii concentrations being 4 1 and 3 2 respectively supplementary material fig s1 dgt fig 1a was used to measure the diffusive flux of s ii in sediments and p fe and s ii at the sediment water interface swi on a diel scale the dgt devices were provided by easysensor ltd china www easysensor net the piston type dgt device contains a binding phase plus a diffusion layer and when it is directly laid on the swi the p fe and s ii in pore water of the uppermost sediment layer generally within a range of 1 0 mm will diffuse across the diffusion layer and be immediately adsorbed by the binding phase ding et al 2012 the depletion of pore water p fe and s ii caused by dgt probe uptake will further induce the liberation of easily exchangeable p fe and s ii from sediment solids resupplying pore water p fe and s ii concentrations therefore there will be a greater flux of p fe and s ii measured by the dgt device if the supply of p fe and s ii from pore water and labile solids increases at the swi 2 2 microcosm experiment set up the sediment cores and waters used in this study were collected from meiliang bay of taihu lake 31 30 31 1 n 120 10 31 0 e the third largest freshwater lake in china meiliang bay has been polluted by sewage discharge since the 1980s resulting in significant levels of water eutrophication and algal blooms xu et al 2017 about 20 sediment cores 11 cm in diameter 30 cm in length were collected using a gravity corer on 18th august 2016 with water and algae samples collected simultaneously from the same sites six sediment cores were installed with thirty rhizon samplers rhizon css the netherlands 2 5 mm in diameter inserted horizontally into the cores in the overlying water at 5 mm above the sediment water interface swi and below the swi at depths of 5 mm 10 mm 15 mm and 20 mm respectively fig 1 ten sediment cores

occupied 86 of the total algal biomass the distance from the top of the water to the top of the coring tubes was about 25 cm the distance from the top of the coring tubes to the swi was about 15 cm the tanks were continuously incubated without stirring of the water in greenhouse for 70 days the filtered lake water was added in the tanks every 2 3 days to replenish the loss of water from evaporation water temperature ranged from 11 c to 29 c during the incubation period 2 3 sampling and analysis the environmental conditions light intensity do and ph in the water were measured on site

sediment cores fig 1e the concentrations of srp and soluble fe ii were analyzed immediately following sampling piston type agi and zro chelex dgt devices were used for measurement of the diffusive fluxes of p fe and s ii at the swi by placing devices on the surface of sediments rhizon inserted and allowing a deployment time of 12 h from 6 00 a m to 18 00 p m or from 18 00 p m to 6 00 a m flat agi dgt probes were inserted into parallel sediment cores non rhizon simultaneously for measurement of labile s ii in sediments after their removal the surface of the device was rinsed using deionized water then stored in plastic bags and kept moist prior to analysis during the deployment of the dgt devices three non rhizon sediment cores were removed from each tank and used for measurements of dissolved oxygen do and ph in sediments using the microelectrodes ox 100 ph 500 unisense aarhus denmark fig 1c a total of 550 ml water samples was collected on each of the 1st 5th 15th 20th 44th and 70th days for analysis of chlorophyll a chla and chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom the details about the analyses of rhizon and dgt samples and chla and cdom are shown in the supplementary material 2 4 data treatment and statistical analysis the concentration of dgt labile s ii in the sediment water profile as well as the fluxes of p fe and s ii at the swi were calculated as the dgt flux as shown in equation 1 ding et al 2016 santner et al 2015 1 f d g t m a t where m μg is the accumulated mass over the deployment time a cm2 is the exposure area of the gel and t s is the deployment time statistical analysis was performed using spss v20 0 software the correlations between each two variables were analyzed using the pearson correlation coefficient at the p 05 p 01 and p 001 levels of significance 3 results 3 1 changes in algal growth the concentration of chla at different sampling times is shown in fig 2 a during the 70 day sampling period chla concentrations remained relatively constant at around 9 5 μg l 1 in the control treatment which should come from the settled algae on the sediment surface for the algal treatment chla concentrations increased sharply from 27 6 μg l 1 on the 1st day of operation to 154 3 μg l 1 on the 15th day following this chla concentrations showed a decreasing trend to 14 3 μg l 1 by the 70th day three components of cdom were identified by parallel factor analysis parafac in the water of algal treatment fig 2b and fig s2 components 1 2 and 3 represent tryptophan like fluorophores microbial reworked humic like fluorophore and terrestrial humic like materials respectively fluorescence intensity of the three components especially components 1 and 2 had a visible increase on days 20 and 44 in comparison with those before day 20 fig 2 3 2 hourly changes of light intensity and water do and ph the hourly changes in light intensity do and ph on each sampling day and their diel dynamics on different days are shown in fig 3 the light intensity was high during daytime from 6 00 to 18 00 with a peak at around 12 00 p m and remained at very low levels at other times the do value in control treatments showed considerable variation from 3 8 to 6 8 mg l 1 on day 1 then remained relatively stable following this for algal treatments do values decreased persistently on days 1 and 5 from 6 5 mg l 1 to 9 0 mg l 1 at 12 00 p m to 2 5 mg l 1 and 1 5 mg l 1 by 06 00 a m the next day a similar pattern was observed on days 15 20 and 44 except that the maximum value occurred at 15 00 p m by day 70 the degree of variation in do levels had reduced to a very low level showing no significant difference compared to the control treatments the change in ph follows a similar trend as do with both parameters showing a strong positive correlation table s1 the highest ph observed was 10 5 at 15 00 p m on day 20 3 3 diel changes of ph and do in sediments the distributions of ph and do in the diel sediment water profiles are shown in fig 4 and the mean values of each parameter in the upper sediment layer are listed in table 1 on day 1 there are no evident differences in ph or do levels between the algae and control treatments p 05 student s t test by days 20 and 44 a significant difference in both ph and do levels are apparent between algal treatments and controls the highest observed values occurred in algal tanks during daytime while the lowest values occurred in algal tanks at overnight and control tank values were intermediate among them for algal treatments ph and do showed a diel pattern of decreased mean values in the upper 2 5 and 1 0 mm sediment layers with ph decreasing from 9 26 to 7 36 and do from 6 74 mg l 1 to 0 84 mg l 1 the affected sediment depths decreased with reduced water ph and do levels in algal treatments the affected depths for ph and do decreased from 20 mm to 12 4 mm and from 3 5 mm to 1 5 mm between daytime and overnight it is of note that by day 70 no visible difference is present between the control and the algal treatments 3 4 changes in soluble fe ii and srp concentrations and their relationship the hourly changes in srp and soluble fe ii concentrations in the upper 20 mm sediment layers were investigated at different sampling times as an example the data at the depth of 5 mm for the algal treatment are shown in fig 5 while all other data are displayed in fig s3 on day 1 there is a visible fluctuation in srp concentrations from 12 00 p m to 21 00 p m with peaks in concentrations observed at 15 00 p m and 18 00 p m the concentrations of soluble fe ii showed a similar trend overall on day 5 the change in srp and soluble fe ii showed very similar diel cycles both exhibiting peaks at 21 00 p m and the following morning at 06 00 a m respectively this similarity in trend was also observed on day 15 where concentration peaks appeared simultaneously on days 20 44 and 70 the soluble fe ii concentrations retained the pattern previously observed exhibiting two concentration peaks at 21 00 p m and the following day at 06 00 a m or 03 00 a m with a visible concentration minimum at 00 00 a m however srp concentrations remained small fluctuation 11 rsd the statistical analysis showed that a significant positive correlation occurred between srp and soluble fe ii concentrations in sediments on days 5 and 15 while on other days correlations were not found in all datasets table 2 the mean concentrations of pore water srp and soluble fe ii at each measured sediment depth were calculated as daytime from 6 00 a m to 18 00 p m and overnight from 18 00 p m to 6 00 a m averages with their vertical distributions on different days shown in fig 6 in the control treatments there was a sharp increase in both srp and soluble fe ii from the swi to a depth of 5 mm below this depth only small fluctuation were observed with no significant differences in concentration observed for srp or soluble fe ii among the 6 sampling times or between the day and night the largest difference in concentration for both srp and soluble fe ii occurred on the 70th day with mean concentrations of srp and soluble fe ii being 51 lower and 58 higher than that on the 1st day respectively table 3 with this variation persisting throughout day and night periods in algal treatments the variation in pore water srp and soluble fe ii concentrations were significantly greater than in control treatments srp showed an increasing trend from day 1 to day 44 followed by a sharp decrease to its original level day 1 the largest difference in srp occurred on day 44 with concentrations 387 higher than on day 1 the extent of increase in srp concentration was generally higher during the night than during daytime for soluble fe ii concentrations an increasing trend occurred from day 1 to day 15 with increases on day 15 being greater overnight following the 15th day the daytime concentration remained steady until day 44 then decreasing sharply until day 70 the overnight concentrations were reduced on days 20 and 44 with an even greater decrease by day 70 the largest difference in soluble fe ii concentrations occurred on the 15th day with mean concentrations of soluble fe ii being 165 higher during the daytime and 214 higher overnight as compared to day 1 table 3 3 5 changes in dgt labile s ii concentration profiles in sediment the 2d distribution of labile s ii concentrations reflected by dgt flux during the algal collapse period on day 44 were measured using dgt and are shown in fig 7 for control treatments the highest fluxes in dgt labile s ii concentrations occurred in sediments below a depth of 40 mm and 25 mm during the daytime and overnight respectively with the flux being greater overnight above 25 mm flux remained at low levels in controls for algal treatments the distribution and degree of flux in labile s ii during the daytime were similar to the control treatment however the fluxes observed overnight were distributed across the whole sediment core profiles with generally much higher values than those observed during daytime or in control treatments daytime or overnight 3 6 releases of p fe and s ii at the sediment water interface the diffusive fluxes of p s ii and fe at the swi are presented in fig 8 in control treatments the fluxes of p and fe showed a small increase from day 1 to day 15 followed by stabilization remaining at a low level until day 70 with no visible difference between values during the daytime or overnight the flux of s ii showed two peaks on day 5 and 15 with the value on day 15 being double that of day 5 the addition of algae greatly promoted the release of p fe and s ii from sediments the fluxes of p and s ii increased from the 1st day to the 44th day followed by a decreasing trend to the 70th day overnight value of p flux at most sampling times were slightly greater than during the daytime the flux in s ii overnight are much greater than those during the daytime with the values observed overnight on day 44 being much greater than those on day 15 while the values observed during the daytime were similar the flux of fe increased significantly from day 1 to day 15 then decreased the values of fe flux during the daytime were highly similar between day 15 and 44 while overnight the value on day 44 was lower than that on day 15 4 discussion 4 1 algal blooms development and its effects on ph and do the concentration of chla is an established indicator for the biomass of phytoplankton present otten et al 2012 in the present study the chla concentration on day 1 was 27 6 μg l 1 which is approaching the threshold limit value 20 μg l 1 for habs xu et al 2015 the chla concentration showed a drastic increase until day 15 followed by a consistent reduction until day 70 the maximum chla concentration 154 3 μg l 1 observed was ten fold lower than the maximum values monitored in lake taihu by the taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research tller over the past three years 2014 2016 the algal blooms peaked on day 15 after which bloom waning and senescence phases began to occur significantly altering microcosm development during the bloom collapse period the fluorescence intensities of tryptophan and microbial humic like components had a visible increase fig 2 confirming the degradation of algae during this period zhang et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 it is of note that the terrestrial humic like component is often closely associated with terrestrial derived organic matter stedmon et al 2007 zhou et al 2016 therefore this component remained relatively stable regardless of the degradation of algae fig 2 algal photosynthesis produces o2 during the daytime in waterbodies while ongoing respiration of benthic heterotrophs depletes o2 and tends to reduce the do concentrations at the swi the photosynthetic activities of algae caused drastic changes in do concentrations in the water column in this study fig 3 with the hourly change in do characterized by a peak in early after noon 12 00 p m or 15 00 p m followed by consistent decrease to the lowest value by 06 00 a m the next morning the time of peak do values were simultaneous or later than the peak light intensity reflecting a delay in o2 production by photosynthesis triggered by high light intensity the largest change in range of do was observed on day 15 from 4 1 to 13 3 mg l 1 at which point the algal blooms was at its biomass peak the fluctuation of water column do in algal treatments resulted in changes in the do concentration in the upper sediment layer and variations in oxygen penetration depth from day to night fig 4 table 1 with the magnitude of diel differences being consistent with those in the water column phytoplankton photosynthesis also significantly resulted in drastic ph changes from day to night fig 3 probably through changing the free co2 level ph values in the water column increased to 10 53 which is higher than the maximal ph value 9 67 observed in lake taihu monitoring by tller over the past three years but in range with the maximum ph value of 11 0 observed in another large eutrophic lake chaohu china during a hab event yang et al 2012 it is of note that the ph increase was more sensitive than the increase in do which is reflected by day 1 data where ph is significantly different in the control and algal treatments while the difference in do concentration is not obvious furthermore the depth of sediment affected by the fluctuation of water ph 20 mm was much deeper than the depth affected by change in do 3 5 mm fig 4 4 2 effects of algal blooms on p release from sediments habs had a pronounced effect on the concentration of srp in the upper 20 mm sediment layer figs 5 6 fig s3 in contrast to the relatively small change in srp observed in the control sediments during the bloom growth period from day 1 to day 15 an increase in srp concentrations in upper sediments was observed fig 6 reflecting that the presence of habs caused liberation of srp from sediment solids a recent study showed that internal p loading accounted for 54 of increased water column total p during the prebloom bloom period in meiliang bay of lake taihu and the liberated p played a major role in causing seasonal nitrogen limitation for habs ding et al 2018 for deep lakes with water stratification p released from sediments would not be available to phytoplankton until fall turnover crockford et al 2015 the rate of srp release varied at an hourly time scale with day 5 and 15 both showing two peak srp concentration events at 21 00 p m and the following morning at 06 00 a m fig 5 fig s3 the maximum increase in srp concentrations in sediments appeared on day 44 during which the algal blooms is in the waning and senescence phase fig 6 the maximum extent 387 is similar to a field investigation in which the pore water srp concentrations were 300 400 higher within the bloom region compared to the outside of bloom gao et al 2014 during the bloom collapse period small variation in srp was observed with the disappearance of the two peak distribution fig 5 fig s3 implying that there may be different mechanisms controlling the liberation of srp from sediment solids the release of p from the sediment was also enhanced by the presence of habs as reflected by the increase in p flux at the swi with similar effects reported during habs in other studies zhu et al 2013 the greatest increase of flux appeared on day 44 which is consistent with the changes in srp in the upper 20 mm sediment the level of p flux overnight was larger than during the daytime reflecting greater sediment activity overnight with this feature supported by the relatively high concentrations of srp in the upper sediment layer during the night fig 6 4 3 mechanisms for the driving release of p by habs the hourly changes in ph and do concentrations in the water column are significant fig 3 which further induced a large variation in concentrations in upper sediment layers from day to night fig 4 therefore taking the primary role of fe redox into consideration it is expected that the mobility of p would be modified on an hourly timescale through altered fe redox cycling ding et al 2016 giles et al 2016 smolders et al 2017 for soluble fe ii results showed that except for day 1 all days showed a similar diel change pattern as highlighted by two concentration peaks at 21 00 p m and 06 00 a m or 03 00 a m the next morning with lowest concentrations observed at 00 00 a m to the best of our knowledge this phenomenon has not been previously reported the appearance of a peak in soluble fe ii concentrations at 21 00 p m is accompanied by daily high values in do and ph however the high do levels and alkaline conditions will reduce the concentration of soluble fe ii by causing fe ii oxygenation or precipitation respectively by day 70 when both do concentrations and ph were stabilized due to habs collapse the temporal pattern of variation in soluble fe ii concentrations persisted this implies that the hourly change in fe ii concentrations in the upper sediment layer was not sensitive to changes to chemical conditions such as do and ph as light cannot penetrate the clay sediment the role of photochemical reactions can be excluded suggesting the effect may be microbially mediated melton et al 2014 recently this hourly fluctuation pattern of soluble fe ii was observed by us in field studies at lake taihu supporting that it is not a unique phenomenon observed in the present study although further studies should be carried out in this aspect the change in srp concentration is similar to the change in soluble fe ii concentration on days 5 and 15 which is demonstrated by the appearance of peak concentrations at the same time the positive correlation between srp and soluble fe ii verified that they are coupled in biogeochemical cycles in surface sediments during the bloom period this resulted in the simultaneous release of srp and soluble fe ii and their enrichment in overlying waters fig 5 fig s3 an effect frequently observed and reported giles et al 2016 smith et al 2011 smolders et al 2017 previous studies have revealed that the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides and the reverse reaction can result in a simultaneous increase or decrease in fe ii and srp ding et al 2016 the fe redox coupled remobilization of p is sensitive to change in do concentrations smolders et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 fox example the concentration of soluble fe ii in pore water should decrease during the daytime due to oxygenation by the increased oxygen in the uppermost sediment layer in the algal treatment fig 4 which should further decrease the concentration of srp through adsorption by fe iii oxides however such a phenomenon has not been observed fig 5 this implies that the fe coupled release of p during the bloom period is more complex than the fe p paradigm established by einsele 1936 and mortimer 1941 on days 20 and 44 there is no significant variation in srp in the upper sediment layer in contrast with the two peak pattern observed for soluble fe ii on these days suggesting that decoupling of fe and p occurred the decomposition of algal cells occurs during the bloom collapse period which can promote the release of p wang et al 2015 2016 zhu et al 2013 a previous incubation study show that algal degradation directly released srp and increased srp concentrations in the vicinity of the swi in contrast to the change in srp the increase of soluble fe ii occurred due to more reductive conditions in sediments and the diffusion of fe ii from deep sediment layers han et al 2015 therefore the decomposition of algae changes the srp source from fe redox coupled release to direct release from degraded algal cells which is consistent with the lack of correlation between srp and soluble fe ii on days 20 and 44 table 2 it is of note that the level of release of srp from degraded algae on day 44 is much greater than from fe coupled p on day 15 reflected by the increase of srp in sediments as well as p flux at the swi figs 6 and 8 however soluble fe ii concentration and flux decreased from day 15 to day 44 figs 6 and 8 this should be attributed to the increased s ii concentration overnight during algal decomposition figs 7 and 8 which can cause soluble fe ii to precipitate as fes decreasing the concentration of soluble fe ii rozan et al 2002 a recent study observed enhanced sulfide production and p mobilization due to increased sulfate concentrations in the water column of lake taihu in a simulation experiment chen et al 2016 5 conclusions the addition of algae significantly increased the concentrations of pore water soluble fe ii and srp in sediments with a maximum increase of 214 and 387 during the night in bloom and collapse periods respectively as compared to the 1st day the increases in pore water soluble fe ii and srp enhanced the diffusive fluxes of both fe and p to the water column hourly changes in pore water soluble fe ii in sediments show that the peak increase consistently occurred at 21 00 p m and 06 00 a m or 03 00 a m the next morning during the algal blooms period srp concentrations were consistent with soluble fe ii concentrations following the two peak diel pattern this demonstrates that a fe p coupling mechanism is responsible for the release of p from sediments during the collapse period srp was decoupled from the fe cycle and remained constant with the degradation of algae being a dominant process contributing to the release of p acknowledgments this study was jointly sponsored by the national natural science foundation of china 41701568 41571465 41621002 the national program

19727,algal growth causes a drastic change in aquatic conditions over a diel cycle which may induce sensitive feedback systems in sediments causing p release in this study a microcosm experiment was performed using a suction sampler rhizon to observe changes in soluble reactive phosphorus srp and soluble fe ii concentrations in the top 20 mm sediment layer on a 3 h time interval at different phases of harmful algal bloom hab development the results showed that the algal blooms prevailed up to 15 days after incubation after which the process of bloom collapse proceeded until the 70th day the concentrations of pore water soluble fe ii and srp increased throughout the incubation period compared to day 1 maximum increases of 214 in soluble fe ii and 387 in srp were observed at night during the bloom and collapse periods respectively the diffusive fluxes of fe and p at the sediment water interface swi generally corresponded to their changes in concentrations hourly fluctuation in soluble fe ii and srp concentrations were observed with two distinct concentration peaks occurred at 21 00 p m and 06 00 a m or 03 00 a m respectively these findings suggest that fe p coupling mechanisms are responsible for the release of p from sediments during the collapse period soluble fe ii concentrations were suppressed by the increase of labile s ii at night meanwhile srp concentrations were decoupled from fe cycling with small fluctuations 11 rsd on an hourly timescale and the decomposition of algae was a dominant source contributing to the release of p from sediments these results significantly improved the understanding of processes and mechanisms behind the stimulated release of p from sediments during habs graphical abstract image 1 keywords harmful algal blooms habs diffusive gradients in thin films sediments phosphorus iron eutrophication 1 introduction water eutrophication presents a global challenge in environmental management often resulting in

loss paerl et al 2011 watzin et al 2006 phosphorus p has long been regarded as the most limiting nutrient controlling algal blooms in freshwaters carpenter 2008 huser et al 2016 schindler et al 2008 2016 more recent studies have revealed that both nitrogen n and p are key limiting factors lewis et al 2011 xu et al 2010 their roles vary seasonally and geographically p limitation generally occurs in spring followed by appearance of n limitation in summer and fall paerl et al 2016 one major reason for this dual limitation paradigm is that the concentration of p in water bodies can be sustained by the release of p from sediments while loss of n through denitrification is considerable in warm seasons paerl et al 2014 xu et al 2015 the release of p from freshwater sediments has been recognized for at least 80 years since einsele 1936 and mortimer 1941 proposed that the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides was responsible for the release of sediment p the internal loading of p is a major factor influencing the recovery of water bodies from eutrophication after that external p inputs were controlled and reduced ho and michalak 2017 jeppesen et al 2005 paytan et al 2017 in this case internal p loading maintains the persistence of habs causing water bodies recovery to be delayed for typically 10 15 years nürnberg et al 2013 paytan et al 2017 søndergaard et al 2013 a recent modelling study based on the temporal bayesian hierarchical framework bhm showed that the sediment exchange of p not external p loading determined the p limitation for habs in hyper eutrophic lake dianchi china wu et al 2017 the release intensity of p from sediments is notably enhanced during hab events with this phenomenon having been investigated intensively in laboratory simulation experiments and field studies gao et al 2013 gaoa 2012 giles et al 2016 smith et al 2011 xie et al 2003 a positive feedback loop has been proposed where habs drive the release of p from sediments which in turn fuels the prolonging of bloom life spans to date two major factors have been identified as drivers for the release of p from sediments during algal blooms firstly the elevation of ph values in the water column and upper sediment layer due to algal photosynthesis promoting the desorption of p o 4 3 ions bound to sediment solids due to oh competition gao et al 2012 2014 xie and xie 2002 secondly the formation of anoxic condition at the sediment water interface swi during habs causes the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides and the release of fe bound p pearce et al 2013 smith et al 2011 wang et al 2016 this redox driven release of p is generally verified by simultaneous accumulations of soluble fe ii and mn above the swi giles et al 2016 smith et al 2011 smolders et al 2017 furthermore the decomposition of algal appears during habs or following the algal blooms collapse resulting in the release of p from the degraded algal cells han et al 2015 zhu et al 2013 there is much debate about what mechanisms are dominant in the stimulation of p release from sediments during habs ph and oxygen levels in the water column are highly affected by algal photosynthesis and as sunlight intensity varies greatly within a day this pattern drives the changes in ph and do observed in the water column which can induce drastic changes to water chemistry and the mobility of p in the upper sediment layer when considering the primary role of fe redox cycle on p mobility ding et al 2016 the simultaneous monitoring of fe and p in both water and sediments on an hourly scale will greatly promote understanding of feedback mechanisms between habs and sediments this form of monitoring has been performed previously in overlying waters to the diel or hourly scales confirming the importance of ph and redox driven p release gao et al 2014 giles et al 2016 smith et al 2011 although to our knowledge no hourly scale data is available for sediments in the present study a 70 day incubation experiment was performed with the addition of algae using intact sediment cores to simulate the environmental habs scenario a suction sampler rhizon was used to investigate the changes in concentrations of soluble fe ii and srp in the upper 20 mm sediment layer on 3 h timescales at different algal growth phases microelectrodes and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt were used to obtain the change in distribution of ph do as well as the diffusion fluxes of fe p and sulfide s ii at the sediment water interface swi to a diel scale based on these high frequency measurements the mechanisms of stimulation of p release from sediments during habs were assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 hourly and diel scale sampling strategy several techniques have been developed for the analysis of sediments to a high temporal spatial resolution such as microelectrode high resolution dialysis hr peeper and dgt systems ding et al 2013 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2012 zhang et al 1995 these techniques have allowed the measurements of parameters at spatial resolutions between submillimeter and millimeter scales although the time required for analysis ranges from several hours to days ding et al 2015 santner et al 2015 the uses of passive sampling probes such as hr peeper or dgt systems are destructive to sediments due to insertion of probes none of these systems can repeatedly obtain the hourly scale data on concentrations of soluble fe ii or srp in a single sediment assay accordingly few studies have reported chemical parameters in sediments to hourly and diel scales in the present study we applied a rhizon sampler which uses a suction technique fig 1 e to perform hourly scale sampling of pore waters for the simultaneous measurements of srp and soluble fe ii rhizon sampling is originally applied to extract soil seepage water and then to perform sampling of sediment pore water geurts et al 2010 seeberg elverfeldt et al 2005 rhizon sampling is an effective and convenient method to obtain pore water samples directly from sediments with minimal disturbance to the sediment structure and no potential contamination from the surrounding air chen and hur 2015 shotbolt 2010 preliminary experiments were performed using a sediment core stabilized in the dark for 2 months to ensure that rhizon samplers could be effectively applied to the measurement of srp and soluble fe ii in sediments to a 3 h temporal scale with the variation rsd observed in srp and soluble fe ii concentrations being 4 1 and 3 2 respectively supplementary material fig s1 dgt fig 1a was used to measure the diffusive flux of s ii in sediments and p fe and s ii at the sediment water interface swi on a diel scale the dgt devices were provided by easysensor ltd china www easysensor net the piston type dgt device contains a binding phase plus a diffusion layer and when it is directly laid on the swi the p fe and s ii in pore water of the uppermost sediment layer generally within a range of 1 0 mm will diffuse across the diffusion layer and be immediately adsorbed by the binding phase ding et al 2012 the depletion of pore water p fe and s ii caused by dgt probe uptake will further induce the liberation of easily exchangeable p fe and s ii from sediment solids resupplying pore water p fe and s ii concentrations therefore there will be a greater flux of p fe and s ii measured by the dgt device if the supply of p fe and s ii from pore water and labile solids increases at the swi 2 2 microcosm experiment set up the sediment cores and waters used in this study were collected from meiliang bay of taihu lake 31 30 31 1 n 120 10 31 0 e the third largest freshwater lake in china meiliang bay has been polluted by sewage discharge since the 1980s resulting in significant levels of water eutrophication and algal blooms xu et al 2017 about 20 sediment cores 11 cm in diameter 30 cm in length were collected using a gravity corer on 18th august 2016 with water and algae samples collected simultaneously from the same sites six sediment cores were installed with thirty rhizon samplers rhizon css the netherlands 2 5 mm in diameter inserted horizontally into the cores in the overlying water at 5 mm above the sediment water interface swi and below the swi at depths of 5 mm 10 mm 15 mm and 20 mm respectively fig 1 ten sediment cores including three rhizon assembled cores were placed in each of two tanks 70 cm 50 cm 65 cm length width height the tanks were filled with filtered whatman 0 45 μm pore size lake water to a depth of 60 cm and left for 2 days in a greenhouse after that 10 l of unfiltered and filtered lake water were added to the two tanks respectively the unfiltered lake water contained algae of which microcystis spp occupied 86 of the total algal biomass the distance from the top of the water to the top of the coring tubes was about 25 cm the distance from the top of the coring tubes to the swi was about 15 cm the tanks were continuously incubated without stirring of the water in greenhouse for 70 days the filtered lake water was added in the tanks every 2 3 days to replenish the loss of water from evaporation water temperature ranged from 11 c to 29 c during the incubation period 2 3 sampling and analysis the environmental conditions light intensity do and ph in the water were measured on site on the 1st 5th 15th 20th 44th and 70th days to a 3 h scale simultaneously 1 ml samples of overlying water and pore water were obtained from each sediment depth using rhizon samplers pre loaded into sediment cores fig 1e the concentrations of srp and soluble fe ii were analyzed immediately following sampling piston type agi and zro chelex dgt devices were used for measurement of the diffusive fluxes of p fe and s ii at the swi by placing devices on the surface of sediments rhizon inserted and allowing a deployment time of 12 h from 6 00 a m to 18 00 p m or from 18 00 p m to 6 00 a m flat agi dgt probes were inserted into parallel sediment cores non rhizon simultaneously for measurement of labile s ii in sediments after their removal the surface of the device was rinsed using deionized water then stored in plastic bags and kept moist prior to analysis during the deployment of the dgt devices three non rhizon sediment cores were removed from each tank and used for measurements of dissolved oxygen do and ph in sediments using the microelectrodes ox 100 ph 500 unisense aarhus denmark fig 1c a total of 550 ml water samples was collected on each of the 1st 5th 15th 20th 44th and 70th days for analysis of chlorophyll a chla and chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom the details about the analyses of rhizon and dgt samples and chla and cdom are shown in the supplementary material 2 4 data treatment and statistical analysis the concentration of dgt labile s ii in the sediment water profile as well as the fluxes of p fe and s ii at the swi were calculated as the dgt flux as shown in equation 1 ding et al 2016 santner et al 2015 1 f d g t m a t where m μg is the accumulated mass over the deployment time a cm2 is the exposure area of the gel and t s is the deployment time statistical analysis was performed using spss v20 0 software the correlations between each two variables were analyzed using the pearson correlation coefficient at the p 05 p 01 and p 001 levels of significance 3 results 3 1 changes in algal growth the concentration of chla at different sampling times is shown in fig 2 a during the 70 day sampling period chla concentrations remained relatively constant at around 9 5 μg l 1 in the control treatment which should come from the settled algae on the sediment surface for the algal treatment chla concentrations increased sharply from 27 6 μg l 1 on the 1st day of operation to 154 3 μg l 1 on the 15th day following this chla concentrations showed a decreasing trend to 14 3 μg l 1 by the 70th day three components of cdom were identified by parallel factor analysis parafac in the water of algal treatment fig 2b and fig s2 components 1 2 and 3 represent tryptophan like fluorophores microbial reworked humic like fluorophore and terrestrial humic like materials respectively fluorescence intensity of the three components especially components 1 and 2 had a visible increase on days 20 and 44 in comparison with those before day 20 fig 2 3 2 hourly changes of light intensity and water do and ph the hourly changes in light intensity do and ph on each sampling day and their diel dynamics on different days are shown in fig 3 the light intensity was high during daytime from 6 00 to 18 00 with a peak at around 12 00 p m and remained at very low levels at other times the do value in control treatments showed considerable variation from 3 8 to 6 8 mg l 1 on day 1 then remained relatively stable following this for algal treatments do values decreased persistently on days 1 and 5 from 6 5 mg l 1 to 9 0 mg l 1 at 12 00 p m to 2 5 mg l 1 and 1 5 mg l 1 by 06 00 a m the next day a similar pattern was observed on days 15 20 and 44 except that the maximum value occurred at 15 00 p m by day 70 the degree of variation in do levels had reduced to a very low level showing no significant difference compared to the control treatments the change in ph follows a similar trend as do with both parameters showing a strong positive correlation table s1 the highest ph observed was 10 5 at 15 00 p m on day 20 3 3 diel changes of ph and do in sediments the distributions of ph and do in the diel sediment water profiles are shown in fig 4 and the mean values of each parameter in the upper sediment layer are listed in table 1 on day 1 there are no evident differences in ph or do levels between the algae and control treatments p 05 student s t test by days 20 and 44 a significant difference in both ph and do levels are apparent between algal treatments and controls the highest observed values occurred in algal tanks during daytime while the lowest values occurred in algal tanks at overnight and control tank values were intermediate among them for algal treatments ph and do showed a diel pattern of decreased mean values in the upper 2 5 and 1 0 mm sediment layers with ph decreasing from 9 26 to 7 36 and do from 6 74 mg l 1 to 0 84 mg l 1 the affected sediment depths decreased with reduced water ph and do levels in algal treatments the affected depths for ph and do decreased from 20 mm to 12 4 mm and from 3 5 mm to 1 5 mm between daytime and overnight it is of note that by day 70 no visible difference is present between the control and the algal treatments 3 4 changes in soluble fe ii and srp concentrations and their relationship the hourly changes in srp and soluble fe ii concentrations in the upper 20 mm sediment layers were investigated at different sampling times as an example the data at the depth of 5 mm for the algal treatment are shown in fig 5 while all other data are displayed in fig s3 on day 1 there is a visible fluctuation in srp concentrations from 12 00 p m to 21 00 p m with peaks in concentrations observed at 15 00 p m and 18 00 p m the concentrations of soluble fe ii showed a similar trend overall on day 5 the change in srp and soluble fe ii showed very similar diel cycles both exhibiting peaks at 21 00 p m and the following morning at 06 00 a m respectively this similarity in trend was also observed on day 15 where concentration peaks appeared simultaneously on days 20 44 and 70 the soluble fe ii concentrations retained the pattern previously observed exhibiting two concentration peaks at 21 00 p m and the following day at 06 00 a m or 03 00 a m with a visible concentration minimum at 00 00 a m however srp concentrations remained small fluctuation 11 rsd the statistical analysis showed that a significant positive correlation occurred between srp and soluble fe ii concentrations in sediments on days 5 and 15 while on other days correlations were not found in all datasets table 2 the mean concentrations of pore water srp and soluble fe ii at each measured sediment depth were calculated as daytime from 6 00 a m to 18 00 p m and overnight from 18 00 p m to 6 00 a m averages with their vertical distributions on different days shown in fig 6 in the control treatments there was a sharp increase in both srp and soluble fe ii from the swi to a depth of 5 mm below this depth only small fluctuation were observed with no significant differences in concentration observed for srp or soluble fe ii among the 6 sampling times or between the day and night the largest difference in concentration for both srp and soluble fe ii occurred on the 70th day with mean concentrations of srp and soluble fe ii being 51 lower and 58 higher than that on the 1st day respectively table 3 with this variation persisting throughout day and night periods in algal treatments the variation in pore water srp and soluble fe ii concentrations were significantly greater than in control treatments srp showed an increasing trend from day 1 to day 44 followed by a sharp decrease to its original level day 1 the largest difference in srp occurred on day 44 with concentrations 387 higher than on day 1 the extent of increase in srp concentration was generally higher during the night than during daytime for soluble fe ii concentrations an increasing trend occurred from day 1 to day 15 with increases on day 15 being greater overnight following the 15th day the daytime concentration remained steady until day 44 then decreasing sharply until day 70 the overnight concentrations were reduced on days 20 and 44 with an even greater decrease by day 70 the largest difference in soluble fe ii concentrations occurred on the 15th day with mean concentrations of soluble fe ii being 165 higher during the daytime and 214 higher overnight as compared to day 1 table 3 3 5 changes in dgt labile s ii concentration profiles in sediment the 2d distribution of labile s ii concentrations reflected by dgt flux during the algal collapse period on day 44 were measured using dgt and are shown in fig 7 for control treatments the highest fluxes in dgt labile s ii concentrations occurred in sediments below a depth of 40 mm and 25 mm during the daytime and overnight respectively with the flux being greater overnight above 25 mm flux remained at low levels in controls for algal treatments the distribution and degree of flux in labile s ii during the daytime were similar to the control treatment however the fluxes observed overnight were distributed across the whole sediment core profiles with generally much higher values than those observed during daytime or in control treatments daytime or overnight 3 6 releases of p fe and s ii at the sediment water interface the diffusive fluxes of p s ii and fe at the swi are presented in fig 8 in control treatments the fluxes of p and fe showed a small increase from day 1 to day 15 followed by stabilization remaining at a low level until day 70 with no visible difference between values during the daytime or overnight the flux of s ii showed two peaks on day 5 and 15 with the value on day 15 being double that of day 5 the addition of algae greatly promoted the release of p fe and s ii from sediments the fluxes of p and s ii increased from the 1st day to the 44th day followed by a decreasing trend to the 70th day overnight value of p flux at most sampling times were slightly greater than during the daytime the flux in s ii overnight are much greater than those during the daytime with the values observed overnight on day 44 being much greater than those on day 15 while the values observed during the daytime were similar the flux of fe increased significantly from day 1 to day 15 then decreased the values of fe flux during the daytime were highly similar between day 15 and 44 while overnight the value on day 44 was lower than that on day 15 4 discussion 4 1 algal blooms development and its effects on ph and do the concentration of chla is an established indicator for the biomass of phytoplankton present otten et al 2012 in the present study the chla concentration on day 1 was 27 6 μg l 1 which is approaching the threshold limit value 20 μg l 1 for habs xu et al 2015 the chla concentration showed a drastic increase until day 15 followed by a consistent reduction until day 70 the maximum chla concentration 154 3 μg l 1 observed was ten fold lower than the maximum values monitored in lake taihu by the taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research tller over the past three years 2014 2016 the algal blooms peaked on day 15 after which bloom waning and senescence phases began to occur significantly altering microcosm development during the bloom collapse period the fluorescence intensities of tryptophan and microbial humic like components had a visible increase fig 2 confirming the degradation of algae during this period zhang et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 it is of note that the terrestrial humic like component is often closely associated with terrestrial derived organic matter stedmon et al 2007 zhou et al 2016 therefore this component remained relatively stable regardless of the degradation of algae fig 2 algal photosynthesis produces o2 during the daytime in waterbodies while ongoing respiration of benthic heterotrophs depletes o2 and tends to reduce the do concentrations at the swi the photosynthetic activities of algae caused drastic changes in do concentrations in the water column in this study fig 3 with the hourly change in do characterized by a peak in early after noon 12 00 p m or 15 00 p m followed by consistent decrease to the lowest value by 06 00 a m the next morning the time of peak do values were simultaneous or later than the peak light intensity reflecting a delay in o2 production by photosynthesis triggered by high light intensity the largest change in range of do was observed on day 15 from 4 1 to 13 3 mg l 1 at which point the algal blooms was at its biomass peak the fluctuation of water column do in algal treatments resulted in changes in the do concentration in the upper sediment layer and variations in oxygen penetration depth from day to night fig 4 table 1 with the magnitude of diel differences being consistent with those in the water column phytoplankton photosynthesis also significantly resulted in drastic ph changes from day to night fig 3 probably through changing the free co2 level ph values in the water column increased to 10 53 which is higher than the maximal ph value 9 67 observed in lake taihu monitoring by tller over the past three years but in range with the maximum ph value of 11 0 observed in another large eutrophic lake chaohu china during a hab event yang et al 2012 it is of note that the ph increase was more sensitive than the increase in do which is reflected by day 1 data where ph is significantly different in the control and algal treatments while the difference in do concentration is not obvious furthermore the depth of sediment affected by the fluctuation of water ph 20 mm was much deeper than the depth affected by change in do 3 5 mm fig 4 4 2 effects of algal blooms on p release from sediments habs had a pronounced effect on the concentration of srp in the upper 20 mm sediment layer figs 5 6 fig s3 in contrast to the relatively small change in srp observed in the control sediments during the bloom growth period from day 1 to day 15 an increase in srp concentrations in upper sediments was observed fig 6 reflecting that the presence of habs caused liberation of srp from sediment solids a recent study showed that internal p loading accounted for 54 of increased water column total p during the prebloom bloom period in meiliang bay of lake taihu and the liberated p played a major role in causing seasonal nitrogen limitation for habs ding et al 2018 for deep lakes with water stratification p released from sediments would not be available to phytoplankton until fall turnover crockford et al 2015 the rate of srp release varied at an hourly time scale with day 5 and 15 both showing two peak srp concentration events at 21 00 p m and the following morning at 06 00 a m fig 5 fig s3 the maximum increase in srp concentrations in sediments appeared on day 44 during which the algal blooms is in the waning and senescence phase fig 6 the maximum extent 387 is similar to a field investigation in which the pore water srp concentrations were 300 400 higher within the bloom region compared to the outside of bloom gao et al 2014 during the bloom collapse period small variation in srp was observed with the disappearance of the two peak distribution fig 5 fig s3 implying that there may be different mechanisms controlling the liberation of srp from sediment solids the release of p from the sediment was also enhanced by the presence of habs as reflected by the increase in p flux at the swi with similar effects reported during habs in other studies zhu et al 2013 the greatest increase of flux appeared on day 44 which is consistent with the changes in srp in the upper 20 mm sediment the level of p flux overnight was larger than during the daytime reflecting greater sediment activity overnight with this feature supported by the relatively high concentrations of srp in the upper sediment layer during the night fig 6 4 3 mechanisms for the driving release of p by habs the hourly changes in ph and do concentrations in the water column are significant fig 3 which further induced a large variation in concentrations in upper sediment layers from day to night fig 4 therefore taking the primary role of fe redox into consideration it is expected that the mobility of p would be modified on an hourly timescale through altered fe redox cycling ding et al 2016 giles et al 2016 smolders et al 2017 for soluble fe ii results showed that except for day 1 all days showed a similar diel change pattern as highlighted by two concentration peaks at 21 00 p m and 06 00 a m or 03 00 a m the next morning with lowest concentrations observed at 00 00 a m to the best of our knowledge this phenomenon has not been previously reported the appearance of a peak in soluble fe ii concentrations at 21 00 p m is accompanied by daily high values in do and ph however the high do levels and alkaline conditions will reduce the concentration of soluble fe ii by causing fe ii oxygenation or precipitation respectively by day 70 when both do concentrations and ph were stabilized due to habs collapse the temporal pattern of variation in soluble fe ii concentrations persisted this implies that the hourly change in fe ii concentrations in the upper sediment layer was not sensitive to changes to chemical conditions such as do and ph as light cannot penetrate the clay sediment the role of photochemical reactions can be excluded suggesting the effect may be microbially mediated melton et al 2014 recently this hourly fluctuation pattern of soluble fe ii was observed by us in field studies at lake taihu supporting that it is not a unique phenomenon observed in the present study although further studies should be carried out in this aspect the change in srp concentration is similar to the change in soluble fe ii concentration on days 5 and 15 which is demonstrated by the appearance of peak concentrations at the same time the positive correlation between srp and soluble fe ii verified that they are coupled in biogeochemical cycles in surface sediments during the bloom period this resulted in the simultaneous release of srp and soluble fe ii and their enrichment in overlying waters fig 5 fig s3 an effect frequently observed and reported giles et al 2016 smith et al 2011 smolders et al 2017 previous studies have revealed that the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides and the reverse reaction can result in a simultaneous increase or decrease in fe ii and srp ding et al 2016 the fe redox coupled remobilization of p is sensitive to change in do concentrations smolders et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 fox example the concentration of soluble fe ii in pore water should decrease during the daytime due to oxygenation by the increased oxygen in the uppermost sediment layer in the algal treatment fig 4 which should further decrease the concentration of srp through adsorption by fe iii oxides however such a phenomenon has not been observed fig 5 this implies that the fe coupled release of p during the bloom period is more complex than the fe p paradigm established by einsele 1936 and mortimer 1941 on days 20 and 44 there is no significant variation in srp in the upper sediment layer in contrast with the two peak pattern observed for soluble fe ii on these days suggesting that decoupling of fe and p occurred the decomposition of algal cells occurs during the bloom collapse period which can promote the release of p wang et al 2015 2016 zhu et al 2013 a previous incubation study show that algal degradation directly released srp and increased srp concentrations in the vicinity of the swi in contrast to the change in srp the increase of soluble fe ii occurred due to more reductive conditions in sediments and the diffusion of fe ii from deep sediment layers han et al 2015 therefore the decomposition of algae changes the srp source from fe redox coupled release to direct release from degraded algal cells which is consistent with the lack of correlation between srp and soluble fe ii on days 20 and 44 table 2 it is of note that the level of release of srp from degraded algae on day 44 is much greater than from fe coupled p on day 15 reflected by the increase of srp in sediments as well as p flux at the swi figs 6 and 8 however soluble fe ii concentration and flux decreased from day 15 to day 44 figs 6 and 8 this should be attributed to the increased s ii concentration overnight during algal decomposition figs 7 and 8 which can cause soluble fe ii to precipitate as fes decreasing the concentration of soluble fe ii rozan et al 2002 a recent study observed enhanced sulfide production and p mobilization due to increased sulfate concentrations in the water column of lake taihu in a simulation experiment chen et al 2016 5 conclusions the addition of algae significantly increased the concentrations of pore water soluble fe ii and srp in sediments with a maximum increase of 214 and 387 during the night in bloom and collapse periods respectively as compared to the 1st day the increases in pore water soluble fe ii and srp enhanced the diffusive fluxes of both fe and p to the water column hourly changes in pore water soluble fe ii in sediments show that the peak increase consistently occurred at 21 00 p m and 06 00 a m or 03 00 a m the next morning during the algal blooms period srp concentrations were consistent with soluble fe ii concentrations following the two peak diel pattern this demonstrates that a fe p coupling mechanism is responsible for the release of p from sediments during the collapse period srp was decoupled from the fe cycle and remained constant with the degradation of algae being a dominant process contributing to the release of p acknowledgments this study was jointly sponsored by the national natural science foundation of china 41701568 41571465 41621002 the national program

and technology hong kong china corresponding author autotrophic denitrification has been widely studied for odor mitigation corrosion control and nitrogen removal in recent years this paper examines the response of sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob driven autotrophic denitrification under short term stress of dissolved sulfide a series of batch tests were conducted to investigate the effect of different sulfide concentrations 0 1600 mg total dissolved sulfide tds l on autotrophic denitrification and sulfide oxidation by sob enriched sludge our results show that autotrophic denitrification no3 to n2 was stimulated up to 200 mg tds l with a maximum denitrification rate of 9 4 mg n g volatile suspended solids vss h and the nitrite reduction was a rate limiting step when sulfide concentration was higher than 200 mg tds l it inhibited nitrate reductase and nitrate reduction became the rate limiting step according to edwards and aiba inhibition models sulfide oxidation however was not inhibited and the maximum rate of 100 3 mg tds g vss h was obtained at sulfide concentration of 1000 mg tds l it is important to point out that the transient inhibition on autotrophic denitrification caused by high sulfide stress was resilient and non lethal with no significant changes in cell viability even under sulfide concentration of 1000 mg tds l this study reveals the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of dissolved sulfide on sob driven autotrophic denitrification and its possible underlying mechanism with discussion on engineering implications graphical abstract image 1 keywords autotrophic denitrification biological sulfide oxidation sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob dissolved sulfide 1 introduction autotrophic denitrification by sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob using inorganic carbon as a carbon source and removing the reduced sulfur compounds sulfide sulfur thiosulfate and nitrogen nitrate and nitrite simultaneously has been observed in a number of natural and engineered eco system am et al 2005 wang et al 2005 cardoso et al 2006 manconi et al 2007 lu et al 2012 pokorna and zabranska 2015 this sob driven autotrophic denitrification could be employed to remediate groundwater with low concentration of nitrate sierra alvarez et al 2007 and to remove toxic and corrosive sulfide from gas stream hirai et al 1990 or water stream of sulfur laden industries gu et al 2004 tanaka et al 2007 recently this process has also been applied for engineered saline sewage treatment in a full scale demonstration in hong kong which reduced 70 biological sludge production 30 energy consumption and 30 greenhouse gas emission in comparison with the local conventional activated sludge process wu et al 2016 for wastewater treatment sob driven autotrophic denitrification utilizes dissolved sulfide as an electron donor enabling high rate low cost autotrophic nitrogen removal read daily et al 2011 xu et al 2014 several studies reported that dissolved sulfide especially unionized form h2s inhibited the activities of nitrifying heterotrophic denitrifying and anammox bacteria even at very low concentrations of 0 5 4 0 mg total dissolved sulfide tds l tds h2s hs s2 erguder et al 2008 zhou et al 2014 pan et al 2013 jin et al 2013 it could be explained as free sulfide h2s diffuses through the microbial cell membrane thereby denaturing the native proteins moosa and harrison 2006 chen et al 2008 and or inactivating the critical oxidase mediated respiration of cytochromes bagarinao 1992 lloyd 2006 bouillaud and blachier 2011 however there are contradictory reports with respect to the influence of dissolved sulfide on sob driven autotrophic denitrification utilizing sulfide as an electron donor for instance cardoso et al 2006 reported the failure of sob driven autotrophic denitrification in an up flow anaerobic sludge bed at an influent sulfide concentration of 320 mg tds l at ph of 7 0 and sludge loading rate of 6 7 mg tds g volatile suspended solids vss h whereas the maximum sulfide oxidation and autotrophic denitrification rates were achieved in a stirred bioreactor continuously fed with 480 mg tds l at ph 6 8 7 2 and sulfide loading rate of 52 0 mg tds g vss h in an et al 2010 recently a long term laboratory scale study using sob sludge demonstrated that the dissolved sulfide could effectively mitigate the electron competition among nitrate nitrite and n2o reductases and the n2o accumulation can be significantly decreased while increasing influent sulfur to nitrogen s n ratios from 3 0 to 5 0 g s g n in sob driven autotrophic denitrification at dissolved sulfide concentration up to 150 mg s l yang et al 2016 to date most studies focused on the impact of dissolved sulfide on the removals of nitrogen and sulfide within a limited range of sulfide concentrations 0 500 mg tds l and without detailed investigations on the underlying inhibition mechanism and kinetics thus the overarching goal of this study was to examine the role of sulfide on sob driven autotrophic denitrification and its possible underlying mechanism within a wide range of dissolved sulfide concentrations a series of well designed batch studies were conducted to 1 examine the influence of bulk liquid dissolved sulfide concentrations from 0 to 1600 mg tds l on autotrophic denitrification and biological sulfide oxidation by sob enriched sludge 2 evaluate the resilience of activity of autotrophic denitrifiers sob against short term exposure to different sulfide concentrations and 3 identify the effect of dissolved sulfide on microbial viability of sob and explore the possible mechanism of dissolved sulfide on the activity of sob 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum the experiments were carried out using an enriched and fully acclimatized sob sludge obtained from a laboratory scale up flow anoxic sludge reactor mother reactor as shown in fig s1 in the supplementary information si the reactor with working volume of 30 l was initially seeded with waste activated sludge obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant in guangzhou china that employs the a a o process and fed with synthetic wastewater composition in table s1 and operation conditions in table s2 in si the mother reactor was continuously operated for approximately 300 days with stable performance see table s3 the volatile suspended solids vss concentration of the reactor was about 6 9 0 1 g l with specific denitrification rate of 56 5 1 1 mg n g vss h pyrosequencing results suggest that the major population in the sludge about 65 of retrieved sequences are thiobacillus sp and sulfurimonas sp table 1 and fig s2 and members of this order can carry out complete autotrophic denitrification with sulfide as an electron donor beller et al 2006 sievert et al 2008 details of pyrosequencing methodology can be referred to our previous paper yang et al 2016 afterwards the sob sludge was fully acclimatized and ready for the following batch experiments 2 2 batch tests a series of batch tests batch tests i were conducted in the 250 ml conical flasks to evaluate the effects of dissolved sulfide on autotrophic denitrification and sulfide oxidation by sob in each batch test the sob sludge was withdrawn from the mother reactor fig s1 in si concentrated by centrifugation at 4500 g for 3 min and washed three times with oxygen free milli q water about 0 5 g of the centrifuged and washed sob sludge was re inoculated into a 250 ml conical flask with 150 ml of synthetic medium and the final vss concentration was approximately 3 3 g l in each flask the synthetic sulfide solutions were supplemented with macro and micro nutrients 216 mg l kno3 30 mg no3 n l 2 0 g l kh2po4 2 0 g l nahco3 and 0 2 g l mgcl2 they contained dissolved sulfide of 0 30 50 90 100 150 200 250 300 400 500 700 1 000 1300 and 1600 mg tds l total 15 different tds concentrations prepared using na2s 9h2o causing s n ratios of 0 1 0 1 7 3 0 3 3 5 0 6 7 8 3 10

purged with n2 gas 99 9 purity then sealed completely with parafilm to prevent gas exchange with atmosphere gentle mixing was provided by a magnetic stirrer at 150 rpm each test lasted for 1 h and mixed liquor samples were taken for nitrate nitrite sulfide thiosulfate and sulfate analysis at the beginning and end of batch test the ph value was also monitored during the experiment and it increased only slightly 0 2 unit during the tests the vss concentration of the mixed liquor was also measured at the end of batch test the control tests with inoculum and nutrient solution but no dissolved sulfide or nitrate were also carried out under the same experimental conditions at the end of batch test the sludge samples were taken from each flask to analyze the cell viability via fluorescent staining as described in section 2 3 the h2s and hs concentrations were determined based on the following relationship h2s tds 1 10ph pk1 1 where pk1 value is 6 97 at 25 c pk1 2 151 1437 t where t is in kelvin broderius and smith 1977 at ph 7 0 h2s and hs are the predominant species and s2 is negligible 0 001 of the tds a series of inhibition kinetic models were used for fitting the observed experimental data see tables s4 s5 and s6 in si and compared using r software and the nls function de micheaux et al 2014 another set of batch tests batch tests ii were conducted to examine the resiliency of sob sludge for autotrophic denitrification following the dissolved sulfide inhibition it involved three successive steps step i was aimed at obtaining the best microbial activity of sob sludge about 0 5 g of sob sludge as vss from the mother reactor was added into each 250 ml conical flask total three flasks with 150 ml synthetic medium including 200 mg tds l and 30 mg no3 n l and was run for 5 h to obtain the best autotrophic denitrification rate as indicated in batch tests i bt i the sludge sample in each flask was then separately centrifuged at 4500 g and washed three times with oxygen free milli q water step ii was aimed at evaluating the sulfide inhibition on sob activity the sludge samples totally three from three flasks treated in step i were further separately resuspended in three 250 ml conical flasks with synthetic medium containing 30 mg no3 n l in each and dissolved sulfide of 300 500 or 1000 mg tds l respectively each flask was gently mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 150 rpm for 5 h to evaluate the sulfide inhibition on sob finally in step iii the resiliency of sob activity for autotrophic denitrification was examined the centrifuged at 4500 g and washed sludge samples totally three from three flasks from step ii were separately resuspended again in three 250 ml conical flasks with synthetic medium containing 200 mg tds l and 30 mg no3 n l solutions in each and each flask was run for 5 h to evaluate the resiliency of sob activity for autotrophic denitrification the same synthetic medium and operating conditions as in batch tests i were used except the dissolved sulfide and the vss concentrations in each conical flask vss concentration was controlled at about 3 0 g l mixed liquor samples were taken from each flask for nitrate nitrite dissolved sulfide thiosulfate sulfate and vss analysis before and after each step in all the batch tests three flasks were operated in parallel for each dissolved sulfide concentration at room temperature 25 2 c 2 3 fluorescent staining and flow cytometry fcm two nucleic acid stains green fluorescent syto 9 dye and red fluorescent propidium iodide pi were used in combination as a viability indicator that differentiates cells with intact or damaged cytoplasmic membranes berney et al 2007 the live dead baclight bacterial viability and counting kit l34856 molecular probes usa were used for the analysis as per the manufacturer s guidelines the staining stock solution consisting of syto 9 nucleic acid stain 3 34 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and pi 20 mm in dmso was diluted 500 times and the microsphere standard was diluted 100 times the staining solution was then stored at 20 c and protected from light until further use sludge samples 1 ml each from the conical flask were transferred into 2 ml plastic centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 3 min to pelletize the cells the supernatant was discarded and sludge samples were resuspended in 0 85 nacl solution for incubation under dark condition at room temperature for an hour the incubated sludge suspension samples were dispersed by sonication at 40 w for 1 min which was sufficient for dispersion without impacting cell viability sébastien et al 2002 sonicated sludge samples were then filtered through an 8 μm membrane filter to separate bacterial cells from the bigger aggregates and 10 μl of sample was stained with 990 μl of staining solution prior to flow cytometry analysis the stained samples were incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature flow cytometry measurements were performed using beckman coulter flow cytometer cytomic tm fc 500 usa equipped with a blue 25 mw solid state laser emitting light at a fixed wavelength of 488 nm both syto 9 and pi fluorescence were excited by the 488 nm laser and collected through a 527 30 nm band pass or a 630 nm long pass filter respectively wang et al 2010 all samples were collected as logarithmic signals and were triggered on the green and red fluorescence channels for each sample run data for 30 000 events were collected all analyses were conducted in triplicates and the patterns were reproducible 2 4 sampling and analytical methods mixed

ion chromatography equipped with a conductivity detector and an ic as23 anion or ic cs12a cation analytical column ics 900 dionex usa dissolved sulfide was measured with the methylene blue method apha 2005 while ph and temperature were monitored with a portable ph meter mettler toledo fg2 fk switzerland 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of dissolved sulfide on sob activity under short term sulfide stress the effect of dissolved sulfide on sob activity for autotrophic denitrification and biological sulfide oxidation was investigated in a series of batch experiments batch tests i in a very broad range of dissolved sulfide concentrations 0 1600 mg tds l the n2o intermediate of nitrate denitrification was not analyzed in this study because n2o accumulation and release was very little while the s n ratio was close to or higher than 2 0 g s g n as investigated in our previous study yang et al 2016 therefore in this study the autotrophic denitrification or simply denitrification is regarded as the complete nitrogen conversion from nitrate no3 to dinitrogen n2 mainly including two steps nitrate reduction the first step no3 no2 and nitrite reduction the second step no2 n2 and the nitrate reduction is merely the first step of denitrification i e no3 no2 the specific nitrate reduction no3 to no2 autotrophic denitrification no3 to n2 and sulfide oxidation dissolved sulfide to so4 2 rates are presented in fig 1 a variety of substrate inhibition models were examined to fit the obtained data as shown in fig 1 more details in tables s4 s5 and s6 in si the inhibition models proposed by edwards 1970 and aiba et al 1968 showed a better fit and realistic biokinetic constants in both cases the residual standard error was significantly lower when fitted to nitrate reduction only no3 to no2 than for autotrophic denitrification no3 to n2 indicating the greater sulfide sensitivity to the nitrate reductase moraes et al 2012 the fitted parameters for the edwards model gave the lowest residual error 0 8265 as shown in table 2 the biomass specific denitrification rate was strongly dependent on initial dissolved sulfide concentration and it increased rapidly reaching a maximum rate of 9 4 mg n g vss h at 200 mg tds l as shown in fig 1 dolejs et al 2015 also reported an increase in denitrification rate from 1 1 to 5 9 mg n g vss h when the dissolved sulfide was increased from 30 to 55 mg tds l in this study nitrite accumulation was detected the nitrite concentrations in batch reactors with initial sulfide concentrations of 30 50 90 100 and 150 mg tds l were 1 5 3 3 3 6 4 3 and 5 1 mg n l respectively but no nitrite was detected in the batch reactors with initial sulfide concentrations above 200 mg tds l data not shown the region between nitrate reduction and denitrification curves in fig 1 also implies that the nitrite reduction was the rate limiting step below 200 mg tds l of dissolved sulfide concentration in this study at sulfide level above 200 mg tds l specific autotrophic denitrification no3 to n2 rate was equal to specific nitrate reduction no3 to no2 rate and declined from 9 4 mg n g vss h to 0 mg n g vss h fig 1 suggesting the inhibition of nitrate reduction under high sulfide stress at the higher sulfide concentrations 200 mg tds l nitrate reduction was the rate limiting step and it was not observed the inhibition trend caused by nitrite or free nitrous acid fna as no nitrite was detected in the relevant batch tests the s n ratios were about 1 7 3 0 3 3 and 5 0 g s g n in the batch reactors with initial sulfide concentrations of 50 90 100 and 150 mg tds l respectively which were higher than the theoretical stoichiometric s n ratio of 1 4 g s g n for complete nitrate denitrification no3 to n2 lu et al 2012 so the accumulation of nitrite at dissolved sulfide concentration of below 200 mg tds l was unlikely caused by sulfide electron donor limitation as excess sulfide was supplied in the batch reactors except the one with initial sulfide concentration of 30 mg tds l the accumulation of nitrite was most likely associated with a higher sensitivity and lower sulfide affinity for nitrite reductase compared to nitrate reductase at low sulfide concentrations 200 mg tds l percheron et al 1998 in summary the optimal sulfide concentration for denitrification in this study i e 200 mg tds l was similar with the previously reported values about 200 300 mg tds l for thiobacillus dominant systems wang et al 2005 cardoso et al 2006 the sulfide oxidation rate however was not apparently inhibited by dissolved sulfide even at very high levels of dissolved sulfide concentrations i e 1 000 1300 and 1600 mg tds l as shown in fig 1 the maximum sulfide oxidation rate 100 3 mg tds g vss h was achieved at the dissolved sulfide concentration of 1000 mg tds l and was about 2 6 fold of that measured at 100 mg tds l fitting of a simple monod equation yielded the kinetic constants r max maximum substrate utilization rate and k s substrate half saturation coefficient of 119 9 40 5 mg tds g vss h pr t 0 0003 and 216 0 23 2 mg tds l pr t 0 0078 respectively it indicates that within the potential dissolved sulfide concentration range generally below 200 mg tds l experienced in wastewater treatment systems higher dissolved sulfide concentrations stimulate rather than inhibit the biological sulfide oxidation by sob sludge however when the dissolved sulfide concentration was above 200 mg tds l both reduction efficiencies of nitrate no3 to no2 and denitrification no3 to n2 were significantly inhibited thus it is important to find out what will be the electron acceptor in biochemical redox reaction while oxidizing the sulfide and inhibiting the nitrate reduction and autotrophic denitrification sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr a membrane bound flavoprotein is a key enzyme secreted by sob for promoting sulfide oxidation theissen et al 2003 in chemolithotrophic anaerobic metabolism fumarate inside the cell could serve as the terminal electron acceptor of sqr in vivo for sulfide oxidation even if bulk liquid electron acceptors are limited at high sulfide concentration tielens et al 2002 therefore it is possible that sqr unlike the nitrate reductase continues to be active even at extremely high dissolved sulfide concentration and explains why the biological sulfide oxidation rate increased with increasing sulfide concentration this was also occurred in jing et al 2008 that the inhibitory sulfide concentration for sulfide oxidation was higher than 1000 mg tds l with enriched sob sludge in an upflow reactor for synthetic wastewater treatment 3 2 transient inhibition and resilience of sob activity under short term sulfide stress as shown in fig 1 the role of dissolve sulfide on sob driven autotrophic denitrification apparently transited from stimulation below 200 mg tds l to inhibition above 200 mg tds l while subjecting to short term sulfide stress but is the inhibition on autotrophic denitrification caused by sulfide under above 200 mg tds l recoverable or irreversible the resilience of sob activity after exposure to three dissolved sulfide concentrations e g 300 500 and 1000 mg tds l was investigated in batch tests ii and the results are shown in fig 2 the autotrophic denitrification rate of the sludge fully recovered in all tests with no statistically significant decrease between conditions prior to inhibition and after recovery table s7 the results suggest that the inhibition of sulfide to sob sludge for denitrification was reversible i e it is transient inhibition previous studies also demonstrated the inhibitory effects of dissolved sulfide on a broad range of microbial metabolism for example cardoso et al 2006 reported that the dissolved sulfide at a concentration of 240 mg tds l or above at ph 7 0 could inhibit nitrate reduction by a chemolithotrophic denitrifying enriched culture but no further indicating the resilience of this inhibition or the underlying mechanism the sulfide inhibition on anammox bacteria ammonia oxidizers and nitrite reducers could be caused by much lower dissolved sulfide concentrations i e 0 5 4 0 mg tds l and it was reversible merely at a low critical value of sulfide concentration in all studies jin et al 2013 ortiz et al 2013 but in this study it is the first time to point out the transient inhibition of sulfide on sob activity and its complete resilience after short term sulfide stress under high sulfide concentrations of 300 500 and 1000 mg tds l one mechanism for the good resilience of sob activity after transient inhibition of sulfide could be the reversible binding of sulfide and heme cofactor of essential cytochromes cytochrome c oxidase nitrate reductase etc involved in proton pumping for atp generation in the cell moura 2014 kabil and banerjee 2010 one reason for the lack of inhibition during sulfide oxidation on the other hand could be the fes rather than heme as a key cofactor of fumarate reductase thony meyer 1997 and the fumarate rather than nitrate can serve as the electron acceptor while autotrophic denitrification is significantly inhibited or nitrate availability is limited even at extremely high dissolved sulfide concentration tielens et al 2002 this study mainly focuses on the sob resilience under short term 5 h of reaction time exposure to dissolve sulfide because the hydraulic retention time hrt in the sob driven autotrophic denitrification reactor mother reactor as shown in fig s1 in si is merely about 5 h as indicated in our previous work yang et al 2016 the sob resilience under long term exposure to dissolved sulfide may be different from short term exposure and will be further investigate in the future study 3 3 effect of dissolved sulfide on microbial viability of sob the good resilience of sob activity after short term exposure to high sulfide levels 300 500 and 1000 mg tds l could be attributed to transient inhibition e g the reversible binding of sulfide and heme cofactor of essential cytochromes and or to rapid proliferation of new cells after short term sulfide stress so the percentages of live and dead bacterial cells were detected by fluorescent staining and flow cytometer fcm to confirm whether proliferation of new cells or not after inactivation of sob sludge suspension with 70 ethyl alcohol solution for 5 h sufficient time for killing most of sob cells and 96 6 of sob cells lysis the dead bacterial cells sample was used to calibrate the flow cytometer and to differentiate the fluorescent signals of live dead cells fig 3 a the live dead microbes were distinguished in plots of fluorescence versus side scatter for blank sample i e sob sludge with no sulfide addition fig 3b sob sludge treated by 200 mg tds l the optimal level for sob activity fig 3c and sob sludge treated by 1000 mg tds l fig 3d fig 3e summarized the percentages of live bacterial cells in sob sludge treated by 0 100 200 300 500 and 1000 mg tds l of dissolved sulfide for 5 h respectively the percentage of live bacterial cells increased by 1 7 at 200 mg tds l compared to the blank sample 0 mg tds l but only decreased by 2 4 at 1000 mg tds l and there was no statistically significant change of percentage of live bacterial cells between blank sample 0 mg tds l and sob sludge treated by other sulfide concentrations 100 200 300 500 and 1000 mg tds l see anova analysis in table s8 indicating that the sob microbes were highly resistant to sulfide and its metabolism was possibly temporarily inhibited rather than irreversibly damaged such as cell lysis thus the resilience of sob activity for denitrification could only be attributed to restoration of the live cells after short term exposure to high levels of dissolved sulfide such as 300 500 and 1000 mg tds l rather than the proliferation of new cells it is quite different from the heterotrophic denitrifiers which cease growth and lyse i e die because of enzymes inactivation while they were subjected to 200 mg tds l of dissolved sulfide for merely 30 min leta et al 2004 in this study we elucidate the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of dissolved sulfide on sob activity with the sulfide concentration of 200 mg tds l as the boundary condition and the good resilience of sob activity on denitrification because of thorough restoration of live cells while decreasing sulfide concentration although we cannot exactly know the mechanism of dissolved sulfide on sob driven autotrophic denitrification at the cellular or enzymatic level through this study the following explanation best describes the possible mechanism of dissolved sulfide on sob activity under short term sulfide stress when the dissolved sulfide concentration is below 200 mg tds l boundary condition the autotrophic denitrification reaction no3 to n2 constitutes a continuous and complete oxidation of sulfide to non toxic sulfate schutz et al 1999 griesbeck et al 2000 guo et al 2016 under such circumstance the sob microbes operate with high activity on autotrophic denitrification based on the availability of substrate electron donor i e dissolved sulfide so the higher sulfide concentration was supplied the higher autotrophic denitrification rate was achieved however beyond 200 mg tds l of dissolved sulfide concentration in this study the sulfide would bind with metal cofactors of nitrate reductase and cause transient inhibition of denitrification activity moura 2014 kabil and banerjee 2010 in this case the sob microbes could utilize an alternative pathway of electron transport that are not blocked by sulfide inhibition lloyd 2006 such as oxidizing sulfide to non toxic sulfate with sqr and reducing fumarate alternative electron acceptor with fumarate reductase tielens et al 2002 handley et al 2014 keller et al 2015 however the high concentrations of dissolved sulfide above 200 mg tds l caused no significant lethality cell lysis so that the sob activity on autotrophic denitrification can be quickly recovered while decreasing sulfide concentration to 200 mg tds l boundary condition as extensively reported by previous work dissolved sulfide is an undesirable compound in wastewater influent that can significantly inhibit n2o reduction by binding with the metal cofactor of n2o reductase during heterotrophic denitrification pan et al 2013 pauleta et al 2013 however dissolved sulfide below 200 mg tds l stimulates rather than inhibits the autotrophic denitrification process by sob sludge as reported in this study therefore the influent s n mass ratio could be designed for improving sob driven autotrophic denitrification and simultaneously achieving the highest denitrification rate and the lowest accumulation and emission of n2o in the engineered sulfur mediated biological wastewater treatment such as sani process yang et al 2016 4 conclusions this study elucidated the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of dissolved sulfide on sob activity for autotrophic denitrification with the boundary condition of 200 mg tds l under short term sulfide stress from 0 to 1600 mg tds l dissolved sulfide was stimulatory up to 200 mg tds l with a maximum denitrification no3 to n2 rate of 9 4 mg n g vss h while beyond 200 mg tds l the nitrate reduction no3 to no2 was significantly inhibited and became the rate limiting step according to edwards and aibi inhibition models which was possibly caused by the reaction of dissolved sulfide and metal cofactors of nitrate reductase but the biological sulfide oxidation followed the monod equation with no obvious inhibition and a maximum oxidation rate of 100 3 mg tds g vss l at an extremely high sulfide stress of 1000 mg tds l the sob activity on autotrophic denitrification can be well recovered after decreasing the sulfide concentration to 200 mg tds l boundary condition which could be attributed good restoration of the live cells of sob microbes rather than cells proliferation as no significant lethality cell lysis effect on sob microbes was found by the flow cytometer analysis author s contribution hui lu

and technology hong kong china corresponding author autotrophic denitrification has been widely studied for odor mitigation corrosion control and nitrogen removal in recent years this paper examines the response of sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob driven autotrophic denitrification under short term stress of dissolved sulfide a series of batch tests were conducted to investigate the effect of different sulfide concentrations 0 1600 mg total dissolved sulfide tds l on autotrophic denitrification and sulfide oxidation by sob enriched sludge our results show that autotrophic denitrification no3 to n2 was stimulated up to 200 mg tds l with a maximum denitrification rate of 9 4 mg n g volatile suspended solids vss h and the nitrite reduction was a rate limiting step when sulfide concentration was higher than 200 mg tds l it inhibited nitrate reductase and nitrate reduction became the rate limiting step according to edwards and aiba inhibition models sulfide oxidation however was not inhibited and the maximum rate of 100 3 mg tds g vss h was obtained at sulfide concentration of 1000 mg tds l it is important to point out that the transient inhibition on autotrophic denitrification caused by high sulfide stress was resilient and non lethal with no significant changes in cell viability even under sulfide concentration of 1000 mg tds l this study reveals the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of dissolved sulfide on sob driven autotrophic denitrification and its possible underlying mechanism with discussion on engineering implications graphical abstract image 1 keywords autotrophic denitrification biological sulfide oxidation sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob dissolved sulfide 1 introduction autotrophic denitrification by sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob using inorganic carbon as a carbon source and removing the reduced sulfur compounds sulfide sulfur thiosulfate and nitrogen nitrate and nitrite simultaneously has been observed in a number of natural and engineered eco system am et al 2005 wang et al 2005 cardoso et al 2006 manconi et al 2007 lu et al 2012 pokorna and zabranska 2015 this sob driven autotrophic denitrification could be employed to remediate groundwater with low concentration of nitrate sierra alvarez et al 2007 and to remove toxic and corrosive sulfide from gas stream hirai et al 1990 or water stream of sulfur laden industries gu et al 2004 tanaka et al 2007 recently this process has also been applied for engineered saline sewage treatment in a full scale demonstration in hong kong which reduced 70 biological sludge production 30 energy consumption and 30 greenhouse gas emission in comparison with the local conventional activated sludge process wu et al 2016 for wastewater treatment sob driven autotrophic denitrification utilizes dissolved sulfide as an electron donor enabling high rate low cost autotrophic nitrogen removal read daily et al 2011 xu et al 2014 several studies reported that dissolved sulfide especially unionized form h2s inhibited the activities of nitrifying heterotrophic denitrifying and anammox bacteria even at very low concentrations of 0 5 4 0 mg total dissolved sulfide tds l tds h2s hs s2 erguder et al 2008 zhou et al 2014 pan et al 2013 jin et al 2013 it could be explained as free sulfide h2s diffuses through the microbial cell membrane thereby denaturing the native proteins moosa and harrison 2006 chen et al 2008 and or inactivating the critical oxidase mediated respiration of cytochromes bagarinao 1992 lloyd 2006 bouillaud and blachier 2011 however there are contradictory reports with respect to the influence of dissolved sulfide on sob driven autotrophic denitrification utilizing sulfide as an electron donor for instance cardoso et al 2006 reported the failure of sob driven autotrophic denitrification in an up flow anaerobic sludge bed at an influent sulfide concentration of 320 mg tds l at ph of 7 0 and sludge loading rate of 6 7 mg tds g volatile suspended solids vss h whereas the maximum sulfide oxidation and autotrophic denitrification rates were achieved in a stirred bioreactor continuously fed with 480 mg tds l at ph 6 8 7 2 and sulfide loading rate of 52 0 mg tds g vss h in an et al 2010 recently a long term laboratory scale study using sob sludge demonstrated that the dissolved sulfide could effectively mitigate the electron competition among nitrate nitrite and n2o reductases and the n2o accumulation can be significantly decreased while increasing influent sulfur to nitrogen s n ratios from 3 0 to 5 0 g s g n in sob driven autotrophic denitrification at dissolved sulfide concentration up to 150 mg s l yang et al 2016 to date most studies focused on the impact of dissolved sulfide on the removals of nitrogen and sulfide within a limited range of sulfide concentrations 0 500 mg tds l and without detailed investigations on the underlying inhibition mechanism and kinetics thus the overarching goal of this study was to examine the role of sulfide on sob driven autotrophic denitrification and its possible underlying mechanism within a wide range of dissolved sulfide concentrations a series of well designed batch studies were conducted to 1 examine the influence of bulk liquid dissolved sulfide concentrations from 0 to 1600 mg tds l on autotrophic denitrification and biological sulfide oxidation by sob enriched sludge 2 evaluate the resilience of activity of autotrophic denitrifiers sob against short term exposure to different sulfide concentrations and 3 identify the effect of dissolved sulfide on microbial viability of sob and explore the possible mechanism of dissolved sulfide on the activity of sob 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum the experiments were carried out using an enriched and fully acclimatized sob sludge obtained from a laboratory scale up flow anoxic sludge reactor mother reactor as shown in fig s1 in the supplementary information si the reactor with working volume of 30 l was initially seeded with waste activated sludge obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant in guangzhou china that employs the a a o process and fed with synthetic wastewater composition in table s1 and operation conditions in table s2 in si the mother reactor was continuously operated for approximately 300 days with stable performance see table s3 the volatile suspended solids vss concentration of the reactor was about 6 9 0 1 g l with specific denitrification rate of 56 5 1 1 mg n g vss h pyrosequencing results suggest that the major population in the sludge about 65 of retrieved sequences are thiobacillus sp and sulfurimonas sp table 1 and fig s2 and members of this order can carry out complete autotrophic denitrification with sulfide as an electron donor beller et al 2006 sievert et al 2008 details of pyrosequencing methodology can be referred to our previous paper yang et al 2016 afterwards the sob sludge was fully acclimatized and ready for the following batch experiments 2 2 batch tests a series of batch tests batch tests i were conducted in the 250 ml conical flasks to evaluate the effects of dissolved sulfide on autotrophic denitrification and sulfide oxidation by sob in each batch test the sob sludge was withdrawn from the mother reactor fig s1 in si concentrated by centrifugation at 4500 g for 3 min and washed three times with oxygen free milli q water about 0 5 g of the centrifuged and washed sob sludge was re inoculated into a 250 ml conical flask with 150 ml of synthetic medium and the final vss concentration was approximately 3 3 g l in each flask the synthetic sulfide solutions were supplemented with macro and micro nutrients 216 mg l kno3 30 mg no3 n l 2 0 g l kh2po4 2 0 g l nahco3 and 0 2 g l mgcl2 they contained dissolved sulfide of 0 30 50 90 100 150 200 250 300 400 500 700 1 000 1300 and 1600 mg tds l total 15 different tds concentrations prepared using na2s 9h2o causing s n ratios of 0 1 0 1 7 3 0 3 3 5 0 6 7 8 3 10

mixed liquor samples were taken for nitrate nitrite sulfide thiosulfate and sulfate analysis at the beginning and end of batch test the ph value was also monitored during the experiment and it increased only slightly 0 2 unit during the tests the vss concentration of the mixed liquor was also measured at the end of batch test the control tests with inoculum and nutrient solution but no dissolved sulfide or nitrate were also carried out under the same experimental conditions at the end of batch test the sludge samples were taken from each flask to analyze the cell viability via fluorescent staining as described in section 2 3 the h2s and hs concentrations were determined based on the following relationship h2s tds 1 10ph pk1 1 where pk1 value is 6 97 at 25 c pk1 2 151 1437 t where t is in kelvin broderius and smith 1977 at ph 7 0 h2s and hs are the predominant species and s2 is negligible 0 001 of the tds a series of inhibition kinetic models were used for fitting the observed experimental data see tables s4 s5 and s6 in si and compared using r software and the nls function de micheaux et al 2014 another set of batch tests batch tests ii were conducted to examine the resiliency of sob sludge for autotrophic denitrification following the dissolved sulfide inhibition it involved three successive steps step i was aimed at obtaining the best microbial activity of sob sludge about 0 5 g of sob sludge as vss from the mother reactor was added into each 250 ml conical flask total three flasks with 150 ml synthetic medium including 200 mg tds l and 30 mg no3 n l and was run for 5 h to obtain the best autotrophic denitrification rate as indicated in batch tests i bt i the sludge sample in each flask was then separately centrifuged at 4500 g and washed three times with oxygen free milli q water step ii was aimed at evaluating the sulfide inhibition on sob activity the sludge samples totally three from three flasks treated in step i were further separately resuspended in three 250 ml conical flasks with synthetic medium containing 30 mg no3 n l in each and dissolved sulfide of 300 500 or 1000 mg tds l respectively each flask was gently mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 150 rpm for 5 h to evaluate the sulfide inhibition on sob finally in step iii the resiliency of sob activity for autotrophic denitrification was examined the centrifuged at 4500 g and washed sludge samples totally three from three flasks from step ii were separately resuspended again in three 250 ml conical flasks with synthetic medium containing 200 mg tds l and 30 mg no3 n l solutions in each and each flask was run for 5 h to evaluate the resiliency of sob activity for autotrophic denitrification the same synthetic medium and operating conditions as in batch tests i were used except the dissolved sulfide and the vss concentrations in each conical flask vss concentration was controlled at about 3 0 g l mixed liquor samples were taken from each flask for nitrate nitrite dissolved sulfide thiosulfate sulfate and vss analysis before and after each step in all the batch tests three flasks were operated in parallel for each dissolved sulfide concentration at room temperature 25 2 c 2 3 fluorescent staining and flow cytometry fcm two nucleic acid stains green fluorescent syto 9 dye and red fluorescent propidium iodide pi were used in combination as a viability indicator that differentiates cells with intact or damaged cytoplasmic membranes berney et al 2007 the live dead baclight bacterial viability and counting kit l34856 molecular probes usa were used for the analysis as per the manufacturer s guidelines the staining stock solution consisting of syto 9 nucleic acid stain 3 34 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and pi 20 mm in dmso was diluted 500 times and the microsphere standard was diluted 100 times the staining solution was then stored at 20 c and protected from light until further use sludge samples 1 ml each from the conical flask were transferred into 2 ml plastic centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 3 min to pelletize the cells the supernatant was discarded and sludge samples were resuspended in 0 85 nacl solution for incubation under dark condition at room temperature for an hour the incubated sludge suspension samples were dispersed by sonication at 40 w for 1 min which was sufficient for dispersion without impacting cell viability sébastien et al 2002 sonicated sludge samples were then filtered through an 8 μm membrane filter to separate bacterial cells from the bigger aggregates and 10 μl of sample was stained with 990 μl of staining solution prior to flow cytometry analysis the stained samples were incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature flow cytometry measurements were performed using beckman coulter flow cytometer cytomic tm fc 500 usa equipped with a blue 25 mw solid state laser emitting light at a fixed wavelength of 488 nm both syto 9 and pi fluorescence were excited by the 488 nm laser and collected through a 527 30 nm band pass or a 630 nm long pass filter respectively wang et al 2010 all samples were collected as logarithmic signals and were triggered on the green and red fluorescence channels for each sample run data for 30 000 events were collected all analyses were conducted in triplicates and the patterns were reproducible 2 4 sampling and analytical methods mixed liquor samples were taken using a syringe and immediately filtered through disposable millipore filter units 0 45 μm pore size for the analysis of nitrate nitrite ammonium sulfide thiosulfate and sulfate the suspended solids ss and vss concentrations in each flask were determined as per the standard methods apha 2005 nitrate nitrite thiosulfate sulfate and ammonium nitrogen were analyzed using ion chromatography equipped with a conductivity detector and an ic as23 anion or ic cs12a cation analytical column ics 900 dionex usa dissolved sulfide was measured with the methylene blue method apha 2005 while ph and temperature were monitored with a portable ph meter mettler toledo fg2 fk switzerland 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of dissolved sulfide on sob activity under short term sulfide stress the effect of dissolved sulfide on sob activity for autotrophic denitrification and biological sulfide oxidation was investigated in a series of batch experiments batch tests i in a very broad range of dissolved sulfide concentrations 0 1600 mg tds l the n2o intermediate of nitrate denitrification was not analyzed in this study because n2o accumulation and release was very little while the s n ratio was close to or higher than 2 0 g s g n as investigated in our previous study yang et al 2016 therefore in this study the autotrophic denitrification or simply denitrification is regarded as the complete nitrogen conversion from nitrate no3 to dinitrogen n2 mainly including two steps nitrate reduction the first step no3 no2 and nitrite reduction the second step no2 n2 and the nitrate reduction is merely the first step of denitrification i e no3 no2 the specific nitrate reduction no3 to no2 autotrophic denitrification no3 to n2 and sulfide oxidation dissolved sulfide to so4 2 rates are presented in fig 1 a variety of substrate inhibition models were examined to fit the obtained data as shown in fig 1 more details in tables s4 s5 and s6 in si the inhibition models proposed by edwards 1970 and aiba et al 1968 showed a better fit and realistic biokinetic constants in both cases the residual standard error was significantly lower when fitted to nitrate reduction only no3 to no2 than for autotrophic denitrification no3 to n2 indicating the greater sulfide sensitivity to the nitrate reductase moraes et al 2012 the fitted parameters for the edwards model gave the lowest residual error 0 8265 as shown in table 2 the biomass specific denitrification rate was strongly dependent on initial dissolved sulfide concentration and it increased rapidly reaching a maximum rate of 9 4 mg n g vss h at 200 mg tds l as shown in fig 1 dolejs et al 2015 also reported an increase in denitrification rate from 1 1 to 5 9 mg n g vss h when the dissolved sulfide was increased from 30 to 55 mg tds l in this study nitrite accumulation was detected the nitrite concentrations in batch reactors with initial sulfide concentrations of 30 50 90 100 and 150 mg tds l were 1 5 3 3 3 6 4 3 and 5 1 mg n l respectively but no nitrite was detected in the batch reactors with initial sulfide concentrations above 200 mg tds l data not shown the region between nitrate reduction and denitrification curves in fig 1 also implies that the nitrite reduction was the rate limiting step below 200 mg tds l of dissolved sulfide concentration in this study at sulfide level above 200 mg tds l specific autotrophic denitrification no3 to n2 rate was equal to specific nitrate reduction no3 to no2 rate and declined from 9 4 mg n g vss h to 0 mg n g vss h fig 1 suggesting the inhibition of nitrate reduction under high sulfide stress at the higher sulfide concentrations 200 mg tds l nitrate reduction was the rate limiting step and it was not observed the inhibition trend caused by nitrite or free nitrous acid fna as no nitrite was detected in the relevant batch tests the s n ratios were about 1 7 3 0 3 3 and 5 0 g s g n in the batch reactors with initial sulfide concentrations of 50 90 100 and 150 mg tds l respectively which were higher than the theoretical stoichiometric s n ratio of 1 4 g s g n for complete nitrate denitrification no3 to n2 lu et al 2012 so the accumulation of nitrite at dissolved sulfide concentration of below 200 mg tds l was unlikely caused by sulfide electron donor limitation as excess sulfide was supplied in the batch reactors except the one with initial sulfide concentration of 30 mg tds l the accumulation of nitrite was most likely associated with a higher sensitivity and lower sulfide affinity for nitrite reductase compared to nitrate reductase at low sulfide concentrations 200 mg tds l percheron et al 1998 in summary the optimal sulfide concentration for denitrification in this study i e 200 mg tds l was similar with the previously reported values about 200 300 mg tds l for thiobacillus dominant systems wang et al 2005 cardoso et al 2006 the sulfide oxidation rate however was not apparently inhibited by dissolved sulfide even at very high levels of dissolved sulfide concentrations i e 1 000 1300 and 1600 mg tds l as shown in fig 1 the maximum sulfide oxidation rate 100 3 mg tds g vss h was achieved at the dissolved sulfide concentration of 1000 mg tds l and was about 2 6 fold of that measured at 100 mg tds l fitting of a simple monod equation yielded the kinetic constants r max maximum substrate utilization rate and k s substrate half saturation coefficient of 119 9 40 5 mg tds g vss h pr t 0 0003 and 216 0 23 2 mg tds l pr t 0 0078 respectively it indicates that within the potential dissolved sulfide concentration range generally below 200 mg tds l experienced in wastewater treatment systems higher dissolved sulfide concentrations stimulate rather than inhibit the biological sulfide oxidation by sob sludge however when the dissolved sulfide concentration was above 200 mg tds l both reduction efficiencies of nitrate no3 to no2 and denitrification no3 to n2 were significantly inhibited thus it is important to find out what will be the electron acceptor in biochemical redox reaction while oxidizing the sulfide and inhibiting the nitrate reduction and autotrophic denitrification sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr a membrane bound flavoprotein is a key enzyme secreted by sob for promoting sulfide oxidation theissen et al 2003 in chemolithotrophic anaerobic metabolism fumarate inside the cell could serve as the terminal electron acceptor of sqr in vivo for sulfide oxidation even if bulk liquid electron acceptors are limited at high sulfide concentration tielens et al 2002 therefore it is possible that sqr unlike the nitrate reductase continues to be active even at extremely high dissolved sulfide concentration and explains why the biological sulfide oxidation rate increased with increasing sulfide concentration this was also occurred in jing et al 2008 that the inhibitory sulfide concentration for sulfide oxidation was higher than 1000 mg tds l with enriched sob sludge in an upflow reactor for synthetic wastewater treatment 3 2 transient inhibition and resilience of sob activity under short term sulfide stress as shown in fig 1 the role of dissolve sulfide on sob driven autotrophic denitrification apparently transited from stimulation below 200 mg tds l to inhibition above 200 mg tds l while subjecting to short term sulfide stress but is the inhibition on autotrophic denitrification caused by sulfide under above 200 mg tds l recoverable or irreversible the resilience of sob activity after exposure to three dissolved sulfide concentrations e g 300 500 and 1000 mg tds l was investigated in batch tests ii and the results are shown in fig 2 the autotrophic denitrification rate of the sludge fully recovered in all tests with no statistically significant decrease between conditions prior to inhibition and after recovery table s7 the results suggest that the inhibition of sulfide to sob sludge for denitrification was reversible i e it is transient inhibition previous studies also demonstrated the inhibitory effects of dissolved sulfide on a broad range of microbial metabolism for example cardoso et al 2006 reported that the dissolved sulfide at a concentration of 240 mg tds l or above at ph 7 0 could inhibit nitrate reduction by a chemolithotrophic denitrifying enriched culture but no further indicating the resilience of this inhibition or the underlying mechanism the sulfide inhibition on anammox bacteria ammonia oxidizers and nitrite reducers could be caused by much lower dissolved sulfide concentrations i e 0 5 4 0 mg tds l and it was reversible merely at a low critical value of sulfide concentration in all studies jin et al 2013 ortiz et al 2013 but in this study it is the first time to point out the transient inhibition of sulfide on sob activity and its complete resilience after short term sulfide stress under high sulfide concentrations of 300 500 and 1000 mg tds l one mechanism for the good resilience of sob activity after transient inhibition of sulfide could be the reversible binding of sulfide and heme cofactor of essential cytochromes cytochrome c oxidase nitrate reductase etc involved in proton pumping for atp generation in the cell moura 2014 kabil and banerjee 2010 one reason for the lack of inhibition during sulfide oxidation on the other hand could be the fes rather than heme as a key cofactor of fumarate reductase thony meyer 1997 and the fumarate rather than nitrate can serve as the electron acceptor while autotrophic denitrification is significantly inhibited or nitrate availability is limited even at extremely high dissolved sulfide concentration tielens et al 2002 this study mainly focuses on the sob resilience under short term 5 h of reaction time exposure to dissolve sulfide because the hydraulic retention time hrt in the sob driven autotrophic denitrification reactor mother reactor as shown in fig s1 in si is merely about 5 h as indicated in our previous work yang et al 2016 the sob resilience under long term exposure to dissolved sulfide may be different from short term exposure and will be further investigate in the future study 3 3 effect of dissolved sulfide on microbial viability of sob the good resilience of sob activity after short term exposure to high sulfide levels 300 500 and 1000 mg tds l could be attributed to transient inhibition e g the reversible binding of sulfide and heme cofactor of essential cytochromes and or to rapid proliferation of new cells after short term sulfide stress so the percentages of live and dead bacterial cells were detected by fluorescent staining and flow cytometer fcm to confirm whether proliferation of new cells or not after inactivation of sob sludge suspension with 70 ethyl alcohol solution for 5 h sufficient time for killing most of sob cells and 96 6 of sob cells lysis the dead bacterial cells sample was used to calibrate the flow cytometer and to differentiate the fluorescent signals of live dead cells fig 3 a the live dead microbes were distinguished in plots of fluorescence versus side scatter for blank sample i e sob sludge with no sulfide addition fig 3b sob sludge treated by 200 mg tds l the optimal level for sob activity fig 3c and sob sludge treated by 1000 mg tds l fig 3d fig 3e summarized the percentages of live bacterial cells in sob sludge treated by 0 100 200 300 500 and 1000 mg tds l of dissolved sulfide for 5 h respectively the percentage of live bacterial cells increased by 1 7 at 200 mg tds l compared to the blank sample 0 mg tds l but only decreased by 2 4 at 1000 mg tds l and there was no statistically significant change of percentage of live bacterial cells between blank sample 0 mg tds l and sob sludge treated by other sulfide concentrations 100 200 300 500 and 1000 mg tds l see anova analysis in table s8 indicating that the sob microbes were highly resistant to sulfide and its metabolism was possibly temporarily inhibited rather than irreversibly damaged such as cell lysis thus the resilience of sob activity for denitrification could only be attributed to restoration of the live cells after short term exposure to high levels of dissolved sulfide such as 300 500 and 1000 mg tds l rather than the proliferation of new cells it is quite different from the heterotrophic denitrifiers which cease growth and lyse i e die because of enzymes inactivation while they were subjected to 200 mg tds l of dissolved sulfide for merely 30 min leta et al 2004 in this study we elucidate the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of dissolved sulfide on sob activity with the sulfide concentration of 200 mg tds l as the boundary condition and the good resilience of sob activity on denitrification because of thorough restoration of live cells while decreasing sulfide concentration although we cannot exactly know the mechanism of dissolved sulfide on sob driven autotrophic denitrification at the cellular or enzymatic level through this study the following explanation best describes the possible mechanism of dissolved sulfide on sob activity under short term sulfide stress when the dissolved sulfide concentration is below 200 mg tds l boundary condition the autotrophic denitrification reaction no3 to n2 constitutes a continuous and complete oxidation of sulfide to non toxic sulfate schutz et al 1999 griesbeck et al 2000 guo et al 2016 under such circumstance the sob microbes operate with high activity on autotrophic denitrification based on the availability of substrate electron donor i e dissolved sulfide so the higher sulfide concentration was supplied the higher autotrophic denitrification rate was achieved however beyond 200 mg tds l of dissolved sulfide concentration in this study the sulfide would bind with metal cofactors of nitrate reductase and cause transient inhibition of denitrification activity moura 2014 kabil and banerjee 2010 in this case the sob microbes could utilize an alternative pathway of electron transport that are not blocked by sulfide inhibition lloyd 2006 such as oxidizing sulfide to non toxic sulfate with sqr and reducing fumarate alternative electron acceptor with fumarate reductase tielens et al 2002 handley et al 2014 keller et al 2015 however the high concentrations of dissolved sulfide above 200 mg tds l caused no significant lethality cell lysis so that the sob activity on autotrophic denitrification can be quickly recovered while decreasing sulfide concentration to 200 mg tds l boundary condition as extensively reported by previous work dissolved sulfide is an undesirable compound in wastewater influent that can significantly inhibit n2o reduction by binding with the metal cofactor of n2o reductase during heterotrophic denitrification pan et al 2013 pauleta et al 2013 however dissolved sulfide below 200 mg tds l stimulates rather than inhibits the autotrophic denitrification process by sob sludge as reported in this study therefore the influent s n mass ratio could be designed for improving sob driven autotrophic denitrification and simultaneously achieving the highest denitrification rate and the lowest accumulation and emission of n2o in the engineered sulfur mediated biological wastewater treatment such as sani process yang et al 2016 4 conclusions this study elucidated the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of dissolved sulfide on sob activity for autotrophic denitrification with the boundary condition of 200 mg tds l under short term sulfide stress from 0 to 1600 mg tds l dissolved sulfide was stimulatory up to 200 mg tds l with a maximum denitrification no3 to n2 rate of 9 4 mg n g vss h while beyond 200 mg tds l the nitrate reduction no3 to no2 was significantly inhibited and became the rate limiting step according to edwards and aibi inhibition models which was possibly caused by the reaction of dissolved sulfide and metal cofactors of nitrate reductase but the biological sulfide oxidation followed the monod equation with no obvious inhibition and a maximum oxidation rate of 100 3 mg tds g vss l at an extremely high sulfide stress of 1000 mg tds l the sob activity on autotrophic denitrification can be well recovered after decreasing the sulfide concentration to 200 mg tds l boundary condition which could be attributed good restoration of the live cells of sob microbes rather than cells proliferation as no significant lethality cell lysis effect on sob microbes was found by the flow cytometer analysis author s contribution hui lu

19729,although the removal of se vi from water by using zero valent iron zvi is a promising method passivation of zvi severely inhibits its performance to overcome such issue we proposed an efficient technique to enhance se vi removal via pre corrosion of zvi with h2o2 hcl in a short time 15 min the resultant pczvi suspension was weakly acidic ph 4 56 and contained abundant aqueous fe2 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy showed that pczvi mainly consisted of fe0 66 2 hydrated ferric oxide 26 3 and fe3o4 7 5 efficient removal of se vi from sulfate rich solution was achieved by pczvi compared with zvi in the absence and presence of h2o2 and acid pretreated zvi moreover the efficient removal of se vi by pczvi sustained over a broad ph range 3 9 due to its strong buffering power the presence of chloride carbonate nitrate and common cations na k ca2 and mg2 posed negligible influence on the removal of se vi by pczvi while the inhibitory effect induced by sulfate silicate and phosphate indicated the significance of se vi adsorption as a prerequisite step for its removal the consumption of aqueous fe2 was associated with se vi removal and x ray absorption near edge structure revealed that the main pathway for se vi removal by pczvi was a stepwise reduction of se vi to se iv and then se0 as the dominant final state 78 2 moreover higher electron selectivity of pczvi was attributed to the enhanced enrichment of se oxyanions prior to their reduction graphical abstract image 1 keywords selenate zvi corrosion hydrogen peroxide adsorption reduction 1 introduction selenium se is a necessary trace nutrient element but elevated level of se would pose serious risks to human and various living organics fairweather tait et al 2011 however certain industrial wastewaters from refining mining and smelting contain high concentrations of se meng et al 2002 hence efficient technologies for removal of se from water are in great demand the predominant species of aqueous se are se vi and se iv santos et al 2015 se iv can be firmly bound to the surface of various metal oxides via inner sphere complexation hayes et al 1987 pan et al 2010 in contrast the interactions of se vi with most metal oxides are predominantly outer sphere complexation yamani et al 2014 which is subject to interference induced by coexisting anions se vi removal from sulfate rich waters is particularly challenging due to the extremely similar chemical structures of seo4 2 and so4 2 nishimura et al 2007 shan et al 2017 thus chemical reduction of se vi into se iv or lower valent state is regarded as an effective strategy for its efficient remove from water tang et al 2014 liang et al 2015 zero valent iron zvi is a well known inexpensive material with moderate reducing power for water decontamination noubactep 2015 and the removal of se vi by zvi was proved to be mainly via reduction and adsorption yoon et al 2011 however the application of zvi technology is significantly restricted by the surface passivation of zvi guan et al 2015 noubactep 2015 thus various techniques including acid washing agrawal and tratnyek 1996 ultrasonication geiger et al 2002 h2 reduction liou et al 2005 microwave remya and lin 2011 nano sized zvi technology comba et al 2011 and weak magnetic field liang et al 2014 2015 have been developed to address this issue however most of the above techniques are far from satisfaction to implement in full scale application due to high cost or the requirement for special facilities noubactep 2015 tang et al 2014 suggests that fe2 plays an important role in the removal of se vi by zvi based on the superior reducing power of surface bound fe ii over aqueous fe ii white and peterson 1996 gorski et al 2016 meanwhile fe ii could rejuvenate lepidocrocite to magnetite of semiconductor nature thus facilitating the electron transfer from the fe0 core to se vi further a hybridized fe0 fe3o4 fe2 system has been employed for efficient removal of se vi compared with the non hybrid or partial hybrid systems tang et al 2016 however a relatively long precondition duration typically 6 h was required for the equilibration among the three components thus it is still imperative to develop more efficient techniques to enhance the removal of se vi by zvi based materials the corrosion process of zvi plays a vital role in its performance for reductive removal of contaminants owing to the formation of reactive corrosion products such as fe ii fe3o4 and h h2 noubactep 2009 2015 xu et al 2012 recently guo et al 2015 suggests that the removal of no3 by zvi could be greatly enhanced via addition of oxidants such as h2o2 kmno4 and cr vi considering h2o2 is an environmentally benign oxidant widely used in industry it has great potential to serve as an activator reagent of zvi for practical application however h2o2 might compete with the contaminant for electron from zvi and therefore decrease the electron efficiency in light of the above studies we anticipated a simple technique to enhance the removal of se vi through pre corrosion of zvi using h2o2 hcl to obtain a hybrid suspension system consisting of fe0 fe2 fe3o4 and other fe hydr oxides thus the objective of this study is to investigate the performance and mechanism of se vi removal by zvi pre corroded by h2o2 hcl pczvi the resultant pczvi was characterized with multiple techniques to identify the active components and the effect of solution chemistry on se vi removal by pczvi was explored the mechanism of se vi removal was elucidated in terms of the role of fe ii and its ph buffer effect the role of fe corrosion products the removal pathway of se vi and the electron selectivity as well 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the powdered zvi of 100 mesh 150 μm particle size bet specific surface area 1 95 m2 g was purchased from aladdin reagent inc shanghai china while na2seo3 and na2seo4 were obtained from xiya reagent co ltd chengdu china stock solutions of se vi were prepared by dissolving na2seo4 in ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm all other chemicals were analytical grade from sinopharm reagent co ltd shanghai china 2 2 preparation of pczvi suspension the pczvi suspension was prepared in a 50 ml centrifuge by dosing 1 20 g zvi powder and preset volume of 30 wt h2o2 solution into 20 ml 0 10 m hcl solution the centrifuge tube was sealed and shaken for 30 s after which the lid was opened for once to release the excess pressure subsequently the centrifuge tube was sealed again and installed on a rotisserie rotator for complete mixing at 90 rpm for 15 min the resultant black suspension was denoted by pczvi suspension fig s1 for comparison purpose the parallel pretreatments of zvi only with hcl or h2o2 were performed to prepare the acid pretreated zvi suspension azvi and h2o2 pretreated zvi suspension ozvi to probe their individual roles respectively note that the preparation of pczvi was optimized based on the performance of se vi removal text s1 and fig s2 2 3 removal of se vi by pczvi the freshly prepared pczvi suspension was added into a 500 ml three necked flask containing se vi solution with co existing sulfate at initial ph 7 0 resulting in a final volume of 300 ml initially at 0 253 mm se vi or 20 mg se l and 1000 mg l so4 2 note that the addition of sulfate was aimed to simulate the coexisting anions commonly present in wastewater which is crucial to the performance of se vi removal jegadeesan et al 2005 nishimura et al 2007 with continuous mechanical agitation at 350 rpm aliquots were withdrawn from the solution at preset time intervals followed by immediate filtration through 0 22 μm membrane for the subsequent analysis the effect of initial ph was investigated by adjusting the se vi solution with hcl or naoh into the ph range from 3 to 9 before the addition of pczvi suspension moreover the evolution of ph was monitored throughout the experiments to investigate the effect of the dissolved oxygen do on se vi removal by pczvi kinetics experiments were performed under different aeration conditions n2 air o2 and no aeration prior to the addition of pczvi the solution was pre purged with the corresponding gas for 30 min respectively during the removal process the solution was continuously purged to maintain a stable do which was measured by a fluorescent electrode gradient concentrations 0 1 10 and 100 mm of common co existing anions cl so4 2 hco3 no3 po4 3 and sio3 2 and cations na k ca2 and mg2 were introduced to the initial se vi solution to explore their influence on the removal process 2 4 characterization and analysis the solid products of pczvi and those after reaction with se vi were separated from the suspension by filtration through 0 22 μm membrane freeze dried and vacuum packed for further characterization the surface area and pore distribution of the solid products were characterized with n2 adsorption desorption nova 3000 quantachrome usa the morphological images were recorded with a scanning electron microscope sem s 3400 ii hitachi japan while the crystalline phases were identified with an x ray diffractometer xrd x tra arl switzerland in order to further investigate the speciation of solid products of pczvi 57fe mössbauer spectra were collected by proportional counter on topologic 500 a spectrometer with 57co rh as radioactive source at room temperature the proportion of fe0 in the different forms of zvi was quantified by acid dissolution of the solid in a specially designed apparatus to collect the generated h2 yang et al 2017 meanwhile the fraction of fe ii in the solid was calculated by deducting that of fe0 from the total fe ii in the aqueous phase se k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectra of the pczvi samples separated at preset time series were recorded to characterize the valence states of immobilized se during the removal process the spectra was collected in fluorescence mode and the data were analyzed with the demeter athena software version 0 9 25 fese se0 powder na2seo3 and na2seo4 were employed as reference materials for se ii se0 se iv and se vi respectively in the linear combination fitting lcf the total concentration of se and fe was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes icap7400 thermo usa while the aqueous se iv was analyzed by an atomic fluorescence spectroscope afs af 610 a rayleigh beijing china the aqueous fe ii concentration was spectrophotometrically determined by the 1 10 phenanthroline method at 510 nm and the residual h2o2 concentration was analyzed according to sellers 1980 the concentration of h2 was analyzed with a gas chromatograph trace 1310 thermo usa with a thermal conductivity detector tcd 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of pczvi the appearance of the as prepared pczvi suspension 20 ml was a black to russet suspension with black sediments fig s1 as an optimized preparation parameter of pczvi text s1 and fig s2 the initial molar ratio of fe0 h2o2 h was 1 0 5 0 093 thus although the initial solution was highly acidic 0 10 m hcl the stoichiometric amount of h was less than 10 of that of fe0 due to the small liquid solid ratio thereby the resultant pczvi suspension was far less acidic ph 4 56 due to the rapid consumption of h by abundant fe0 to generate fe2 with its final concentration of 43 8 mm in the aqueous phase in contrast fe iii which is prone to precipitate at such ph was not detected in the aqueous phase the added h2o2 initially at 536 mm was almost depleted 0 012 mm at 15 min suggesting its direct involvement into the accelerated corrosion of zvi during the preparation the surface roughness of the solid phase of pczvi greatly increased compared with zvi as observed in the sem images fig 1 a b indicating the formation of corrosion products on the surface of zvi during the preparation of pczvi accordingly the bet surface area of the solid phase isolated from pczvi 24 0 m2 g was one order of magnitude larger than that of pristine zvi 1 95 m2 g the xrd pattern of pczvi fig 2 demonstrated that fe3o4 was the only crystalline corrosion product the 57fe mössbauer spectrum of pczvi fig 3 and table s1 reveals that the solid phase consists of mainly three components i e fe0 hydrous ferric oxides hfo and fe3o4 which accounted for 66 2 26 3 and 7 5 of the total fe respectively note that hfo was not detected in the xrd pattern of pczvi due to its poor crystallinity however hfo is a porous oxide with large surface area up to 600 m2 g dzombak and morel 1990 manceau and charlet 1994 and considered as a good adsorbent for various oxyanions including se vi and se iv parida et al 1997 peak and sparks 2002 dixit and hering 2003 which may play an important role during the sequestration of se vi by pczvi in contrast the spectrum of zvi showed the sole phase of fe0 fig s3a although hfo was also present in the solid phase of azvi its proportion 5 7 was much smaller fig s3b and table s1 fe3o4 was not detected in the mössbauer spectrum of azvi possibly because of its low content based on the above analysis the main reactions during the preparation of pczvi are listed in eqs s1 s8 3 2 enhanced removal of se vi by pczvi the performance of se vi removal by pczvi was compared with zvi and other relevant systems fig 4 apparently se vi removal by zvi followed the pseudo zero order kinetic model r 2 0 989 with the rate constant k 0 of 1 6 mg l 1 h 1 whereas that by pczvi was remarkably accelerated following a pseudo first order kinetic model r 2 0 992 with k obs 0 568 h 1 different from the promotional effect via acid washing reported elsewhere agrawal and tratnyek 1996 only 28 of se was removed by azvi in 8 h suggesting that hcl pretreatment did not bring positive effect under the experimental conditions hcl fe 1 10 7 mol mol in contrast the pretreatment with h2o2 ozvi or addition of h2o2 both increased se vi removal to a quite limited extent 7 removal in 8 h therefore the enhancement by pretreatment with hcl and h2o2 was a synergistic process instead of a simple sum of their individual effects in addition although se vi removal by pczvi was faster than other reference systems it was still restricted by the inhibitory effect of sulfate in the sulfate free solution se vi could be lowered from 20 to 0 3 mg l in 20 min fig 4 generally pczvi is a promising reagent for se vi removal from water 3 3 effect of solution chemistry on se vi removal by pczvi 3 3 1 effect of ph effect of initial ph 3 9 on se vi removal by pczvi was investigated fig 5 a as observed the favorable removal of se vi by pczvi 98 as well as the removal kinetics was overlapped at initial ph from 3 to 9 in contrast the removal of se vi by using zvi is generally inhibited under alkaline condition due to unfavorable adsorption and intensified passivation yoon et al 2011 xie et al 2017 the broad ph suitability of pczvi demonstrates its superior potential over zvi for the practical se vi removal from various water matrices such preferable se vi removal by pczvi over a wide ph range was preliminarily probed by monitoring the evolution of ph at different initial phs fig 5b regardless of the initial ph varying from 3 to 9 the solution ph was rapidly within 10 min buffered to and thereafter maintained in a narrow range of 5 2 5 4 which is favorable for se vi removal this is why se vi removal was unaffected by varied phs for the pczvi suspension such amazing buffering capacity of pczvi was originated from both its solid components and the aqueous fe2 at acidic ph0 e g ph 3 most of the aqueous h was consumed by the dissolution and protonation of the corrosion products as for the alkaline ph0 e g ph 9 the buffering effect induced by the pczvi suspension was achieved via the hydrolysis precipitation of fe2 fe3 eqs s6 s10 and the deprotonation of the fe hydr oxides such as hfo and fe3o4 qin et al 2017 also found that the addition of fe2 to the zvi se vi system could quickly stabilize the ph at 6 0 until its depletion indicating the role of fe2 as a ph buffer 3 3 2 effect of do the performance of se vi removal by pczvi was compared at four do levels by continuous aeration with n2 air o2 and no aeration with do concentrations at 2 5 8 9 22 3 and 6 1 mg l respectively as shown in fig 6 se vi removal by pczvi was almost the same under no aeration and continuous aeration with n2 in contrast the removal efficiency was inhibited under continuous aeration with air or o2 previous studies yoon et al 2011 guo et al 2015 suggested that the increase of do within appropriate range would enhance the removal of se vi by zvi whereas reaction under pure o2 results in complete loss of reactivity of zvi murphy 1988 furthermore qin et al 2017 elucidated the coupled effect of fe2 and do on the removal of se vi by zvi the increase of do at appropriate range in the presence of fe2 could enhance the removal of se vi due to the formation of lepidocrocite γ feooh to augment the adsorption of se vi and further increasing do concentrations resulted in a lower capacity of zvi though the utilization ratio of fe0 was increased in our experiment pczvi could provide abundant hfo for se vi se iv adsorption and it is not necessary to conduct air o2 aeration to enhance se vi adsorption via in situ formation of γ feooh on the contrary excess do would compete with se vi se iv for the electron from fe0 to inhibit its electron selectivity moreover fe ii a promoter for the reduction of se vi and the rejuvenation of γ feooh to fe3o4 would be consumed by the excessive o2 collectively se vi removal by pczvi is an operationally uncritical technique performing well under natural do conditions 3 3 3 effect of coexisting ions effects of common anions chloride sulfate carbonate nitrate phosphate and silicate up to 100 mm except for carbonate up to 10 mm in view of its solubility on the removal of se vi by pczvi were explored as depicted in fig 7 se vi was completely 99 9 removed within 1 h in the absence of coexisting ions and the presence of chloride carbonate and nitrate showed negligible effects on the removal in contrast sulfate phosphate and silicate posed inhibitory influence on se vi removal by pczvi phosphate exhibited the most inhibitory effect with se vi removal fully inhibited at 10 mm it is interesting to observe that nitrate up to 100 mm exerted negligible influence because nitrate as an electron acceptor would suppress se vi removal by zvi mondal et al 2004 zhang et al 2005 shan et al 2017 to further elucidate this point the removal of no3 by pczvi was investigated in the absence and presence of se vi although 95 of no3 initially at 1 43 mm could be gradually removed in 8 h by pczvi fig s4 its removal rate was much slower than se vi in 1 h fig 7 moreover at no3 of 100 mm initially its removal by pczvi was negligible thus pczvi is capable of removing se vi preferentially over no3 possibly because the se oxyanions could be preferentially adsorbed by pczvi hfo as a major component over no3 similar to zvi murphy 1988 zhang et al 2005 the presence of sulfate inhibits the removal of se vi by pczvi due to the similar chemistry of seo4 2 and so4 2 as for phosphate and silicate both tend to form inner sphere complexes with fe hydr oxides and thus compete with se vi se iv for adsorption sites su and puls 2001 kohn and roberts 2006 the inhibitory effect induced by sulfate silicate and phosphate demonstrated that adsorption of se vi onto the surface of pczvi was a prerequisite step for its removal the influences of four cations na k ca2 and mg2 on se vi removal by pczvi were similar fig 8 and negligible adverse effects were observed for all the cations up to 10 mm further increase to 100 mm slightly suppressed the removal rate in the initial 2 h according to the calculation from visual minteq 3 1 42 of se vi is present as aqueous caseo4 at 100 mm ca2 although caseo4 is below the saturation of precipitation the dissociation between seo4 2 and ca2 would hinder the removal rate of seo4 2 by pczvi nevertheless se vi removal 99 was not affected after 2 h even at 100 mm of ca2 mg2 suggesting pczvi works at high hardness 3 4 mechanism of se vi removal by pczvi 3 4 1 role of fe2 and its ph buffer effect the variations of ph and aqueous fe2 during the removal of se vi by zvi in the absence and presence of h2o2 azvi and pczvi are shown in fig 9 the ph in the zvi or the zvi h2o2 system quickly increased from 7 to 10 in 1 h mainly ascribed to the generation of oh induced by h2 evolution corrosion of zvi and the reduction of se vi se iv as described in eqs s11 s13 similar results were also observed elsewhere zhang et al 2005 qin et al 2017 and alkaline ph is unfavorable for se vi removal by zvi in contrast the ph in the azvi or pczvi systems was maintained at 5 2 5 6 which favors the removal of se vi such ph buffer effect could be mainly ascribed to the presence of the abundant fe2 in both systems qin et al 2017 nevertheless the removal efficiency of azvi was the lowest among the four systems although its ph evolution resembled that of the pczvi system thereby the enhanced removal of se vi by pczvi cannot be explained solely with the effect of solution ph it has been well accepted that fe2 could promote se vi removal by zvi however the efficient se vi removal by pczvi could not be simply ascribed to the presence of fe2 because the azvi system contained even higher fe2 than pczvi by plotting the aqueous fe2 versus se concentration during se vi by pczvi fig s5 the linear correlation r 2 0 991 indicated that the consumption of fe2 was a driving force for se vi removal which agreed well with previous studies tang et al 2014 qin et al 2017 as observed in fig 9b the amount of fe2 consumed during se vi removal by pczvi was almost four times higher than that of the azvi system therefore the consumption of fe2 was associated with the efficient se vi removal to further reveal the role of fe2 fe2 masking experiments were involved by the addition of 1 10 phenanthroline which could form stable complex with both aqueous fe2 and surface bound fe ii liang et al 2013 as shown in fig 10 the se vi removal rate was inhibited in the presence of 9 0 mm 1 10 phenanthroline indicating that fe2 played an indispensable role in se vi removal however the external addition of 3 0 mm fe2 approximately identical to the initial fe2 in the pczvi system did not significantly accelerate the removal of se vi suggesting that the surface bound fe ii instead of the aqueous fe2 plays the dominant role which was consistent with the superior reducing power of structural fe ii over aqueous fe ii white and peterson 1996 gorski et al 2016 3 4 2 role of fe corrosion products the evolution of fe corrosion products during the removal of se vi by zvi in the absence and presence of h2o2 azvi and pczvi were characterized with xrd as shown in fig 2 magnetite fe3o4 was the only observed crystalline corrosion product for zvi regardless of the absence or presence of h2o2 meanwhile the signal of metallic fe0 was greatly weakened as for the azvi and pczvi systems lepidocrocite γ feooh and goethite α feooh were observed in addition to magnetite furthermore the peak signals of the azvi system were especially pronounced suggesting a higher degree of zvi corrosion among these corrosion products magnetite and lepidocrocite are commonly observed after the removal of se vi by zvi liang et al 2015 qin et al 2017 whereas the formation of goethite for the azvi and pczvi systems was possibly induced by fe2 and so4 2 das et al 2017 diab and mokari 2017 and the aging of hfo dzombak and morel 1990 such evolution was also reflected in the sem images fig 1 d h particularly needle shaped products were observed for azvi and pczvi after the reaction with se vi consistent with the formation of goethite from xrd spectra the comparison between the 57fe mössbauer spectra of pczvi before and after reaction with se vi fig s3c and table s1 revealed that the corrosion evolution process during se vi removal was mainly the transformation of fe0 to fe3o4 lepidocrocite and goethite from viewpoint of electron transfer magnetite is believed to facilitate the electron transfer from fe0 core to solid liquid interface huang and zhang 2005 tang et al 2016 while lepidocrocite of poor conductivity is mainly responsible for the passivation of zvi mu et al 2017 however their adsorption affinity for se vi in the presence of fe2 just followed the opposite order qin et al 2017 given that adsorption of se vi is a prerequisite step for its reduction appropriate amount of lepidocrocite formation would enhance the enrichment of se vi nevertheless excessive generation of lepidocrocite would block the electron transfer pathway in our experiment the highest signal of lepidocrocite was observed in the azvi system fig 2 which might be responsible for the inhibition of se vi removal tang et al 2016 suggests that fe0 fe3o4 fe2 constitutes a ternary synergistic system hzvi for efficient removal of se vi of particular note is that certain precondition duration typically 6 h is required prior to the removal process during which fe2 could be bound to the surface of fe3o4 and the contact between fe3o4 and fe0 could be strengthened generally the objective of either the composition of the hybrid system with multiple components or the precondition process is to establish a well prepared zvi based system of dual capabilities i e efficient enrichment of se vi and expedited electron transfer from the fe0 core to se vi which could also be used to interpret the efficient removal of se vi by the pczvi system first the fe0 fe3o4 fe2 components also existed in our pczvi system where fe2 was well equilibrated with the solid phase during its preparation furthermore hfo as another major component 26 3 in the pczvi system could serve as an excellent adsorbent for se oxyanions parida et al 1997 peak and sparks 2002 dixit and hering 2003 thus enhancing the enrichment of se vi se iv however the pczvi suspension is prepared with h2o2 as an efficient oxidant leading to the short preparation duration 15 min compared with the precondition duration of the hzvi system 3 4 3 removal pathways of se vi to investigate the pathways of se vi removal by pczvi in the presence of sulfate the evolution of the immobilized se was quantified by xanes and the lcf fitting spectra and those of the reference materials are available in fig s6 as shown in fig 11 a se iv and se0 were the main oxidation states in the immobilized se whereas the signal of se vi was not observed throughout the removal process with the increase of reaction time the content of se iv gradually decreased while that of se0 increased accordingly indicating the stepwise reduction of se vi to se iv and then se0 furthermore based on the determination of the aqueous se species fig 4 and the lcf results of the immobilized se inset of fig 11a the evolution of se during the removal process is depicted in fig 11b obviously the removal of se vi by pczvi underwent the following processes in sequence contact of se vi with the solid surface reduction of se vi to se iv immobilization of se iv via inner sphere complexation further reduction of the immobilized se iv to se0 in the solid phase finally the majority of the total se 78 2 was immobilized as se0 3 4 4 evaluation of utilization ratio ur and electron selectivity es qin et al 2017 proposed the definitions and calculation protocols of ur and es during the removal of se vi by zvi in our study the ur and es of pczvi for se vi removal were compared with those of zvi h2o2 with the results tabulated in table s2 generally the ur of the zvi h2o2 system 97 6 was larger compared to pczvi 91 4 however the es of pczvi 0 748 was higher than the zvi h2o2 counterpart 0 507 note that the calculated es was relatively lower than those reported by qin et al 2017 because the coexisting sulfate significantly inhibited the adsorption of se oxyanions as shown in table s2 the distributions of valence states of se and fe in both systems after reaction were quite similar comparatively the enhanced es of pczvi was dominantly owing to the higher sequestration of se consistent with the proposed role of the enrichment of se oxyanions by hfo prior to their reduction 4 conclusions in this study we proposed an efficient technique to enhance the removal of se vi through pre corrosion of zvi with h2o2 hcl to constitute a suspension of fe0 hfo fe3o4 and aqueous fe2 the removal of se vi from sulfate rich solution by pczvi was superior to zvi in the absence and presence of h2o2 and acid pretreated zvi and the efficient removal of se vi by pczvi was applicable over a wide range of ph from 3 to 9 due to its strong buffering power the effects of coexisting ions on the removal of se vi by pczvi indicated the significance of the adsorption of se vi as a prerequisite step for its removal the consumption of aqueous fe2 was associated with the efficient removal of se vi and the main pathway for se vi removal by pczvi was a stepwise reduction of se vi to se iv and then se0 as the dominant final state moreover the higher electron selectivity of pczvi was attributed to the role of hfo via enhancing the enrichment of se oxyanions prior to their reduction acknowledgments this study was financially supported by national key r d program of china grant no

19729,although the removal of se vi from water by using zero valent iron zvi is a promising method passivation of zvi severely inhibits its performance to overcome such issue we proposed an efficient technique to enhance se vi removal via pre corrosion of zvi with h2o2 hcl in a short time 15 min the resultant pczvi suspension was weakly acidic ph 4 56 and contained abundant aqueous fe2 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy showed that pczvi mainly consisted of fe0 66 2 hydrated ferric oxide 26 3 and fe3o4 7 5 efficient removal of se vi from sulfate rich solution was achieved by pczvi compared with zvi in the absence and presence of h2o2 and acid pretreated zvi moreover the efficient removal of se vi by pczvi sustained over a broad ph range 3 9 due to its strong buffering power the presence of chloride carbonate nitrate and common cations na k ca2 and mg2 posed negligible influence on the removal of se vi by pczvi while the inhibitory effect induced by sulfate silicate and phosphate indicated the significance of se vi adsorption as a prerequisite step for its removal the consumption of aqueous fe2 was associated with se vi removal and x ray absorption near edge structure revealed that the main pathway for se vi removal by pczvi was a stepwise reduction of se vi to se iv and then se0 as the dominant final state 78 2 moreover higher electron selectivity of pczvi was attributed to the enhanced enrichment of se oxyanions prior to their reduction graphical abstract image 1 keywords selenate zvi corrosion hydrogen peroxide adsorption reduction 1 introduction selenium se is a necessary trace nutrient element but elevated level of se would pose serious risks to human and various living organics fairweather tait et al 2011 however certain industrial wastewaters from refining mining and smelting contain high concentrations of se meng et al 2002 hence efficient technologies for removal of se from water are in great demand the predominant species of aqueous se are se vi and se iv santos et al 2015 se iv can be firmly bound to the surface of various metal oxides via inner sphere complexation hayes et al 1987 pan et al 2010 in contrast the interactions of se vi with most metal oxides are predominantly outer sphere complexation yamani et al 2014 which is subject to interference induced by coexisting anions se vi removal from sulfate rich waters is particularly challenging due to the extremely similar chemical structures of seo4 2 and so4 2 nishimura et al 2007 shan et al 2017 thus chemical reduction of se vi into se iv or lower valent state is regarded as an effective strategy for its efficient remove from water tang et al 2014 liang et al 2015 zero valent iron zvi is a well known inexpensive material with moderate reducing power for water decontamination noubactep 2015 and the removal of se vi by zvi was proved to be mainly via reduction and adsorption yoon et al 2011 however the application of zvi technology is significantly restricted by the surface passivation of zvi guan et al 2015 noubactep 2015 thus various techniques including acid washing agrawal and tratnyek 1996 ultrasonication geiger et al 2002 h2 reduction liou et al 2005 microwave remya and lin 2011 nano sized zvi technology comba et al 2011 and weak magnetic field liang et al 2014 2015 have been developed to address this issue however most of the above techniques are far from satisfaction to implement in full scale application due to high cost or the requirement for special facilities noubactep 2015 tang et al 2014 suggests that fe2 plays an important role in the removal of se vi by zvi based on the superior reducing power of surface bound fe ii over aqueous fe ii white and peterson 1996 gorski et al 2016 meanwhile fe ii could rejuvenate lepidocrocite to magnetite of semiconductor nature thus facilitating the electron transfer from the fe0 core to se vi further a hybridized fe0 fe3o4 fe2 system has been employed for efficient removal of se vi compared with the non hybrid or partial hybrid systems tang et al 2016 however a relatively long precondition duration typically 6 h was required for the equilibration among the three components thus it is still imperative to develop more efficient techniques to enhance the removal of se vi by zvi based materials the corrosion process of zvi plays a vital role in its performance for reductive removal of contaminants owing to the formation of reactive corrosion products such as fe ii fe3o4 and h h2 noubactep 2009 2015 xu et al 2012 recently guo et al 2015 suggests that the removal of no3 by zvi could be greatly enhanced via addition of oxidants such as h2o2 kmno4 and cr vi considering h2o2 is an environmentally benign oxidant widely used in industry it has great potential to serve as an activator reagent of zvi for practical application however h2o2 might compete with the contaminant for electron from zvi and therefore decrease the electron efficiency in light of the above studies we anticipated a simple technique to enhance the removal of se vi through pre corrosion of zvi using h2o2 hcl to obtain a hybrid suspension system consisting of fe0 fe2 fe3o4 and other fe hydr oxides thus the objective of this study is to investigate the performance and mechanism of se vi removal by zvi pre corroded by h2o2 hcl pczvi the resultant pczvi was characterized with multiple techniques to identify the active components and the effect of solution chemistry on se vi removal by pczvi was explored the mechanism of se vi removal was elucidated in terms of the role of fe ii and its ph buffer effect the role of fe corrosion products the removal pathway of se vi and the electron selectivity as well 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the powdered zvi of 100 mesh 150 μm particle size bet specific surface area 1 95 m2 g was purchased from aladdin reagent inc shanghai china while na2seo3 and na2seo4 were obtained from xiya reagent co ltd chengdu china stock solutions of se vi were prepared by dissolving na2seo4 in ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm all other chemicals were analytical grade from sinopharm reagent co ltd shanghai china 2 2 preparation of pczvi suspension the pczvi suspension was prepared in a 50 ml centrifuge by dosing 1 20 g zvi powder and preset volume of 30 wt h2o2 solution into 20 ml 0 10 m hcl solution the centrifuge tube was sealed and shaken for 30 s after which the lid was opened for once to release the excess pressure subsequently the centrifuge tube was sealed again and installed on a rotisserie rotator for complete mixing at 90 rpm for 15 min the resultant black suspension was denoted by pczvi suspension fig s1 for comparison purpose the parallel pretreatments of zvi only with hcl or h2o2 were performed to prepare the acid pretreated zvi suspension azvi and h2o2 pretreated zvi suspension ozvi to probe their individual roles respectively note that the preparation of pczvi was optimized based on the performance of se vi removal text s1 and fig s2 2 3 removal of se vi by pczvi the freshly prepared pczvi suspension was added into a 500 ml three necked flask containing se vi solution with co existing sulfate at initial ph 7 0 resulting in a final volume of 300 ml initially at 0 253 mm se vi or 20 mg se l and 1000 mg l so4 2 note that the addition of sulfate was aimed to simulate the coexisting anions commonly present in wastewater which is crucial to the performance of se vi removal jegadeesan et al 2005 nishimura et al 2007 with continuous mechanical agitation at 350 rpm aliquots were withdrawn from the solution at preset time intervals followed by immediate filtration through 0 22 μm membrane for the subsequent analysis the effect of initial ph was investigated by adjusting the se vi solution with hcl or naoh into the ph range from 3 to 9 before the addition of pczvi suspension moreover the evolution of ph was monitored throughout the experiments to investigate the effect of the dissolved oxygen do on se vi removal by pczvi kinetics experiments were performed under different aeration conditions n2 air o2 and no aeration prior to the addition of pczvi the solution was pre purged with the corresponding gas for 30 min respectively during the removal process the solution was continuously purged to maintain a stable do which was measured by a fluorescent electrode gradient concentrations 0 1 10 and 100 mm of common co existing anions cl so4 2 hco3 no3 po4 3 and sio3 2 and cations na k ca2 and mg2 were introduced to the initial se vi solution to explore their influence on the removal process 2 4 characterization and analysis the solid products of pczvi and those after reaction with se vi were separated from the suspension by filtration through 0 22 μm membrane freeze dried and vacuum packed for further characterization the surface area and pore distribution of the solid products were characterized with n2 adsorption desorption nova 3000 quantachrome usa the morphological images were recorded with a scanning electron microscope sem s 3400 ii hitachi japan while the crystalline phases were identified with an x ray diffractometer xrd x tra arl switzerland in order to further investigate the speciation of solid products of pczvi 57fe mössbauer spectra were collected by proportional counter on topologic 500 a spectrometer with 57co rh as radioactive source at room temperature the proportion of fe0 in the different forms of zvi was quantified by acid dissolution of the solid in a specially designed apparatus to collect the generated h2 yang et al 2017 meanwhile the fraction of fe ii in the solid was calculated by deducting that of fe0 from the total fe ii in the aqueous phase se k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectra of the pczvi samples separated at preset time series were recorded to characterize the valence states of immobilized se during the removal process the spectra was collected in fluorescence mode and the data were analyzed with the demeter athena software version 0 9 25 fese se0 powder na2seo3 and na2seo4 were employed as reference materials for se ii se0 se iv and se vi respectively in the linear combination fitting lcf the total concentration of se and fe was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes icap7400 thermo usa while the aqueous se iv was analyzed by an atomic fluorescence spectroscope afs af 610 a rayleigh beijing china the aqueous fe ii concentration was spectrophotometrically determined by the 1 10 phenanthroline method at 510 nm and the residual h2o2 concentration was analyzed according to sellers 1980 the concentration of h2 was analyzed with a gas chromatograph trace 1310 thermo usa with a thermal conductivity detector tcd 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of pczvi the appearance of the as prepared pczvi suspension 20 ml was a black to russet suspension with black sediments fig s1 as an optimized preparation parameter of pczvi text s1 and fig s2 the initial molar ratio of fe0 h2o2 h was 1 0 5 0 093 thus although the initial solution was highly acidic 0 10 m hcl the stoichiometric amount of h was less than 10 of that of fe0 due to the small liquid solid ratio thereby the resultant pczvi suspension was far less acidic ph 4 56 due to the rapid consumption of h by abundant fe0 to generate fe2 with its final concentration of 43 8 mm in the aqueous phase in contrast fe iii which is prone to precipitate at such ph was not detected in the aqueous phase the added h2o2 initially at 536 mm was almost depleted 0 012 mm at 15 min suggesting its direct involvement into the accelerated corrosion of zvi during the preparation the surface roughness of the solid phase of pczvi greatly increased compared with zvi as observed in the sem images fig 1 a b indicating the formation of corrosion products on the surface of zvi during the preparation of pczvi accordingly the bet surface area of the solid phase isolated from pczvi 24 0 m2 g was one order of magnitude larger than that of pristine zvi 1 95 m2 g the xrd pattern of pczvi fig 2 demonstrated that fe3o4 was the only crystalline corrosion product the 57fe mössbauer spectrum of pczvi fig 3 and table s1 reveals that the solid phase consists of mainly three components i e fe0 hydrous ferric oxides hfo and fe3o4 which accounted for 66 2 26 3 and 7 5 of the total fe respectively note that hfo was not detected in the xrd pattern of pczvi due to its poor crystallinity however hfo is a porous oxide with large surface area up to 600 m2 g dzombak and morel 1990 manceau and charlet 1994 and considered as a good adsorbent for various oxyanions including se vi and se iv parida et al 1997 peak and sparks 2002 dixit and hering 2003 which may play an important role during the sequestration of se vi by pczvi in contrast the spectrum of zvi showed the sole phase of fe0 fig s3a although hfo was also present in the solid phase of azvi its proportion 5 7 was much smaller fig s3b and table s1 fe3o4 was not detected in the mössbauer spectrum of azvi possibly because of its low content based on the above analysis the main reactions during the preparation of pczvi are listed in eqs s1 s8 3 2 enhanced removal of se vi by pczvi the performance of se vi removal by pczvi was compared with zvi and other relevant systems fig 4 apparently se vi removal by zvi followed the pseudo zero order kinetic model r 2 0 989 with the rate constant k 0 of 1 6 mg l 1 h 1 whereas that by pczvi was remarkably accelerated following a pseudo first order kinetic model r 2 0 992 with k obs 0 568 h 1 different from the promotional effect via acid washing reported elsewhere agrawal and tratnyek 1996 only 28 of se was removed by azvi in 8 h suggesting that hcl pretreatment did not bring positive effect under the experimental conditions hcl fe 1 10 7 mol mol in contrast the pretreatment with h2o2 ozvi or addition of h2o2 both increased se vi removal to a quite limited extent 7 removal in 8 h therefore the enhancement by pretreatment with hcl and h2o2 was a synergistic process instead of a simple sum of their individual effects in addition although se vi removal by pczvi was faster than other reference systems it was still restricted by the inhibitory effect of sulfate in the sulfate free solution se vi could be lowered from 20 to 0 3 mg l in 20 min fig 4 generally pczvi is a promising reagent for se vi removal from water 3 3 effect of solution chemistry on se vi removal by pczvi 3 3 1 effect of ph effect of initial ph 3 9 on se vi removal by pczvi was investigated fig 5 a as observed the favorable removal of se vi by pczvi 98 as well as the removal kinetics was overlapped at initial ph from 3 to 9 in contrast the removal of se vi by using zvi is generally inhibited under alkaline condition due to unfavorable adsorption and intensified passivation yoon et al 2011 xie et al 2017 the broad ph suitability of pczvi demonstrates its superior potential over zvi for the practical se vi removal from various water matrices such preferable se vi removal by pczvi over a wide ph range was preliminarily probed by monitoring the evolution of ph at different initial phs fig 5b regardless of the initial ph varying from 3 to 9 the solution ph was rapidly within 10 min buffered to and thereafter maintained in a narrow range of 5 2 5 4 which is favorable for se vi removal this is why se vi removal was unaffected by varied phs for the pczvi suspension such amazing buffering capacity of pczvi was originated from both its solid components and the aqueous fe2 at acidic ph0 e g ph 3 most of the aqueous h was consumed by the dissolution and protonation of the corrosion products as for the alkaline ph0 e g ph 9 the buffering effect induced by the pczvi suspension was achieved via the hydrolysis precipitation of fe2 fe3 eqs s6 s10 and the deprotonation of the fe hydr oxides such as hfo and fe3o4 qin et al 2017 also found that the addition of fe2 to the zvi se vi system could quickly stabilize the ph at 6 0 until its depletion indicating the role of fe2 as a ph buffer 3 3 2 effect of do the performance of se vi removal by pczvi was compared at four do levels by continuous aeration with n2 air o2 and no aeration with do concentrations at 2 5 8 9 22 3 and 6 1 mg l respectively as shown in fig 6 se vi removal by pczvi was almost the same under no aeration and continuous aeration with n2 in contrast the removal efficiency was inhibited under continuous aeration with air or o2 previous studies yoon et al 2011 guo et al 2015 suggested that the increase of do within appropriate range would enhance the removal of se vi by zvi whereas reaction under pure o2 results in complete loss of reactivity of zvi murphy 1988 furthermore qin et al 2017 elucidated the coupled effect of fe2 and do on the removal of se vi by zvi the increase of do at appropriate range in the presence of fe2 could enhance the removal of se vi due to the formation of lepidocrocite γ feooh to augment the adsorption of se vi and further increasing do concentrations resulted in a lower capacity of zvi though the utilization ratio of fe0 was increased in our experiment pczvi could provide abundant hfo for se vi se iv adsorption and it is not necessary to conduct air o2 aeration to enhance se vi adsorption via in situ formation of γ feooh on the contrary excess do would compete with se vi se iv for the electron from fe0 to inhibit its electron selectivity moreover fe ii a promoter for the reduction of se vi and the rejuvenation of γ feooh to fe3o4 would be consumed by the excessive o2 collectively se vi removal by pczvi is an operationally uncritical technique performing well under natural do conditions 3 3 3 effect of coexisting ions effects of common anions chloride sulfate carbonate nitrate phosphate and silicate up to 100 mm except for carbonate up to 10 mm in view of its solubility on the removal of se vi by pczvi were explored as depicted in fig 7 se vi was completely 99 9 removed within 1 h in the absence of coexisting ions and the presence of chloride carbonate and nitrate showed negligible effects on the removal in contrast sulfate phosphate and silicate posed inhibitory influence on se vi removal by pczvi phosphate exhibited the most inhibitory effect with se vi removal fully inhibited at 10 mm it is interesting to observe that nitrate up to 100 mm exerted negligible influence because nitrate as an electron acceptor would suppress se vi removal by zvi mondal et al 2004 zhang et al 2005 shan et al 2017 to further elucidate this point the removal of no3 by pczvi was investigated in the absence and presence of se vi although 95 of no3 initially at 1 43 mm could be gradually removed in 8 h by pczvi fig s4 its removal rate was much slower than se vi in 1 h fig 7 moreover at no3 of 100 mm initially its removal by pczvi was negligible thus pczvi is capable of removing se vi preferentially over no3 possibly because the se oxyanions could be preferentially adsorbed by pczvi hfo as a major component over no3 similar to zvi murphy 1988 zhang et al 2005 the presence of sulfate inhibits the removal of se vi by pczvi due to the similar chemistry of seo4 2 and so4 2 as for phosphate and silicate both tend to form inner sphere complexes with fe hydr oxides and thus compete with se vi se iv for adsorption sites su and puls 2001 kohn and roberts 2006 the inhibitory effect induced by sulfate silicate and phosphate demonstrated that adsorption of se vi onto the surface of pczvi was a prerequisite step for its removal the influences of four cations na k ca2 and mg2 on se vi removal by pczvi were similar fig 8 and negligible adverse effects were observed for all the cations up to 10 mm further increase to 100 mm slightly suppressed the removal rate in the initial 2 h according to the calculation from visual minteq 3 1 42 of se vi is present as aqueous caseo4 at 100 mm ca2 although caseo4 is below the saturation of precipitation the dissociation between seo4 2 and ca2 would hinder the removal rate of seo4 2 by pczvi nevertheless se vi removal 99 was not affected after 2 h even at 100 mm of ca2 mg2 suggesting pczvi works at high hardness 3 4 mechanism of se vi removal by pczvi 3 4 1 role of fe2 and its ph buffer effect the variations of ph and aqueous fe2 during the removal of se vi by zvi in the absence and presence of h2o2 azvi and pczvi are shown in fig 9 the ph in the zvi or the zvi h2o2 system quickly increased from 7 to 10 in 1 h mainly ascribed to the generation of oh induced by h2 evolution corrosion of zvi and the reduction of se vi se iv as described in eqs s11 s13 similar results were also observed elsewhere zhang et al 2005 qin et al 2017 and alkaline ph is unfavorable for se vi removal by zvi in contrast the ph in the azvi or pczvi systems was maintained at 5 2 5 6 which favors the removal of se vi such ph buffer effect could be mainly ascribed to the presence of the abundant fe2 in both systems qin et al 2017 nevertheless the removal efficiency of azvi was the lowest among the four systems although its ph evolution resembled that of the pczvi system thereby the enhanced removal of se vi by pczvi cannot be explained solely with the effect of solution ph it has been well accepted that fe2 could promote se vi removal by zvi however the efficient se vi removal by pczvi could not be simply ascribed to the presence of fe2 because the azvi system contained even higher fe2 than pczvi by plotting the aqueous fe2 versus se concentration during se vi by pczvi fig s5 the linear correlation r 2 0 991 indicated that the consumption of fe2 was a driving force for se vi removal which agreed well with previous studies tang et al 2014 qin et al 2017 as observed in fig 9b the amount of fe2 consumed during se vi removal by pczvi was almost four times higher than that of the azvi system therefore the consumption of fe2 was associated with the efficient se vi removal to further reveal the role of fe2 fe2 masking experiments were involved by the addition of 1 10 phenanthroline which could form stable complex with both aqueous fe2 and surface bound fe ii liang et al 2013 as shown in fig 10 the se vi removal rate was inhibited in the presence of 9 0 mm 1 10 phenanthroline indicating that fe2 played an indispensable role in se vi removal however the external addition of 3 0 mm fe2 approximately identical to the initial fe2 in the pczvi system did not significantly accelerate the removal of se vi suggesting that the surface bound fe ii instead of the aqueous fe2 plays the dominant role which was consistent with the superior reducing power of structural fe ii over aqueous fe ii white and peterson 1996 gorski et al 2016 3 4 2 role of fe corrosion products the evolution of fe corrosion products during the removal of se vi by zvi in the absence and presence of h2o2 azvi and pczvi were characterized with xrd as shown in fig 2 magnetite fe3o4 was the only observed crystalline corrosion product for zvi regardless of the absence or presence of h2o2 meanwhile the signal of metallic fe0 was greatly weakened as for the azvi and pczvi systems lepidocrocite γ feooh and goethite α feooh were observed in addition to magnetite furthermore the peak signals of the azvi system were especially pronounced suggesting a higher degree of zvi corrosion among these corrosion products magnetite and lepidocrocite are commonly observed after the removal of se vi by zvi liang et al 2015 qin et al 2017 whereas the formation of goethite for the azvi and pczvi systems was possibly induced by fe2 and so4 2 das et al 2017 diab and mokari 2017 and the aging of hfo dzombak and morel 1990 such evolution was also reflected in the sem images fig 1 d h particularly needle shaped products were observed for azvi and pczvi after the reaction with se vi consistent with the formation of goethite from xrd spectra the comparison between the 57fe mössbauer spectra of pczvi before and after reaction with se vi fig s3c and table s1 revealed that the corrosion evolution process during se vi removal was mainly the transformation of fe0 to fe3o4 lepidocrocite and goethite from viewpoint of electron transfer magnetite is believed to facilitate the electron transfer from fe0 core to solid liquid interface huang and zhang 2005 tang et al 2016 while lepidocrocite of poor conductivity is mainly responsible for the passivation of zvi mu et al 2017 however their adsorption affinity for se vi in the presence of fe2 just followed the opposite order qin et al 2017 given that adsorption of se vi is a prerequisite step for its reduction appropriate amount of lepidocrocite formation would enhance the enrichment of se vi nevertheless excessive generation of lepidocrocite would block the electron transfer pathway in our experiment the highest signal of lepidocrocite was observed in the azvi system fig 2 which might be responsible for the inhibition of se vi removal tang et al 2016 suggests that fe0 fe3o4 fe2 constitutes a ternary synergistic system hzvi for efficient removal of se vi of particular note is that certain precondition duration typically 6 h is required prior to the removal process during which fe2 could be bound to the surface of fe3o4 and the contact between fe3o4 and fe0 could be strengthened generally the objective of either the composition of the hybrid system with multiple components or the precondition process is to establish a well prepared zvi based system of dual capabilities i e efficient enrichment of se vi and expedited electron transfer from the fe0 core to se vi which could also be used to interpret the efficient removal of se vi by the pczvi system first the fe0 fe3o4 fe2 components also existed in our pczvi system where fe2 was well equilibrated with the solid phase during its preparation furthermore hfo as another major component 26 3 in the pczvi system could serve as an excellent adsorbent for se oxyanions parida et al 1997 peak and sparks 2002 dixit and hering 2003 thus enhancing the enrichment of se vi se iv however the pczvi suspension is prepared with h2o2 as an efficient oxidant leading to the short preparation duration 15 min compared with the precondition duration of the hzvi system 3 4 3 removal pathways of se vi to investigate the pathways of se vi removal by pczvi in the presence of sulfate the evolution of the immobilized se was quantified by xanes and the lcf fitting spectra and those of the reference materials are available in fig s6 as shown in fig 11 a se iv and se0 were the main oxidation states in the immobilized se whereas the signal of se vi was not observed throughout the removal process with the increase of reaction time the content of se iv gradually decreased while that of se0 increased accordingly indicating the stepwise reduction of se vi to se iv and then se0 furthermore based on the determination of the aqueous se species fig 4 and the lcf results of the immobilized se inset of fig 11a the evolution of se during the removal process is depicted in fig 11b obviously the removal of se vi by pczvi underwent the following processes in sequence contact of se vi with the solid surface reduction of se vi to se iv immobilization of se iv via inner sphere complexation further reduction of the immobilized se iv to se0 in the solid phase finally the majority of the total se 78 2 was immobilized as se0 3 4 4 evaluation of utilization ratio ur and electron selectivity es qin et al 2017 proposed the definitions and calculation protocols of ur and es during the removal of se vi by zvi in our study the ur and es of pczvi for se vi removal were compared with those of zvi h2o2 with the results tabulated in table s2 generally the ur of the zvi h2o2 system 97 6 was larger compared to pczvi 91 4 however the es of pczvi 0 748 was higher than the zvi h2o2 counterpart 0 507 note that the calculated es was relatively lower than those reported by qin et al 2017 because the coexisting sulfate significantly inhibited the adsorption of se oxyanions as shown in table s2 the distributions of valence states of se and fe in both systems after reaction were quite similar comparatively the enhanced es of pczvi was dominantly owing to the higher sequestration of se consistent with the proposed role of the enrichment of se oxyanions by hfo prior to their reduction 4 conclusions in this study we proposed an efficient technique to enhance the removal of se vi through pre corrosion of zvi with h2o2 hcl to constitute a suspension of fe0 hfo fe3o4 and aqueous fe2 the removal of se vi from sulfate rich solution by pczvi was superior to zvi in the absence and presence of h2o2 and acid pretreated zvi and the efficient removal of se vi by pczvi was applicable over a wide range of ph from 3 to 9 due to its strong buffering power the effects of coexisting ions on the removal of se vi by pczvi indicated the significance of the adsorption of se vi as a prerequisite step for its removal the consumption of aqueous fe2 was associated with the efficient removal of se vi and the main pathway for se vi removal by pczvi was a stepwise reduction of se vi to se iv and then se0 as the dominant final state moreover the higher electron selectivity of pczvi was attributed to the role of hfo via enhancing the enrichment of se oxyanions prior to their reduction acknowledgments this study was financially supported by national key r d program of china grant no
