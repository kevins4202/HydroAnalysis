14760,non point nitrate pollution in groundwater has been accelerated by agricultural development but sustainable nitrogen removal is a challenge because of its wide distribution and negative side effects surface agricultural practices saps which are demonstrably effective in driving the downward infiltration of dissolved organic carbon doc have not been well explored for their potential to enhance nitrate attenuation in groundwater therefore a combination of soil column and groundwater incubation experiments was performed to investigate the carbon and nitrogen responses to different saps manure fertilization lucerne planting and straw return the soil column experiment showed that saps promoted doc and reduced nitrate leaching into groundwater and straw treatment witnessed the highest doc leaching flux 252 71 g m 2 yr 1 and lowest nitrate leaching flux 9 51 g m 2 yr 1 the groundwater incubation experiment showed that leachates from the straw treatment displayed the best denitrification enhancement performance with the highest no3 n reduction efficiency 92 93 and rate 1 627 mg day n2 selectivity 99 78 and net nitrogen removal 0 09 mg furthermore fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry confirmed that chos molecules with lower double bond equivalents 0 5 and larger carbon numbers 10 15 were more accessible to denitrifiers this study provides a new path for the sustainable control of non point source nitrate pollution graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords surface agricultural practices dissolved organic carbon vadose zone groundwater nitrate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrate contamination in groundwater has become a major environmental concern with the successive occurrence of groundwater nitrate overload around the world xin et al 2019 yu et al 2020 excess nitrate in groundwater may cause blooms and eutrophication li et al 2018 and even produce potential hazards to human health such as methemoglobinemia colorectal cancer and thyroid disease zhang et al 2018b non point sources such as nitrogen fertilizers have become the main source of nitrate pollution in groundwater wang et al 2021 compared with its point source counterpart which covers a small area and is relatively easy to mitigate with engineering based strategies the non point source nitrate pollution in groundwater is widely and heterogeneously distributed and extremely difficult to control by technical measures monitored natural attenuation is usually adopted as the most appropriate approach for mitigating nitrate non point source pollution park et al 2016 nevertheless in situ nitrate attenuation capacities in groundwater are fundamentally impacted by hydrogeological conditions making the results appear to be significantly variable in different environments therefore understanding the in situ nitrate attenuation mechanism and finding a feasible means of reinforcing the same is of utmost necessity denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra are the predominant mechanism of natural nitrate attenuation in groundwater singleton et al 2007 su et al 2022 many factors significantly impact the two processes such as ph temperature dissolved oxygen do and dissolved organic carbon doc popp et al 2020 among which doc is considered one of the primary limiting factors hang et al 2016 because doc can provide energy for microorganisms to reduce nitrate however under unfavorable nitrate reduction conditions characterized by low doc levels in situ attenuation fails to adequately protect groundwater quality with natural denitrification and dnra processes lee et al 2017 previous research has overcome this issue by introducing extra carbon sources through injection wells to promote in situ attenuation lee et al 2021 which is not suitable for large scale groundwater non point sources overlain by arable land the impact of extra carbon sources such as acetate glucose calderer et al 2010 succinate and fumarate lee et al 2021 has been well studied over decades of research these studies have helped to obtain further insight into isolated organic components but little is known regarding the role of natural carbon sources which comprise a myriad of heterogeneous organic compounds more recently doc analysis has been significantly improved by the emergence of fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms which allows for the accurate identification of thousands of individual molecular formulas in a single environmental sample nai et al 2020 remucal et al 2020 this technique paves the way for exploring the molecular evolution of doc in natural nitrate attenuation and provides deep insight into the complex carbon source based nitrate attenuation process surface agricultural practices saps such as manure fertilization cover crop planting and straw return have been widely applied to decrease chemical inputs improve soil fertility and enhance agricultural productivity a growing body of literature supports that saps can positively affect soil organic carbon storage li et al 2021 potential denitrification rate qin et al 2017 and aerobic respiratory activity cannavo et al 2004 in the soil profile and soil organic carbon leaching loss vinther et al 2006 however they merely conducted detailed examinations of the surface soil and shallow vadose zone while paying no attention to the link between soil and groundwater recently several site scale evidences suggest that vertical doc infiltration triggered by the implementation of saps may affect groundwater nitrate attenuation alessandrino et al 2021 premrov et al 2012 observed an increase in doc occurrence in groundwater overlain by cover crops and confirmed that the cover crop may greatly enhance natural nitrate attenuation via denitrification jahangir et al 2014 furthermore the multi isotope analysis conducted by li et al 2017 also revealed the occurrence of denitrification in the straw return area possibly corresponding to the potential increase of electron donors in groundwater however there have been no studies regarding which saps are better at removing nitrate from groundwater while minimizing the negative side effects more efforts are required to unveil the driving mechanism of saps in enhancing nitrate attenuation in groundwater which may have strong implications for its practical applicability in this study a combination of soil column and groundwater incubation experiments was conducted to link groundwater behavior with saps carbon and nitrogen responses soil profile leaching characteristics and groundwater nitrogen removal performance to different saps manure fertilization cover crop planting and straw return were investigated to gain insight into the regulatory mechanism ft icr ms and microbial community analyses were conducted the results of this study provide insightful information on the feasibility of selected agricultural practices as an innovative and sustainable strategy to enhance nitrate attenuation in groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and materials samples soil organic amendments groundwater and porous medium were collected from an intensive agricultural area in the north china plain 120 10 16 e 36 31 36 n which is one of the major grain producing regions in china and plays a vital role in ensuring national food security zhang et al 2018a the region has a mean annual precipitation of 680 mm the area was cultivated in a rotation of summer maize and winter wheat with an annual nitrogen fertilizer application rate of 600 kg hm2 the phreatic aquifer zone consists of alluvium and alluvial gravel from the quaternary system with burial depths of 0 5 4 0 m 2 1 1 soil to perform the soil column experiment five soil segments were collected at 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm depths the soil samples were immediately brought to the laboratory and divided into two subsamples one subsample was measured for ph electrical conductivity ec water content maximum water holding capacity bulk density soil texture no3 n no2 n nh4 n dissolved organic nitrogen don total dissolved nitrogen tdn total nitrogen tn doc and total carbon tc another subsample was air dried crushed and sieved to 2 0 mm before being packed into soil columns the basic physicochemical properties of the soils at each depth are listed in table s1 2 1 2 organic amendments considering that manure fertilization cover cropping and straw return are routine practices for improving soil fertility in this agricultural area manure lucerne and straw were used as three representative organic amendments in the soil column experiment before use the organic amendments were air dried ground and sieved to pass through a 2 0 mm mesh the basic physicochemical properties of the organic amendments are presented in table s2 2 1 3 groundwater and porous medium to perform the groundwater incubation experiment groundwater samples were obtained using an organic glass hydrophore gomo et al 2018 water temperature do ec ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were immediately measured on site the porous medium was collected using an auger sd 1 christie engineering australia at a depth of 450 cm with coring tubes extracted from the ground every 100 cm all the collected samples were sealed and transported to the laboratory for pretreatment the basic physicochemical properties of the groundwater and porous medium are listed in text s1 and table s3 2 2 experimental apparatus and methods to explore the connection between saps and groundwater nitrate attenuation behavior a combination of soil column and groundwater incubation experiments was adopted to simulate the vadose zone groundwater coupled system the soil column leaching experiment aimed to investigate the carbon and nitrogen leaching characteristics under the impact of saps and the resulting leachates were sequentially used in the groundwater incubation experiment to quantitatively estimate nitrate attenuation potentials and negative side effects fig 1 2 2 1 soil column experiment a layered soil column was constructed with five soil segments collected at five different soil depths 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm and the soil was moistened to approximately 60 of the maximum water holding capacity and pre incubated at 25 c for a week to recover microbial activity before column packing a soil column with an inner diameter of 6 cm and a length of 120 cm was constructed with polymethyl methacrylate pipes fig 1 the soil was prevented from escaping by first placing a nylon net followed by a 5 0 cm layer of acid washed quartz sand then the prepared soils were packed into the columns in 5 cm increments to a height of 100 cm soil profile about 3 87 kg of the prepared soil was packed into the columns to achieve an average bulk density of about 1 37 g cm 1 a filter paper followed by a 5 0 cm thick acid washed quartz sand was placed on the top of the soil column to uniformly distribute the water to simulate the application of saps the top 20 cm of soil in the column was thoroughly mixed with different organic amendments 1 control 2 manure 3 lucerne and 4 straw as an alternative approach to crop nitrogen fertilizer requirements the tn added by each organic amendment was consistent to meet agricultural production the amounts used were 4 62 4 30 and 16 80 mg in the manure lucerne and straw treatments respectively equivalent to the local field application rate of 600 kg n hm2 each treatment was replicated three times deionized water was added to the columns to represent the mean annual precipitation 680 mm of qingdao city which was applied as five split events during the entire experimental period at an interval of one week for each split event deionized water was added slowly into soil column using a peristaltic pump at the rate of 534 8 μl min 1 for 12 h once a week the leachate from individual columns was collected to measure the ph ec no3 n no2 n nh4 n don tdn and doc furthermore the remaining leachates obtained from parallel columns under the same treatment were mixed and stored at 4 c before the groundwater incubation experiments at the end of the experiment the soil in each layer was sampled to determine the no3 n no2 n nh4 n don tdn and doc concentrations to compare with the carbon and nitrogen contents in each layer of the soil column after leaching we calculated the carbon and nitrogen contents in each layer of the soil column before leaching based on the basic physicochemical properties of soil and organic amendments 2 2 2 groundwater incubation experiment the groundwater incubation experiments were conducted in microcosms containing porous medium 8 g groundwater 2 67 ml and the leachates 0 2 ml in the first leaching event and 0 48 ml in each remaining leaching event from the soil column experiments under control manure lucerne and straw conditions based on the results of the soil column experiment fewer leachates were obtained from the first leaching event than from other leaching events because of the unsaturated state of the columns at the initial stage considering that the leachates collected at different leaching events may contain different dissolved organic matter and result in variable nitrate attenuation enhancement performances three tested groups of added leachates were prepared as follows 1 single group the leachate of the first leaching event 2 three in one group the mixed leachate formed by mixing the leachates of the first three leaching events and 3 five in one group the mixed leachate formed by mixing the leachates of all the leaching events fig 1 anaerobic conditions were introduced by sparging with high purity argon for 1 min all microcosms were whirlpool oscillated to thoroughly mix and then placed in a constant temperature incubator gxz 380b jiangnan china the temperature was maintained at 18 c groundwater incubation experiments were conducted in triplicate and destructive sampling was conducted at each sampling date 0 1 2 3 5 7 10 and 20 d after incubation headspace samples were collected in microcosms using a syringe to measure the n2o concentration samples of the microcosm were then extracted as a whole with a 0 1 m k2so4 solution 1 2 5 w v to measure no3 n no2 n nh4 n don tdn and doc the contents of doc and various nitrogen forms were shown as the sum of their content in both the water and solid phases mg n 2 3

performed using a mobio powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc usa the extracted dna was used to amplify the v3 v4 regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene using 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag

dissolved nitrogen leaching characteristics fig 2 a shows the doc content of the leachates in the control manure lucerne and straw treatments over the leaching period leachates from the manure lucerne and straw treatments showed consistently higher doc concentrations than the control throughout the soil column experiment in the early phase of the experiment the doc concentration for all the treatments showed an increasing trend and reached a maximum level at the third leaching event after which doc concentrations decreased slowly doc concentrations tended to stabilize from the fourth to the fifth leaching events but persisted on the fifth leaching event doc concentration was much higher in the manure 169 51 mg l lucerne 77 41 mg l and straw treatments 455 05 mg l compared to the control 18 32 mg l indicating a sustainable doc leaching potential that indicates if extreme precipitation or additional diffuse irrigation occurs more doc will possibly access to groundwater compared with the data obtained under the average precipitation scenario in this study total doc export was higher in the manure lucerne and straw treatments than in the control fig 2d among which the straw treatment witnessed the highest total doc export 714 16 mg column this illustrates that saps could potentially promote doc leaching into the groundwater and may be attributable to the addition of organic amendments that directly promoted the formation of the doc pool and enhanced microbial activity which indirectly increased the conversion of soil organic carbon into doc chen et al 2022 figs 2b c and s1 show the dissolved nitrogen no3 n no2 n nh4 n don and tdn content of the leachates in the control manure lucerne and straw treatments over the leaching period in the early phase of the experiment the tdn concentration for all the treatments showed a decreasing trend and reached the minimum level at the third leaching event except for the straw treatment which reached the minimum level at the fourth leaching event subsequently the tdn leaching for all the treatments began to plateau with negligible further leaching during the late phase of the experiment no3 n and don were the dominant forms of tdn in the leachate accounting for 12 29 82 21 and 15 94 45 63 of tdn losses respectively whereas the no2 n and nh4 n contents were relatively low accounting for only 0 08 2 34 and 0 21 2 00 respectively total no3 n export was lower in the manure lucerne and straw treatments than in the control fig 2e among which the straw treatment exhibited the lowest total no3 n export 26 88 mg column this occurred because saps could provide a sufficient carbon source for denitrifying bacteria that ultimately enhances soil denitrification hu et al 2021 qin et al 2017 which corresponded to the high total doc export as previously mentioned furthermore total tdn export in the manure lucerne and straw treatments decreased by 14 47 30 30 and 14 50 respectively compared with the control fig 2f indicating that the nitrogen introduced by organic amendments was lower than the nitrogen removed by soil denitrification to provide more general information we further calculated the annual leaching flux based on the leaching amount of the soil column the results showed that straw treatment witnessed the highest doc leaching flux 252 71 g m 2 yr 1 and lowest nitrate leaching flux 9 51 g m 2 yr 1 the doc and dissolved nitrogen no3 n no2 n nh4 n and don contents in soil layers collected from each treatment before and after leaching are presented in figs s2 and s3 before leaching the doc and dissolved nitrogen contents for all the treatments were mainly concentrated in the surface soil layer of 0 20 cm compared to the control the doc and dissolved nitrogen content increased 5 02 7 12 and 23 37 times and 1 73 1 17 and 2 77 times in the manure lucerne and straw treatments respectively the results showed that the incorporation of organic amendments boosted the contents of carbon and nitrogen in the surface soil of 0 20 cm consistent with the properties of organic amendments table s2 moreover dissolved nitrogen was mainly in the form of no3 n don and nh4 n fig s3 after leaching the doc content in the surface soil layer 0 20 cm markedly decreased while the doc content in the deeper soil layers 20 100 cm generally increased in all the treatments this confirmed that the doc content in deeper soil was mainly derived from leaching and provided evidence to support the vertical migration of doc from the surface soil to the groundwater a similar phenomenon also existed in the dissolved nitrogen namely the dissolved nitrogen in the surface soil migrated downward into the deep soil and dissolved nitrogen in each soil layer mostly contained don and nh4 n fig s3 which indicated that no3 n was readily leached into groundwater 3 2 effects of different leachates on groundwater no3 n attenuation figs 3 and s4 present the dissolved nitrogen no3 n no2 n n2on nh4 n don and tdn and doc contents of microcosms receiving different groups of leachates following a 20 day groundwater incubation experiment in all cases except for the single group nitrate reduction could be divided into two phases with fast and slow dynamics the kinetics of the fast phase the first two days of incubation appeared to be first order text s4 and fitting that model to the data gave the rate constants k presented in table s4 generally the no3 n content for all the treatments decreased rapidly in the fast phase and then slowed down in the slow phase the dynamics of the doc content followed a similar pattern as that of the no3 n content in all the treatments where a decreasing trend was observed in the first two days and then remained constant after two days interestingly different no3 n reduction patterns were observed when receiving different groups of leachates after the leachate of the single group was added all the treatments displayed poor no3 n reduction efficiency with no3 n remaining at approximately 81 52 90 71 after 20 d of incubation and poor reaction rate ranging at 0 007 0 012 mg day which can be attributed to the low c n ratio molar ratio 0 24 0 26 the same below in the leachate from the first sampling event however with the supplementation of the three in one leachate the 20 day no3 n reduction efficiency and rate increased to 24 34 46 93 66 15 and 95 93 and 0 014 0 223 0 384 and 1 634 mg day in the control manure lucerne and straw treatments respectively in comparison the five in one groups showed a slight further improvement in nitrate elimination resulting in no3 n reduction efficiencies of 22 68 85 19 66 36 and 92 93 and reduction rates of 0 051 0 806 0 606 and 1 627 mg day in the control manure lucerne and straw treatments respectively a progressive shift towards faster no3 n reduction rate from single group to five in one group was confirmed by significant positive relationship between the no3 n reduction rate and c n ratio fig s5 this confirmed the importance of an adequate carbon source for nitrate reduction and illustrated that the nitrate attenuation enhancement effect increased with increasing c n of the leachate furthermore the no3 n reduction efficiency and rate in the straw treatment 13 66 95 93 and 0 007 1 634 mg day were much higher than that in the other treatments 9 29 85 19 and 0 007 0 806 mg day which indicated that straw return could enhance nitrate attenuation more efficiently than other saps this can be attributed almost exclusively to the high content of doc fig 3 and the highest c n ratio maintained table s4 in the straw treatment corresponding to its highest doc leaching potential in the soil column experiment although a decrease in no3 n content was observed in all the treatments there were distinctive dynamic changes in nitrate reduction products no2 n n2o n and nh4 n among the different treatments considering that nitrate reduction was not obvious in the single group and the distributions of reaction products were similar in the three in one and five in one groups we discuss the five in one group in detail as an example in the straw treatment the content of no2 n dramatically accumulated during the initial two days and then was subsequently removed which reflected the occurrence of incomplete denitrification in a short incubation time moreover the no2 n accumulated peak corresponded to the point of no3 n exhaustion owing to differences in denitrification enzyme activity between nitrate and nitrite reductases cui et al 2017 thus the accumulated no2 n began to decline rapidly when the no3 n was completely consumed there was almost no residual no2 n n2o n and nh4 n and n2 selectivity was up 99 78 at the end of the experiment this demonstrated that the straw treatment was sufficient for complete denitrification and almost no dnra occurred unlike the straw treatment the manure and lucerne treatments shared similar patterns of no3 n transformation the content of no2 n increased rapidly during the first two days and then remained steady after two days the maximal ntr1 was 58 57 and 65 24 in the manure and lucerne treatments respectively which indicated that much of the removed no3 n was transformed to no2 n without further reduction this may have occurred because of an insufficient supply of carbon sources liu et al 2021b furthermore the n2on content increased slowly after day 10 reaching a maximum level on day 20 when ntr2 was 5 89 and 6 91 in the manure and lucerne treatments respectively which indicated that part of the removed no3 n was converted to n2o n without further reduction the increase in n2o n after day 10 may be attributed to the accumulation of no2 n which is consistent with previous findings that high concentrations of no2 n can inhibit the activity of nitrous oxide reductase park et al 2001 in addition the nh4 n content increased slowly after day 5 reaching a maximum level on day 20 when ntr3 was 3 26 and 3 69 in the manure and lucerne treatments respectively which may be attributed to the occurrence of dnra eventually there was substantial residual no2 n n2o n and nh4 n and the n2 selectivity was merely 51 26 and 45 47 in the manure and lucerne treatments respectively this demonstrates that the manure and lucerne treatments were dominated by incomplete denitrification with low dnra occurrence overall a no3 n reduction of 66 36 92 93 in groundwater under the average annual precipitation scenario was achieved for all saps used in this study the missing nitrogen was likely product of denitrification coinciding with the enrichment of doc promoted by leachates in the groundwater nevertheless it should also be noted that significant amounts of dissolved nitrogen were initially introduced into the groundwater by leachates to objectively evaluate the nitrate attenuation enhancement performance of various leachates groundwater porous medium included was considered as a black box and nitrogen balance was a measure of nitrogen input from leachates minus gaseous nitrogen loss a negative nitrogen balance was observed in the straw treatment whereas a positive nitrogen balance was more popular in the other treatments fig s6 this indicates that net nitrogen removal can only be achieved in the straw treatment which further supports straw return as the optimal sap both in terms of the net dissolved nitrogen removal and product composition 3 3 molecular characteristics and transformation of doc as found in section 3 2 that the no3 n reduction rate was significantly correlated with c n ratio a pertinent question then arises on whether the different doc composition in various leachates would also cast a prominent effect on the denitrification process in groundwater then ft icr ms analysis was performed to further understand the doc evolution of incubation process considering that the five in one group exhibited optimal denitrification performance the doc molecular characteristics of the microcosms were analyzed by ft icr ms in the control manure lucerne and straw treatments receiving the five in one leachate group on days 0 and 20 these docs were composed of cho 47 19 61 96 followed by chno 23 03 37 08 chos 11 83 24 11 and chnos 2 47 5 68 fig s7a on day 0 pronounced differences in doc composition were observed among the different treatments compared with the control 9 77 the protein content was significantly higher in the manure lucerne and straw treatments with 19 42 24 62 and 17 47 respectively this shows that the increase in protein in groundwater was promoted by saps which made the denitrifiers much more accessible to biodegradable doc to reduce no3 n specifically carbohydrates were abundant in the straw treatment 1 39 which was more easily utilized by the denitrifiers consistent with the highest no3 n reduction efficiency and rate as previously mentioned in section 3 2 furthermore dbewa was comparatively lower in the manure lucerne and straw treatments than in the control suggesting an increase in doc saturation in groundwater under saps table s5 in addition a significant difference in doc composition was observed between the day 0 and day 20 samples for the four treatments compared with day 0 the content of biodegradable compounds such as proteins decreased whereas the content of refractory compounds such as tannins increased fig s7b to better clarify the molecular transformation in the incubation processes under various treatments the doc molecules were screened to make up reactive stable and formed pools detailed screening principles in text s5 reactive pool indicated the molecules those were preferentially transformed during incubation stable pool indicated the molecules with little change in content during incubation and the formed pool indicated molecules with significantly increased content after incubation around 1163 3049 molecules were reactive in the incubation accounting for 6 74 36 83 of the molecules in the day 0 samples table s6 approximately 1170 4063 molecules were formed after incubation contributing to 12 74 53 35 of the molecules in the day 20 samples table s6 generally the reactive molecules in all the treatments had relatively higher dbewa and mwwa than other molecules in the day 0 samples indicating that doc with large molecules and unsaturated groups was preferentially transformed during the incubation processes table s6 to further examine the characteristics of the reactive molecules under various treatments in the day 0 samples the reactive molecules were divided into four groups namely cho doc chno doc chos doc and chnos doc the dbe of the samples in this study exhibited a broad range of distributions fig 4 a and figs s8 s10 indicating the prevalence of double bonds and cycloalkane structures in the groundwater doc interestingly the reactive molecules for all the treatments mainly occupied the chos region with a lower dbe 0 5 as well as a larger carbon number 10 15 fig 4a the results indicate that chos molecules with a higher degree of saturation and complexity were more easily utilized by denitrifiers the reactive chos molecules from all the treatments were identified into 12 subcategories based on the amount of oxygen and sulfur atoms o3s1 o14s1 fig 4b the reactive oxs1 group was mainly concentrated in the o4s1 o10s1 subcategories with relatively higher abundances suggesting the potential presence of sulfurous functional groups with high oxidation liu et al 2021a such as so3h groups in the reactive chos component moreover the reactive chos molecules were mostly proteins with some lignin fig 4c consistent with the fact that chos doc in nature are mainly proteins liu et al 2021a given this new finding the abundance of proteins 17 47 and high c n ratio of the leachate reported in section 3 2 from the straw treatment could further explain its excellent denitrification enhancement potential and prove that straw return contributed to more bioaccessible components 3 4 bacterial community characteristics of the porous medium 3 4 1 richness and diversity of bacterial communities the structures of the bacterial communities in the porous medium were analyzed by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing analysis in the control manure lucerne and straw treatments under different groups on days 0 and 20 all rarefaction curves reached a plateau with high coverage estimators 98 suggesting that the diversity of the bacterial communities was deeply captured by the 16s rrna gene sequence database compared with the original porous medium the decrease in the simpson index and the increase in the shannon chao and ace indices indicated that saps increased the groundwater bacterial diversity and richness table s7 3 4 2 bacterial communities shift at the phylum level proteobacteria and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla altogether accounting for 63 71 80 97 of the total bacterial phyla in all the treatments fig 5 a proteobacteria which includes most of the denitrifying bacteria liu et al 2020 was higher in the manure 37 65 54 41 lucerne 45 37 68 04 and straw treatments 29 90 68 94 compared to the control 27 34 41 56 indicating that the saps could promote the removal of nitrogen in groundwater actinobacteria which mainly participate in the carbon cycle of humus decomposition yang et al 2018 showed an opposite distribution pattern with a relatively lower abundance in the manure 3 51 8 12 lucerne 1 54 7 32 and straw 1 34 5 20 treatments compared to that in the control 7 41 11 93 this may be associated with the fact that a considerable portion of refractory doc was observed in the control and further supported that more biodegradable organic species were introduced by the saps applications bacteroidota which consists of numerous bacteria known for their decomposition of proteins chen et al 2018 was more prevalent in the manure 2 10 4 00 lucerne 2 10 5 31 and straw treatments 1 34 4 15 than in the control 1 26 3 19 this finding was in agreement with the high protein content in the manure lucerne and straw treatments evidenced by ft icr ms data and further supported that protein may be a dominant contributor to biodegradable doc and largely drive denitrification additionally firmicutes which can metabolize in aerobic or anoxic environments and have denitrifying activity zuo et al 2019 also deserve attention the relative abundance of firmicutes was highest in the straw treatment 1 03 12 11 compared with the control 0 94 1 57 manure 0 68 2 04 and lucerne treatments 0 81 2 31 indicating that straw return could provide a more conducive environment for the enrichment of denitrifiers in groundwater to further understand the bacterial community related to no3 n consumption in the nitrogen removal system the relative abundances of denitrifying genera were detected in the four treatments similar to the ft icr ms analysis we discuss the five in one group in detail as an example according to previous literature liu et al 2020 2022 all denitrifying genera in the porous medium were screened and the results are presented in fig 5b denitrifying bacteria were abundant in the straw treatment accounting for 61 32 of the total bacterial genera which was higher than the control 43 25 manure 46 57 and lucerne 34 37 treatments this coincided with the highest no3 n reduction efficiency of the straw treatment as previously shown in section 3 2 in the straw treatment the relative abundances of pseudomonas 23 69 simplicispira 8 24 and rhodoferax 5 56 some typical strict anoxic heterotrophic denitrifiers liu et al 2020 sperfeld et al 2018 was higher than those in the other treatments this explains the possibility of better denitrification in the straw treatment moreover acidovorax a denitrifying genus known for its utilization of carbohydrates liu et al 2020 was abundant in the straw treatment 1 69 compared to the control 0 04 manure 0 89 and lucerne 0 55 treatments corresponding to the observed higher carbohydrate content of the straw treatment in the ft icr ms analysis therefore we inferred that the increased size of the labile doc pool due to straw return was a key factor that favored nitrate attenuation in groundwater 3 5 environmental implications our results show that saps can be adopted for efficient nitrate removal from groundwater by regulating the export of terrestrial doc this finding has profound implications for the mitigation of nitrate non point source pollution in groundwater given that the proportion and composition of carbon containing organic amendments are very different the generation of more and better bioaccessible doc from straw return is a promising approach for stimulating efficient nitrate removal from groundwater in addition straw return a typical agricultural practice and biomass reuse method works to stimulate denitrification in groundwater as a side job and avoid extra investments for groundwater remediation if in situ straw return can be harnessed well better no3 n removal higher n2 selectivity and less nitrogen input are expected in practices for sustainably controlling non point source nitrate pollution however scale up of the results and the potentials of in situ application as an attenuation method for non point source nitrate should be more focused including migration of nitrate through unsaturated zone exhaustion of biodegradable organic materials over time etc in addition the complex mechanism under actual hydrogeological conditions like pyrite oxidation anoxic nitrification coupled to mn oxide reduction and that heterotrophic nitrifying aerobic denitrifying bacteria capable of denitrification utom et al 2020 could impact the denitrification enhancement potential of straw return further field studies are required to characterize their long term performance and provide a basis for application guidance 4 conclusions saps based regulations were conducted in the vadose zone groundwater coupled system to investigate the responses of soil profile leaching characteristics and groundwater nitrogen removal performance in this study the soil column experiment showed that saps promoted doc and reduced nitrate leaching into groundwater with the highest doc leaching export and lowest nitrate leaching export detected in the straw treatment the groundwater incubation experiment showed that the denitrification was not significantly promoted after receiving the leachate from the first leaching event whereas with the c n ratio of the leachate increased in the following leaching events the denitrification enhancement effect was significantly promoted accordingly corresponding with its highest doc leaching potential leachates from the straw treatment induced the best nitrate reduction efficiency as well as the minimized negative environmental impacts the high c n ratio and abundance of proteins in the leachate from the straw treatment could explain its excellent denitrification enhancement potential therefore straw return is very promising for addressing agriculture derived nitrate contamination issues in groundwater

14760,non point nitrate pollution in groundwater has been accelerated by agricultural development but sustainable nitrogen removal is a challenge because of its wide distribution and negative side effects surface agricultural practices saps which are demonstrably effective in driving the downward infiltration of dissolved organic carbon doc have not been well explored for their potential to enhance nitrate attenuation in groundwater therefore a combination of soil column and groundwater incubation experiments was performed to investigate the carbon and nitrogen responses to different saps manure fertilization lucerne planting and straw return the soil column experiment showed that saps promoted doc and reduced nitrate leaching into groundwater and straw treatment witnessed the highest doc leaching flux 252 71 g m 2 yr 1 and lowest nitrate leaching flux 9 51 g m 2 yr 1 the groundwater incubation experiment showed that leachates from the straw treatment displayed the best denitrification enhancement performance with the highest no3 n reduction efficiency 92 93 and rate 1 627 mg day n2 selectivity 99 78 and net nitrogen removal 0 09 mg furthermore fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry confirmed that chos molecules with lower double bond equivalents 0 5 and larger carbon numbers 10 15 were more accessible to denitrifiers this study provides a new path for the sustainable control of non point source nitrate pollution graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords surface agricultural practices dissolved organic carbon vadose zone groundwater nitrate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrate contamination in groundwater has become a major environmental concern with the successive occurrence of groundwater nitrate overload around the world xin et al 2019 yu et al 2020 excess nitrate in groundwater may cause blooms and eutrophication li et al 2018 and even produce potential hazards to human health such as methemoglobinemia colorectal cancer and thyroid disease zhang et al 2018b non point sources such as nitrogen fertilizers have become the main source of nitrate pollution in groundwater wang et al 2021 compared with its point source counterpart which covers a small area and is relatively easy to mitigate with engineering based strategies the non point source nitrate pollution in groundwater is widely and heterogeneously distributed and extremely difficult to control by technical measures monitored natural attenuation is usually adopted as the most appropriate approach for mitigating nitrate non point source pollution park et al 2016 nevertheless in situ nitrate attenuation capacities in groundwater are fundamentally impacted by hydrogeological conditions making the results appear to be significantly variable in different environments therefore understanding the in situ nitrate attenuation mechanism and finding a feasible means of reinforcing the same is of utmost necessity denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra are the predominant mechanism of natural nitrate attenuation in groundwater singleton et al 2007 su et al 2022 many factors significantly impact the two processes such as ph temperature dissolved oxygen do and dissolved organic carbon doc popp et al 2020 among which doc is considered one of the primary limiting factors hang et al 2016 because doc can provide energy for microorganisms to reduce nitrate however under unfavorable nitrate reduction conditions characterized by low doc levels in situ attenuation fails to adequately protect groundwater quality with natural denitrification and dnra processes lee et al 2017 previous research has overcome this issue by introducing extra carbon sources through injection wells to promote in situ attenuation lee et al 2021 which is not suitable for large scale groundwater non point sources overlain by arable land the impact of extra carbon sources such as acetate glucose calderer et al 2010 succinate and fumarate lee et al 2021 has been well studied over decades of research these studies have helped to obtain further insight into isolated organic components but little is known regarding the role of natural carbon sources which comprise a myriad of heterogeneous organic compounds more recently doc analysis has been significantly improved by the emergence of fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms which allows for the accurate identification of thousands of individual molecular formulas in a single environmental sample nai et al 2020 remucal et al 2020 this technique paves the way for exploring the molecular evolution of doc in natural nitrate attenuation and provides deep insight into the complex carbon source based nitrate attenuation process surface agricultural practices saps such as manure fertilization cover crop planting and straw return have been widely applied to decrease chemical inputs improve soil fertility and enhance agricultural productivity a growing body of literature supports that saps can positively affect soil organic carbon storage li et al 2021 potential denitrification rate qin et al 2017 and aerobic respiratory activity cannavo et al 2004 in the soil profile and soil organic carbon leaching loss vinther et al 2006 however they merely conducted detailed examinations of the surface soil and shallow vadose zone while paying no attention to the link between soil and groundwater recently several site scale evidences suggest that vertical doc infiltration triggered by the implementation of saps may affect groundwater nitrate attenuation alessandrino et al 2021 premrov et al 2012 observed an increase in doc occurrence in groundwater overlain by cover crops and confirmed that the cover crop may greatly enhance natural nitrate attenuation via denitrification jahangir et al 2014 furthermore the multi isotope analysis conducted by li et al 2017 also revealed the occurrence of denitrification in the straw return area possibly corresponding to the potential increase of electron donors in groundwater however there have been no studies regarding which saps are better at removing nitrate from groundwater while minimizing the negative side effects more efforts are required to unveil the driving mechanism of saps in enhancing nitrate attenuation in groundwater which may have strong implications for its practical applicability in this study a combination of soil column and groundwater incubation experiments was conducted to link groundwater behavior with saps carbon and nitrogen responses soil profile leaching characteristics and groundwater nitrogen removal performance to different saps manure fertilization cover crop planting and straw return were investigated to gain insight into the regulatory mechanism ft icr ms and microbial community analyses were conducted the results of this study provide insightful information on the feasibility of selected agricultural practices as an innovative and sustainable strategy to enhance nitrate attenuation in groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and materials samples soil organic amendments groundwater and porous medium were collected from an intensive agricultural area in the north china plain 120 10 16 e 36 31 36 n which is one of the major grain producing regions in china and plays a vital role in ensuring national food security zhang et al 2018a the region has a mean annual precipitation of 680 mm the area was cultivated in a rotation of summer maize and winter wheat with an annual nitrogen fertilizer application rate of 600 kg hm2 the phreatic aquifer zone consists of alluvium and alluvial gravel from the quaternary system with burial depths of 0 5 4 0 m 2 1 1 soil to perform the soil column experiment five soil segments were collected at 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm depths the soil samples were immediately brought to the laboratory and divided into two subsamples one subsample was measured for ph electrical conductivity ec water content maximum water holding capacity bulk density soil texture no3 n no2 n nh4 n dissolved organic nitrogen don total dissolved nitrogen tdn total nitrogen tn doc and total carbon tc another subsample was air dried crushed and sieved to 2 0 mm before being packed into soil columns the basic physicochemical properties of the soils at each depth are listed in table s1 2 1 2 organic amendments considering that manure fertilization cover cropping and straw return are routine practices for improving soil fertility in this agricultural area manure lucerne and straw were used as three representative organic amendments in the soil column experiment before use the organic amendments were air dried ground and sieved to pass through a 2 0 mm mesh the basic physicochemical properties of the organic amendments are presented in table s2 2 1 3 groundwater and porous medium to perform the groundwater incubation experiment groundwater samples were obtained using an organic glass hydrophore gomo et al 2018 water temperature do ec ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were immediately measured on site the porous medium was collected using an auger sd 1 christie engineering australia at a depth of 450 cm with coring tubes extracted from the ground every 100 cm all the collected samples were sealed and transported to the laboratory for pretreatment the basic physicochemical properties of the groundwater and porous medium are listed in text s1 and table s3 2 2 experimental apparatus and methods to explore the connection between saps and groundwater nitrate attenuation behavior a combination of soil column and groundwater incubation experiments was adopted to simulate the vadose zone groundwater coupled system the soil column leaching experiment aimed to investigate the carbon and nitrogen leaching characteristics under the impact of saps and the resulting leachates were sequentially used in the groundwater incubation experiment to quantitatively estimate nitrate attenuation potentials and negative side effects fig 1 2 2 1 soil column experiment a layered soil column was constructed with five soil segments collected at five different soil depths 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm and the soil was moistened to approximately 60 of the maximum water holding capacity and pre incubated at 25 c for a week to recover microbial activity before column packing a soil column with an inner diameter of 6 cm and a length of 120 cm was constructed with polymethyl methacrylate pipes fig 1 the soil was prevented from escaping by first placing a nylon net followed by a 5 0 cm layer of acid washed quartz sand then the prepared soils were packed into the columns in 5 cm increments to a height of 100 cm soil profile about 3 87 kg of the prepared soil was packed into the columns to achieve an average bulk density of about 1 37 g cm 1 a filter paper followed by a 5 0 cm thick acid washed quartz sand was placed on the top of the soil column to uniformly distribute the water to simulate the application of saps the top 20 cm of soil in the column was thoroughly mixed with different organic amendments 1 control 2 manure 3 lucerne and 4 straw as an alternative approach to crop nitrogen fertilizer requirements the tn added by each organic amendment was consistent to meet agricultural production the amounts used were 4 62 4 30 and 16 80 mg in the manure lucerne and straw treatments respectively equivalent to the local field application rate of 600 kg n hm2 each treatment was replicated three times deionized water was added to the columns to represent the mean annual precipitation 680 mm of qingdao city which was applied as five split events during the entire experimental period at an interval of one week for each split event deionized water was added slowly into soil column using a peristaltic pump at the rate of 534 8 μl min 1 for 12 h once a week the leachate from individual columns was collected to measure the ph ec no3 n no2 n nh4 n don tdn and doc furthermore the remaining leachates obtained from parallel columns under the same treatment were mixed and stored at 4 c before the groundwater incubation experiments at the end of the experiment the soil in each layer was sampled to determine the no3 n no2 n nh4 n don tdn and doc concentrations to compare with the carbon and nitrogen contents in each layer of the soil column after leaching we calculated the carbon and nitrogen contents in each layer of the soil column before leaching based on the basic physicochemical properties of soil and organic amendments 2 2 2 groundwater incubation experiment the groundwater incubation experiments were conducted in microcosms containing porous medium 8 g groundwater 2 67 ml and the leachates 0 2 ml in the first leaching event and 0 48 ml in each remaining leaching event from the soil column experiments under control manure lucerne and straw conditions based on the results of the soil column experiment fewer leachates were obtained from the first leaching event than from other leaching events because of the unsaturated state of the columns at the initial stage considering that the leachates collected at different leaching events may contain different dissolved organic matter and result in variable nitrate attenuation enhancement performances three tested groups of added leachates were prepared as follows 1 single group the leachate of the first leaching event 2 three in one group the mixed leachate formed by mixing the leachates of the first three leaching events and 3 five in one group the mixed leachate formed by mixing the leachates of all the leaching events fig 1 anaerobic conditions were introduced by sparging with high purity argon for 1 min all microcosms were whirlpool oscillated to thoroughly mix and then placed in a constant temperature incubator gxz

dissolved nitrogen leaching characteristics fig 2 a shows the doc content of the leachates in the control manure lucerne and straw treatments over the leaching period leachates from the manure lucerne and straw treatments showed consistently higher doc concentrations than the control throughout the soil column experiment in the early phase of the experiment the doc concentration for all the treatments showed an increasing trend and reached a maximum level at the third leaching event after which doc concentrations decreased slowly doc concentrations tended to stabilize from the fourth to the fifth leaching events but persisted on the fifth leaching event doc concentration was much higher in the manure 169 51 mg l lucerne 77 41 mg l and straw treatments 455 05 mg l compared to the control 18 32 mg l indicating a sustainable doc leaching potential that indicates if extreme precipitation or additional diffuse irrigation occurs more doc will possibly access to groundwater compared with the data obtained under the average precipitation scenario in this study total doc export was higher in the manure lucerne and straw treatments than in the control fig 2d among which the straw treatment witnessed the highest total doc export 714 16 mg column this illustrates that saps could potentially promote doc leaching into the groundwater and may be attributable to the addition of organic amendments that directly promoted the formation of the doc pool and enhanced microbial activity which indirectly increased the conversion of soil organic carbon into doc chen et al 2022 figs 2b c and s1 show the dissolved nitrogen no3 n no2 n nh4 n don and tdn content of the leachates in the control manure lucerne and straw treatments over the leaching period in the early phase of the experiment the tdn concentration for all the treatments showed a decreasing trend and reached the minimum level at the third leaching event except for the straw treatment which reached the minimum level at the fourth leaching event subsequently the tdn leaching for all the treatments began to plateau with negligible further leaching during the late phase of the experiment no3 n and don were the dominant forms of tdn in the leachate accounting for 12 29 82 21 and 15 94 45 63 of tdn losses respectively whereas the no2 n and nh4 n contents were relatively low accounting for only 0 08 2 34 and 0 21 2 00 respectively total no3 n export was lower in the manure lucerne and straw treatments than in the control fig 2e among which the straw treatment exhibited the lowest total no3 n export 26 88 mg column this occurred because saps could provide a sufficient carbon source for denitrifying bacteria that ultimately enhances soil denitrification hu et al 2021 qin et al 2017 which corresponded to the high total doc export as previously mentioned furthermore total tdn export in the manure lucerne and straw treatments decreased by 14 47 30 30 and 14 50 respectively compared with the control fig 2f indicating that the nitrogen introduced by organic amendments was lower than the nitrogen removed by soil denitrification to provide more general information we further calculated the annual leaching flux based on the leaching amount of the soil column the results showed that straw treatment witnessed the highest doc leaching flux 252 71 g m 2 yr 1 and lowest nitrate leaching flux 9 51 g m 2 yr 1 the doc and dissolved nitrogen no3 n no2 n nh4 n and don contents in soil layers collected from each treatment before and after leaching are presented in figs s2 and s3 before leaching the doc and dissolved nitrogen contents for all the treatments were mainly concentrated in the surface soil layer of 0 20 cm compared to the control the doc and dissolved nitrogen content increased 5 02 7 12 and 23 37 times and 1 73 1 17 and 2 77 times in the manure lucerne and straw treatments respectively the results showed that the incorporation of organic amendments boosted the contents of carbon and nitrogen in the surface soil of 0 20 cm consistent with the properties of organic amendments table s2 moreover dissolved nitrogen was mainly in the form of no3 n don and nh4 n fig s3 after leaching the doc content in the surface soil layer 0 20 cm markedly decreased while the doc content in the deeper soil layers 20 100 cm generally increased in all the treatments this confirmed that the doc content in deeper soil was mainly derived from leaching and provided evidence to support the vertical migration of doc from the surface soil to the groundwater a similar phenomenon also existed in the dissolved nitrogen namely the dissolved nitrogen in the surface soil migrated downward into the deep soil and dissolved nitrogen in each soil layer mostly contained don and nh4 n fig s3 which indicated that no3 n was readily leached into groundwater 3 2 effects of different leachates on groundwater no3 n attenuation figs 3 and s4 present the dissolved nitrogen no3 n no2 n n2on nh4 n don and tdn and doc contents of microcosms receiving different groups of leachates following a 20 day groundwater incubation experiment in all cases except for the single group nitrate reduction could be divided into two phases with fast and slow dynamics the kinetics of the fast phase the first two days of incubation appeared to be first order text s4 and fitting that model to the data gave the rate constants k presented in table s4 generally the no3 n content for all the treatments decreased rapidly in the fast phase and then slowed down in the slow phase the dynamics of the doc content followed a similar pattern as that of the no3 n content in all the treatments where a decreasing trend was observed in the first two days and then remained constant after two days interestingly different no3 n reduction patterns were observed when receiving different groups of leachates after the leachate of the single group was added all the treatments displayed poor no3 n reduction efficiency with no3 n remaining at approximately 81 52 90 71 after 20 d of incubation and poor reaction rate ranging at 0 007 0 012 mg day which can be attributed to the low c n ratio molar ratio 0 24 0 26 the same below in the leachate from the first sampling event however with the supplementation of the three in one leachate the 20 day no3 n reduction efficiency and rate increased to 24 34 46 93 66 15 and 95 93 and 0 014 0 223 0 384 and 1 634 mg day in the control manure lucerne and straw treatments respectively in comparison the five in one groups showed a slight further improvement in nitrate elimination resulting in no3 n reduction efficiencies of 22 68 85 19 66 36 and 92 93 and reduction rates of 0 051 0 806 0 606 and 1 627 mg day in the control manure lucerne and straw treatments respectively a progressive shift towards faster no3 n reduction rate from single group to five in one group was confirmed by significant positive relationship between the no3 n reduction rate and c n ratio fig s5 this confirmed the importance of an adequate carbon source for nitrate reduction and illustrated that the nitrate attenuation enhancement effect increased with increasing c n of the leachate furthermore the no3 n reduction efficiency and rate in the straw treatment 13 66 95 93 and 0 007 1 634 mg day were much higher than that in the other treatments 9 29 85 19 and 0 007 0 806 mg day which indicated that straw return could enhance nitrate attenuation more efficiently than other saps this can be attributed almost exclusively to the high content of doc fig 3 and the highest c n ratio maintained table s4 in the straw treatment corresponding to its highest doc leaching potential in the soil column experiment although a decrease in no3 n content was observed in all the treatments there were distinctive dynamic changes in nitrate reduction products no2 n n2o n and nh4 n among the different treatments considering that nitrate reduction was not obvious in the single group and the distributions of reaction products were similar in the three in one and five in one groups we discuss the five in one group in detail as an example in the straw treatment the content of no2 n dramatically accumulated during the initial two days and then was subsequently removed which reflected the occurrence of incomplete denitrification in a short incubation time moreover the no2 n accumulated peak corresponded to the point of no3 n exhaustion owing to differences in denitrification enzyme activity between nitrate and nitrite reductases cui et al 2017 thus the accumulated no2 n began to decline rapidly when the no3 n was completely consumed there was almost no residual no2 n n2o n and nh4 n and n2 selectivity was up 99 78 at the end of the experiment this demonstrated that the straw treatment was sufficient for complete denitrification and almost no dnra occurred unlike the straw treatment the manure and lucerne treatments shared similar patterns of no3 n transformation the content of no2 n increased rapidly during the first two days and then remained steady after two days the maximal ntr1 was 58 57 and 65 24 in the manure and lucerne treatments respectively which indicated that much of the removed no3 n was transformed to no2 n without further reduction this may have occurred because of an insufficient supply of carbon sources liu et al 2021b furthermore the n2on content increased slowly after day 10 reaching a maximum level on day 20 when ntr2 was 5 89 and 6 91 in the manure and lucerne treatments respectively which indicated that part of the removed no3 n was converted to n2o n without further reduction the increase in n2o n after day 10 may be attributed to the accumulation of no2 n which is consistent with previous findings that high concentrations of no2 n can inhibit the activity of nitrous oxide reductase park et al 2001 in addition the nh4 n content increased slowly after day 5 reaching a maximum level on day 20 when ntr3 was 3 26 and 3 69 in the manure and lucerne treatments respectively which may be attributed to the occurrence of dnra eventually there was substantial residual no2 n n2o n and nh4 n and the n2 selectivity was merely 51 26 and 45 47 in the manure and lucerne treatments respectively this demonstrates that the manure and lucerne treatments were dominated by incomplete denitrification with low dnra occurrence overall a no3 n reduction of 66 36 92 93 in groundwater under the average annual precipitation scenario was achieved for all saps used in this study the missing nitrogen was likely product of denitrification coinciding with the enrichment of doc promoted by leachates in the groundwater nevertheless it should also be noted that significant amounts of dissolved nitrogen were initially introduced into the groundwater by leachates to objectively evaluate the nitrate attenuation enhancement performance of various leachates groundwater porous medium included was considered as a black box and nitrogen balance was a measure of nitrogen input from leachates minus gaseous nitrogen loss a negative nitrogen balance was observed in the straw treatment whereas a positive nitrogen balance was more popular in the other treatments fig s6 this indicates that net nitrogen removal can only be achieved in the straw treatment which further supports straw return as the optimal sap both in terms of the net dissolved nitrogen removal and product composition 3 3 molecular characteristics and transformation of doc as found in section 3 2 that the no3 n reduction rate was significantly correlated with c n ratio a pertinent question then arises on whether the different doc composition in various leachates would also cast a prominent effect on the denitrification process in groundwater then ft icr ms analysis was performed to further understand the doc evolution of incubation process considering that the five in one group exhibited optimal denitrification performance the doc molecular characteristics of the microcosms were analyzed by ft icr ms in the control manure lucerne and straw treatments receiving the five in one leachate group on days 0 and 20 these docs were composed of cho 47 19 61 96 followed by chno 23 03 37 08 chos 11 83 24 11 and chnos 2 47 5 68 fig s7a on day 0 pronounced differences in doc composition were observed among the different treatments compared with the control 9 77 the protein content was significantly higher in the manure lucerne and straw treatments with 19 42 24 62 and 17 47 respectively this shows that the increase in protein in groundwater was promoted by saps which made the denitrifiers much more accessible to biodegradable doc to reduce no3 n specifically carbohydrates were abundant in the straw treatment 1 39 which was more easily utilized by the denitrifiers consistent with the highest no3 n reduction efficiency and rate as previously mentioned in section 3 2 furthermore dbewa was comparatively lower in the manure lucerne and straw treatments than in the control suggesting an increase in doc saturation in groundwater under saps table s5 in addition a significant difference in doc composition was observed between the day 0 and day 20 samples for the four treatments compared with day 0 the content of biodegradable compounds such as proteins decreased whereas the content of refractory compounds such as tannins increased fig s7b to better clarify the molecular transformation in the incubation processes under various treatments the doc molecules were screened to make up reactive stable and formed pools detailed screening principles in text s5 reactive pool indicated the molecules those were preferentially transformed during incubation stable pool indicated the molecules with little change in content during incubation and the formed pool indicated molecules with significantly increased content after incubation around 1163 3049 molecules were reactive in the incubation accounting for 6 74 36 83 of the molecules in the day 0 samples table s6 approximately 1170 4063 molecules were formed after incubation contributing to 12 74 53 35 of the molecules in the day 20 samples table s6 generally the reactive molecules in all the treatments had relatively higher dbewa and mwwa than other molecules in the day 0 samples indicating that doc with large molecules and unsaturated groups was preferentially transformed during the incubation processes table s6 to further examine the characteristics of the reactive molecules under various treatments in the day 0 samples the reactive molecules were divided into four groups namely cho doc chno doc chos doc and chnos doc the dbe of the samples in this study exhibited a broad range of distributions fig 4 a and figs s8 s10 indicating the prevalence of double bonds and cycloalkane structures in the groundwater doc interestingly the reactive molecules for all the treatments mainly occupied the chos region with a lower dbe 0 5 as well as a larger carbon number 10 15 fig 4a the results indicate that chos molecules with a higher degree of saturation and complexity were more easily utilized by denitrifiers the reactive chos molecules from all the treatments were identified into 12 subcategories based on the amount of oxygen and sulfur atoms o3s1 o14s1 fig 4b the reactive oxs1 group was mainly concentrated in the o4s1 o10s1 subcategories with relatively higher abundances suggesting the potential presence of sulfurous functional groups with high oxidation liu et al 2021a such as so3h groups in the reactive chos component moreover the reactive chos molecules were mostly proteins with some lignin fig 4c consistent with the fact that chos doc in nature are mainly proteins liu et al 2021a given this new finding the abundance of proteins 17 47 and high c n ratio of the leachate reported in section 3 2 from the straw treatment could further explain its excellent denitrification enhancement potential and prove that straw return contributed to more bioaccessible components 3 4 bacterial community characteristics of the porous medium 3 4 1 richness and diversity of bacterial communities the structures of the bacterial communities in the porous medium were analyzed by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing analysis in the control manure lucerne and straw treatments under different groups on days 0 and 20 all rarefaction curves reached a plateau with high coverage estimators 98 suggesting that the diversity of the bacterial communities was deeply captured by the 16s rrna gene sequence database compared with the original porous medium the decrease in the simpson index and the increase in the shannon chao and ace indices indicated that saps increased the groundwater bacterial diversity and richness table s7 3 4 2 bacterial communities shift at the phylum level proteobacteria and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla altogether accounting for 63 71 80 97 of the total bacterial phyla in all the treatments fig 5 a proteobacteria which includes most of the denitrifying bacteria liu et al 2020 was higher in the manure 37 65 54 41 lucerne 45 37 68 04 and straw treatments 29 90 68 94 compared to the control 27 34 41 56 indicating that the saps could promote the removal of nitrogen in groundwater actinobacteria which mainly participate in the carbon cycle of humus decomposition yang et al 2018 showed an opposite distribution pattern with a relatively lower abundance in the manure 3 51 8 12 lucerne 1 54 7 32 and straw 1 34 5 20 treatments compared to that in the control 7 41 11 93 this may be associated with the fact that a considerable portion of refractory doc was observed in the control and further supported that more biodegradable organic species were introduced by the saps applications bacteroidota which consists of numerous bacteria known for their decomposition of proteins chen et al 2018 was more prevalent in the manure 2 10 4 00 lucerne 2 10 5 31 and straw treatments 1 34 4 15 than in the control 1 26 3 19 this finding was in agreement with the high protein content in the manure lucerne and straw treatments evidenced by ft icr ms data and further supported that protein may be a dominant contributor to biodegradable doc and largely drive denitrification additionally firmicutes which can metabolize in aerobic or anoxic environments and have denitrifying activity zuo et al 2019 also deserve attention the relative abundance of firmicutes was highest in the straw treatment 1 03 12 11 compared with the control 0 94 1 57 manure 0 68 2 04 and lucerne treatments 0 81 2 31 indicating that straw return could provide a more conducive environment for the enrichment of denitrifiers in groundwater to further understand the bacterial community related to no3 n consumption in the nitrogen removal system the relative abundances of denitrifying genera were detected in the four treatments similar to the ft icr ms analysis we discuss the five in one group in detail as an example according to previous literature liu et al 2020 2022 all denitrifying genera in the porous medium were screened and the results are presented in fig 5b denitrifying bacteria were abundant in the straw treatment accounting for 61 32 of the total bacterial genera which was higher than the control 43 25 manure 46 57 and lucerne 34 37 treatments this coincided with the highest no3 n reduction efficiency of the straw treatment as previously shown in section 3 2 in the straw treatment the relative abundances of pseudomonas 23 69 simplicispira 8 24 and rhodoferax 5 56 some typical strict anoxic heterotrophic denitrifiers liu et al 2020 sperfeld et al 2018 was higher than those in the other treatments this explains the possibility of better denitrification in the straw treatment moreover acidovorax a denitrifying genus known for its utilization of carbohydrates liu et al 2020 was abundant in the straw treatment 1 69 compared to the control 0 04 manure 0 89 and lucerne 0 55 treatments corresponding to the observed higher carbohydrate content of the straw treatment in the ft icr ms analysis therefore we inferred that the increased size of the labile doc pool due to straw return was a key factor that favored nitrate attenuation in groundwater 3 5 environmental implications our results show that saps can be adopted for efficient nitrate removal from groundwater by regulating the export of terrestrial doc this finding has profound implications for the mitigation of nitrate non point source pollution in groundwater given that the proportion and composition of carbon containing organic amendments are very different the generation of more and better bioaccessible doc from straw return is a promising approach for stimulating efficient nitrate removal from groundwater in addition straw return a typical agricultural practice and biomass reuse method works to stimulate denitrification in groundwater as a side job and avoid extra investments for groundwater remediation if in situ straw return can be harnessed well better no3 n removal higher n2 selectivity and less nitrogen input are expected in practices for sustainably controlling non point source nitrate pollution however scale up of the results and the potentials of in situ application as an attenuation method for non point source nitrate should be more focused including migration of nitrate through unsaturated zone exhaustion of biodegradable organic materials over time etc in addition the complex mechanism under actual hydrogeological conditions like pyrite oxidation anoxic nitrification coupled to mn oxide reduction and that heterotrophic nitrifying aerobic denitrifying bacteria capable of denitrification utom et al 2020 could impact the denitrification enhancement potential of straw return further field studies are required to characterize their long term performance and provide a basis for application guidance 4 conclusions saps based regulations were conducted in the vadose zone groundwater coupled system to investigate the responses of soil profile leaching characteristics and groundwater nitrogen removal performance in this study the soil column experiment showed that saps promoted doc and reduced nitrate leaching into groundwater with the highest doc leaching export and lowest nitrate leaching export detected in the straw treatment the groundwater incubation experiment showed that the denitrification was not significantly promoted after receiving the leachate from the first leaching event whereas with the c n ratio of the leachate increased in the following leaching events the denitrification enhancement effect was significantly promoted accordingly corresponding with its highest doc leaching potential leachates from the straw treatment induced the best nitrate reduction efficiency as well as the minimized negative environmental impacts the high c n ratio and abundance of proteins in the leachate from the straw treatment could explain its excellent denitrification enhancement potential therefore straw return is very promising for addressing agriculture derived nitrate contamination issues in groundwater

14761,urban stormwater conveys dissolved pollutants micropollutants particulate matter natural debris and anthropogenic macrodebris to receiving waters though it is widely recognized that anthropogenic macrodebris mobilized by stormwater contributes to global pollution management issues e g ocean garbage patches these materials often are not the focus of stormwater sampling campaigns furthermore macrodebris can cause clogging of sewer systems exacerbating flooding and public health hazards due to their engineered structures draining directly connected impervious areas e g catch basins inlets and pipes roads present a unique opportunity to mitigate the conveyance of macrodebris in stormwater to optimize control measures data are needed to understand expected volume and mass of macrodebris in road runoff to address this gap in knowledge a field monitoring study was conducted in ohio usa to quantify the mass volume and moisture content of macrodebris transported by road runoff designed to filter macrodebris i e material with diameter greater than 5 mm while maintaining drainage purpose built inserts were deployed in catch basins at eleven geographically diverse

transportation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction macrodebris is an urban stormwater pollutant comprised of organic material e g leaves branches and grass clippings litter e g plastic metal glass paper cardboard and styrofoam and large particulate matter e g fragments of pavement and gravel macrodebris also known as gross solids are characterized by caltrans and the water environment research federation among others by a particle diameter greater than 5 mm allison et al 1998a kim et al 2006 roesner et al 2007 treilles et al 2021 macrodebris are often unaccounted for in research studies on urban runoff due to the restrictive 9 5 mm diameter of the sample tubing using in conjunction with automated samplers a portion of the macrodebris load in stormwater is composed of anthropogenic refuse which left unchecked contributes to global scale pollution management issues such as ocean garbage patches these negatively affect aquatic ecosystems create hazards for shipping lanes and lead to negative socioeconomic impacts van sebille et al 2012 gall and thompson 2015 in response total maximum daily loads tmdls for trash have been established in several watersheds across the u s e g california regional water quality control board 2007 to inform these regulatory limits it is important to quantify the contribution of macrodebris conveyed by road runoff to implement evaluate and refine mitigation strategies further knowledge of macrodebris volume and mass can guide the design of pretreatment devices for stormwater control measures scms and catch basin inserts macrodebris in urban runoff has been characterized in watersheds in california wisconsin minnesota canada south africa australia and france prasad et al 1980 dorney 1986 allison et al 1998b marais et al 2001 kim et al 2006 kalinosky et al 2013 treilles et al 2021 most studies have focused on macrodebris mass while their volume may be particularly important for macrodebris treatment system design as well as to estimate treatment system maintenance frequency research at both the site and watershed scale indicates that the vast majority i e 80 90 by mass of macrodebris conveyed by urban runoff is composed of vegetation allison et al 1998b alam et al 2017 chrispijn 2004 land use influences macrodebris mass loading rates loads ranging from 0 04 to 6 8 kg ha have been reported for watersheds with a variety of land use types i e mixed residential commercial low and high density residential and dense urban centers in australia and the u s allison et al 1996b waickowski 2015 higher debris loads have been observed in sites with greater tree abundance and catchment area though efforts such as street sweeping programs were shown to reduce macrodebris accumulation in stormwater catch basins waickowski 2015 roads provide opportunities for both the generation e g litter vehicle parts grass clippings etc and conveyance i e along curb and gutter systems drained by catch basins of macrodebris to receiving waters however few studies have been performed to date which explore both the quantity and composition of macrodebris from roads in a study of six highway monitoring sites in southern california kim et al 2006 found 90 of macrodebris volume was made up of vegetation and 10 of anthropogenic litter and was generated at loading rates between 1 2 13 3 kg ha similarly the dry weight of macrodebris samples from four road sites in north carolina collected on an approximately weekly basis ranged between 0 2 1 6 kg ha winston and hunt 2017 more research is needed to characterize macrodebris mobilization by road runoff to inform debris management activities e g street sweeping and the design of engineered retrofits such as pretreatment devices to limit debris conveyance through sewer networks further research which evaluates the volume and moisture content of macrodebris in addition to mass and loading rates is needed to understand the potential implications of macrodebris characteristics on final disposal in landfills precipitation patterns influence the mass of macrodebris conveyed in urban runoff with positive correlations identified between macrodebris mass and rainfall depth waickowski 2015 winston and hunt 2017 macrodebris loads were also influenced by peak rainfall intensity suggesting that bursts of intense rainfall mobilized a larger mass of macrodebris winston and hunt 2017 seasonal trends as well as correlation between tree canopy cover and macrodebris generation have been observed perhaps unsurprising given the high proportion of vegetation found in stormwater conveyed macrodebris hobie et al 2014 waickowski 2015 however relatively little is known about the influence of traffic characteristics on macrodebris from roads which may have important implications on the need for targeted retrofit measures e g catch basin inserts or frequency of maintenance activities such as street sweeping though these studies shed light on factors affecting macrodebris conveyed in urban runoff research is needed to investigate other factors which may contribute to macrodebris mobilization including climatic geographic and critically traffic related factors further there is a need to explore retrofits to roadside drainage infrastructure to improve the trapping of macrodebris and prevent the conveyance of large organic material particulate debris and litter to receiving water bodies the objective of this study was to quantify the volume mass and moisture content of macrodebris contributed by runoff from roads over single rainfall events and annually to inform the design of catch basin inserts and pretreatment devices for scms further factors such as road watershed and hyetograph characteristics were explored to understand key drivers in macrodebris generation 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of monitored sites eleven sites across the state of ohio usa were selected for monitoring fig 1 the sites were located in the franklin delaware hamilton montgomery allen portage and lake counties table 1 weather in the state is varied with both humid hot summers and cold winter weather annually the state receives between 965 and 1092 mm of precipitation monitored catchments consisted solely of road drainage constrained by curb and gutter several factors which potentially influence macrodebris were considered during site selection including rainfall patterns pavement type number of travel lanes annual average daily traffic aadt posted speed limits adjacent land use relative vegetation coverage and development density were selected to bracket the range of mass and volume of macrodebris generated from roads relative vegetation coverage provides qualitative approximation of pervious cover in areas surrounding catch basin and ranges from high e g the catch basin along sr 48 which was adjacent to a grassed shoulder and several large deciduous trees to low e g the catch basin along us 20 with nearly no nearby vegetation due to equipment and personnel limitations monitoring was performed during two periods data were collected at five sites in 2016 and six sites in 2017 monitoring sites were identified by the corresponding road identifier i 70 and i 90 were interstate highways us 22 sr 43 sr 48 sr 49 sr 59 and sr 81 were principal arterials and sr 117 sr 257 and us 20 were minor arterials interstate highways principal arterials and minor arterials in this study had aadt above 30 000 between 10 000 25 000 and less than 10 000 vehicles per day vpd respectively odot 2018 similarly posted speed limits were 105 113 kph 56 89 kph and 56 89 kph respectively the wearing course at all sites was asphalt except for us 20 and i 90 which were paved with concrete 2 2 field data collection and laboratory analysis each site employed curb and gutter drainage systems which discharged stormwater into catch basins within one catch basin along each road table 1 macrodebris were filtered from stormwater and collected in purpose built catch basin inserts these inserts were built from aluminum angle iron supports which fit inside the catch basin frame and allowed the grate to be reinstalled so that water could flow freely into the grate fig 2 attached to the angle iron was a wire mesh netting with an aperture of 5 mm to capture all macrodebris larger than this diameter each catch basin insert was 61 cm long 30 cm wide and 41 cm deep providing a maximum potential storage of 0 075 m3 for macrodebris storage a wooden diverter was affixed to the curb and gutter to ensure that all stormwater passed through the catch basin insert fig 2 macrodebris samples were collected from in 2016 at i 70 us 22 sr 257 sr 48 and sr 49 and in 2017 at i 90 sr 59 sr 43 us 20 sr 81 and sr 117 table 1 sampling window duration varied from 193 to 233 days during each site visit for sample collection the macrodebris retained inside the catch basin insert was placed in either 3 8 l resealable plastic bags or 151 4 l garbage bags depending on the total accumulated sample volume since the previous site visit samples were subsequently stored in a laboratory refrigerator at 4 c until sample analysis was performed macrodebris was collected on average every 11 6 days so a single macrodebris sample could represent debris mobilized during dry weather wind events or one or multiple precipitation events the volume and mass of each macrodebris sample were analyzed in the laboratory following collection samples were first categorized as either dry moderate or wet by visual observation sample wet weight was determined using a laboratory scale intelligent weighing technology model pc 20 001 supplementary material fig s1 the loose bulk volume was determined by measuring depth of macrodebris in a bin to the nearest 1 6 mm at six locations and converting to volume using the known depth volume relationship determined using bin dimensions macrodebris were separated into one of nine categories by visual inspection natural vegetation e g grass leaves twigs cigarettes plastic fabric wood glass metal paper and gravel these subsamples were weighed to obtain subsample wet weights and measured for subsample volume dry weights were measured on a subset of samples from each of the three moisture content categories collected in 2017 i e seven dry five moderate and eight wet samples after drying in an oven for 24 h at 105 c the total sample mass was then measured and sample drying was repeated until no change in total sample mass was recorded over each additional 24 h drying window the sample was then separated into the nine categories and weighed to understand which categories retained the most water

obstructions rainfall depth measured on a 1 min interval by the tipping bucket rain gage was stored on hobo pendant loggers onset computer corporation bourne ma and downloaded monthly total rainfall depth since the previous site visit as measured by the manual rain gage was also recorded 2 3 data analysis discrete storm events were identified by a minimum adp of 6 hr and rainfall depth of 2 5 mm the following descriptive statistics were determined for each macrodebris sample season elapsed time since the previous sample collection total rainfall depth total rainfall duration maximum peak 5 min rainfall intensity mean rainfall intensity and longest dry period which occurred since the previous macrodebris sample collection traffic and site characteristics including aadt pavement type functional class speed limit surrounding land use and development density i e rural suburban or urban were also tabulated after testing for normality the kruskal wallis test was utilized to determine whether differences in the mass and volume of macrodebris at each site were affected by site characteristics e g aadt speed limit pavement type functional class etc seasonality of macrodebris mass and volume was also explored using dunn s test with a bonferroni correction finally data were utilized in spearman s rank correlation multiple linear regression and multiple comparisons using dunn s test with a bonferroni correction to determine how climatic conditions and site characteristics were related to the transport of total and categorical macrodebris volume and mass cumulative mass kg and

fraction i e percent by weight and volume of the total sample represented by each macrodebris category was calculated box plots were used to visually represent both the mean composition i e mean percent by mass and by volume and cumulative mass and volume of macrodebris samples collected at each site multivariable linear models were created using backward selection to identify the effects of rainfall and site characteristics on macrodebris volume and mass james et al 2021 for samples analyzed for dry weight the weight of evaporated water was enumerated as a percentage of the dry weight i e the moisture content this analysis was completed for each macrodebris sample and for the nine macrodebris categories statistical analysis using the kruskal wallis test with follow up multiple paired comparisons using dunn s test with a bonferroni correction was utilized to determine whether the dry moderate and wet samples were statistically different moisture content data were compared to levels suitable for landfilling of municipal solid waste miller et al 2016 all statistical analyses were performed in the statistical software r version 3 5 1 r core team 2018 data were analyzed using a criterion of 95 confidence α 0 05 unless otherwise noted 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary of dataset monitoring period duration defined as the duration between the installation and removal of the catch basin inserts varied from 193 to 233 d with a mean of 213 6 d sites were visited to collect samples every 11 6 7 3 d mean std dev with a minimum of 4 d and a maximum of 55 d between sample collection across the 11 monitored sites a total of 202 macrodebris samples were collected during 2016 and 2017 the number of macrodebris samples collected by site varied from 14 to 22 with a mean of 18 3 samples the majority of the samples were obtained during the summer months 103 with autumn 60 and spring 39 accounting for the remaining samples collected sampling was discontinued during winter months due to freezing conditions of the 202 total samples 110 were visually identified as dry 54 4 33 as moderately wet 16 3 and 59 as wet 29 2 3 2 rainfall summary statistics substantial variability in rainfall characteristics was observed over the monitoring period fig 3 however no significant differences between sites were observed for rainfall depth duration peak intensity average intensity or adp p values 0 50 as supported by the lack of clustering of data points for single sites in fig 3 thus rainfall statistics in fig 3 summarize data for macrodebris samples from all sites rainfall depth across the sampling windows varied from a minimum of 2 5 mm to a maximum of 179 6 mm with a median value of 23 4 mm rain event duration varied from 0 5 h to 134 h with a median value of 9 1 h peak 5 min 6 1 94 5 mm hr and average 0 5 77 0 mm hr rainfall intensities varied over similar ranges median adp per sampling window was 6 9 days and varied from 0 4 days to 28 4 days the substantial variability in climatic variables observed among the collected samples indicated that the data set is robust and provides a reliable indication of the mass and volume of macrodebris from typical roads in ohio 3 3 volume of macrodebris macrodebris volume l data are summarized in fig 4 and table 2 mean total macrodebris volume for each sample varied from 1 48 to 10 49 l across the 11 sites maximum volume retained during a given sampling window varied from 4 35 to 66 62 l across the sites the maximum macrodebris volume observed was at sr 48 on november 8 2016 where leaves from a nearby deciduous tree completely filled the catch basin insert with vegetation representing 98 of the resulting total sample volume this trend held true across the broader data set with vegetation contributing on average 3 94 l of the mean 4 66 l total macrodebris volume collected across all sites during each sampling visit i e 80 3 by volume the volume of all other macrodebris categories represented less than 0 38 l per sampling window glass n 179 202 metal n 181 202 and fabric n 174 202 were often not observed in macrodebris in road runoff in contrast vegetation was found in all 202 samples the maximum volume recorded for each macrodebris category was 66 62 l total volume 65 49 l vegetation 4 32 l gravel 2 91 l plastic 2 42 l cigarettes 2 23 l fabric 1 78 l paper with glass metal and wood representing 1 14 l or less these maxima did not coincide during a single sampling window total sampled macrodebris at the 11 sites varied from 28 01 to 220 31 l during the respective monitoring periods normalizing these data by the drainage area contributing runoff to the catch basin as well as the sampling window duration the volumetric loading rate of total macrodebris varied from 2 89 to 16 07 l ha day mean 8 56 l ha day this corresponds to an average of 3123 l ha yr of macrodebris entering each catch basin in this study these data could be utilized to size and predict maintenance intervals for forebays or to inform the development of tmdls for trash loading vegetation was the primary contributor to macrodebris volume at all 11 sites figs s2 s3 and represented between 63 5 95 5 of total macrodebris volume by site mean 80 3 secondary contributors to macrodebris volume included cigarettes five sites plastic four sites and gravel two sites secondary contributors were dramatically less important contributing between 1 7 12 6 of total macrodebris volume mean 7 2 tertiary contributors to total macrodebris volume were cigarettes four sites plastic three sites wood two sites and gravel and paper one site each tertiary contributors to macrodebris volume represented between 1 1 9 1 of the total mean 5 1 using the kruskal wallis omnibus test significant differences were observed among sites for the volume of total macrodebris vegetation cigarettes plastic and wood additionally glass and paper were significantly different among sites at the α 0 10 level follow up paired comparisons using the dunn s test with a bonferroni correction highlighted a number of significant differences between sites table 3 but showed no differences in paper or glass volume between sites the i 70 site produced significantly greater total macrodebris volume than i 90 sr 117 us 22 sr 257 sr 49 and sr 81 perhaps due to its aadt which was approximately three times larger than the next greatest aadt table 1 sr 43 sr 48 sr 59 and us 20 had significantly greater total macrodebris volume than sr 117 sr 257 and sr 81 pointing to differences in the volume of macrodebris generated in higher trafficked urban and suburban routes compared to less trafficked minor arterials in rural areas table 1 since vegetation made up between 63 and 96 of total volume it is not surprising results of statistical testing for this category were similar to those for total volume table 3 stormwater from i 70 sr 43 and us 20 had significantly more cigarette volume than sr 117 us 22 sr 257 sr 48 sr 49 and sr 81 i 90 and sr 49 had a greater volume of cigarettes than sr 257 for plastic and wood volume i 70 and us 20 frequently produced greater volumes than other sites observed debris from vehicular accidents and plastic bottles from a nearby supermarket were the main contributors of plastic at i 70 and us 20 respectively wood consisted of pieces of lumber presumably from work vehicles the omnibus test showed there were significant differences in total volume vegetation cigarettes and plastic between seasons follow up paired comparisons showed total macrodebris vegetation and cigarette volume were significantly greater in the fall than in the spring or summer p 0 001 similarly plastic volume was greater in the fall than in the summer p 0 10 seasonality in vegetation volume was expected especially at the five sites with nearby deciduous trees i e sr 48 us 20 us 22 sr 49 and sr 59 mean daily total macrodebris volume across the 11 sites in the fall was 0 61 l day significantly higher than the 0 19 l day and 0 34 l day observed in spring and summer respectively since vegetation represented between 63 and 96 of total macrodebris volume depending on site it was not surprising seasonal trends were also observed for total macrodebris volume trends observed in cigarette presence in macrodebris samples followed those of vegetation rather than a seasonal change in the incidence of smoking perhaps during spring and summer passing cars may force this low weight litter toward the side of the road cigarettes were often trapped by leaf piles perhaps transported there by wind along the curb line alam et al 2017 found that wind speed was the most important factor in dry weather macrodebris loading thus these seasonal patterns indicate that the leaves appear to catch the cigarettes during the autumn results of spearman s correlation analyses are presented in fig 5 site characteristics were poorly correlated to macrodebris volume with speed limit not correlated to a single macrodebris category aadt was significantly albeit weakly 0 2 ρ 0 4 correlated to total macrodebris volume vegetation cigarettes and plastic supporting significant differences between road characteristics and macrodebris accumulation observed in tables 1 and 3 rainfall characteristics such as depth and duration were weakly correlated to total volume and plastic contrasting with results in alam et al 2017 where macrodebris was significantly correlated to rainfall depth elapsed time since the previous sample was collected was weakly correlated to total volume vegetation gravel cigarettes and plastic this metric serves as a predictor of build up processes but does not account for wash off processes including wind and rain since the previous sampling window given the weak correlations between macrodebris volume and site specific and rainfall characteristics categorical differences between sites e g functional class surrounding land use etc were also considered as potential influential factors to the composition of macrodebris differences in macrodebris volume were also observed between different road functional classes i e interstate principal arterial and minor arterial and land uses interstate locations exhibited significantly larger volumes of vegetation compared to minor arterials p 0 05 cigarettes plastic both p 0 05 and wood p 0 1 were also significantly higher on interstate locations compared to minor arterials a reasonable result given the differences in aadt between these sites table 1 interstate sites also produced greater volumes of cigarettes plastic wood and total macrodebris than principal arterial routes while the volume of total macrodebris and vegetation were significantly higher on principal arterials compared to minor arterial routes no differences were observed for glass metal fabric gravel or paper similar results were observed between land uses with higher total and categorical macrodebris volumes generally produced from commercial high density and low density residential catchments compared to agricultural areas multiple linear regression suggested that on average four times more total macrodebris volume per sampling window was derived from urban sites 24 23 l than suburban 5 11 l or rural 7 27 l sites similar trends were observed for vegetation volume of cigarettes and plastic from urban sites was two times greater than from rural sites no differences were observed between urban suburban and rural sites for fabric gravel or paper these data suggest macrodebris reduction efforts should target interstate and principal arterial locations near highly trafficked commercial or high density residential urban and suburban areas to mitigate macrodebris generation though more research is needed in an expanded geographic area to confirm these trends multivariable linear regression using backward selection resulted in the following model of macrodebris volume 2 v o l 2 59 2 55 s e a s o n s p r i n g 2 54 s e a s o n s u m m e r 3 29 n o t u r n l a n e s 1 19 10 4 a a d t where vol is macrodebris volume l seasonal terms i e seasonspring and seasonsummer are binary values e g 1 or 0 to indicate the current season no turn lanes is the number of turn lanes and aadt is annual average daily traffic vehicles per day p 0 01 r2 0 35 the relationships between both season as well as aadt and macrodebris volume were unsurprising lower macrodebris volumes can be expected in spring and summer seasons prior to leaf drop additionally increased traffic loads introduce additional opportunities for debris to become deposited on roadways and conveyed in runoff conversely the relationship between the number of turn lanes and macrodebris volume was unexpected it is possible that larger number of turn lanes provide more opportunities for macrodebris to be carried by runoff via both sheet flow and concentrated flow however given the degree of variance of this variable i e ranging from 0 to 1 table 1 in the sites studied herein further investigation of catch basins selected specifically based on the number of turn lanes in contributing catchments may be needed to confirm this hypothesis interestingly no other variables related to site characteristics were included in final models suggesting traffic loads and seasonal trends may be the best predictors of macrodebris volume 3 4 mass of macrodebris box plots illustrating total and categorical macrodebris by site are presented in fig 6 mean total wet weight per sampling window varied from 0 05 to 3 57 kg mean of all samples was 0 53 kg table 4 normalizing for the area of the catchment draining to each catch basin and the sampling window duration mass loading rates varied from 0 10 to 5 22 kg ha day with a mean rate of 0 79 kg ha day this corresponds to an average of 287 kg ha yr wet weight of macrodebris entering each catch basin in this study this mass loading rate is considerably lower than four commercial watersheds range 878 3676 kg ha yr monitored in australia chrispijn 2004 alam et al 2017 but within the range of loading rates 11 359 kg ha yr observed for various densities of residential development and downtown areas in four cities in north carolina usa waickowski 2015 however this macrodebris loading rate exceeds that observed in nine urban catchments in cape town south africa where marais et al 2001 observed 2 62 kg ha yr median 40 kg ha yr of organic debris and 0 27 kg ha yr median 10 kg ha yr of anthropogenic refuse cardboard and plastic at each catchment outfall factors such as total annual rainfall and the presence of deciduous vegetation which vary considerably across the regions discussed above might lead to the vast differences in annual macrodebris mass loading rates reported in the literature maximum macrodebris weight collected from a given site over any sampling window varied from 0 01 kg to 28 08 kg the sample with the largest weight was collected at i 70 following both mowing of the adjacent shoulder as well as several vehicular accidents which contributed macrodebris to the catch basin the weight of this sample was nearly five times greater than the second heaviest sample collected during the monitoring period vegetation made up most of the sample weight fig 6 mean sample weights across all sites were 0 54 kg for total macrodebris mass 0 45 kg for vegetation 0 04 kg for plastic 0 03 kg for gravel 0 02 kg for fabric 0 02 kg for cigarettes and glass metal wood and paper contributing less than 0 01 kg per sample vegetation represented 63 2 96 7 of the total wet weight at each site mean 79 7 figs s4 and s5 and was the primary contributor to macrodebris mass at ten of the eleven sites gravel was the primary contributor at sr 117 these findings are supported by alam et al 2017 who found that 93 of macrodebris captured in a catch basin insert in gosnells western australia were composed of vegetation secondary contributors to macrodebris mass included gravel and cigarettes three sites each paper two sites and plastic vegetation and wood one site each at three sites i e i 90 sr 81 and sr 117 the secondary contributor represented 16 5 27 2 of total mass at all other sites it represented less than 7 of total mass mean across all sites 9 2 tertiary contributors to total macrodebris mass included plastic four sites wood and cigarettes three sites each and gravel one site tertiary contributors never represented more than 9 of total mass mean 3 5 statistically significant differences for macrodebris mass between sites are summarized in table 5 using the kruskal wallis test significant differences were found in between site total mass vegetation plastic and cigarettes all p values 1 10 11 as well as glass and paper p values 0 02 no differences were observed between sites for mass of metal wood fabric and gravel follow up paired comparisons using dunn s test with a bonferroni correction showed that i 70 produced the greatest total mass of macrodebris in stormwater runoff with significantly greater total mass than seven other sites more vegetation cigarettes and plastic were also produced at this site than at least five other sites sr 117 sr 257 and sr 81 often had significantly lower total vegetation and cigarette mass than sr 48 sr 59 us 20 us 22 sr 43 sr 49 and i 70 of the eleven sites monitored sr 117 sr 257 and sr 81 had three of the four lowest aadt counts table 1 the site with the highest macrodebris mass i 70 had approximately three times greater aadt than the next highest aadt site suggesting aadt may play a role in macrodebris mass generation from roadways the kruskal wallis test showed significant seasonality for total mass vegetation plastic and gravel paired comparisons among seasons showed fall was significantly greater than summer for total and vegetation mass while fall was not significantly greater than spring in either case p values of 0 12 and 0 16 respectively mass of plastic collected from spring samples was greater than those collected during the fall p 0 10 and summer p 0 05 similarly the mass of gravel in samples collected during the spring and summer were both greater than samples collected during the fall α 0 10 this may be related to the effects of plowing and deicing salt during winter on the structure of the wearing course of the pavement seasonality for vegetation was observed mainly due to leaf fall in the autumn hobbie et al 2014 and waickowski 2015 observed similar seasonality in vegetation mass in our study this was primarily observed at sites with nearby trees including sr 48 us 20 us 22 sr 49 and sr 59 this suggests that if catch basin inserts were utilized to capture macrodebris en masse more frequent and onerous maintenance would be needed during the fall season especially in sites surrounded by vegetation results of spearman s rank correlation analysis exploring the effects of causal variables e g rainfall and site characteristics on macrodebris mass are presented in fig 5 rainfall depth and duration were weakly correlated to total macrodebris vegetation and cigarette mass site characteristics including aadt speed limit and catchment area and several rainfall characteristics i e adp peak intensity average intensity were not reliable predictors of macrodebris mass these results suggest depth and duration of rainfall were the best albeit weak predictors of macrodebris mass there are other factors which may influence the mass of macrodebris such as littering habits wind speed and direction vehicular accidents etc which were not captured in the data set and thus cannot be included in a model to predict macrodebris mass further research is needed to better quantify other factors which might predict macrodebris mass total and categorical macrodebris mass varied between road functional classes land uses and development density the mass of vegetation cigarettes plastic paper glass and total macrodebris collected from interstates were significantly greater than minor arterial routes all p 0 05 aside from glass which was significant at p 0 10 interstate sites also yielded significantly greater masses of cigarettes plastic and total macrodebris compared to principal arterial routes which generated greater masses of vegetation and total macrodebris compared to minor arterial routes no differences were observed between functional class for masses of metal wood gravel or fabric masses of total macrodebris vegetation and cigarettes were significantly higher from commercial high density residential and low density residential sites compared to agricultural sites commercial areas generated significantly more plastics compared to all other land uses masses of wood and fabric were also higher for commercial sites compared to agricultural areas p 0 05 similar to trends observed on a volumetric basis the mass of total and several categories of macrodebris exhibited clear differences between varying levels of development using multiple linear regression it was observed that the urban sites produced a per sample mean of 1 13 kg total macrodebris mass twelve times higher than that for suburban and rural sites 0 08 0 09 kg runoff from urban sites conveyed 1 04 kg of vegetation per sampling window about ten times that of suburban sites 0 11 kg and 30 times that of rural sites 0 04 kg on average urban sites produced 0 07 kg of plastic while suburban 0 kg and rural sites 0 01 kg produced very little a similar trend was observed for cigarettes with 0 04 kg on average for urban sites and 0 01 kg for suburban and rural sites no significant trends across the urban to rural gradient were observed for glass metal wood fabric gravel or paper similar results were observed by waickowski 2015 who generally found that highly urbanized watersheds downtown areas and high density residential in north carolina produced greater mass loading of macrodebris than low density sites alongside the seasonal needs for increased maintenance these results confirm that catch basin inserts deployed to mitigate macrodebris from urban roads near commercial and residential areas will require more frequent maintenance due to the quantity of debris generated in densely developed catchments multivariable linear regression using backward selection resulted in the following model of macrodebris mass 3 m a s s 934 94 29 44 d e p t h 37 0 d u r a t i o n 0 048 a a d t where mass is macrodebris mass kg depth is cumulative rainfall depth since previous debris removal mm duration is cumulative rainfall duration since previous debris removal hr and aadt is annual average daily traffic vehicles per day p 0 01 r2 0 31 model results suggest that greater macrodebris mass should be expected with increased cumulative rainfall depth between debris removal and on roads with greater traffic loads further the combined effects of depth and duration suggest more intense rain events will result in increased macrodebris mass like macrodebris volume modeling results suggest that aadt is the only site characteristic needed to predict macrodebris mass and may be useful to inform the frequency of maintenance and debris removal 3 5 macrodebris water content moisture content of macrodebris was investigated due to its importance to the eventual disposal of this waste fig s1 if catch basin inserts were to be installed at scale for control of macrodebris in runoff vacuum trucks would be utilized to efficiently remove accumulated debris this debris would then presumably be landfilled and may be subject to applicable maximum moisture contents prior to final disposal meaning that drying of macrodebris might be necessary as expected mean moisture content was lowest for the samples visually characterized as dry 12 6 and highest for wet samples 161 5 high levels of variability were observed in the moisture content of samples particularly for the moderate and wet samples table 6 mean moisture content was 78 4 with moisture contents ranging from 1 5 to nearly 440 alam et al 2017 measured macrodebris moisture content from 24 to 52 5 from samples collected in western australia eight of 18 macrodebris samples analyzed herein exceeded 70 moisture content which has been identified as the optimum moisture content to maximize dry density of municipal solid waste reddy et al 2009 moisture was primarily retained in paper vegetation cigarettes and wood while glass metal fabric and gravel retained no appreciable moisture fig 7 mean moisture content for wood varied from 50 to 125 across the dry moderate and wet samples cigarettes in dry and moderate samples were approximately 35 water while their moisture content in wet samples was 155 similarly paper was approximately 40 water in dry and moderate samples while it was 139 moisture in wet samples median moisture content for vegetation was 18 46 and 120 for dry moderate and wet samples respectively these results indicate that additional efforts to decrease moisture from macrodebris e g stockpiling and temporary storage in decanting areas retained in catch basin inserts may be required especially from sites where wood paper vegetation and cigarettes and prevalent sources of waste 3 6 implications for macrodebris control design of pretreatment devices for scms and other litter traps is predicated on three factors 1 the expected volume of macrodebris 2 the space available for installation of such a device and 3 cost the first two factors are related to how frequently these devices may require maintenance the more debris and smaller the device the more often it will require maintenance in the case of catch basin inserts their design and volumetric capacity is restricted by the dimensions of the catch basin thus the maintenance frequency is driven primarily by the volume of debris the discussion below will focus on optimizing maintenance frequency based on the volumetric capacity of the catch basin inserts in this study if these systems are neglected there is the potential for localized nuisance flooding in the area around the catch basin introducing safety risks to passing motorists the catch basin inserts utilized herein had 75 l of maximum storage for macrodebris macrodebris volume data collected during this study can be used to estimate maintenance intervals at 7 of the 11 monitoring sites the total volume of macrodebris captured over the monitoring period table 2 was less than 75 l suggesting that annual maintenance to remove entrapped macrodebris would be sufficient at sr 257 i 90 and sr 81 volumetric macrodebris accumulation rates i e 27 90 37 93 l of debris collected over 214 233 days table 2 were low enough that maintenance performed every two years would ensure that the capacity of the catch basin insert was not exceeded at two sites i e sr 43 and us 22 maintenance during the peak leaf drop period would be required given the sample volumes collected in autumn from these locations i e 72 97 l and 67 46 l respectively maintenance would have been needed at sr 48 in autumn i e to remove the 68 77 l of debris collected between may october and early winter i e to mitigate the 123 95 l of total debris collected in november december even more frequent maintenance would be required at i 70 where macrodebris would need to be collected in late summer i e 70 00 l captured between may august early autumn i e 79 72 l captured in the month of september alone and early winter i e 70 58 l captured between october december these data show the inherent variability in macrodebris generation equations such as those developed in sections 3 3 and 3 4 can be used to estimate maintenance frequency for a given location as a function of site and rainfall characteristics however more research is needed to understand macrodebris generation regionally how to best capture debris before it enters sewers or stormwater control measures and how to optimize debris removal frequency from pretreatment devices to ensure performance and mitigate risks to passing motorists posed by localized nuisance flooding 4 conclusions macrodebris represent a class of infrequently quantified pollutants in stormwater that contribute to the pollution of surface waters globally as such a monitoring study was undertaken to quantify the volume and mass of macrodebris in road runoff across the state of ohio usa mean total macrodebris volume and mass for samples collected on average every 11 6 days in catch basins were 4 62 l and 0 49 kg resulting in mean volumetric and mass loading rates of 8 56 l ha day and 0 79 kg ha day respectively vegetation was the primary contributor to macrodebris averaging 80 3 and 79 7 of the volume and mass of total collected macrodebris respectively vegetation and total macrodebris volume and mass were highest in the autumn season vegetation was primarily comprised of grass clippings from mowing of the roadside shoulder and leaf fall from trees in the autumn suggesting that maintenance for catch basin or scm pre treatment clean out can be scheduled around these events rainfall depth duration elapsed time since the previous sample collection adp peak rainfall intensity catchment area and aadt were significantly correlated to either macrodebris mass or volume correlations to macrodebris mass were infrequently observed and were weaker than those for macrodebris volume road functional class land use and development density exhibited notable impacts on macrodebris generation with higher masses and volumes of total and categorical macrodebris generally collected along urban and suburban interstate routes surrounded by commercial and residential areas multivariable linear models suggest aadt and seasonality were the best predictors of macrodebris volume while aadt cumulative rainfall depth and cumulative rainfall duration were included in final regression models of macrodebris mass moisture content in macrodebris samples was highly variable range 1 5 to 440 with a mean of 78 5 in some cases drying or solidification of macrodebris may be needed prior to landfilling the data presented herein inform macrodebris mitigation strategies and required maintenance frequencies for pre treatment devices for scms including catch basin inserts hydrodynamic separators and others future research should expand upon the geographical range of this study evaluate the efficacy of catch basin inserts deployed en masse and

clippings litter e g plastic metal glass paper cardboard and styrofoam and large particulate matter e g fragments of pavement and gravel macrodebris also known as gross solids are characterized by caltrans and the water environment research federation among others by a particle diameter greater than 5 mm allison et al 1998a kim et al 2006 roesner et al 2007 treilles et al 2021 macrodebris are often unaccounted for in research studies on urban runoff due to the restrictive 9 5 mm diameter of the sample tubing using in conjunction with automated samplers a portion of the macrodebris load in stormwater is composed of anthropogenic refuse which left unchecked contributes to global scale pollution management issues such as ocean garbage patches these negatively affect aquatic ecosystems create hazards for shipping lanes and lead to negative socioeconomic impacts van sebille et al 2012 gall and thompson 2015 in response total maximum daily loads tmdls for trash have been established in several watersheds across the u s e g california regional water quality control board 2007 to inform these regulatory limits it is important to quantify the contribution of macrodebris conveyed by road runoff to implement evaluate and refine mitigation strategies further knowledge of macrodebris volume and mass can guide the design of pretreatment devices for stormwater control measures scms and catch basin inserts macrodebris in urban runoff has been characterized in watersheds in california wisconsin minnesota canada south africa australia and france prasad et al 1980 dorney 1986 allison et al 1998b marais et al 2001 kim et al 2006 kalinosky et al 2013 treilles et al 2021 most studies have focused on macrodebris mass while their volume may be particularly important for macrodebris treatment system design as well as to estimate treatment system maintenance frequency research at both the site and watershed scale indicates that the vast majority i e 80 90 by mass of macrodebris conveyed by urban runoff is composed of vegetation allison et al 1998b alam et al 2017 chrispijn 2004 land use influences macrodebris mass loading rates loads ranging from 0 04 to 6 8 kg ha have been reported for watersheds with a variety of land use types i e mixed residential commercial low and high density residential and dense urban centers in australia and the u s allison et al 1996b waickowski 2015 higher debris loads have been observed in sites with greater tree abundance and catchment area though efforts such as street sweeping programs were shown to reduce macrodebris accumulation in stormwater catch basins waickowski 2015 roads provide opportunities for both the generation e g litter vehicle parts grass clippings etc and conveyance i e along curb and gutter systems drained by catch basins of macrodebris to receiving waters however few studies have been performed to date which explore both the quantity and composition of macrodebris from roads in a study of six highway monitoring sites in southern california kim et al 2006 found 90 of macrodebris volume was made up of vegetation and 10 of anthropogenic litter and was generated at loading rates between 1 2 13 3 kg ha similarly the dry weight of macrodebris samples from four road sites in north carolina collected on an approximately weekly basis ranged between 0 2 1 6 kg ha winston and hunt 2017 more research is needed to characterize macrodebris mobilization by road runoff to inform debris management activities e g street sweeping and the design of engineered retrofits such as pretreatment devices to limit debris conveyance through sewer networks further research which evaluates the volume and moisture content of macrodebris in addition to mass and loading rates is needed to understand the potential implications of macrodebris characteristics on final disposal in landfills precipitation patterns influence the mass of macrodebris conveyed in urban runoff with positive correlations identified between macrodebris mass and rainfall depth waickowski 2015 winston and hunt 2017 macrodebris loads were also influenced by peak rainfall intensity suggesting that bursts of intense rainfall mobilized a larger mass of macrodebris winston and hunt 2017 seasonal trends as well as correlation between tree canopy cover and macrodebris generation have been observed perhaps unsurprising given the high proportion of vegetation found in stormwater conveyed macrodebris hobie et al 2014 waickowski 2015 however relatively little is known about the influence of traffic characteristics on macrodebris from roads which may have important implications on the need for targeted retrofit measures e g catch basin inserts or frequency of maintenance activities such as street sweeping though these studies shed light on factors affecting macrodebris conveyed in urban runoff research is needed to investigate other factors which may contribute to macrodebris mobilization including climatic geographic and critically traffic related factors further there is a need to explore retrofits to roadside drainage infrastructure to improve the trapping of macrodebris and prevent the conveyance of large organic material particulate debris and litter to receiving water bodies the objective of this study was to quantify the volume mass and moisture content of macrodebris contributed by runoff from roads over single rainfall events and annually to inform the design of catch basin inserts and pretreatment devices for scms further factors such as road watershed and hyetograph characteristics were explored to understand key drivers in macrodebris generation 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of monitored sites eleven sites across the state of ohio usa were selected for monitoring fig 1 the sites were located in the franklin delaware hamilton montgomery allen portage and lake counties table 1 weather in the state is varied with both humid hot summers and cold winter weather annually the state receives between 965 and 1092 mm of precipitation monitored catchments consisted solely of road drainage constrained by curb and gutter several factors which potentially influence macrodebris were considered during site selection including rainfall patterns pavement type number of travel lanes annual average daily traffic aadt posted speed limits adjacent land use relative vegetation coverage and development density were selected to bracket the range of mass and volume of macrodebris generated from roads relative vegetation coverage provides qualitative approximation of pervious cover in areas surrounding catch basin and ranges from high e g the catch basin along sr 48 which was adjacent to a grassed shoulder and several large deciduous trees to low e g the catch basin along us 20 with nearly no nearby vegetation due to equipment and personnel limitations monitoring was performed during two periods data were collected at five sites in 2016 and six sites in 2017 monitoring sites were identified by the corresponding road identifier i 70 and i 90 were interstate highways us 22 sr 43 sr 48 sr 49 sr 59 and sr 81 were principal arterials and sr 117 sr 257 and us 20 were minor arterials interstate highways principal arterials and minor arterials in this study had aadt above 30 000 between 10 000 25 000 and less than 10 000

which were paved with concrete 2 2 field data collection and laboratory analysis each site employed curb and gutter drainage systems which discharged stormwater into catch basins within one catch basin along each road table 1 macrodebris were filtered from stormwater and collected in purpose built catch basin inserts these inserts were built from aluminum angle iron supports which fit inside the catch basin frame and allowed the grate to be reinstalled so that water could flow freely into the grate fig 2 attached to the angle iron was a wire mesh netting with an aperture of 5 mm to capture all macrodebris larger than this diameter each catch basin insert was 61 cm long 30 cm wide and 41 cm deep providing a maximum potential storage of 0 075 m3 for macrodebris storage a wooden diverter was affixed to the curb and gutter to ensure that all stormwater passed through the catch basin insert fig 2 macrodebris samples were collected from in 2016 at i 70 us 22 sr 257 sr 48 and sr 49 and in 2017 at i 90 sr 59 sr 43 us 20 sr 81 and sr 117 table 1 sampling window duration varied from 193 to 233 days during each site visit for sample collection the macrodebris retained inside the catch basin insert was placed in either 3 8 l resealable plastic bags or 151 4 l garbage bags depending on the total accumulated sample volume since the previous site visit samples were subsequently stored in a laboratory refrigerator at 4 c until sample analysis was performed macrodebris was collected on average every 11 6 days so a single macrodebris sample could represent debris mobilized during dry weather wind events or one or multiple precipitation events the volume and mass of each macrodebris sample were analyzed in the laboratory following collection samples were first categorized as either dry moderate or wet by visual observation sample wet weight was determined using a laboratory scale intelligent weighing technology model pc 20 001 supplementary material fig s1 the loose bulk volume was determined by measuring depth of macrodebris in a bin to the nearest 1 6 mm at six locations and converting to volume using the known depth volume relationship determined using bin dimensions macrodebris were separated into one of nine categories by visual inspection natural vegetation e g grass leaves twigs cigarettes plastic fabric wood glass metal paper and gravel these subsamples were weighed to obtain subsample wet weights and measured for subsample volume dry weights were measured on a subset of samples from each of the three moisture content categories collected in 2017 i e seven dry five moderate and eight wet samples after drying in an oven for 24 h at 105 c the total sample mass was then measured and sample drying was repeated until no change in total sample mass was recorded over each additional 24 h drying window the sample was then separated into the nine categories and weighed to understand which categories retained the most water

catch basin inserts varied from 193 to 233 d with a mean of 213 6 d sites were visited to collect samples every 11 6 7 3 d mean std dev with a minimum of 4 d and a maximum of 55 d between sample collection across the 11 monitored sites a total of 202 macrodebris samples were collected during 2016 and 2017 the number of macrodebris samples collected by site varied from 14 to 22 with a mean of 18 3 samples the majority of the samples were obtained during the summer months 103 with autumn 60 and spring 39 accounting for the remaining samples collected sampling was discontinued during winter

in rainfall characteristics was observed over the monitoring period fig 3 however no significant differences between sites were observed for rainfall depth duration peak intensity average intensity or adp p values 0 50 as supported by the lack of clustering of data points for single sites in fig 3 thus rainfall statistics in fig 3 summarize data for macrodebris samples from all sites rainfall depth across the sampling windows varied from a minimum of 2 5 mm to a maximum of 179 6 mm with a median value of 23 4 mm rain event duration varied from 0 5 h to 134 h with a median value of 9 1 h peak 5

variability in climatic variables observed among the collected samples indicated that the data set is robust and provides a reliable indication of the mass and volume of macrodebris from typical roads

volume retained during a given sampling window varied from 4 35 to 66 62 l across the sites the maximum macrodebris volume observed was at sr 48 on november 8 2016 where leaves from a nearby deciduous tree completely filled the catch basin insert with vegetation representing 98 of the resulting total sample volume this trend held true across the broader data set with vegetation contributing on

volume recorded for each macrodebris category was 66 62 l total volume 65 49 l vegetation 4 32 l gravel 2 91 l plastic 2 42 l cigarettes 2 23 l fabric 1 78 l paper with glass metal and wood representing 1 14 l or less these maxima did not coincide during a single sampling window total sampled macrodebris at the 11 sites varied from 28 01 to 220 31 l during the respective monitoring periods normalizing these data by the drainage area contributing runoff to the catch basin as well as the sampling window duration the volumetric loading rate of total macrodebris varied from 2 89 to 16 07 l ha day mean 8 56 l ha day this corresponds to an average of 3123 l ha yr of macrodebris entering each catch basin in this study these data could be utilized to size and predict maintenance intervals for forebays or to inform the development of tmdls for trash loading vegetation was the primary contributor to macrodebris volume at all 11 sites figs s2 s3 and represented between 63 5 95 5 of total macrodebris volume by site mean 80 3 secondary contributors to macrodebris volume included cigarettes five sites plastic four sites and gravel two sites secondary contributors were dramatically less important contributing between 1 7 12 6 of total macrodebris volume mean 7 2 tertiary contributors to total macrodebris volume were cigarettes four sites plastic three sites wood two sites and gravel and paper one site each tertiary contributors to macrodebris volume represented between 1 1 9 1 of the total mean 5 1 using the kruskal wallis omnibus test significant differences were observed among sites for the volume of total macrodebris vegetation cigarettes plastic and wood additionally glass and paper were significantly different among sites at the α 0 10 level follow up paired comparisons using the dunn s test with a bonferroni correction highlighted a number of significant differences between sites table 3 but showed no differences in paper or glass volume between sites the i 70 site produced significantly greater total macrodebris volume than i 90 sr 117 us 22 sr 257 sr 49 and sr 81 perhaps due to its aadt which was approximately three times larger than the next greatest aadt table 1 sr 43 sr 48 sr 59 and us 20 had significantly greater total macrodebris volume than sr 117 sr 257 and sr 81 pointing to differences in the volume of macrodebris generated in higher trafficked urban and suburban routes compared to less trafficked minor arterials in rural areas table 1 since vegetation made up between 63 and 96 of total volume it is not surprising results of statistical testing for this category were similar to those for total volume table 3 stormwater from i 70 sr 43 and us 20 had significantly more cigarette volume than sr 117 us 22 sr 257 sr 48 sr 49 and sr 81 i 90 and sr 49 had a greater volume of cigarettes than sr 257 for plastic and wood volume i 70 and us 20 frequently produced greater volumes than other sites observed debris from vehicular accidents and plastic bottles from a nearby supermarket were the main contributors of plastic at i 70 and us 20 respectively wood consisted of pieces of lumber presumably from work vehicles the omnibus test showed there were significant differences in total volume vegetation cigarettes and plastic between seasons follow up paired comparisons showed total macrodebris vegetation and cigarette volume were significantly greater in the fall than in the spring or summer p 0 001 similarly plastic volume was greater in the fall than in the summer p 0 10 seasonality in vegetation volume was expected especially at the five sites with nearby deciduous trees i e sr 48 us 20 us 22 sr 49 and sr 59 mean daily total macrodebris volume across the 11 sites in the fall was 0 61 l day significantly higher than the 0 19 l day and 0 34 l day observed in spring and summer respectively since vegetation represented between 63 and 96 of total macrodebris volume depending on site it was not surprising seasonal trends were also observed for total macrodebris volume trends observed in cigarette presence in macrodebris samples followed those of vegetation rather than a seasonal change in the incidence of smoking perhaps during spring and summer passing cars may force this low weight litter toward the side of the road cigarettes were often trapped by leaf piles perhaps transported there by wind along the curb line alam et al 2017 found that wind speed was the most important factor in dry weather macrodebris loading thus these seasonal patterns indicate that the leaves appear to catch the cigarettes during the autumn results of spearman s correlation analyses are presented in fig 5 site characteristics were poorly correlated to macrodebris volume with speed limit not correlated to a single macrodebris category aadt was significantly albeit weakly 0 2 ρ 0 4 correlated to total macrodebris volume vegetation cigarettes and plastic supporting significant differences between road characteristics and macrodebris accumulation observed in tables 1 and 3 rainfall characteristics such as depth and duration were weakly correlated to total volume and plastic contrasting with results in alam et al 2017 where macrodebris was significantly correlated to rainfall depth elapsed time since the previous sample was collected was weakly correlated to total volume vegetation gravel cigarettes and plastic this metric serves as a predictor of build up processes but does not account for wash off processes including wind and rain since the previous sampling window given the weak correlations between macrodebris volume and site specific and rainfall characteristics categorical differences between sites e g functional class surrounding land use etc were also considered as potential influential factors to the composition of macrodebris differences in macrodebris volume were also observed between different road functional classes i e interstate principal arterial and minor arterial and land uses interstate locations exhibited significantly larger volumes of vegetation compared to minor arterials p 0 05 cigarettes plastic both p 0 05 and wood p 0 1 were also significantly higher on interstate locations compared to minor arterials a reasonable result given the differences in aadt between these sites table 1 interstate sites also produced greater volumes of cigarettes plastic wood and total macrodebris than principal arterial routes while the volume of total macrodebris and vegetation were significantly higher on principal arterials compared to minor arterial routes no differences were observed for glass metal fabric gravel or paper similar results were observed between land uses with higher total and categorical macrodebris volumes generally produced from commercial high density and low density residential catchments compared to agricultural areas multiple linear regression suggested that on average four times more total macrodebris volume per sampling window was derived from urban sites 24 23 l than suburban 5 11 l or rural 7 27 l sites similar trends were observed for vegetation volume of cigarettes and plastic from urban sites was two times greater than from rural sites no differences were observed between urban suburban and rural sites for fabric gravel or paper these data suggest macrodebris reduction efforts should target interstate and principal arterial locations near highly trafficked commercial or high density residential urban and suburban areas to mitigate macrodebris generation though more research is needed in an expanded geographic area to confirm these trends multivariable linear regression using backward selection resulted in the following model of macrodebris volume 2 v o l 2 59 2 55 s e a s o

to indicate the current season no turn lanes is the number of turn lanes and aadt is annual average daily traffic vehicles per day p 0 01 r2 0 35 the relationships between both season as well as aadt and macrodebris volume were unsurprising lower macrodebris volumes can be expected in spring and summer seasons prior to leaf drop additionally increased traffic loads introduce additional opportunities for debris to become deposited on roadways and conveyed in runoff conversely the relationship between the number of turn lanes and macrodebris volume was unexpected it is possible that larger number of turn lanes provide more opportunities for macrodebris to be carried by runoff via both sheet flow and concentrated flow however given the degree of variance of this variable i e ranging from 0 to 1 table 1 in the sites studied herein further investigation of catch basins selected specifically based on the number of turn lanes in contributing catchments may be needed to confirm this hypothesis interestingly no other variables related to site characteristics were included in final models suggesting traffic loads and seasonal trends may be the best predictors of macrodebris volume 3 4 mass of macrodebris box plots illustrating total and categorical macrodebris by site are presented in fig 6 mean total wet weight per sampling window varied from 0 05 to 3 57 kg mean of all samples was 0 53 kg table 4 normalizing for the area of the catchment draining to each catch basin and the sampling window duration mass loading rates varied from 0 10 to 5 22 kg ha day with a mean rate of 0 79 kg ha day this corresponds to an average of 287 kg ha yr wet weight of macrodebris entering each catch basin in this study this mass loading rate is considerably lower than four commercial watersheds range 878 3676 kg ha yr monitored in australia chrispijn 2004 alam et al 2017 but within the range of loading rates 11 359 kg ha yr observed for various densities of residential development and downtown areas in four cities in north carolina usa waickowski 2015 however this macrodebris loading rate exceeds that observed in nine urban catchments in cape town south africa where marais et al 2001 observed 2 62 kg ha yr median 40 kg ha yr of organic debris and 0 27 kg ha yr median 10 kg ha yr of anthropogenic refuse cardboard and plastic at each catchment outfall factors such as total annual rainfall and the presence of deciduous vegetation which vary considerably across the regions discussed above might lead to the vast differences in annual macrodebris mass loading rates reported in the literature maximum macrodebris weight collected from a given site over any sampling window varied from 0 01 kg to 28 08 kg the sample with the largest weight was collected at i 70 following both mowing of the adjacent shoulder as well as several vehicular accidents which contributed macrodebris to the catch basin the weight of this sample was nearly five times greater than the second heaviest sample collected during the monitoring period vegetation made up most of the sample weight fig 6 mean sample weights across all sites were 0 54 kg for total macrodebris mass 0 45 kg for vegetation 0 04 kg for plastic 0 03 kg for gravel 0 02 kg for fabric 0 02 kg for cigarettes and glass metal wood and paper contributing less than 0 01 kg per sample vegetation represented 63 2 96 7 of the total wet weight at each site mean 79 7 figs s4 and s5 and was the primary contributor to macrodebris mass at ten of the eleven sites gravel was the primary contributor at sr 117 these findings are supported by alam et al 2017 who found that 93 of macrodebris captured in a catch basin insert in gosnells western australia were composed of vegetation secondary contributors to macrodebris mass included gravel and cigarettes three sites each paper two sites and plastic vegetation and wood one site each at three sites i e i 90 sr 81 and sr 117 the secondary contributor represented 16 5 27 2 of total mass at all other sites it represented less than 7 of total mass mean across all sites 9 2 tertiary contributors to total macrodebris mass included plastic four sites wood and cigarettes three sites each and gravel one site tertiary contributors never represented more than 9 of total mass mean 3 5 statistically significant differences for macrodebris mass between sites are summarized in table 5 using the kruskal wallis test significant differences were found in between site total mass vegetation plastic and cigarettes all p values 1 10 11 as well as glass and paper p values 0 02 no differences were observed between sites for mass of metal wood fabric and gravel follow up paired comparisons using dunn s test with a bonferroni correction showed that i 70 produced the greatest total mass of macrodebris in stormwater runoff with significantly greater total mass than seven other sites more vegetation cigarettes and plastic were also produced at this site than at least five other sites sr 117 sr 257 and sr 81 often had significantly lower total vegetation and cigarette mass than sr 48 sr 59 us 20 us 22 sr 43 sr 49 and i 70 of the eleven sites monitored sr 117 sr 257 and sr 81 had three of the four lowest aadt counts table 1 the site with the highest macrodebris mass i 70 had approximately three times greater aadt than the next highest aadt site suggesting aadt may play a role in macrodebris mass generation from roadways the kruskal wallis test showed significant seasonality for total mass vegetation plastic and gravel paired comparisons among seasons showed fall was significantly greater than summer for total and vegetation mass while fall was not significantly greater than spring in either case p values of 0 12 and 0 16 respectively mass of plastic collected from spring samples was greater than those collected during the fall p 0 10 and summer p 0 05 similarly the mass of gravel in samples collected during the spring and summer were both greater than samples collected during the fall α 0 10 this may be related to the effects of plowing and deicing salt during winter on the structure of the wearing course of the pavement seasonality for vegetation was observed mainly due to leaf fall in the autumn hobbie et al 2014 and waickowski 2015 observed similar seasonality in vegetation mass in our study this was primarily observed at sites with nearby trees including sr 48 us 20 us 22 sr 49 and sr 59 this suggests that if catch basin inserts were utilized to capture macrodebris en masse more frequent and onerous maintenance would be needed during the fall season especially in sites surrounded by vegetation results of spearman s rank correlation analysis exploring the effects of causal variables e g rainfall and site characteristics on macrodebris mass are presented in fig 5 rainfall depth and duration were weakly correlated to total macrodebris vegetation and cigarette mass site characteristics including aadt speed limit and catchment area and several rainfall characteristics i e adp peak intensity average intensity were not reliable predictors of macrodebris mass these results suggest depth and duration of rainfall were the best albeit weak predictors of macrodebris mass there are other factors which may influence the mass of macrodebris such as littering habits wind speed and direction vehicular accidents etc which were not captured in the data set and thus cannot be included in a model to predict macrodebris mass further research is needed to better quantify other factors which might predict macrodebris mass total and categorical macrodebris mass varied between road functional classes land uses and development density the mass of vegetation cigarettes plastic paper glass and total macrodebris collected from interstates were significantly greater than minor arterial routes all p 0 05 aside from glass which was significant at p 0 10 interstate sites also yielded significantly greater masses of cigarettes plastic and total macrodebris compared to principal arterial routes which generated greater masses of vegetation and total macrodebris compared to minor arterial routes no differences were observed between functional class for masses of metal wood gravel or fabric masses of total macrodebris vegetation and cigarettes were significantly higher from commercial high density residential and low density residential sites compared to agricultural sites commercial areas generated significantly more plastics compared to all other land uses masses of wood and fabric were also higher for commercial sites compared to agricultural areas p 0 05 similar to trends observed on a volumetric basis the mass of total and several categories of macrodebris exhibited clear differences between varying levels of development using multiple linear regression it was observed that the urban sites produced a per sample mean of 1 13 kg total macrodebris mass twelve times higher than that for suburban and rural sites 0 08 0 09 kg runoff from urban sites conveyed 1 04 kg of vegetation per sampling window about ten times that of suburban sites 0 11 kg and 30 times that of rural sites 0 04 kg on average urban sites produced 0 07 kg of plastic while suburban 0 kg and rural sites 0 01 kg produced very little a similar trend was observed for cigarettes with 0 04 kg on average for urban sites and 0 01 kg for suburban and rural sites no significant trends across the urban to rural gradient were observed for glass metal wood fabric gravel or paper similar results were observed by waickowski 2015 who generally found that highly urbanized watersheds downtown areas and high density residential in north carolina produced greater mass loading of macrodebris than low density sites alongside the seasonal needs for increased maintenance these results confirm that catch basin inserts deployed to mitigate macrodebris from urban roads near commercial and residential areas will require more frequent maintenance due to the quantity of debris generated in densely developed catchments multivariable linear regression using backward selection resulted in the following model of macrodebris mass 3 m a s s 934 94 29 44 d e p t h 37 0 d u r a t i o n 0 048 a a d t where mass is macrodebris mass kg depth is cumulative rainfall depth since previous debris removal mm duration is cumulative rainfall duration since previous debris removal hr and aadt is annual average daily traffic vehicles per day p 0 01 r2 0 31 model results suggest that greater macrodebris mass should be expected with increased cumulative rainfall depth between debris removal and on roads with greater traffic loads further the combined effects of depth and duration suggest more intense rain events will result in increased macrodebris mass like macrodebris volume modeling results suggest that aadt is the only site characteristic needed to predict macrodebris mass and may be useful to inform the frequency of maintenance and debris removal 3 5 macrodebris water content moisture content of macrodebris was investigated due to its importance to the eventual disposal of this waste fig s1 if catch basin inserts were to be installed at scale for control of macrodebris in runoff vacuum trucks would be utilized to efficiently remove accumulated debris this debris would then presumably be landfilled and may be subject to applicable maximum moisture contents prior to final disposal meaning that drying of macrodebris might be necessary as expected mean moisture content was lowest for the samples visually characterized as dry 12 6 and highest for wet samples 161 5 high levels of variability were observed in the moisture content of samples particularly for the moderate and wet samples table 6 mean moisture content was 78 4 with moisture contents ranging from 1 5 to nearly 440 alam et al 2017 measured macrodebris moisture content from 24 to 52 5 from samples collected in western australia eight of 18 macrodebris samples analyzed herein exceeded 70 moisture content which has been identified as the optimum moisture content to maximize dry density of municipal solid waste reddy et al 2009 moisture was primarily retained in paper vegetation cigarettes and wood while glass metal fabric and gravel retained no appreciable moisture fig 7 mean moisture content for wood varied from 50 to 125 across the dry moderate and wet samples cigarettes in dry and moderate samples were approximately 35 water while their moisture content in wet samples was 155 similarly paper was approximately 40 water in dry and moderate samples while it was 139 moisture in wet samples median moisture content for vegetation was 18 46 and 120 for dry moderate and wet samples respectively these results indicate that additional efforts to decrease moisture from macrodebris e g stockpiling and temporary storage in decanting areas retained in catch basin inserts may be required especially from sites where wood paper vegetation and cigarettes and prevalent sources of waste 3 6 implications for macrodebris control design of pretreatment devices for scms and other litter traps is predicated on three factors 1 the expected volume of macrodebris 2 the space available for installation of such a device and 3 cost the first two factors are related to how frequently these devices may require maintenance the more debris and smaller the device the more often it will require maintenance in the case of catch basin inserts their design and volumetric capacity is restricted by the dimensions of the catch basin thus the maintenance frequency is driven primarily by the volume of debris the discussion below will focus on optimizing maintenance frequency based on the volumetric capacity of the catch basin inserts in this study if these systems are neglected there is the potential for localized nuisance flooding in the area around the catch basin introducing safety risks to passing motorists the catch basin inserts utilized herein had 75 l of maximum storage for macrodebris macrodebris volume data collected during this study can be used to estimate maintenance intervals at 7 of the 11 monitoring sites the total volume of macrodebris captured over the monitoring period table 2 was less than 75 l suggesting that annual maintenance to remove entrapped macrodebris would be sufficient at sr 257 i 90 and sr 81 volumetric macrodebris accumulation rates i e 27 90 37 93 l of debris collected over 214 233 days table 2 were low enough that maintenance performed every two years would ensure that the capacity of the catch basin insert was not exceeded at two sites i e sr 43 and us 22 maintenance during the peak leaf drop period would be required given the sample volumes collected in autumn from these locations i e 72 97 l and 67 46 l respectively maintenance would have been needed at sr 48 in autumn i e to remove the 68 77 l of debris collected between may october and early winter i e to mitigate the 123 95 l of total debris collected in november december even more frequent maintenance would be required at i 70 where macrodebris would need to be collected in late summer i e 70 00 l captured between may august early autumn i e 79 72 l captured in the month of september alone and early winter i e 70 58 l captured between october december these data show the inherent variability in macrodebris generation equations such as those developed in sections 3 3 and 3 4 can be used to estimate maintenance frequency for a given location as a function of site and rainfall characteristics however more research is needed to understand macrodebris generation regionally how to best capture debris before it enters sewers or stormwater control measures and how to optimize debris removal frequency from pretreatment devices to ensure performance and mitigate risks to passing motorists posed by localized nuisance flooding 4 conclusions macrodebris represent a class of infrequently quantified pollutants in stormwater that contribute to the pollution of surface waters globally as such a monitoring study was undertaken to quantify the volume and mass of macrodebris in road runoff across the state of ohio usa mean total macrodebris volume and mass for samples collected on average every 11 6 days in catch basins were 4 62 l and 0 49 kg resulting in mean volumetric and mass loading rates of 8 56 l ha day and 0 79 kg ha day respectively vegetation was the primary contributor to macrodebris averaging 80 3 and 79 7 of the volume and mass of total collected macrodebris respectively vegetation and total macrodebris volume and mass were highest in the autumn season vegetation was primarily comprised of grass clippings from mowing of the roadside shoulder and leaf fall from trees in the autumn suggesting that maintenance for catch basin or scm pre treatment clean out can be scheduled around these events rainfall depth duration elapsed time since the previous sample collection adp peak rainfall intensity catchment area and aadt were significantly correlated to either macrodebris mass or volume correlations to macrodebris mass were infrequently observed and were weaker than those for macrodebris volume road functional class land use and development density exhibited notable impacts on macrodebris generation with higher masses and volumes of total and categorical macrodebris generally collected along urban and suburban interstate routes surrounded by commercial and residential areas multivariable linear models suggest aadt and seasonality were the best predictors of macrodebris volume while aadt cumulative rainfall depth and cumulative rainfall duration were included in final regression models of macrodebris mass moisture content in macrodebris samples was highly variable range 1 5 to 440 with a mean of 78 5 in some cases drying or solidification of macrodebris may be needed prior to landfilling the data presented herein inform macrodebris mitigation strategies and required maintenance frequencies for pre treatment devices for scms including catch basin inserts hydrodynamic separators and others future research should expand upon the geographical range of this study evaluate the efficacy of catch basin inserts deployed en masse and

i3 i redox species and a dye sensitizer n719 with tio2 connected in parallel reported in our previous study ramalingam et al 2021a this device with the parallel connection configuration delivered a photocurrent of 9 5 ma and a desalination rate of 217 8 µg cm 2 min 1 under a 10 000 ppm nacl feed in comparison its single photoelectrode only produced a photocurrent of 5 3 ma with a desalination rate of 142 2 µg cm 2 min 1 existing devices suffered from the fast recombination of photo induced electrons and holes and low photo conversion efficiency resulting in a rapid photocurrent decline and desalination performance deterioration mismatched fermi levels between photoelectrodes connected in series can produce an internal bias that may improve photon excited carrier separation and transfer

carrier separation and transfer and the open circuit potential which lead to significantly enhanced desalination performance energy efficiency and energy storage capacity as illustrated in fig 1 a dye

pedot films were coated on both sides of the graphite paper in different thicknesses to serve as integrated electrodes the ies can prevent i3 i in the organic electrolyte from leaking into the aqueous fe cn 6 3 4 redox channel and transport electrons from the solar cell part to the redox flow desalination part through their rough surface topography fabrication of solar driven redox flow

and discussion 3 1 properties of tio2 photoanode nio photocathode and tio2 nio photoelectrode in a series connection fig 2 shows the electrochemical and photo electric properties of the tio2 and nio photoelectrodes in fig 2a the short circuit current of a single nio photocathode can reach 1 0 ma with an open circuit voltage ocv of 136 mv the short circuit current of a single tio2 photoanode is 5 9 ma with an ocv of 756 mv when a nio photocathode and a tio2 photoanode were connected in series the short circuit current of the tio2 nio double photoelectrode was slightly smaller than that of a single tio2 photoanode which can be attributed to the risen resistance caused by the increased distance between the photoanode and photocathode bush et al 2018 liang et al 2022a in contrast the ocv of the tio2 nio double photoelectrode increases significantly to 900 mv which is beneficial for obtaining higher energy output chen et al 2020c nam and choi 2019 the efficiency η see its calculation method in the supporting information of a device with the tio2 nio double photoelectrode is 5 43 which is higher than that made of a single nio photocathode at η of 0 2 and a single tio2 photoanode at η of 5 27 bush et al 2018 leijtens et al 2018 eis curves of the tio2 nio double photoelectrode single nio photocathode and single tio2 photoanode are shown in fig 2b the tio2 nio double photoelectrode has the smallest semicircle on its eis nyquist plot under the illumination indicating the lowest surface resistance and the fastest carrier transport rate compared to the other two photoelectrodes liang et al 2020 the redox potentials of the two types of redox electrolytes i3 i and fe cn 6 3 4 are displayed in their cv curves in fig 2c and fig 2d respectively the oxidized potential of i3 i appears at 0 492 v and the reduced potential is at 0 134 v vs ag agcl the redox peaks of fe cn 6 3 4 are located at 0 387 v for oxidation and 0 078 v vs ag agcl for reduction according to the nernst

photoelectrodes connected in series is shown in fig s4 and its related discussion in the supporting information in the tio2 photoanode bach et al 1998 nattestad et al 2010 there are three steps 1 under the light illumination the n719 dye molecule is exited forming an energy band gap between dye dye and dye dye 2 the photogenerated charge is transferred to the conducting band cb of the tio2 photoanode and eventually arrives at the nio photocathode through the external circuit and fto 3 the reduced dye is regenerated by receiving electrons from the redox mediator of i3 i in the nio photocathode daeneke et al 2015 maffeis et al 2021 qin et al 2009 three similar steps exist 1 under photoexcitation the dye molecule forms charge separated states 2 simultaneously the holes are injected into the valance band vb of nio and the reduced dye is regenerated 3 as the redox reaction of i3 i proceeds the electrons are transferred to the integrated electrode the desalination mainly depends on the charge transfer via the integrated electrode and the coupling effect of ion exchange membranes eis tests were also conducted to measure the internal and interfacial resistances of the device as shown in fig s5 in the supporting information this device mainly has two types of resistances a resistance rs of 97 99 ω comes from redox electrolyte and salt stream channels a semicircle rct exists at the intermediate frequency region representing the charge interfacial capacitance and transfer resistance at the photoelectrode electrolyte interfaces liu et al 2018 3 2 the desalination mechanism and performance fig 1 is a schematic diagram of the redox flow desalination device with the double photoelectrodes used in this study it includes three parts dye sensitized tio2 photoanode solar cell redox flow desalination cell and dye sensitized nio photocathode solar cell under light illumination the photosensitizers in solar cells are excited with the formation of charge separated states with the reaction of redox mediators electrons are transferred to the external circuit and reduce the dye the desalination can be realized with the assistance of the two integrated electrodes the ion exchange membranes and the circulation of electrolytes fig 3 a and b shows the time dependent photocurrent potential and ionic conductivity curves under the mode of short circuit and constant current respectively the photocurrent is close to 0 ma under the dark condition fig 3a once the light is illuminated the photocurrent jumps to 6 8 ma it then gradually decreases to 5 53 ma with the prolongation of time during the first 43 2 min the ionic conductivity of the desalted stream decreases rapidly from 7 62 to 1 0 ms cm 1 500 ppm reaching the standard condition of freshwater the salt removal rate is 164 9 µg cm 2 min 1 then it takes 40 6 min more to gradually desalt from 1 0 to 0 2 ms cm 1 with a salt removal rate of 24 1 µg cm 2 min 1 simultaneously the photocurrent declines to 0 149 ma cm2 according to a previous report lee et al 2006 the limiting current density was calculated as 0 158 ma cm2 as shown in fig s6 in the supporting information which was approximately equal to the actual current the decrease in the photocurrent and the salt removal rate can be attributed to the increasing internal resistance of the device when the salt is removed in addition to the salt concentration of 4000 ppm we also tested the desalination performance with the salt concentrations of 1000 2000 8000 and 12 000 ppm fig s7 in the supporting information displays the photocurrent and ionic conductivity variation at different salt concentrations with the increase in salt concentrations the initial photocurrents also increase consistent with a previous study liang et al 2022a and the corresponding salt removal rates see calculation methods in the supporting information and solar desalination capacities increase with the salt concentration as shown in fig s8 in the supporting information the corresponding freshwater production rate was estimated and listed in table s1 in the supporting information besides we tested the desalination performance of devices with single photoelectrode as shown in fig s9 and table s2 the photocurrent and desalination performance of the device with double photoelectrodes are higher than devices with a single tio2 photoanode or a single nio photocathode which is consistent with the energy efficiency shown in j v curves fig 2a we also investigated the influence of the light intensity the light intensity was varied from 102 to 307 mw cm 2 fig s10 and table s3 in the supporting information display photocurrents and salt removal rates at zero bias the photocurrent and salt removal rate only rises slightly with the increased light power density under the constant current mode we recorded the photocurrent using the galvanostatic discharge program of a battery analyzer neware shenzhen china fig 3b shows the potential variation with time under the 3 ma discharge current once illuminated the ocv immediately reaches 0 84 v and remains stable after applying the 3 ma discharge current the voltage decreases to 0 41 v and reduces gradually simultaneously the ionic conductivity of the desalted stream decreases from 7 63 to 1 51 ms cm 1 while that of the concentrated stream increases to 13 75 ms cm 1 correspondingly the whole desalination process lasts for 65 min and the corresponding salt removal rate and solar desalination capacity are 107 2 µg cm 2 min 1 and 0 09 µmol j 1 respectively 3 3 long term stability the salt volume was tenfold increased to 20 ml the other conditions were maintained the same as shown in fig 3c the desalination process lasts 17 5 h and high quality water containing 15 ppm salt is obtained in the desalination stream the salt removal rate and solar desalination capacity were 150 µg cm 2 min 1 and 0 12 µmol j 1 respectively 3 4 cycling stability multiple cycle desalination tests were performed under the same conditions to investigate the cycling stability of the device during the three cycles fig 4 shows that the initial photocurrents are 5 53 ma 5 67 ma and 5 43 ma respectively all three cycles can desalinate the salt feed at the same initial concentration 4000 ppm to 0 02 ms cm 1 about 10 ppm obtaining high quality freshwater besides the salt removal rates of the three cycles shown in fig s11 in the supporting information are 164 9 mg cm 2 min 1 155 2 mg cm 2 min 1 and 151 1 mg cm 2 min 1 respectively without significant performance decline these cycling results suggest that the photoelectrodes and the device have excellent stability we also conducted the cycle desalination tests with pt modified ie to compare the desalination performance of pt modified ie and pedot modified ie the result is shown in fig s12 in the supporting information it demonstrated that the pedot had better desalination performance than pt and could provide more excellent cyclic stability 3 5 the seawater desalination to further explore the practical applicability of this device a seawater desalination test was conducted the photocurrent and ionic conductivity variations are displayed in fig 4b the initial photocurrent increases to 7 6 ma and remains stable for the initial 200 min as the ionic conductivity of the seawater drops the photocurrent gradually decreases the whole desalination process lasts for 309 min and the ionic conductivity of the seawater decreases from 53 45 ms cm 1 to fresh water level after desalination the seawater s ion contents were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma icp and ion chromatography ic the results are listed in table 1 na and cl removal efficiencies in the seawater are greater than 99 other multivalent cations e g ca2 mg2 sr2 k and anions e g so4 2 are also successfully removed to a low level with a high removal efficiency the performances of recently reported solar redox desalination methods are summarized in table s4 in the supporting information the results in this study are much better than those recently reported results in the literature cheng et al 2022 the series architecture of n719 tio2 n719 nio delivered the highest photocurrent of 5 67 ma resulting in an excellent removal rate it also efficiently desalted the natural seawater to freshwater for the first time it achieved excellent salt ion removals for na and cl and other ions e g borate ca2 k mg2 sr2 so4 2 in seawater to increase the practical applicability we further assembled a device with two photoelectrodes placed on one side of the device to be illuminated by a single light source as illustrated in fig s13a in the supporting information two chambers of redox flow electrolyte i3 i or fe cn 6 3 4 were integrated on silicone support the salt stream volume was increased to 6 ml other operation conditions were the same as that in the previous experiments fig s13b shows that once illumination the photocurrent rises to 1 83 ma and then decreases to 1 75 ma after 208 6 min the conductivity of the desalted stream decreases from 7 52 to 5 46 ms cm 1 and the conductivity of the concentrated stream increases to 10 6 ms cm 1 the salt removal rate and solar desalination capacity are 27 7 µg cm 2 min 1 and 0 026 µmol j 1 respectively the photocurrent and desalination performance is lower than in the previous experiment possibly due to the different device configurations especially the salt chambers overall the additional demo further demonstrates the potential for practical applications 4 conclusion an efficient solar redox flow desalination device with double tio2 nio photoelectrodes connected in series is demonstrated the ocv of the device reaches 904 mv the efficiency ŋ of the double photoelectrodes is 5 43 higher than that of a single tio2 photoanode or nio photocathode this device delivers a high photocurrent of 5 67 ma high quality freshwater can be obtained from brackish water containing different concentrations

cathode by a peristaltic pump and the redox reaction occurred in the anode chamber and the cathode chamber the desalination was realized with the blocking of ion exchanges and the redox recirculation of fe cn 6 3 4 chen et al 2020a zuo et al 2022 electrochemical characterization electrochemical characterizations were carried out using the electrochemical workstation including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis cv and linear sweep voltammetry lsv eis was measured in the two electrode configuration with the i3 i electrolyte recirculated between the two electrodes cv was conducted with the three electrode configuration a glassy carbon gc electrode as the working electrode a pt mesh as the counter electrode and an ag agcl electrode as the reference electrode the cv tests of i3 i and fe cn 6 3 4 electrolytes were similar to our previous studies ramalingam et al 2021a the i3 i electrolyte was composed of 10 mm lii 1 mm i2 and 0 1 m liclo4 in acetonitrile and the potential was recorded within the voltage of 0 5 to 1 2 v at the scan rates of 25 50 100 and 150 mv s 1 the fe cn 6 3 4 electrolyte was composed of 10 mm k3 fe cn 6 and 10 mm k4 fe cn 6 in 0 1 m nacl which was recorded from 0 3 and 0 6 v at the scan rates of 25 50 100 and 150 mv s 1 to test desalination performances brackish water with different concentrations 1000 2000 4000 8000 to 12 000 ppm of nacl was used under the operational mode of short circuit or constant current xenon light with an output power of 307 mw cm 2 was used as the light source the light intensity is adjustable the volumes of each salt chamber and redox electrolyte chamber are 2 and 4 ml respectively peristaltic pumps controlled the salt and redox electrolyte stream s flow rate at 2 5 and 4 ml min 1 the concentration of fe cn 6 3 4 was 120 mm 120 mm the same concentrations of salts as in brackish water were added in the aqueous fe cn 6 3 4 electrolyte to maintain similar electrical conductivity the i3 i electrolyte comprised 1 m lii and 0 1 m i2 in acetonitrile fig s2 in the supporting information shows a photo of the device setup under light illumination further a natural seawater desalination test was carried out during the batch cycles of the desalination tests at the brackish water nacl concentration of 4000 ppm all conditions remained the same except for replacing the brackish water feed in each cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of tio2 photoanode nio photocathode and tio2 nio photoelectrode in a series connection fig 2 shows the electrochemical and photo electric properties of the tio2 and nio photoelectrodes in fig 2a the short circuit current of a single nio photocathode can reach 1 0 ma with an open circuit voltage ocv of 136 mv the short circuit current of a single tio2 photoanode is 5 9 ma with an ocv of 756 mv when a nio photocathode and a tio2 photoanode were connected in series the short circuit current of the tio2 nio double photoelectrode was slightly smaller than that of a single tio2 photoanode which can be attributed to the risen resistance caused by the increased distance between the photoanode and photocathode bush et al 2018 liang et al 2022a in contrast the ocv of the tio2 nio double photoelectrode increases significantly to 900 mv which is beneficial for obtaining higher energy output chen et al 2020c nam and choi 2019 the efficiency η see its calculation method in the supporting information of a device with the tio2 nio double photoelectrode is 5 43 which is higher than that made of a single nio photocathode at η of 0 2 and a single tio2 photoanode at η of 5 27 bush et al 2018 leijtens et al 2018 eis curves of the tio2 nio double photoelectrode single nio photocathode and single tio2 photoanode are shown in fig 2b the tio2 nio double photoelectrode has the smallest semicircle on its eis nyquist plot under the illumination indicating the lowest surface resistance and the fastest carrier transport rate compared to the other two photoelectrodes liang et al 2020 the redox potentials of the two types of redox electrolytes i3 i and fe cn 6 3 4 are displayed in their cv curves in fig 2c and fig 2d respectively the oxidized potential of i3 i appears at 0 492 v and the reduced potential is at 0 134 v vs ag agcl the redox peaks of fe cn 6 3 4 are located at 0 387 v for oxidation and 0 078 v vs ag agcl for reduction according to the nernst eq 1 1 e r e d o x e r e d o x 0 r t n f l n c o x c r e d where e r e d o x is the redox potential e r e d o x 0 is the standard potential r t n and f are gas constant temperature the number of

reduction of the redox pairs displays a positive and negative shift respectively as shown in fig s3 in the supporting information the detailed inner charge transfer mechanism of the double photoelectrodes connected in series is shown in fig s4 and its related discussion in the supporting information in the tio2 photoanode bach et al 1998 nattestad et al 2010 there are three steps 1 under the light illumination the n719 dye molecule is exited forming an energy band gap between dye dye and dye dye 2 the photogenerated charge is transferred to the conducting band cb of the tio2 photoanode and eventually arrives at the nio photocathode through the external circuit and fto 3 the reduced dye is regenerated by receiving electrons from the redox mediator of i3 i in the nio photocathode daeneke et al 2015 maffeis et al 2021 qin et al 2009 three similar steps exist 1 under photoexcitation the dye molecule forms charge separated states 2 simultaneously the holes are injected into the valance band vb of nio and the reduced dye is regenerated 3 as the redox reaction of i3 i proceeds the electrons are transferred to the integrated electrode the desalination mainly depends on the charge transfer via the integrated electrode and the coupling effect of ion exchange membranes eis tests were also conducted to measure the internal and interfacial resistances of the device as shown in fig s5 in the supporting information this device mainly has two types of resistances a resistance rs of 97 99 ω comes from redox electrolyte and salt stream channels a semicircle rct exists at the intermediate frequency region representing the charge interfacial capacitance and transfer resistance at the photoelectrode electrolyte interfaces liu et al 2018 3 2 the desalination mechanism and performance fig 1 is a schematic diagram of the redox flow desalination device with the double photoelectrodes used in this study it includes three parts dye sensitized tio2 photoanode solar cell redox flow desalination cell and dye sensitized nio photocathode solar cell under light illumination the photosensitizers in solar cells are excited with the formation of charge separated states with the reaction of redox mediators electrons are transferred to the external circuit and reduce the dye the desalination can be realized with the assistance of the two integrated electrodes the ion exchange membranes and the circulation of electrolytes fig 3 a and b shows the time dependent photocurrent potential and ionic conductivity curves under the mode of short circuit and constant current respectively the photocurrent is close to 0 ma under the dark condition fig 3a once the light is illuminated the photocurrent jumps to 6 8 ma it then gradually decreases to 5 53 ma with the prolongation of time during the first 43 2 min the ionic conductivity of the desalted stream decreases rapidly from 7 62 to 1 0 ms cm 1 500 ppm reaching the standard condition of freshwater the salt removal rate is 164 9 µg cm 2 min 1 then it takes 40 6 min more to gradually desalt from 1 0 to 0 2 ms cm 1 with a salt removal rate of 24 1 µg cm 2 min 1 simultaneously the photocurrent declines to 0 149 ma cm2 according to a previous report lee et al 2006 the limiting current density was calculated as 0 158 ma cm2 as shown in fig s6 in the supporting information which was approximately equal to the actual current the decrease in the photocurrent and the salt removal rate can be attributed to the increasing internal resistance of the device when the salt is removed in addition to the salt concentration of 4000 ppm we also tested the desalination performance with the salt concentrations of 1000 2000 8000 and 12 000 ppm fig s7 in the supporting information displays the photocurrent and ionic conductivity variation at different salt concentrations with the increase in salt concentrations the initial photocurrents also increase consistent with a previous study liang et al 2022a and the corresponding salt removal rates see calculation methods in the supporting information and solar desalination capacities increase with the salt concentration as shown in fig s8 in the supporting information the corresponding freshwater production rate was estimated and listed in table s1 in the supporting information besides we tested the desalination performance of devices with single photoelectrode as shown in fig s9 and table s2 the photocurrent and desalination performance of the device with double photoelectrodes are higher than devices with a single tio2 photoanode or a single nio photocathode which is consistent with the energy efficiency shown in j v curves fig 2a we also investigated the influence of the light intensity the light intensity was varied from 102 to 307 mw cm 2 fig s10 and table s3 in the supporting information display photocurrents and salt removal rates at zero bias the photocurrent and salt removal rate only rises slightly with the increased light power density under the constant current mode we recorded the photocurrent using the galvanostatic discharge program of a battery analyzer neware shenzhen china fig 3b shows the potential variation with time under the 3 ma discharge current once illuminated the ocv immediately reaches 0 84 v and remains stable after applying the 3 ma discharge current the voltage decreases to 0 41 v and reduces gradually simultaneously the ionic conductivity of the desalted stream decreases from 7 63 to 1 51 ms cm 1 while that of the concentrated stream increases to 13 75 ms cm 1 correspondingly the whole desalination process lasts for 65 min and the corresponding salt removal rate and solar desalination capacity are 107 2 µg cm 2 min 1 and 0 09 µmol j 1 respectively 3 3 long term stability the salt volume was tenfold increased to 20 ml the other conditions were maintained the same as shown in fig 3c the desalination process lasts 17 5 h and high quality water containing 15 ppm salt is obtained in the desalination stream the salt removal rate and solar desalination capacity were 150 µg cm 2 min 1 and 0 12 µmol j 1 respectively 3 4 cycling stability multiple cycle desalination tests were performed under the same conditions to investigate the cycling stability of the device during the three cycles fig 4 shows that the initial photocurrents are 5 53 ma 5 67 ma and 5 43 ma respectively all three cycles can desalinate the salt feed at the same initial concentration 4000 ppm to 0 02 ms cm 1 about 10 ppm obtaining high quality freshwater besides the salt removal rates of the three cycles shown in fig s11 in the supporting information are 164 9 mg cm 2 min 1 155 2 mg cm 2 min 1 and 151 1 mg cm 2 min 1 respectively without significant performance decline these cycling results suggest that the photoelectrodes and the device have excellent stability we also conducted the cycle desalination tests with pt modified ie to compare the desalination performance of pt modified ie and pedot modified ie the result is shown in fig s12 in the supporting information it demonstrated that the pedot had better desalination performance than pt and could provide more excellent cyclic stability 3 5 the seawater desalination to further explore the practical applicability of this device a seawater desalination test was conducted the photocurrent and ionic conductivity variations are displayed in fig 4b the initial photocurrent increases to 7 6 ma and remains stable for the initial 200 min as the ionic conductivity of the seawater drops the photocurrent gradually decreases the whole desalination process lasts for 309 min and the ionic conductivity of the seawater decreases from 53 45 ms cm 1 to fresh water level after desalination the seawater s ion contents were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma icp and ion chromatography ic the results are listed in table 1 na and cl removal efficiencies in the seawater are greater than 99 other multivalent cations e g ca2 mg2 sr2 k and anions e g so4 2 are also successfully removed to a low level with a high removal efficiency the performances of recently reported solar redox desalination methods are summarized in table s4 in the supporting information the results in this study are much better than those recently reported results in the literature cheng et al 2022 the series architecture of n719 tio2 n719 nio delivered the highest photocurrent of 5 67 ma resulting in an excellent removal rate it also efficiently desalted the natural seawater to freshwater for the first time it achieved excellent salt ion removals for na and cl and other ions e g borate ca2 k mg2 sr2 so4 2 in seawater to increase the practical applicability we further assembled a device with two photoelectrodes placed on one side of the device to be illuminated by a single light source as illustrated in fig s13a in the supporting information two chambers of redox flow electrolyte i3 i or fe cn 6 3 4 were integrated on silicone support the salt stream volume was increased to 6 ml other operation conditions were the same as that in the previous experiments fig s13b shows that once illumination the photocurrent rises to 1 83 ma and then decreases to 1 75 ma after 208 6 min the conductivity of the desalted stream decreases from 7 52 to 5 46 ms cm 1 and the conductivity of the concentrated stream increases to 10 6 ms cm 1 the salt removal rate and solar desalination capacity are 27 7 µg cm 2 min 1 and 0 026 µmol j 1 respectively the photocurrent and desalination performance is lower than in the previous experiment possibly due to the different device configurations especially the salt chambers overall the additional demo further demonstrates the potential for practical applications 4 conclusion an efficient solar redox flow desalination device with double tio2 nio photoelectrodes connected in series is demonstrated the ocv of the device reaches 904 mv the efficiency ŋ of the double photoelectrodes is 5 43 higher than that of a single tio2 photoanode or nio photocathode this device delivers a high photocurrent of 5 67 ma high quality freshwater can be obtained from brackish water containing different concentrations of nacl from 1000 to 12 000 ppm the cycling stability of the device has also been demonstrated with three continuous desalination cycles without significant performance declines natural seawater desalination has also been demonstrated for the first time to obtain high quality freshwater in which the removal efficiencies of multivalent ions are more than 90 the redox flow desalination device with a series double photoelectrode configuration opens a new way to realize efficient and practical solar driven desalination processes credit authorship contribution statement xing wang

14763,benefit cost analysis bca is frequently used to evaluate potable water infrastructure pwi investments however a limitation raised by bca researchers is the narrow view of analysts in identifying investment impacts in this paper we propose a systems thinking framework supported by data from the literature interviews and macroeconomic data to provide analysts with a more systematic and comprehensive view of investment impacts the framework once built can be applied to any pwi investment question to identify the prominent impacts that an analyst should consider taking forward through the quantification stages of the bca process we validate our method for identifying impacts using data from new zealand our method identifies impacts that are typically not valued in bca of pwi investments but that are a common impact of many types of pwi investment decision household costs for example score in the top 10 investment outcomes but are only typically valued in ex post analyses of outbreaks these impacts warrant attention in future benefit cost analyses an additional contribution is the development a new betweenness importance rating which we call flow betweenness to evaluate each impact s prominence within the pwi socio economic system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords potable water infrastructure benefit cost analysis systems thinking infrastructure investment impacts data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction benefit cost analysis bca has become a more common requirement of infrastructure projects since its introduction into us army corps projects persky 2001 most government investment decision frameworks worldwide include bca 1 1 or where benefits are absent the related measure of net present value as part of an investment or policy decision making process treasury new zealand 2015 treasury board of canada secretariat 2022 ukwir 2010 treasury 2022 thus there is now extensive literature on undertaking bca for infrastructure projects new zealand treasury 2015 defines the seven main steps of a bca as shown here 1 define the policy and counterfactual 2 identify who gains and who loses 3 identify the costs and benefits 4 value the costs and benefits 5 discount and compare costs and benefits 6 assess the benefit cost analysis 7 document these steps have been used since bcas became commonplace but their evolution has been uneven there has been substantial literature to support and further develop impact valuation step 4 see e g young 2010 and boardman et al 2017 and to select an appropriate discount rate s step 5 see e g arrow and kruz 2013 but little to support identification of stakeholders and impacts steps 2 and 3 2 2 see also table 1 of the supplemental materials for national benefit cost analysis guides around the world and an analysis of their recommended methods for identifying impacts and stakeholders and selecting impacts for evaluation reed et al 2009 schiller et al 2013 when bcas were first applied in the us army corps the approach to identification was to first calculate easily monetized gains such as expected value of crops saved from flooding and then to list various nonquantifiables such as lives saved persky 2001 p 200 methods to identify costs and benefits have evolved little from identifying what you know you can measure persky 2001 further the literature provides no guidance for identifying which impacts are the most salient an important step before investing significant resource into analysis boardman et al 2017 this problem presents an important policy implication for new zealand potable water infrastructure pwi many new zealand communities cannot afford legislated improvements to their pwi population health waikato district health board 2014 dunne 2015 water new zealand 2017 but are permitted to undertake bca to justify avoiding compliance with standards the critical problem with this requirement is that no guidance is provided on which impacts to value this problem is compounded by the complexity of pwi which includes all infrastructure from source to tap 3 3 intake structures wells pump stations bulk mains pipe distribution networks reservoirs treatment plans and all forms of investment from the extension of a water supply network to rehabilitation of existing infrastructure to softer demand management techniques further since the costs and benefits of a pwi accrue well beyond the community served directly by the pwi it is likely that the analyst will omit them reducing national economic efficiency freeman iii et al 2014 in mishan 2015 p 11 s words in cost benefit analysis we are concerned with the economy as a whole with the welfare of a defined society and not any smaller part of it several bca guidelines allude to a systems thinking approach to identifying impacts by mentioning a path or follow on impacts treasury 2003 florio et al 2008 usepa 2010 treasury new zealand 2015 boardman et al 2017 systems thinking tools such as influence diagrams help overcome cognitive limitations institutionalised practices and misunderstandings by a reducing the risk of missing critical elements b pooling the expertise of multiple experts c facilitating external review and d focusing attention on uncertainties gregory et al 2005 the use of systems thinking tools such as influence diagrams provide a more transparent and defensible way of identifying impacts to be included in bcas influence diagrams and other systems thinking techniques have been used in pwi applications to understand the impacts and influences of water demand and availability bagheri and hjorth 2007 taptiklis 2010 of waterborne illness pasqualini et al 2006 casman et al 2000 infrastructure operations and renewals bianchi and montemaggiore 2008 rehan et al 2011 and company image bianchi and montemaggiore 2008 these influence diagrams have aimed to demonstrate the factors influencing one main type of impact such as company image or waterborne illness however more researchers are exploring beyond single purpose systems models schenk et al 2009 for example developed a systems framework for urban water management the framework attempted to reflect the entire urban water system so that it can be used to explore who and what might be impacted if there is a change in the system similarly erban and walker 2019 propose a framework for evaluating social and environmental impacts of water supply systems based on a distinctions systems relationships and perspectives dsrp map both models allow a thorough exploration of a variety of issues but do not extend to prioritising impacts for evaluation outside of the water supply literature more quantitative methods such as systems dynamics modelling have been used to understand the water food land energy nexus amadei 2019 and forecast the performance of construction projects leon et al 2018 and game theory to predict road user satisfaction osman and nikbakht 2014 to mention a few examples both types of models rely on a method for measuring impacts however and the aim of our exercise is to prioritise impacts for quantification monetisation before investing resource in their quantification or more detailed qualitative assessment we propose a formal process to mitigate omissions of impacts and stakeholders in bcas and to evaluate which impacts of a pwi investment are the most salient to be considered in an economic analysis our systematic method takes a macro economic perspective to identifying all costs and benefits which often extend beyond the community if the sum of the benefits outweighs the investment overall it should be possible to distribute the additional costs and benefits fairly between the parties stakeholder analysis and systems analysis are used to ensure that all benefits and costs are accounted for and to focus on those that are most important from a macro economic perspective we apply our framework to the new zealand water supply industry as a test case developing a more systematic method for identifying impacts of pwi investments and prioritising them for consideration in a project or policy appraisal would benefit the pwi research and practice community by reducing omitted stakeholders and impacts and identifying which may have previously un or undervalued impacts 2 method 2 1 overview the two main components to our method are impacts identification and prioritisation for monetisation we build an influence diagram to visualise the impacts and develop a new measure of betweenness that reflects the prominence of an activity event or impact in pwi in new zealand the influence diagram is based on literature interviews and macroeconomic data from new zealand we develop a new network metric for evaluating the most prominent nodes in the influence diagram we compare the results of the newly developed betweenness measure to traditional betweenness and closeness measures table 1 summarises the main steps of our model build 2 2 data our data the nodes and connections that make up the influence diagram for a potable water supply system were derived from the literature macroeconomic data and semi structured interviews the data collection was undertaken in new zealand in 2011 table 1 shows that we analysed 126 papers and reports that contained stated and revealed preference studies related to potable water supply systems from literature in historical infrastructure developments systems failures investment appraisal systems thinking water consumption and asset management these data were used to identify nodes and causal relationships within the influence diagram we used stakeholder identification questions to identify who initiates change for whose benefit who else is affected who else affects the outcomes and who is required to maintain the change semi structured interviews with 15 stakeholders added further impacts nodes to our diagram we classed data from the literature review and interviews as investment type drivers impacts and stakeholders to capture all appropriate nodes and to document the intermediate influencing factors the literature also indicated connections between many of the nodes as identified in 2d of table 1 we also identified macroeconomic data these data were identified through statistics new zealand s 2001 inter industry tables that reflected the economic interactions of 49 industries within new zealand in 1996 one of these industries was water supply from these tables we identify stakeholders to whom the water supply industry sells consumers and stakeholders that sell to the water supply industry goods and service suppliers these data were used primarily to identify nodes as the causal relationships from input output tables are not qualified at the time of the analysis these were the most recent data available to reflect recent changes more accurately in industries economic activities we adjusted the 1996 data based on each industry s recent gdp contribution 2 3 influence diagram development the main steps in building an influence diagram include defining the system boundary identifying the inputs outputs and system nodes identifying connections between nodes and verifying the model daellenbach et al 2012 steps 1 4 and the data used to support the development of our framework are summarised in table 1 and described more fully below to identify the system boundaries the points at which the system begins and ends bosch et al 2007 we define the investment drivers as the start nodes these include the stakeholder s action s and or environmental factor s that drive the perceived need for each investment type to define the end nodes we used stakeholder national or community level well being measures which is in line with keeney 1992 s concept of fundamental objectives in new zealand government investments are evaluated in terms of four well beings economic environmental social and cultural new zealand government 2012a thus end nodes were those that would fit into one of the four well being categories system nodes were identified by first developing stakeholder and impact identification questions 4 4 complete method and questions detailed in the supplemental materials then reviewing the literature on impacts of pwi investments and macroeconomic data these literature included historical pwi asset management investment policy appraisal system failures ex post analyses water consumption stakeholder management and systems thinking investment types include building new pwi expanding or upgrading existing 5 5 further detail on investment types is provided in the section types of pwi investments to include in influence diagram in the supplemental materials we verified system nodes and connections based on stakeholder interviews the stakeholder selection process involved categorising stakeholders evaluating the importance of each stakeholder category and selecting stakeholders from each category by identifying those that were most important based on their consumption macroeconomic contributions or prominence in the literature by first identifying the categories we ensure that categories that typically receive little attention in the literature such as non consumers are also considered the literature provided us with a list of nearly 50 stakeholder types in ten categories 6 6 as shown in table 4 of the supplemental materials our resources allowed us to select only 15 stakeholder representatives for interviews to ensure wide stakeholder representation we selected stakeholders to such that each of the ten stakeholder categories was represented by at least one stakeholder stakeholder categories that arose from our literature review and coding are summarised in table 2 7 7 the full description of our method for prioritising stakeholders is provided in the section prioritise stakeholders for interview in the supplemental materials we used semi structured interviews to allow for any new stakeholders or impacts to be identified through the interviews we asked specific questions about stakeholders impacts and investment drivers to validate pre selected nodes and identify new ones 8 8 the interview prompts are provided in the supplemental materials thematic analysis was undertaken by reviewing stakeholders interview transcripts and coding or highlighting passages of text that corresponded to the concepts of stakeholders impacts investments drivers and context the qualitative software nvivo qsr international 2012 was used to store transcriptions code and manage coded references we expand the initial network based on the impacts identified in the literature and during interviews the original influence diagram is verified and updated with the new stakeholders impacts investment drivers context and inter connections identified through the coded content from interviews and additional supporting literature where necessary the diagram is entered into the gephi software bastian et al 2009 for visualisation and in depth analysis to identify the network connections and their directionality each investment type node was isolated and the investment driver nodes connected to the investment type nodes by influence arrows similarly influence arrows were drawn between the investment type nodes and each immediate impact node many impact nodes influenced other impact nodes the process of connecting impact nodes stopped when the impact could be identified as influencing a fundamental objective of economic environmental social or cultural wellbeing this process was repeated for each investment type until all impacts identified in the literature had been included the initial influence diagram was complete after all investment types stakeholders and impacts had been addressed to check for orphaned nodes and ensure that all inputs were connected to at least one output the nodes and connections are organised into a matrix all the nodes are provided a unique id and name and are organised such that they become the headers for both rows and columns attributes of an n x n adjacency matrix rows contain input nodes and columns contain output nodes and connections are represented by a 1 when the cell in one row is the input for a given output in the column we verified matrix logic by validating that known inputs had only outgoing links known outputs had only incoming links shortest path tests confirmed that all inputs were connected to at least one output shortest path tests that all inputs were connected to at least on means node shortest path tests that at least one means node was attached to an output node based on the verification process corrections were made to remedy orphaned nodes and orphaned sub component clusters 2 4 evaluate node importance once the matrix is developed we calculate the nodes importance using a measure that considers that the network has a set of start points and a set of end points and a network of intermediate nodes we are considering the impacts of investment decisions and environmental factors on stakeholders a network having a set of start points and set of end points is unusual in the network analysis literature in most literature the nodes could equally be start or end nodes such as origins or destinations or people in a social network thus we required a metric that reflected the overall directional nature of our network acknowledging the defined start and endpoints based on a comprehensive review of over 400 network analysis papers morrison et al 2022 we found that existing measures reflect either a single node s connection or distance from other nodes e g node degree and closeness or overall importance of a given node in a network where there is no overall network flow e g eigen centrality and betweenness as identified directional flow occurs in our network based our review centrality and betweenness metrics are closest to meeting our criteria because they measure the importance of each node within the overall network both are also based on shortest path analysis which is also relevant to our metric because we want to measure the flow between any two nodes just once however they do not reflect the directional importance of a network level set of start end pairs or flow the only other identifiable flow related measure was ascendancy ulanowicz 2005 but flow in this context was across time and in reference to system adaptation rather than within flow within the system in addition ascendancy like other network measures also included all nodes as potential start and end points we have therefore developed a method based on betweenness centrality which like betweenness also uses a shortest path algorithm as its main metric generation tool however our method assesses only a subset of what would be assessed in betweenness centrality the number of times a node is on the shortest path between each start end node pair as opposed to each possible pair in the entire network the approach shows which intermediate nodes are the most influential on performance outcomes by indicating which of these nodes are most connected to start end pairs betweenness centrality would provide a too generalised viewpoint of the level of connectivity of each node given that is assesses all node pair connections to assess each mean node s impact on the end nodes pwi investment outcomes a depth first search was used to understand which means nodes were connected to the end node under consideration and then to identify its depth or number of nodes away from the end node a generalised shortest path algorithm was then developed to identify all shortest paths between a start end node pair the metric is calculated as the sum of all paths across all start end node pairs that pass through an intermediate node we call this metric flow betweenness because it is an extension of the betweenness metric and reflects flow within the network the importance or flow betweenness score g of an intermediate node m is thus g m i 1 s j 1 e σ i j m where g m is the flow betweenness score of node m σ i j total number of shortest paths for the start end combination pair i j directly connected to node m s number of start nodes e number of end nodes i j k in many instances the same path distance number of nodes between node s and node e transpired through more than one pathway we counted the number of pathways that had the shortest path to calculate the scores we used netlogo wilensky 1999 a script based application with specific network analysis extensions 2 5 analysis test finally to demonstrate that a systematic method can present an improvement over less structured methods we develop a test to compare our systematic method to the traditional unstructured method of identifying impacts we compared the baseline impacts those available in the literature to those identified by our framework if our framework identifies new important impacts then it represents an improvement for our baseline we used impacts that have previously been monetised for bca from an extensive literature review we also tested correlation between our new metric and the more traditional ones of betweenness and eigen centrality 3 results through this research we identified 329 nodes that form part of the pwi system although the number of nodes can vary depending on where the analyst draws their system boundaries and how they choose to break down each node connection 25 impacts were identified through interviews that had not been previously identified through the literature in which impacts have been identified this piece of the analysis confirms that there are impacts that are overlooked in bcas however the number of nodes alone is not meaningful as an impact could be further abstracted or generalised or broken down into more components to confirm that these additional impacts are important to a similar level as

illness affordability local and national government costs commercial revenues amount of infrastructure and household costs the new betweenness approach was also compared to the more traditional betweenness and eigen value approach the correlation analysis showed very low correlation between the metrics covariance 0 000016 for eigen value and 0 01 for betweenness centrality which suggests they operate distinctly differently from one another betweenness centrality does not identify affordability government costs household costs or amount of infrastructure as important impacts high scoring nodes are a combination of input just downstream of start nodes and output just upstream of end nodes variables this occurs because there are no start or end nodes so an upstream variable could be equally influential generally speaking as a downstream variable or outcome the metric shows how important the node is to the overall system but not to start end pairs as the upstream nodes are not impacts this metric is less suited to our problem eigen value on the other hand identifies a large number of downstream variables nodes closer to the end nodes as equally important so the eigen value is more suited than betweenness to identifying impacts however it identifies many specific impacts that at least on the surface are intuitively linked to very specific investment types our new flow betweenness metric identifies more aggregated or higher level impacts as most important for example flow betweenness identifies national regional and local government costs as a highly important outcome the eigen value gives this same variable a score of 0 but gives high scores for some of the components of national regional and local government costs including school operability community swimming pool s ability to remain open and collect revenue other goods supplier revenue and revenue from hiring of sports grounds thus flow betweenness appears to be better suited to identifying categories of impacts while eigen value appears to be suited to identifying specific cost components 3 2 important pwi investment impacts rarely or not monetised in table 3 the far right

of ways than those that have previously been monetised illness for example is typically only valued ex post following a waterborne disease outbreak or rarely ex ante to evaluate a water treatment investment decision similarly industrial commercial or agricultural revenue is not valued as an impact except in rare ex post evaluations of waterborne disease outbreaks these high scoring impacts warrant a deeper consideration for valuation in bcas although illness affordability emissions national and local government costs and commercial revenue are often discussed in the context of the bca of a pwi their costs and benefits are rarely calculated our analysis shows that affordability for example is most influenced by household costs which is not surprising but the influence diagram fig 2 show that these costs manifest not only through water rates but also through the costs of by illness 67 fatalities 44 and disability 43 household water equipment for storage 57 sourcing 45 and treatment 38 water rates 44 and cost of goods and services 37 thus our method has identified several impacts as prominent that are rarely valued in bcas and warrant greater consideration 4 discussion we hypothesised that without a systematic method to identify pwi investment impacts analysts could be restricting their analysis to primary stakeholders interests we found that a more systematic method revealed stakeholders impacts and mechanisms that are not prominent in the literature and in bca analyses the mechanisms are important because if a mechanism is neglected then there are two risks the first is that in some contexts the impact will not be identified as a likely outcome of a situation the second is that if there are other mechanisms by which the impact will still occur the impact will not be fully valued our method identified new mechanisms by which impacts occur that have not been previously valued in the literature for example the cost of illness due to additional emissions household costs due to water bills of goods and service suppliers are not monetised similarly household costs are typically only valued to reflect an event as opposed to chronic issues such as low water pressure or water poor taste these impacts and the relevant stakeholders should be considered in a bca for pwi improvements the implication of our findings for pwi owners managers and analysts is that a bca for pwi investments should consider impacts on and influences from goods and service suppliers and households in response to chronic pwi performance there are likely to be opportunities for legislation at a national level that recognises these important inter relationships and the potential to create greater national wellbeing by having these stakeholders work together our method also allows the analyst to examine which inputs most influence a particular output the analyst can isolate government costs for example and identify those inputs and events that most influence government costs such as industrial commercial and agricultural revenue resulting from opportunities from water suppliers long term plans and performance targets conversely the analyst can identify the most important impacts of a given input decision or event the decision to treat water to a higher quality for example will reduce illness through waterborne disease but potentially increase it through emissions arising from additional treatment equipment the method we have proposed fills a gap not only in bca literature but also in other investment evaluation methods such multi criteria analyses where systematic methods for identifying the impacts of a proposed investment are lacking and in the stakeholder management literature where methods for identifying stakeholders are lacking while many bca guidelines and studies suggest the use of systems thinking approaches none of them proposes an explicit method as shown in table 1 in the supplemental materials our method would be useful in these broader fields of investment appraisal and stakeholder management our approach would also be beneficial to incorporate into infrastructure owners asset management plans it would help asset managers identify the extent to which an investment decision might have unexpected positive or negative implications for an intended level of service and their planning and decisions could be updated to prepare for these implications it could also give them the impetus to collaborate with other industry organisations the example discussed for fig 2 shows that there are many ways in which pwi investment decisions influence household costs thus collaborations with other organisations that are also concerned with these effects such as departments of health could help reduce overall costs of providing a good level of service although our method presents a novel approach to identifying the most important impacts the scores imply equal weighting of each connection which we know intuitively is unlikely to be the case and although the approach to building the systems diagram attempts to provide a broad view of the socio economic system of pwi inevitably there remains a level of subjectivity which manifests through stakeholder interviews selection of stakeholders and our own analysis nevertheless it represents a different approach and a new attempt at reducing bias another weakness of our method is that it is resource intensive we propose that it is mainly used to establish a system from which nearly any investment can be analysed in the future once a water authority develops the system diagram it can identify a given investment and then the subset of nodes that are relevant to the proposed investment the flow betweenness can then be measured as described in our method the foundational work of developing the initial system would make it quicker and easier to analyse nearly any investment decision and also to identify major stakeholders our method could be more widely applied to public investment decisions of all kinds it could be the first step of a bca 5 conclusion our method for developing a systems diagram and our flow betweenness metric brings analysts closer to the bca spirit of considering all positive and negative impacts of an investment and provides guidance to identifying which impacts to monetise what we have proposed is not the definitive method but it is an important step towards a systematic method to ensure that bcas do not omit important externalities although our research was undertaken in new zealand the same method could be applied anywhere that potable water is supplied by a central body such as a utility or municipality the research presented in this paper confirms the hypothesis that some of the most prominent impacts of pwi investments have not been monetised future research into the magnitude of costs and benefits omitted from bcas based on the gaps identified through our method would be a

14763,benefit cost analysis bca is frequently used to evaluate potable water infrastructure pwi investments however a limitation raised by bca researchers is the narrow view of analysts in identifying investment impacts in this paper we propose a systems thinking framework supported by data from the literature interviews and macroeconomic data to provide analysts with a more systematic and comprehensive view of investment impacts the framework once built can be applied to any pwi investment question to identify the prominent impacts that an analyst should consider taking forward through the quantification stages of the bca process we validate our method for identifying impacts using data from new zealand our method identifies impacts that are typically not valued in bca of pwi investments but that are a common impact of many types of pwi investment decision household costs for example score in the top 10 investment outcomes but are only typically valued in ex post analyses of outbreaks these impacts warrant attention in future benefit cost analyses an additional contribution is the development a new betweenness importance rating which we call flow betweenness to evaluate each impact s prominence within the pwi socio economic system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords potable water infrastructure benefit cost analysis systems thinking infrastructure investment impacts data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction benefit cost analysis bca has become a more common requirement of infrastructure projects since its introduction into us army corps projects persky 2001 most government investment decision frameworks worldwide include bca 1 1 or where benefits are absent the related measure of net present value as part of an investment or policy decision making process treasury new zealand 2015 treasury board of canada secretariat 2022 ukwir 2010 treasury 2022 thus there is now extensive literature on undertaking bca for infrastructure projects new zealand treasury 2015 defines the seven main steps of a bca as shown here 1 define the policy and counterfactual 2 identify who gains and who loses 3 identify the costs and benefits 4 value the costs and benefits 5 discount and compare costs and benefits 6 assess the benefit cost analysis 7 document these steps have been used since bcas became commonplace but their evolution has been uneven there has been substantial literature to support and further develop impact valuation step 4 see e g young 2010 and boardman et al 2017 and to select an appropriate discount rate s step 5 see e g arrow and kruz 2013 but little to support identification of stakeholders and impacts steps 2 and 3 2 2 see also table 1 of the supplemental materials for national benefit cost analysis guides around the world and an analysis of their recommended methods for identifying impacts and stakeholders and selecting impacts for evaluation reed et al 2009 schiller et al 2013 when bcas were first applied in the us army corps the approach to identification was to first calculate easily monetized gains such as expected value of crops saved from flooding and then to list various nonquantifiables such as lives saved persky 2001 p 200 methods to identify costs and benefits have evolved little from identifying what you know you can measure persky 2001 further the literature provides no guidance for identifying which impacts are the most salient an important step before investing significant resource into analysis boardman et al 2017 this problem presents an important policy implication for new zealand potable water infrastructure pwi many new zealand communities cannot afford legislated improvements to their pwi population health waikato district health board 2014 dunne 2015 water new zealand 2017 but are permitted to undertake bca to justify avoiding compliance with standards the critical problem with this requirement is that no guidance is provided on which impacts to value this problem is compounded by the complexity of pwi which includes all infrastructure from source to tap 3 3 intake structures wells pump stations bulk mains pipe distribution networks reservoirs treatment plans and all forms of investment from the extension of a water supply network to rehabilitation of existing infrastructure to softer demand management techniques further since the costs and benefits of a pwi accrue well beyond the community served directly by the pwi it is likely that the analyst will omit them reducing national economic efficiency freeman iii et al 2014 in mishan 2015 p 11 s words in cost benefit analysis we are concerned with the economy as a whole with the welfare of a defined society and not any smaller part of it several bca guidelines allude to a systems thinking approach to identifying impacts by mentioning a path or follow on impacts treasury 2003 florio et al 2008 usepa 2010 treasury new zealand 2015 boardman et al 2017 systems thinking tools such as influence diagrams help overcome cognitive limitations institutionalised practices and misunderstandings by a reducing the risk of missing critical elements b pooling the expertise of multiple experts c facilitating external review and d focusing attention on uncertainties gregory et al 2005 the use of systems thinking tools such as influence diagrams provide a more transparent and defensible way of identifying impacts to be included in bcas influence diagrams and other systems thinking techniques have been used in pwi applications to understand the impacts and influences of water demand and availability bagheri and hjorth 2007 taptiklis 2010 of waterborne illness pasqualini et al 2006 casman et al 2000 infrastructure operations and renewals bianchi and montemaggiore 2008 rehan et al 2011 and company image bianchi and montemaggiore 2008 these influence diagrams have aimed to demonstrate the factors influencing one main type of impact such as company image or waterborne illness however more researchers are exploring beyond single purpose systems models schenk et al 2009 for example developed a systems framework for urban water management the framework attempted to reflect the entire urban water system so that it can be used to explore who and what might be impacted if there is a change in the system similarly erban and walker 2019 propose a framework for evaluating social and environmental impacts of water supply systems based on a distinctions systems relationships and perspectives dsrp map both models allow a thorough exploration of a variety of issues but do not extend to prioritising impacts for evaluation outside of the water supply literature more quantitative methods such as systems dynamics modelling have been used to understand the water food land energy nexus amadei 2019 and forecast the performance of construction projects leon et al 2018 and game theory to predict road user satisfaction osman and nikbakht 2014 to mention a few examples both types of models rely on a method for measuring impacts however and the aim of our exercise is to prioritise impacts for quantification monetisation before investing resource in their quantification or more detailed qualitative assessment we propose a formal process to mitigate omissions of impacts and stakeholders in bcas and to evaluate which impacts of a pwi investment are the most salient to be considered in an economic analysis our systematic method takes a macro economic perspective to identifying all costs and benefits which often extend beyond the community if the sum of the benefits outweighs the investment overall it should be possible to distribute the additional costs and benefits fairly between the parties stakeholder analysis and systems analysis are used to ensure that all benefits and costs are accounted for and to focus on those that are most important from a macro economic perspective we apply our framework to the new zealand water supply industry as a test case developing a more systematic method for identifying impacts of pwi investments and prioritising them for consideration in a project or policy appraisal would benefit the pwi research and practice community by reducing omitted stakeholders and impacts and identifying which may have previously un or undervalued impacts 2 method 2 1 overview the two main components to our method are impacts identification and prioritisation for monetisation we build an influence diagram to visualise the impacts and develop a new measure of betweenness that reflects the prominence of an activity event or impact in pwi in new zealand the influence diagram is based on literature interviews and macroeconomic data from new zealand we develop a new network metric for evaluating the most prominent nodes in the influence diagram we compare the results of the newly developed betweenness measure to traditional betweenness and closeness measures table 1 summarises the main steps of our model build 2 2 data our data the nodes and connections that make up the influence diagram for a potable water supply system were derived from the literature macroeconomic data and semi structured interviews the data collection was undertaken in new zealand in 2011 table 1 shows that we analysed 126 papers and reports that contained stated and revealed preference studies related to potable water supply systems from literature in historical infrastructure developments systems failures investment appraisal systems thinking water consumption and asset management these data were used to identify nodes and causal relationships within the influence diagram we used stakeholder identification questions to identify who initiates change for whose benefit who else is affected who else affects the outcomes and who is required to maintain the change semi structured interviews with 15 stakeholders added further impacts nodes to our diagram we classed data from the literature review and interviews as investment type drivers impacts and stakeholders to capture all appropriate nodes and to document the intermediate influencing factors the literature also indicated connections between many of the nodes as identified in 2d of table 1 we also identified macroeconomic data these data were identified through statistics new zealand s 2001 inter industry tables that reflected the economic interactions of 49 industries within new zealand in 1996 one of these industries was water supply from these tables we identify stakeholders to whom the water supply industry sells consumers and stakeholders that sell to the water supply industry goods and service suppliers these data were used primarily to identify nodes as the causal relationships from input output tables are not qualified at the time of the analysis these were the most recent data available to reflect recent changes more accurately in industries economic activities we adjusted the 1996 data based on each industry s recent gdp contribution 2 3 influence diagram development the main steps in building an influence diagram include defining the system boundary identifying the inputs outputs and system nodes identifying connections between nodes and verifying the model daellenbach et al 2012 steps 1 4 and the data used to support the development of our framework are summarised in table 1 and described more fully below to identify the system boundaries the points at which the system begins and ends bosch et al 2007 we define the investment drivers as the start nodes these include the stakeholder s action s and or environmental factor s that drive the perceived need for each investment type to define the end nodes we used stakeholder national or community level well being measures which is in line with keeney 1992 s concept of fundamental objectives in new zealand government investments are evaluated in terms of four well beings economic environmental social and cultural new zealand government 2012a thus end nodes were those that would fit into one of the four well being categories system nodes were identified by first developing stakeholder and impact identification questions 4 4 complete method and questions detailed in the supplemental materials then reviewing the literature on impacts of pwi investments and macroeconomic data these literature included historical pwi asset management investment policy appraisal system failures ex post analyses water consumption stakeholder management and systems thinking investment types include building new pwi expanding or upgrading existing 5 5 further detail on investment types is provided in the section types of pwi investments to include in influence diagram in the supplemental materials we verified system nodes and connections based on stakeholder interviews the stakeholder selection process involved categorising stakeholders evaluating the importance of each stakeholder category and selecting stakeholders from each category by identifying those that were most important based on their consumption macroeconomic contributions or prominence in the literature by first identifying the categories we ensure that categories that typically receive little attention in the literature such as non consumers are also considered the literature provided us with a list of nearly 50 stakeholder types in ten categories 6 6 as shown in table 4 of the supplemental materials our resources allowed us to select only 15 stakeholder representatives for interviews to ensure wide stakeholder representation we selected stakeholders to such that each of the ten stakeholder categories was represented by at least one stakeholder stakeholder categories that arose from our literature review and coding are summarised in table 2 7 7 the full description of our method for prioritising stakeholders is provided in the section prioritise stakeholders for interview in the supplemental materials we used semi structured interviews to allow for any new stakeholders or impacts to be identified through the interviews we asked specific questions about stakeholders impacts and investment drivers to validate pre selected nodes and identify new ones 8 8 the interview prompts are provided in the supplemental materials thematic analysis was undertaken by reviewing stakeholders interview transcripts and coding or highlighting passages of text that corresponded to the concepts of stakeholders impacts investments drivers and context the qualitative software nvivo qsr international 2012 was used to store transcriptions code and manage coded references we expand the initial network based on the impacts identified in the literature and during interviews the original influence diagram is verified and updated with the new stakeholders impacts investment drivers context and inter connections identified through the coded content from interviews and additional supporting literature where necessary the diagram is entered into the gephi software bastian et al 2009 for visualisation and in depth analysis to identify the network connections and their directionality each investment type node was isolated and the investment driver nodes connected to the investment type nodes by influence arrows similarly influence arrows were drawn between the investment type nodes and each immediate impact node many impact nodes influenced other impact nodes the process of connecting impact nodes stopped when the impact could be identified as influencing a fundamental objective of economic environmental social or cultural wellbeing this process was repeated for each investment type until all impacts identified in the literature had been included the initial influence diagram was complete after all investment types stakeholders and impacts had been addressed to check for orphaned nodes and ensure that all inputs were connected to at least one output the nodes and connections are organised into a matrix all the nodes are provided a unique id and name and are organised such that they become the headers for both rows and columns attributes of an n x n adjacency matrix rows contain input nodes and columns contain output nodes and connections are represented by a 1 when the cell in one row is the input for a given output in the column we verified matrix logic by validating that known inputs had only outgoing links known outputs had only incoming links shortest path tests confirmed that all inputs were connected to at least one output shortest path tests that all inputs were connected to at least on means node shortest path tests that at least one means node was attached to an output node based on the verification process corrections were made to remedy orphaned nodes and orphaned sub component clusters 2 4 evaluate node importance once the matrix is developed we calculate the nodes importance using a measure that considers that the network has a set of start points and a set of end points and a network of intermediate nodes we are considering the impacts of investment decisions and environmental factors on stakeholders a network having a set of start points and set of end points is unusual in the network analysis literature in most literature the nodes could equally be start or end nodes such as origins or destinations or people in a social network thus we required a metric that reflected the overall directional nature of our network acknowledging the defined start and endpoints based on a comprehensive review of over 400 network analysis papers morrison et al 2022 we found that existing measures reflect either a single node s connection or distance from other nodes e g node degree and closeness or overall importance of a given node in a network where there is no overall network flow e g eigen centrality and betweenness as identified directional flow occurs in our network based our review centrality and betweenness metrics are closest to meeting our criteria because they measure the importance of each node within the overall network both are also based on shortest path analysis which is also relevant to our metric because we want to measure the flow between any two nodes just once however they do not reflect the directional importance of a network level set of start end pairs or flow the only other identifiable flow related measure was ascendancy ulanowicz 2005 but flow in this context was across time and in reference to system adaptation rather than within flow within the system in addition ascendancy like other network measures also included all nodes as potential start and end points we have therefore developed a method based on betweenness centrality which like betweenness also uses a shortest path algorithm as its main metric generation tool however our method assesses only a subset of what would be assessed in betweenness centrality the number of times a node is on the shortest path between each start end node pair as opposed to each possible pair in the entire network the approach shows which intermediate nodes are the most influential on performance outcomes by indicating which of these nodes are most connected to start end pairs betweenness centrality would provide a too generalised viewpoint of the level of connectivity of each node given that is assesses all node pair connections to assess each mean node s impact on the end nodes pwi investment outcomes a depth first search was used to understand which means nodes were connected to the end node under consideration and then to identify its depth or number of nodes away from the end node a generalised shortest path algorithm was then developed to identify all shortest paths between a start end node pair the metric is calculated as the sum of all paths across all start end node pairs that pass through an intermediate node we call this metric flow betweenness because it is an extension of the betweenness metric and reflects flow within the network the importance or flow betweenness score g of an intermediate node m is thus g m i 1 s j 1 e σ i j m where g m is the flow betweenness score of node m σ i j total number of shortest paths for the start end combination pair i j directly connected to node m s number of start nodes e number of end nodes i j k in many instances the same path distance number of nodes between node s and node e transpired through more than one pathway we counted the number of pathways that had the shortest path to calculate the scores we used netlogo wilensky 1999 a script based application with specific network analysis extensions 2 5 analysis test finally to demonstrate that a systematic method can present an improvement over less structured methods we develop a test to compare our systematic method to the traditional unstructured method of identifying impacts we compared the baseline impacts those available in the literature to those identified by our framework if our framework

nodes alone is not meaningful as an impact could be further abstracted or generalised or broken down into more components to confirm that these additional impacts are important to a similar level as

14764,antibiotic resistance genes args have become as emerging contaminant with great concerns worldwide due to their threats to human health it is thus urgent to develop techniques to degrade args in water in this study mos2 fe3o4 mf particles were fabricated and used to activate peroxymonosulfate pms for the degradation of four types of free dna bases t a c and g major components of args and args we found that mf pms system could effectively degrade all four dna bases t within 10 min a within 30 min c within 5 min and g within 5 min in very short time during the reaction process mf could activate pms to form the reactive radicals such as oh so4 o2 and 1o2 contributing to the degradation of dna bases due to the low adsorption energy high charge transfer and great capability for pms cleavage mf exhibited excellent pms adsorption and activation performances mos2 in mf could enhance the cycle of fe iii fe ii improving the catalytic performance excellent catalytic performances of mf pms system were achieved in complex water matrix including different solution ph coexisting of anions and natural organic matter as well as in real water samples including tap water river water sea water and sewage especially under high salinity conditions due to the generation of cl radicals and hclo species mf pms system could also efficiently degrade args chromosomal kanr and plasmid gmra and dna extracted from antibiotic resistant bacteria arb in super short time moreover complete disinfection of two types of model arb e coli k 12 mg 1655 and e coli s17 1 could also be achieved in mf pms system the high degradation performances of mf pms system achieved in the reused experiments and the 14 day continuous flow reactor experiments indicated the stability of mf particles due to the magnetic property it would be convenient to separate mf particles from water after use via using magnet facilitating their reuse of mf and avoiding potential water contamination by catalysts overall this study not only provided a deep insight on fe mo triggered pms activation process but also provided an effective and reliable approach for the treatment of dna bases args dna and arb in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mos2 fe3o4 particles peroxymonosulfate antibiotic resistance genes free dna bases antibiotic resistant bacteria data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the persistent overuse and misuse of antibiotics have driven to the propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args in water infrastructure lulijwa et al 2020 ochman et al 2000 due to the low efficiency for the removal of arb and args by conventional treatment approaches such as uv irradiation and chlorination wastewater treatment plants have become hotspots and main sources for arb and args that subsequently discharged into natural environments via sewage effluents and biosolids wang et al 2020 raza et al 2022 extracellular args have been found to be widespread and abundant in natural environments such as rivers estuaries and soils chen et al 2019 zhu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the transmission of extracellular args present in natural environments could be further enhanced via horizontal transfer and their environmental risks would be greatly increased ju et al 2019 sivalingam et al 2020 args thus have been widely recognized as emerging pollutants to reduce their environmental risks it is critical to develop new techniques to degrade args via generation of different types of reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 and so on that could attack args advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton reaction ahmed et al 2021 photoelectrocatalytic method qi et al 2022 and photocatalytic method zhang et al 2022a have been found to potentially degrade args for example giannakis et al 2018 showed that solar photo fenton process could eliminate args in water via the generated oh li et al 2020a found that hierarchical bi2o2co3 microspheres wrapped with nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide could degrade args by oh produced under uv visible light irradiation owing to the generation of sulfate radicals so4 oh and 1o2 yang et al 2018 peroxymonosulfate pms based aops have also recently been shown to effectively degrade args yao et al 2022 liu et al 2022b 2023b for example yao et al 2022 found that the activation of pms by uv could effectively remove plasmid encoded args via the generated 1o2 liu et al 2022b showed that fe2 produced by the reaction of sulfidated nanoscale zerovalent iron with oxygen in water could activate pms to generate so4 so5 and oh leading to the removal of args magnetic fe3o4 particles which would be easily recovered after use by using external magnetic force could also activate pms to generate ros shao et al 2022 exhibiting the potentials to degrade args nevertheless without cycling of fe iii fe ii the removal performances of args in pms and bare fe3o4 particle system might be limited previous studies have reported that by using different types of co catalysts such as bioi tong et al 2022 ws2 dong et al 2018 and mo xiang et al 2022 the cycle of fe iii fe ii in fe based aops system could be achieved since the presence of unsaturated s atoms could provide reductive capability as well as the potential transition between mo iv and mo vi mos2 has been shown to be one of the most ideal co catalysts to facilitate the cycle of fe iii fe ii and enhance the h2o2 tong et al 2020 and pms activation performances zhou et al 2022 combining mos2 with fe3o4 thus is expected to efficiently activate pms to remove args note that due to magnetic property recycle of the magnetic fe3o4 and mos2 composites from water after use would be very convenient the potential water contamination by catalysts thus could be avoided in this work mos2 fe3o4 mf was synthesized by co precipitation of fe iii and fe ii onto the surface of mos2 spheres the as prepared samples were well characterized note that args are mainly composed by dna bases deoxyribose and phosphate lu et al 2021 the radical induced args damages are mainly caused by the attack of dna bases dizdaroglu et al 2012 the degradation processes of dna bases thus are very crucial for args degradation due to its lowest reduction potential 1 29 v base guanine g is found to be most easily oxidized and damaged dna bases than other ones such as thymine t adenine a and cytosine c von sonntag 2006 steenken et al 1992 however solely g damage could not lead to the complete break up of args zhang et al 2019 moreover due to the higher reduction potential of the guanosine radical 1 29 v than those of alkyl peroxyl radicals 1 05 v it is feasible for dna to be repaired by histone proteins steenken and jovanovic 1997 thus to testify whether pms activation via mf could completely degrade args its degradation performances towards all dna bases including t a c and g were examined in present study the degradation mechanisms of dna bases and their degradation pathways were determined moreover the degradation performances of dna bases in complex water matrix such as at different solution ph with the co presence of anions and natural organic matter and in real water samples with large working volume of 1 l were also examined furthermore the degradation performances in four reused cycles as well as in a continuous flow reactor consecutively running for 14 days were determined in addition mf pms system towards degradation of two model args chromosomal kanr and plasmid gmra and dna extracted from arb as well as disinfection of two types of model arb e coli k 12 mg 1655 and e coli s17 1 were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o thioacetamide ch4n2s ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o ferrous sulfate

the stock solution of a g c t peroxymonosulfate pms and other materials were prepared following the approaches shown in the text s1 of supplementary material e coli k 12 mg1655 and e coli s17 1 were cultivated and stored following the text s2 and used for the extraction of args and dna text s3 2 2 fabrication and characterization of catalytic materials for the fabrication of mos2 particles 50 ml of binary solution containing 1 mmol of nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o and 30 mmol of ch4n2s was heated at 220 c for 18 h to form black precipitate after washing and drying process mos2 particles could be obtained fe3o4 was deposited onto the surface of mos2 by co precipitation process specifically 800 mg of mos2 particles were well dispersed in 100 ml of water under sonification followed by the addition of 0 01 mol of fecl3 6h2o and 0 01 mol of feso4 7h2o then 2 m of naoh solution was added dropwise under n2 atmosphere until the solution ph reached 10 and continued stirring for 30 min to obtain mos2 fe3o4 mf pure fe3o4 was synthesized by a similar process without the presence of mos2 various techniques were used to characterize the composition and structure of mf details about fabrication and characterization were provided in the text s4 2 3 catalytic experiments the catalytic experiments were conducted in a double wall reactor fig s1 with the circular water cooling system going on to keep the temperature of reaction systems at 25 c based on the results of preliminary experiments text s5 figs s2 and s3 the dose of both mf and pms were set to be 200 mg l for the catalytic experiments in a typical degradation experiment of free dna bases 10 mg of catalysts were dispersed into the 50 ml of bases solution 10 μm under sonication and then the solution was kept stirring by a mechanical agitation after mechanically stirring for 20 min an adsorption desorption equilibrium would be achieved then 0 5 ml of pms stock solution 20 g l was added into the suspension to initiate the reaction at specific duration 1 ml of samples at certain intervals were filtrated by 0 22 μm membranes and 0 5 ml of the filtrate would be mixed with 0 5 ml of ethanol to terminate the reaction the concentrations of bases in the samples were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc text s6 the degradation pathway was explored by using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms text s7 and density functional theory dft calculation text s8 toxicities of the by products produced during the degradation processes of dna bases were determined by t e s t software version 4 2 the total organic carbon toc values in the reaction suspensions during the dna bases degradation process were also determined by toc lcph shimadzu japan in the recycle experiments the used materials were separated under magnetic field and treated with h2o2 solution text s9 for sustainable activation du et al 2020 the roles of reactive oxygen species ros were studied through scavenger experiments and electron spin resonance spectrometry esr bruker emx plus the released ions were determined by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms to testify the feasibility of mf pms system for practical application the catalytic degradation performances of chosen bases in complex water matrix at different solution ph with the co presence of anions and natural organic matter as well as in real water samples including tap water river water sea water and sewage were also investigated e coli k 12 mg1655 containing kanamycin resistance genes kanr on chromosome and e coli s17 1 containing gentamycin resistance genes gmra on plasmid were employed as two model arb in present study cultivation protocol was provided in text s2 from which args chromosomal kanr and plasmid gmra and dna were extracted details in text s3 kanr was 1303 bp long while gmra was 534 bp long the primer sequences were provided in text s10 the qpcr assays were all performed by using tiangen superreal premix plus sybr green detailed information about qpcr analysis was provided in text s10 the detailed information about args and dna degradation experiments as well as arb disinfection could also be seen in the supplementary material texts s10 and s11 in present study the primer sequences for kanr and gmra were self designed through primer blast which was provided by u s national library of medicine national center for biotechnology information ncbi 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mos2 fe3o4 sem image fig s4a showed that mos2 fe3o4 named as mf diameter of about 800 nm had a flower like shape with fe3o4 nanoparticles 10 nm depositing on the surfaces of mos2 constructed by many nanosheets with a width of around 20 nm fig s4b the peaks at 2θ 14 3 33 4 39 5 49 1 and 58 5 in the xrd pattern of mf were corresponded to the 002 101 103 105 and 110 planes of mos2 acerce et al 2015 nath et al 2001 while the peaks at 2θ 30 2 35 6 43 2 57 2 and 62 8 could be attributed to the 112 103 004 321 and 224 planes of fe3o4 chai et al 2013 fig s5 clearly fe3o4 particles have been successfully anchored on the surfaces of mos2 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps results showed that mf contained mo s fe and o elements fig s6a the peaks in high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p could be attributed to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 fig s6b both of which corresponded to fe ii and fe iii respectively zheng et al 2021 the characteristic peaks of mo 3d corresponded to mo 3d3 2 and mo 3d5 2 which could be attributed to mo iv major portion and mo vi fig s6c hanlon et al 2015 the s 2p spectra suggested that s2 and s1 son were present on the surfaces of mos2 fig s6d although the magnetic saturation ms value 37 4 emu g of mf was slightly lower than that of fe3o4 46 9 emu g fig s7 mf yet contained strong superparamagnetic property and could be separated from water within 1 min by an external magnet fig s8 the observation indicated that mf could be recovered from water after use via magnetic separation 3 2 performances towards degradation of free dna bases the catalytic degradation of four free dna bases including thymine t adenine a cytosine c and guanine g 10 μm by pms activated with fe3o4 mos2 the mixture of fe3o4 and mos2 particles as well as mos2 fe3o4 mf were examined and the results were provided in figs 1 and s9 without activation pms alone could not degrade four dna bases as indicated by the negligible change of the concentrations of four dna bases during the reaction duration fig s10 prior to the activation of pms fe3o4 particles could adsorb small amount of four dna bases with 2 7 for t 3 3 for a 4 2 for c and 4 1 for g within 20 min the adsorption percentages of four dna bases by mos2 were higher than those by fe3o4 particles specifically 8 6 of t 62 6 of a 49 6 of c and 68 5 of g could be adsorbed by mos2 particles within 20 min the higher adsorption property of mos2 particles towards organic pollutants has also been reported previously lin et al 2022 tang et al 2022 as expected the adsorption percentages of all four dna bases by mixture of mos2 and fe3o4 were between those of solely by mos2 and solely by fe3o4 particles similar results were also achieved by mf after addition of pms into fe3o4 system fe3o4 pms system small amounts of all four dna bases were removed 11 3 of t with k value of 0 0053 0 0002 min 1 7 5 of a with k value of 0 0017 0 0001 min 1 19 0 of c with k value of 0 0260 0 0054 min 1 and 18 6 of g with k value of 0 0494 0 0096 min 1 during the experimental duration similarly the percentages of all four bases removed in mos2 pms system were not very high specifically 28 4 of t k value of 0 0139 0 0007 min 1 25 6 of a k value of 0 0042 0 0006 min 1 29 2 of c k value of 0 0266 0 0014 min 1 and 7 7 of g k value of 0 0070 0 0009 min 1 were removed in mos2 pms system during the reaction process the observation suggested that neither fe3o4 nor mos2 had enough catalytic capability for activating pms to degrade dna bases due to the co catalytic effect of mos2 and fe3o4 tong et al 2020 the enhanced removal percentages of all four dna bases relative to those in fe3o4 pms system and mos2 pms system were achieved when pms was activated by the physical mixture of mos2 and fe3o4 62 6 of t with k value of 0 0420 0 0016 min 1 71 0 of a with k value of 0 0170 0 0006 min 1 90 7 of c with k value of 0 1877 0 0068 min 1 and 48 5 of g with k value of 0 0419 0 0079 min 1 were removed among all different pms activation systems mf pms system exhibited the best degradation performances towards all four dna bases specifically complete degradation of t k value of 0 1792 0 0079 min 1 a k value of 0 0574 0 0027 min 1 c k value of 0 3052 0 0162 min 1 and g k value of 0 2856 0 0179 min 1 could be achieved by activation of pms by mf mf pms within 10 min 30 min 5 min and 5 min respectively it is worth pointing out that in mf pms system complete degradation of four dna bases adsorbed onto mf surfaces could also be achieved fig s11 text s12 the direct contact of fe3o4 with mos2 in mf could result in the faster charge transfer on the interface of mos2 and fe3o4 leading to the more effective pms activation the improved catalytic performances for all four dna bases in mf pms system relative to those in fe3o4 pms system mos2 pms system as well as pms physical mixture of mos2 and fe3o4 system thus were achieved clearly due to the synergy effect of mos2 and fe3o4 mf could efficiently activate pms to completely degrade all four dna bases 3 3 identification of reactive species and degradation mechanism of dna bases quenching experiments were conducted to explore the roles of reactive oxygen species in mf pms system figs 2 and s12 the introduction of tba the scavenger of oh could inhibit the degradation of t with the k value decreasing from 0 1792 0 0075 min 1 to 0 0456 0 0037 min 1 this implied that oh had contribution to t degradation in mf pms system k value further decreased to 0 0103 0 0010 min 1 when meoh the scavenger for oh and so4 was added into the reaction system the observation suggested that in addition to oh so4 also contributed to the degradation of t in mf pms system meanwhile k values greatly decreased to 0 0023 0 0001 min 1 and 0 0021 0 0003 min 1 when l histidine the scavenger for 1o2 and p bq the scavenger for o2 were added into the reaction systems respectively revealing the crucial contribution of 1o2 and o2 to the degradation of t in mf pms system similar degradation performance trends were observed for other three dna bases a c and g when above mentioned different scavengers were added into mf pms system figs 2 and s12 the observations clearly showed that for all four types of dna bases oh so4 o2 and 1o2 all contributed to their degradation in mf pms system epr was employed to further determine the generation of reactive oxygen species as well as the roles of mos2 and fe3o4 for the ros generation processes in mf pms system pms alone could generate small amount of 1o2 via the self decomposition eq s10 zhou et al 2017 gao et al 2021 mos2 and fe3o4 could act as electron shuttles for the enhanced self decomposition of pms and thus increased the catalytic performances accordingly luo et al 2022 wang et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 however signal intensity of 1o2 in mf pms system was obviously lower than that in mos2 pms system and fe3o4 pms system fig 3 a indicating part of 1o2 might be transformed to other radicals in mf pms system no obvious signals for dmpo oh and dmpo so4 could be observed in pms alone system and mos2 pms system fig 3b indicating the lack of oh and so4 in these two systems small peaks for dmpo oh were observed in fe3o4 pms system which could be attributed to pms activation by dissolved fe ii from fe3o4 to the generation of oh and so4 eqs s7 and 8 ling et al 2017 zhang et al 2022b because of the co catalytic effect of mos2 for the regeneration of fe ii eqs s15 and s16 mf exhibited high catalytic capability for pms activation leading to the generation of great amount of oh and so4 as indicated by the large peaks for dmpo oh in mf pms system the xps result showed that the peak intensities of fe ii and fe iii did not change obviously during the reaction process fig s13a suggesting that fe iii was reduced back to fe ii by mo iv after the reaction of fe ii and pms eq s14 due to the generation of mo vi after the co catalytic process eq s15 the percentage of mo vi showed an 8 9 increase after reaction fig s13c the presence of obvious signal for dmpo o2 in mf pms system implied that o2 was formed via the reaction of o2 and re generated fe ii fig 3c eq s9 the interaction of both fe3o4 and mf with pms were simulated by material studio ver 8 0 and the according schematic adsorption processes were provided in fig 3d and 3e respectively the o atoms of pms were adsorbed onto fe atoms of fe3o4 and mf the adsorption energy and charge transfer during the adsorption processes of fe3o4 and mf with pms were calculated fig 3f text s13 the adsorption energy of mf was 3 044 ev which was lower than that of fe3o4 2 095 ev the observation indicated that pms could be easier to adsorb onto mf than onto fe3o4 the charge transfer in mf pms system was calculated to be 0 656 e which was higher than that of fe3o4 pms 0 606 e suggesting the catalytic efficiency in mf pms system was higher than that in fe3o4 pms system the charge transfers in both fe3o4 pms and mf pms systems during degradation process of dna bases t as representative were further characterized by chronoamperometry tests i t curves fig s14 text s14 after adding pms into suspension the current change of mf electrode system 3 67 10 7 a was more negative relative to that of fe3o4 electrode 0 06 10 7 a indicating that more electrons were transferred from mf electrode to pms than those from fe3o4 electrode to pms after the addition of dna base into reaction system the current further negatively increased to 22 54 10 7 a in mf electrode pms system while the current change in fe3o4 electrode pms was minor 0 43 10 7 a the observation indicated that comparing to fe3o4 electrode pms system more electrons were transferred from mf electrode to activate pms sun et al 2022 resulting in the generation of more ros and the subsequent efficient degradation of dna base the o o bond length l o o of free pms was 1 345 å which increased to 1 457 å after adsorption onto the surface of fe3o4 and 1 459 å after adsorption onto the surface of mf the increased o o bond length l o o of pms after adsorption has also been reported previously xie et al 2022 note that with the increase of its l o o the cleavage of pms would be easier to form ros clearly comparing with the free pms the ones adsorbed onto surfaces of fe3o4 and mf were readily activated to generate ros leading to the better catalytic performance moreover with lower adsorption energy more pms would be adsorbed onto mf surfaces in mf pms system and could be activated to generate ros than that in fe3o4 pms system as a result improved catalytic performances for the degradation of all four types of dna bases in mf pms system relative to those in fe3o4 pms system were achieved overall free radicals oh so4 o2 and non radical 1o2 in mf pms system all contributed to the degradation of dna bases first fe ii could activate pms to generate so4 eq s7 and oh eq s14 followed by the regeneration of fe ii via the reduction of fe iii by mo iv eq s15 as a co catalyst in mf mos2 could significantly accelerate the fe iii fe ii cycle eqs s14 and s15 and promote the adsorption process along with the cleavage process of pms which remarkably improved the catalytic performance of mf pms system moreover o2 could be generated by the reaction of fe ii and o2 eq s9 some of which would generate 1o2 eqs s12 and s13 to participate in the reaction process since mos2 and fe3o4 could act as electron shuttles the self decomposition of pms to generate 1o2 for the degradation of bases thus could be enhanced in mf pms system eqs s10 and s13 3 4 degradation pathways of the dna bases to further investigate the degradation pathways of four dna bases the degradation intermediates formed during the reaction processes were identified by using lc ms and gc ms table s1 dft calculation was also employed to determine the reactive sites by fukui index which could further verify the degradation pathways tables s2 5 specifically 1c and 2c atoms in t molecule with the highest f 0 values fukui index for radical attack 0 171 for 1c and 0 173 for 2c were the most vulnerable atoms that would be attacked by so4 oh and o2 in mf pms system through the dihydroxylation of base t by products t1 t2 and t3 thus were formed fig 4 a and 4b moreover the ring fragmentation of base t at 1c atom f 0 value of 0 171 caused by free radical attack would also generate formylamine t4 by hydroxylation at 2c f 0 value of 0 131 and 5c atoms f 0 value of 0 117 in a molecule by the generated radicals by products a1 and a2 could be produced in mf pms system respectively fig 4c and 4d by product a3 would be formed via the attack on the imidazole ring at 5c atom f 0 value of 0 117 in a molecule the degradation pathway of base c was slightly different from that of bases t and a specifically after being attacked by the generated ros in mf pms system hydroxylation might be occurred at 2c f 0 value of 0 150 and 3c atoms f 0 values of 0 165 of c to form by products c1 and c3 respectively fig 4e and 4f similar observation has also been reported previously zhang et al 2020 li et al 2020b with high f values the fukui index of nucleophilic attack for 2c 0 202 and 3c 0 093 atoms in c molecule cytosine dime c2 would be formed during the degradation process in mf pms system via the condensation of these two c molecules by the 1o2 oxidation formylamine c4 would be formed from the ring fragmentation with the attack by ros at 2c atom f 0 value of 0 202 of c similarly via the hydroxylation and condensation processes by the generated ros by products g1 4 were formed during the degradation of base g in mf pms system fig 4g and 4h moreover by product g5 could also be formed via the ring breaking process of g the predicted ld50 for t a c and g were 597 436 2577 and 670 mg kg respectively fig s15 the ld50 values of most by products for t a and g except for the by products of c that could not be found in the database of t e s t software version 4 2 were determined to be obviously higher than those of dna bases fig s15 the observation indicated that by products generated during the dna bases degradation processes contained lower toxicities comparing with dna bases moreover after 30 min reaction process 28 8 20 8 48 1 and 27 4 of toc would be removed for t a c and g respectively fig s16 the observation showed that the mineralization of dna bases occurred during their degradation process as a result after degradation in mf pms system their potential toxicities could be decreased including base c 3 5 effects of water matrix and performances in real water samples the effects of solution ph from 3 to 9 and anions cl no3 so4 2 co3 2 and hco3 on the degradation of t as representative dna base in mf pms system were investigated fig 5 after the addition of mf into the t solution the drop of solution ph was observed fig s17 the decreased solution ph after the addition of mos2 and fe3o4 based materials has also been previously reported monga et al 2020 lei et al 2015 when pms was added into the reaction system the solution ph further decreased and then remained stable during the reaction process although the solution ph was decreased the trend of final solution ph matched well with its initial solution ph the lower initial solution ph the lower final solution ph interestingly complete degradation of base t could be achieved in mf pms system with a wide range of initial ph from 3 to 9 specifically base t could be completely removed within 10 min at the initial solution ph range from 5 to 9 due to the enhanced pms activation to produce so4 at lower ph wang and wang 2018 obviously enhanced degradation performance could be achieved at ph 3 complete removal within 5 min the results clearly demonstrated that mf pms system had outstanding degradation performances towards dna bases at wide solution ph ranges low concentration 10 mm of cl had negligible effect on the degradation of t in mf pms system fig 5b surprisingly higher concentration 50 mm of cl obviously enhanced the degradation performance in mf pms system with k value increased from 0 1792 0 0075 min 1 without cl addition to 0 2671 0 0275 min 1 further increasing cl concentration to 500 mm could lead to the great enhancement of degradation kinetic to k value of 3 1978 0 7605 min 1 fig s18 the observation could be attributed to the activation of pms by cl with high concentration to generate cl radicals and hclo species eqs s18 and 19 chen et al 2021 low concentration of no3 10 mm slightly inhibited the degradation of t in mf pms system due to the consumption of so4 or oh by no3 eqs s20 and 21 fig 5c interestingly further increasing the concentration of no3 to 50 mm yet enhanced the degradation performance of t in mf pms system which could be attributed to the production of no3 with high redox potential e 1 2 2 50 v resulted from the reaction of so4 with no3 fu et al 2019 choi and chung 2019 the improved degradation performance of naproxen with increasing no3 concentration has also been reported previously ghauch et al 2015 the presence of either low or high concentrations of so4 2 in suspensions favored the degradation performance of t in mf pms system fig 5d specifically the presence of 10 mm and 50 mm of so4 2 could enhance k value from 0 1792 0 0075 min 1 without so4 2 addition to 0 5331 0 0215 min 1 and 0 3794 0 0442 min 1 respectively note that the concentration of pms employed in present study was only about 1 19 mm the improved t degradation performance with the presence of so4 2 10 mm and 50 mm could be ascribed to the efficient production of so4 due to the enhanced decomposition rate of pms as well as the inhibition of the transfer from so4 into oh with the presence of so4 2 with high concentration eq s8 ghauch et al 2015 yang et al 2018 since the high alkalinity would hinder pms decomposition to produce so4 fig s19a the presence of 10 mm of either co3 2 or hco3 thus would inhibit the degradation of t via increasing solution ph 11 6 for co3 2 and 10 3 for hco3 fig s19b moreover both co3 2 and hco3 would react with so4 to form co3 that with weaker potential e 1 57 v vs nhe relative to so4 e 2 6 3 1 v vs nhe eq s22 patra et al 2020 peng et al 2021 thus the reduced t degradation performances were observed with the presence of 10 mm of co3 2 and hco3 the inhibition effects of co3 2 and hco3 in other pms based systems have also been reported wang et al 2023 yang et al 2023 note that the concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 in water are much lower than 10 mm serrà et al 2021 huang and mabury 2000 the effects of co3 2 and hco3 with concentrations of 0 017 mm 1 mg l and 0 17 mm 10 mg l commonly present in natural aqueous environment on the t degradation performances in mf pms system thus were investigated fig 5e and 5f the presence of 0 017 mm of co3 2 and hco3 had negligible effect on t degradation in mf pms system although 0 17 mm of co3 2 and hco3 slightly reduced the t degradation efficiency yet complete degradation of t could be achieved in mf pms system within 30 min and 15 min for co3 2 and hco3 respectively clearly mf pms could efficiently degrade dna bases with the presence of different types of common anions in solution the effects of natural organic matter humic acid ha as model natural organic matter on t degradation performances in mf pms system were also investigated fig 6 a the presence of low concentrations of ha 1 mg l and 2 mg l did not affect t degradation efficiencies in mf pms system high concentration of ha 5 mg l yet slightly inhibited the degradation performance of t in mf pms system which might be caused by the consumption of the generated radicals by ha li et al 2022 the adsorption of ha onto mf surfaces might also decrease the active sites of mf for the activation of pms ali et al 2021 leading to the slight decrease of degradation performance of t although the presence of ha with high concentration slightly inhibited the degradation efficiency more than 90 of t could still be removed in mf pms system even with the presence of 5 mg l ha in suspensions obviously mf pms could efficiently degrade dna bases with the presence of natural organic matter in suspensions mf pms system towards the degradation performances of base t in real water samples including tap water river water sea water as well as sewage were further investigated by using a reactor with large working volume of 1 l fig 6b the characteristics of real water samples were provided in table s7 complete removal of t in tap water samples could be achieved by mf pms system within 60 min regardless the presence of organic matter in sea water as indicated by the high value of cod complete degradation of t in sea water could be achieved by mf pms system in very short time 30 s due to the possible generation of more radicals in sea water as the presence of high concentration cl and so4 2 due to the presence of organic matters removal performances of t in both river water and sewage by mf pms system were somehow inhibited however complete degradation of t could still be achieved in these two real water samples within 90 min the observation revealed that mf pms could be employed as a promising catalytic system to remove dna bases in real water samples 3 6 catalytic removal performances towards antibiotic resistance genes args dna and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb the feasibility of mf pms system towards degradation of antibiotic resistance genes args was also investigated by using chromosomal kanr extracted from e coli k 12 mg 1655 antibiotic resistant bacteria arb containing kanamycin resistance genes kanr on chromosome and plasmid gmra extracted from e coli s17 1 arb containing gentamycin resistance genes gmra on plasmid as two model args fig 7 a and 7b note that chromosomal args mainly transport through transformation and vertical transmission processes while plasmid args could be easier to transport through conjugation transformation and transduction processes acman et al 2020 li et al 2021 thus the degradation performances of mf pms system towards two types of args located on either chromosome or plasmid were testified the specific kanr and gmra concentrations during the reaction duration in mf pms system were calculated according to the standard curves which were stablished using plasmids of pure kanr genes and gmra genes fig s20 pms alone could not degrade either kanr or gmra indicating that both types of args were stable in pms solution only a small portion of kanr 1 3 log and gmra 1 1 log could be removed by mf without the addition of pms during the reaction duration in contrast mf pms system could completely degrade kanr 8 2 log within 1 min and gmra 8 2 log within 3 min the observations revealed that in addition to dna bases mf pms system could also effectively degrade both chromosomal and plasmid args note that the initial concentrations of kanr containing 1303 dna bases and gmra containing 534 dna bases were 19 600 μg l about 0 046 μm using 330 g mol as the average molecular weight of deoxynucleotide and 13 710 μg l about 0 078 μm respectively both of which were lower than that of dna bases 10 μm thus the degradation kinetics of both types of args in mf pms system were faster than those of single dna bases to determine whether mf pms system could also degrade the whole dna the degradation performances towards dna extracted from two types of arb e coli k 12 mg 1655 and e coli s17 1 in mf pms system were also examined in very short time 1 min 86 6 of total 21 7 ng l dna of e coli k 12 mg 1655 and 97 2 of total 106 4 ng l dna of e coli s17 1 could be degraded in mf pms system fig 7c and 7d dna of e coli k 12 mg 1655 was used as model dna for electrophoresis analysis and sem characterization electrophoresis results showed that the signal for dna quickly reduced after 1 min of degradation in mf pms system fig s21 comparison between the sem images of dna before fig s22a and after the reaction fig s22b showed that the strands of dna were broken into small fragments after the degradation experiment in mf pms system the above results clearly showed that in addition to degradation of dna bases and args mf pms system also exhibited excellent catalytic performance towards the degradation of the whole dna the catalytic performances of mf pms system towards the disinfection of e coli k 12 mg 1655 and e coli s17 1 two types of model arb were further investigated fig 8 a and 8d without the addition of pms the concentrations of two types of arb did not obviously change during the 30 min experiments with k values of 0 0340 0 0082 min 1 for e coli k 12 mg 1655 and 0 0146 0 0016 min 1 for e coli s17 1 due to its acidity and self decomposition pms alone contained some disinfection capability rodríguez chueca et al 2017 complete disinfection of both e coli k 12 mg 1655 with an observed k value of 0 1671 0 0436 min 1 and e coli s17 1 with an observed k value of 0 2500 0 0245 min 1 by pms could be achieved within 30 min reaction duration addition of mf into pms system could significantly enhance the inactivation performances of two types of arb complete inactivation of e coli k 12 mg 1655 with k value of 0 3952 0 0807 min 1 and e coli s17 1 with k value of 0 2934 0 0434 min 1 could be achieved within 20 min in mf pms system the observation indicated that mf pms system also contained outstanding inactivation performances towards two types of arb during the inactivation process of arb mf pms system could also efficiently degrade both args and dna within two types of arb fig 8b and 8e specifically for both types of arb the concentrations of intracellular args iargs gradually reduced with increasing reaction duration due to the degradation by intracellular ros during the disinfection process liu et al 2023a the arb inactivation would lead to the damages of cell membrane liu et al 2022a which would release iargs into solution thus for both types of arb the concentrations of extracellular args eargs increased in the first 2 min inactivation process and then gradually decreased with the increasing reaction duration due to the degradation by ros generated in mf pms system similar to the trend of iargs the concentrations of intracellular dna idna within two types of arb would reduce due to the degradation by intracellular ros specifically with the increase of reaction duration idna of e coli k 12 mg 1655 and e coli s17 1 reduced from 13 5 μg ml to 7 3 μg ml and from 16 8 μg ml to 7 1 μg ml respectively fig 8c and 8f consistent with the trend of eargs the extracellular dna edna concentrations of both arb also increased to 29 μg ml for e coli k 12 mg 1655 and to 9 4 μg ml for e coli s17 1 in first 2 min disinfection process and subsequently reduced to 1 9 μg ml for e coli k 12 mg 1655 and to 4 4 μg ml for e coli s17 1 with increasing reaction duration due to the degradation by the generated ros clearly mf pms system not only could disinfect arb but also would eliminate the risk of args by degradation of args and dna 3 7 reuse experiment and continuous flow reactor experiment due to its strong superparamagnetic property mf could be easily separated from the reaction system after use by using an external magnet the collected mf could be pretreated with h2o2 du et al 2020 and then reused for the activation of pms to degrade t as representative dna bases over 95 of t could be degraded even in the fourth reused mf pms system fig 9 a indicating that mf contained excellent reusability no obvious change was observed in the xrd patterns of mf after the degradation experiment indicating the excellent stability of mf during the degradation process fig s4 moreover only 0 44 of mo and 0 23 of fe were released into the reaction system which further confirmed the stability of mf during the reaction duration table s6 the above observations clearly showed that mf were very stable and could be repeatedly use for activation of pms to degrade dna bases to further test the long term usage of mf pms system to degrade dna bases a continuous flow reactor with volume of 50 ml was designed fig 9b and the experimental device set up was provided in fig 9c in the experiment 500 mg of mf particles were dispersed in the bottom of the reactor which were stabilized by placing a permanent magnet underneath the reactor suspension with mixture of pms with the concentration of 200 mg l and t solution with the concentration of 250 μm were injected into the inlet of the reactor by a peristaltic pump at the flow rate of 500 μl min effluent from the reactor was also controlled by using a peristaltic pump the hydraulic retention time of the continuous flow reactor experiment was set to be 100 min during the 14 day experiment duration mf pms system could effectively remove more than 90 of dna base t in the continuous flow reactor fig 9d the observation clearly showed that mf particles could continuously activate pms and mf pms system had the potential to effectively degraded dna bases in long term experiments 4 conclusions mf was successfully fabricated and used to activate pms to degrade four types of dna bases args and dna as well as disinfect arb we found that mf pms system could effectively degrade bases t a c and g within 10 min 30 min 5 min and 5 min respectively during the reaction process mf could activate pms to form the reactive radicals such as oh so4 o2 and 1o2 contributing to the degradation of dna bases due to the low adsorption energy high charge transfer and better pms cleavage mf exhibited excellent pms adsorption and activation performances mos2 in mf could enhance the cycle of fe iii fe ii improving the catalytic performance the degradation pathways of the dna bases were mainly through dihydroxylation hydroxylation condensation ring fragmentation and other processes moreover we found that mf pms system could also efficiently degrade dna bases in different solution ph complex water matrix including coexisting of anions and natural organic matter as well as in real water samples including tap water river water sea water and sewage especially under high salinity conditions due to the generation of cl radicals and hclo species mf pms system also exhibited outstanding catalytic performances to degrade chromosomal plasmid args and dna in addition arb could be effectively disinfected by mf pms system during arb disinfection process args and dna within arb could also be efficiently degraded the efficient removal of dna bases in both reuse experiments for four consecutive reused cycles and continuous flow reactor experiments lasted for 14 days confirmed the stability of mf and potential of mf pms system for the repeated use as well as the long term use to degrade dna bases overall this study not only provided a deep insight on fe mo triggered pms activation process but also provided an effective and reliable technique for the treatment of dna bases args dna and arb in water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

14764,antibiotic resistance genes args have become as emerging contaminant with great concerns worldwide due to their threats to human health it is thus urgent to develop techniques to degrade args in water in this study mos2 fe3o4 mf particles were fabricated and used to activate peroxymonosulfate pms for the degradation of four types of free dna bases t a c and g major components of args and args we found that mf pms system could effectively degrade all four dna bases t within 10 min a within 30 min c within 5 min and g within 5 min in very short time during the reaction process mf could activate pms to form the reactive radicals such as oh so4 o2 and 1o2 contributing to the degradation of dna bases due to the low adsorption energy high charge transfer and great capability for pms cleavage mf exhibited excellent pms adsorption and activation performances mos2 in mf could enhance the cycle of fe iii fe ii improving the catalytic performance excellent catalytic performances of mf pms system were achieved in complex water matrix including different solution ph coexisting of anions and natural organic matter as well as in real water samples including tap water river water sea water and sewage especially under high salinity conditions due to the generation of cl radicals and hclo species mf pms system could also efficiently degrade args chromosomal kanr and plasmid gmra and dna extracted from antibiotic resistant bacteria arb in super short time moreover complete disinfection of two types of model arb e coli k 12 mg 1655 and e coli s17 1 could also be achieved in mf pms system the high degradation performances of mf pms system achieved in the reused experiments and the 14 day continuous flow reactor experiments indicated the stability of mf particles due to the magnetic property it would be convenient to separate mf particles from water after use via using magnet facilitating their reuse of mf and avoiding potential water contamination by catalysts overall this study not only provided a deep insight on fe mo triggered pms activation process but also provided an effective and reliable approach for the treatment of dna bases args dna and arb in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mos2 fe3o4 particles peroxymonosulfate antibiotic resistance genes free dna bases antibiotic resistant bacteria data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the persistent overuse and misuse of antibiotics have driven to the propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args in water infrastructure lulijwa et al 2020 ochman et al 2000 due to the low efficiency for the removal of arb and args by conventional treatment approaches such as uv irradiation and chlorination wastewater treatment plants have become hotspots and main sources for arb and args that subsequently discharged into natural environments via sewage effluents and biosolids wang et al 2020 raza et al 2022 extracellular args have been found to be widespread and abundant in natural environments such as rivers estuaries and soils chen et al 2019 zhu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the transmission of extracellular args present in natural environments could be further enhanced via horizontal transfer and their environmental risks would be greatly increased ju et al 2019 sivalingam et al 2020 args thus have been widely recognized as emerging pollutants to reduce their environmental risks it is critical to develop new techniques to degrade args via generation of different types of reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 and so on that could attack args advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton reaction ahmed et al 2021 photoelectrocatalytic method qi et al 2022 and photocatalytic method zhang et al 2022a have been found to potentially degrade args for example giannakis et al 2018 showed that solar photo fenton process could eliminate args in water via the generated oh li et al 2020a found that hierarchical bi2o2co3 microspheres wrapped with nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide could degrade args by oh produced under uv visible light irradiation owing to the generation of sulfate radicals so4 oh and 1o2 yang et al 2018 peroxymonosulfate pms based aops have also recently been shown to effectively degrade args yao et al 2022 liu et al 2022b 2023b for example yao et al 2022 found that the activation of pms by uv could effectively remove plasmid encoded args via the generated 1o2 liu et al 2022b showed that fe2 produced by the reaction of sulfidated nanoscale zerovalent iron with oxygen in water could activate pms to generate so4 so5 and oh leading to the removal of args magnetic fe3o4 particles which would be easily recovered after use by using external magnetic force could also activate pms to generate ros shao et al 2022 exhibiting the potentials to degrade args nevertheless without cycling of fe iii fe ii the removal performances of args in pms and bare fe3o4 particle system might be limited previous studies have reported that by using different types of co catalysts such as bioi tong et al 2022 ws2 dong et al 2018 and mo xiang et al 2022 the cycle of fe iii fe ii in fe based aops system could be achieved since the presence of unsaturated s atoms could provide reductive capability as well as the potential transition between mo iv and mo vi mos2 has been shown to be one of the most ideal co catalysts to facilitate the cycle of fe iii fe ii and enhance the h2o2 tong et al 2020 and pms activation performances zhou et al 2022 combining mos2 with fe3o4 thus is expected to efficiently activate pms to remove args note that due to magnetic property recycle of the magnetic fe3o4 and mos2 composites from water after use would be very convenient the potential water contamination by catalysts thus could be avoided in this work mos2 fe3o4 mf was synthesized by co precipitation of fe iii and fe ii onto the surface of mos2 spheres the as prepared samples were well characterized note that args are mainly composed by dna bases deoxyribose and phosphate lu et al 2021 the radical induced args damages are mainly caused by the attack of dna bases dizdaroglu et al 2012 the degradation processes of dna bases thus are very crucial for args degradation due to its lowest reduction potential 1 29 v base guanine g is found to be most easily oxidized and damaged dna bases than other ones such as thymine t adenine a and cytosine c von sonntag 2006 steenken et al 1992 however solely g damage could not lead to the complete break up of args zhang et al 2019 moreover due to the higher reduction potential of the guanosine radical 1 29 v than those of alkyl peroxyl radicals 1 05 v it is feasible for dna to be repaired by histone proteins steenken and jovanovic 1997 thus to testify whether pms activation via mf could completely degrade args its degradation performances towards all dna bases including t a c and g were examined in present study the degradation mechanisms of dna bases and their degradation pathways were determined moreover the degradation performances of dna bases in complex water matrix such as at different solution ph with the co presence of anions and natural organic matter and in real water samples with large working volume of 1 l were also examined furthermore the degradation performances in four reused cycles as well as in a continuous flow reactor consecutively running for 14 days were determined in addition mf pms system towards degradation of two model args chromosomal kanr and plasmid gmra and dna extracted from arb as well as disinfection of two types of model arb e coli k 12 mg 1655 and e coli s17 1 were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o thioacetamide ch4n2s ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o naoh hydrogen peroxide 30 wt cytosine c thymine t adenine a and guanine g were all purchased from sigma aldrich reagent company all the reagents were used without purification the stock solution of a g c t peroxymonosulfate pms and other materials were prepared following the approaches shown in the text s1 of supplementary material e coli k 12 mg1655 and e coli s17 1 were cultivated and stored following the text s2 and used for the extraction of args and dna text s3 2 2 fabrication and characterization of catalytic materials for the fabrication of mos2 particles 50 ml of binary solution containing 1 mmol of nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o and 30 mmol of ch4n2s was heated at 220 c for 18 h to form black precipitate after washing and drying process mos2 particles could be obtained fe3o4 was deposited onto the surface of mos2 by co precipitation process specifically 800 mg of mos2 particles were well dispersed in 100 ml of water under sonification followed by the addition of 0 01 mol of fecl3 6h2o and 0 01 mol of feso4 7h2o then 2 m of naoh solution was added dropwise under n2 atmosphere until the solution ph reached 10 and continued stirring for 30 min to obtain mos2 fe3o4 mf pure fe3o4 was synthesized by a similar process without the presence of mos2 various techniques were used to characterize the composition and structure of mf details about fabrication and characterization were provided in the text s4 2 3 catalytic experiments the catalytic experiments were conducted in a double wall reactor fig s1 with the circular water cooling system going on to keep the temperature of reaction systems at 25 c based on the results of preliminary experiments text s5 figs s2 and s3 the dose of both mf and pms were set to be 200 mg l for the catalytic experiments in a typical degradation experiment of free dna bases 10 mg of catalysts were dispersed into the 50 ml of bases solution 10 μm under sonication and then the solution was kept stirring by a mechanical agitation after mechanically stirring for 20 min an adsorption desorption equilibrium would be achieved then 0 5 ml of pms stock solution 20 g l was added into the suspension to initiate the reaction at specific duration 1 ml of samples at certain intervals were filtrated by 0 22 μm membranes and 0 5 ml of the filtrate would be mixed with 0 5 ml of ethanol to terminate the reaction the concentrations of bases in the samples were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc text s6 the degradation pathway was explored by using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms text s7 and density functional theory dft calculation text s8 toxicities of the by products produced during the degradation processes of dna bases were determined by t e s t software version 4 2 the total organic carbon toc values in the reaction suspensions during the dna bases degradation process were also determined by toc lcph shimadzu japan in the recycle experiments the used materials were separated under magnetic field and treated with h2o2 solution text s9 for sustainable activation du et al 2020 the roles of reactive oxygen species ros were studied through scavenger experiments and electron spin resonance spectrometry esr bruker emx plus the released ions were determined by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms to testify the feasibility of mf pms system for practical application the catalytic degradation performances of chosen bases in complex water matrix at different solution ph with the co presence of anions and natural organic matter as well as in real water samples including tap water river water sea water and sewage were also investigated e coli k 12 mg1655 containing kanamycin resistance genes kanr on chromosome and e coli s17 1 containing gentamycin resistance genes gmra on plasmid were employed as two model arb in present study cultivation protocol was provided in text s2 from which args chromosomal kanr and plasmid gmra and dna were extracted details in text s3 kanr was 1303 bp long while gmra was 534 bp long the primer sequences were provided in text s10 the qpcr assays were all performed by using tiangen superreal premix plus sybr green detailed information about qpcr analysis was provided in text s10 the detailed information about args and dna degradation experiments as well as arb disinfection could also be seen in the supplementary material texts s10 and s11 in present study the primer sequences for kanr and gmra were self designed through primer blast which was provided by u s national library of medicine national center for biotechnology information ncbi 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mos2 fe3o4 sem image fig s4a showed that mos2 fe3o4 named as mf diameter of about 800 nm had a flower like shape with fe3o4 nanoparticles 10 nm depositing on the surfaces of mos2 constructed by many nanosheets with a width of around 20 nm fig s4b the peaks at 2θ 14 3 33 4 39 5 49 1 and 58 5 in the xrd pattern of mf were corresponded to the 002 101 103 105 and 110 planes of mos2 acerce et al 2015 nath et al 2001 while the peaks at 2θ 30 2 35 6 43 2 57 2 and 62 8 could be attributed to the 112 103 004 321 and 224 planes of fe3o4 chai et al 2013 fig s5 clearly fe3o4 particles have been successfully anchored on the surfaces of mos2 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps results showed that mf contained mo s fe and o elements fig s6a the peaks in high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p could be attributed to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 fig s6b both of which corresponded to fe ii and fe iii respectively zheng et al 2021 the characteristic peaks of mo 3d corresponded to mo 3d3 2 and mo 3d5 2 which could be attributed to mo iv major portion and mo vi fig s6c hanlon et al 2015 the s 2p spectra suggested that s2 and s1 son were present on the surfaces of mos2 fig s6d although the magnetic saturation ms value 37 4 emu g of mf was slightly lower than that of fe3o4 46 9 emu g fig s7 mf yet contained strong superparamagnetic property and could be separated from water within 1 min by an external magnet fig s8 the observation indicated that mf could be recovered from water after use via magnetic separation 3 2 performances towards degradation of free dna bases the catalytic degradation of four free dna bases including thymine t adenine a cytosine c and guanine g 10 μm by pms activated with fe3o4 mos2 the mixture of fe3o4 and mos2 particles as well as mos2 fe3o4 mf were examined and the results were provided in figs 1 and s9 without activation pms alone could not degrade four dna bases as indicated by the negligible change of the concentrations of four dna bases during the reaction duration fig s10 prior to the activation of pms fe3o4 particles could adsorb small amount of four dna bases with 2 7 for t 3 3 for a 4 2 for c and 4 1 for g within 20 min the adsorption percentages of four dna bases by mos2 were higher than those by fe3o4 particles specifically 8 6 of t 62 6 of a 49 6 of c and 68 5 of g could be adsorbed by mos2 particles within 20 min the higher adsorption property of mos2 particles towards organic pollutants has also been reported previously lin et al 2022 tang et al 2022 as expected the adsorption percentages of all four dna bases by mixture of mos2 and fe3o4 were between those of solely by mos2 and solely by fe3o4 particles similar results were also achieved by mf after addition of pms into fe3o4 system fe3o4 pms system small amounts of all four dna bases were removed 11 3 of t with k value of 0 0053 0 0002 min 1 7 5 of a with k value of 0 0017 0 0001 min 1 19 0 of c with k value of 0 0260 0 0054 min 1 and 18 6 of g with k value of 0 0494 0 0096 min 1 during the experimental duration similarly the percentages of all four bases removed in mos2 pms system were not very high specifically 28 4 of t k value of 0 0139 0 0007 min 1 25 6 of a k value of 0 0042 0 0006 min 1 29 2 of c k value of 0 0266 0 0014 min 1 and 7 7 of g k value of 0 0070 0 0009 min 1 were removed in mos2 pms system during the reaction process the observation suggested that neither fe3o4 nor mos2 had enough catalytic capability for activating pms to degrade dna bases due to the co catalytic effect of mos2 and fe3o4 tong et al 2020 the enhanced removal percentages of all four dna bases relative to those in fe3o4 pms system and mos2 pms system were achieved when pms was activated by the physical mixture of mos2 and fe3o4 62 6 of t with k value of 0 0420 0 0016 min 1 71 0 of a with k value of 0 0170 0 0006 min 1 90 7 of c with k value of 0 1877 0 0068 min 1 and 48 5 of g with k value of 0 0419 0 0079 min 1 were removed among all different pms activation systems mf pms system exhibited the best degradation performances towards all four dna bases specifically complete degradation of t k value of 0 1792 0 0079 min 1 a k value of 0 0574 0 0027 min 1 c k value of 0 3052 0 0162 min 1 and g k value of 0 2856 0 0179 min 1 could be achieved by activation of pms by mf mf pms within 10 min 30 min 5 min and 5 min respectively it is worth pointing out that in mf pms system complete degradation of four dna bases adsorbed onto mf surfaces could also be achieved fig s11 text s12 the direct contact of fe3o4 with mos2 in mf could result in the faster charge transfer on the interface of mos2 and fe3o4 leading to the more effective pms activation the improved catalytic performances for all four dna bases in mf pms system relative to those in fe3o4 pms system mos2 pms system as well as pms physical mixture of mos2 and fe3o4 system thus were achieved clearly due to the synergy effect of mos2 and fe3o4 mf could efficiently activate pms to completely degrade all four dna bases 3 3 identification of reactive species and degradation mechanism of dna bases quenching experiments were conducted to explore the roles of reactive oxygen species in mf pms system figs 2 and s12 the introduction of tba the scavenger of oh could inhibit the degradation of t with the k value decreasing from 0 1792 0 0075 min 1 to 0 0456 0 0037 min 1 this implied that oh had contribution to t degradation in mf pms system k value further decreased to 0 0103 0 0010 min 1 when meoh the scavenger for oh and so4 was added into the reaction system the observation suggested that in addition to oh so4 also contributed to the degradation of t in mf pms system meanwhile k values greatly decreased to 0 0023 0 0001 min 1 and 0 0021 0 0003 min 1 when l histidine the scavenger for 1o2 and p bq the scavenger for o2 were added into the reaction systems respectively revealing the crucial contribution of 1o2 and o2 to the degradation of t in mf pms system similar degradation performance trends were observed for other three dna bases a c and g when above mentioned different scavengers were added into mf pms system figs 2 and s12 the observations clearly showed that for all four types of dna bases oh so4 o2 and 1o2 all contributed to their degradation in mf pms system epr was employed to further determine the generation of reactive oxygen species as well as the roles of mos2 and fe3o4 for the ros generation processes in mf pms system pms alone could generate small amount of 1o2 via the self decomposition eq s10 zhou et al 2017 gao et al 2021 mos2 and fe3o4 could act as electron shuttles for the enhanced self decomposition of pms and thus increased the catalytic performances accordingly luo et al 2022 wang et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 however signal intensity of 1o2 in mf pms system was obviously lower than that in mos2 pms system and fe3o4 pms system fig 3 a indicating part of 1o2 might be transformed to other radicals in mf pms system no obvious signals for dmpo oh and dmpo so4 could be observed in pms alone system and mos2 pms system fig 3b indicating the lack of oh and so4 in these two systems small peaks for dmpo oh were observed in fe3o4 pms system which could be attributed to pms activation by dissolved fe ii from fe3o4 to the generation of oh and so4 eqs s7 and 8 ling et al 2017 zhang et al 2022b because of the co catalytic effect of mos2 for the regeneration of fe ii eqs s15 and s16 mf exhibited high catalytic capability for pms activation leading to the generation of great amount of oh and so4 as indicated by the large peaks for dmpo oh in mf pms system the xps result showed that the peak intensities of fe ii and fe iii did not change obviously during the reaction process fig s13a suggesting that fe iii was reduced back to fe ii by mo iv after the reaction of fe ii and pms eq s14 due to the generation of mo vi after the co catalytic process eq s15 the percentage of mo vi showed an 8 9 increase after reaction fig s13c the presence of obvious signal for dmpo o2 in mf pms system implied that o2 was formed via the reaction of o2 and re generated fe ii fig 3c eq s9 the interaction of both fe3o4 and mf with pms were simulated by material studio ver 8 0 and the according schematic adsorption processes were provided in fig 3d and 3e respectively the o atoms of pms were adsorbed onto fe atoms of fe3o4 and mf the adsorption energy and charge transfer during the adsorption processes of fe3o4 and mf with pms were calculated fig 3f text s13 the adsorption energy of mf was 3 044 ev which was lower than that of fe3o4 2 095 ev the observation indicated that pms could be easier to adsorb onto mf than onto fe3o4 the charge transfer in mf pms system was calculated to be 0 656 e which was higher than that of fe3o4 pms 0 606 e suggesting the catalytic efficiency in mf pms system was higher than that in fe3o4 pms system the charge transfers in both fe3o4 pms and mf pms systems during degradation process of dna bases t as representative were further characterized by chronoamperometry tests i t curves fig s14 text s14 after adding pms into suspension the current change of mf electrode system 3 67 10 7 a was more negative relative to that of fe3o4 electrode 0 06 10 7 a indicating that more electrons were transferred from mf electrode to pms than those from fe3o4 electrode to pms after the addition of dna base into reaction system the current further negatively increased to 22 54 10 7 a in mf electrode pms system while the current change in fe3o4 electrode pms was minor 0 43 10 7 a the observation indicated that comparing to fe3o4 electrode pms system more electrons were transferred from mf electrode to activate pms sun et al 2022 resulting in the generation of more ros and the subsequent efficient degradation of dna base the o o bond length l o o of free pms was 1 345 å which increased to 1 457 å after adsorption onto the surface of fe3o4 and 1 459 å after adsorption onto the surface of mf the increased o o bond length l o o of pms after adsorption has also been reported previously xie et al 2022 note that with the increase of its l o o the cleavage of pms would be easier to form ros clearly comparing with the free pms the ones adsorbed onto surfaces of fe3o4 and mf were readily activated to generate ros leading to the better catalytic performance moreover with lower adsorption energy more pms would be adsorbed onto mf surfaces in mf pms system and could be activated to generate ros than that in fe3o4 pms system as a result improved catalytic performances for the degradation of all four types of dna bases in mf pms system relative to those in fe3o4 pms system were achieved overall free radicals oh so4 o2 and non radical 1o2 in mf pms system all contributed to the degradation of dna bases first fe ii could activate pms to generate so4 eq s7 and oh eq s14 followed by the regeneration of fe ii via the reduction of fe iii by mo iv eq s15 as a co catalyst in mf mos2 could significantly accelerate the fe iii fe ii cycle eqs s14 and s15 and promote the adsorption process along with the cleavage process of pms which remarkably improved the catalytic performance of mf pms system moreover o2 could be generated by the reaction of fe ii and o2 eq s9 some of which would generate 1o2 eqs s12 and s13 to participate in the reaction process since mos2 and fe3o4 could act as electron shuttles the self decomposition of pms to generate 1o2 for the degradation of bases thus could be enhanced in mf pms system eqs s10 and s13 3 4 degradation pathways of the dna bases to further investigate the degradation pathways of four dna bases the degradation intermediates formed during the reaction processes were identified by using lc ms and gc ms table s1 dft calculation was also employed to determine the reactive sites by fukui index which could further verify the degradation pathways tables s2 5 specifically 1c and 2c atoms in t molecule with the highest f 0 values fukui index for radical attack 0 171 for 1c and 0 173 for 2c were the most vulnerable atoms that would be attacked by so4 oh and o2 in mf pms system through the dihydroxylation of base t by products t1 t2 and t3 thus were formed fig 4 a and 4b moreover the ring fragmentation of base t at 1c atom f 0 value of 0 171 caused by free radical attack would also generate formylamine t4 by hydroxylation at 2c f 0 value of 0 131 and 5c atoms f 0 value of 0 117 in a molecule by the generated radicals by products a1 and a2 could be produced in mf pms system respectively fig 4c and 4d by product a3 would be formed via the attack on the imidazole ring at 5c atom f 0 value of 0 117 in a molecule the degradation pathway of base c was slightly different from that of bases t and a specifically after being attacked by the generated ros in mf pms system hydroxylation might be occurred at 2c f 0 value of 0 150 and 3c atoms f 0 values of 0 165 of c to form by products c1 and c3 respectively fig 4e and 4f similar observation has also been reported previously zhang et al 2020 li et al 2020b with high f values the fukui index of nucleophilic attack for 2c 0 202 and 3c 0 093 atoms in c molecule cytosine dime c2 would be formed during the degradation process in mf pms system via the condensation of these two c molecules by the 1o2 oxidation formylamine c4 would be formed from the ring fragmentation with the attack by ros at 2c atom f 0 value of 0 202 of c similarly via the hydroxylation and condensation processes by the generated ros by products g1 4 were formed during the degradation of base g in mf pms system fig 4g and 4h moreover by product g5 could also be formed via the ring breaking process of g the predicted ld50 for t a c and g were 597 436 2577 and 670 mg kg respectively fig s15 the ld50 values of most by products for t a and g except for the by products of c that could not be found in the database of t e s t software version 4 2 were determined to be obviously higher than those of dna bases fig s15 the observation indicated that by products generated during the dna bases degradation processes contained lower toxicities comparing with dna bases moreover after 30 min reaction process 28 8 20 8 48 1 and 27 4 of toc would be removed for t a c and g respectively fig s16 the observation showed that the mineralization of dna bases occurred during their degradation process as a result after degradation in mf pms system their potential toxicities could be decreased including base c 3 5 effects of water matrix and performances in real water samples the effects of solution ph from 3 to 9 and anions cl no3 so4 2 co3 2 and hco3 on the degradation of t as representative dna base in mf pms system were investigated fig 5 after the addition of mf into the t solution the drop of solution ph was observed fig s17 the decreased solution ph after the addition of mos2 and fe3o4 based materials has also been previously reported monga et al 2020 lei et al 2015 when pms was added into the reaction system the solution ph further decreased and then remained stable during the reaction process although the solution ph was decreased the trend of final solution ph matched well with its initial solution ph the lower initial solution ph the lower final solution ph interestingly complete degradation of base t could be achieved in mf pms system with a wide range of initial ph from 3 to 9 specifically base t could be completely removed within 10 min at the initial solution ph range from 5 to 9 due to the enhanced pms activation to produce so4 at lower ph wang and wang 2018 obviously enhanced degradation performance could be achieved at ph 3 complete removal within 5 min the results clearly demonstrated that mf pms system had outstanding degradation performances towards dna bases at wide solution ph ranges low concentration 10 mm of cl had negligible effect on the degradation of t in mf pms system fig 5b surprisingly higher concentration 50 mm of cl obviously enhanced the degradation performance in mf pms system with k value increased from 0 1792 0 0075 min 1 without cl addition to 0 2671 0 0275 min 1 further increasing cl concentration to 500 mm could lead to the great enhancement of degradation kinetic to k value of 3 1978 0 7605 min 1 fig s18 the observation could be attributed to the activation of pms by cl with high concentration to generate cl radicals and hclo species eqs s18 and 19 chen et al 2021 low concentration of no3 10 mm slightly inhibited the degradation of t in mf pms system due to the consumption of so4 or oh by no3 eqs s20 and 21 fig 5c interestingly further increasing the concentration of no3 to 50 mm yet enhanced the degradation performance of t in mf pms system which could be attributed to the production of no3 with high redox potential e 1 2 2 50 v resulted from the reaction of so4 with no3 fu et al 2019 choi and chung 2019 the improved degradation performance of naproxen with increasing no3 concentration has also been reported previously ghauch et al 2015 the presence of either low or high concentrations of so4 2 in suspensions favored the degradation performance of t in mf pms system fig 5d specifically the presence of 10 mm and 50 mm of so4 2 could enhance k value from 0 1792 0 0075 min 1 without so4 2 addition to 0 5331 0 0215 min 1 and 0 3794 0 0442 min 1 respectively note that the concentration of pms employed in present study was only about 1 19 mm the improved t degradation performance with the presence of so4 2 10 mm and 50 mm could be ascribed to the efficient production of so4 due to the enhanced decomposition rate of pms as well as the inhibition of the transfer from so4 into oh with the presence of so4 2 with high concentration eq s8 ghauch et al 2015 yang et al 2018 since the high alkalinity would hinder pms decomposition to produce so4 fig s19a the presence of 10 mm of either co3 2 or hco3 thus would inhibit the degradation of t via increasing solution ph 11 6 for co3 2 and 10 3 for hco3 fig s19b moreover both co3 2 and hco3 would react with so4 to form co3 that with weaker potential e 1 57 v vs nhe relative to so4 e 2 6 3 1 v vs nhe eq s22 patra et al 2020 peng et al 2021 thus the reduced t degradation performances were observed with the presence of 10 mm of co3 2 and hco3 the inhibition effects of co3 2 and hco3 in other pms based systems have also been reported wang et al 2023 yang et al 2023 note that the concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 in water are much lower than 10 mm serrà et al 2021 huang and mabury 2000 the effects of co3 2 and hco3 with concentrations of 0 017 mm 1 mg l and 0 17 mm 10 mg l commonly present in natural aqueous environment on the t degradation performances in mf pms system thus were investigated fig 5e and 5f the presence of 0 017 mm of co3 2 and hco3 had negligible effect on t degradation in mf pms system although 0 17 mm of co3 2 and hco3 slightly reduced the t degradation efficiency yet complete degradation of t could be achieved in mf pms system within 30 min and 15 min for co3 2 and hco3 respectively clearly mf pms could efficiently degrade dna bases with the presence of different types of common anions in solution the effects of natural organic matter humic acid ha as model natural organic matter on t degradation performances in mf pms system were also investigated fig 6 a the presence of low concentrations of ha 1 mg l and 2 mg l did not affect t degradation efficiencies in mf pms system high concentration of ha 5 mg l yet slightly inhibited the degradation performance of t in mf pms system which might be caused by the consumption of the generated radicals by ha li et al 2022 the adsorption of ha onto mf surfaces might also decrease the active sites of mf for the activation of pms ali et al 2021 leading to the slight decrease of degradation performance of t although the presence of ha with high concentration slightly inhibited the degradation efficiency more than 90 of t could still be removed in mf pms system even with the presence of 5 mg l ha in suspensions obviously mf pms could efficiently degrade dna bases with the presence of natural organic matter in suspensions mf pms system towards the degradation performances of base t in real water samples including tap water river water sea water as well as sewage were further investigated by using a reactor with large working volume of 1 l fig 6b the characteristics of real water samples were provided in table s7 complete removal of t in tap water samples could be achieved by mf pms system within 60 min regardless the presence of organic matter in sea water as indicated by the high value of cod complete degradation of t in sea water could be achieved by mf pms system in very short time 30 s due to the possible generation of more radicals in sea water as the presence of high concentration cl and so4 2 due to the presence of organic matters removal performances of t in both river water and sewage by mf pms system were somehow inhibited however complete degradation of t could still be achieved in these two real water samples within 90 min the observation revealed that mf pms could be employed as a promising catalytic system to remove dna bases in real water samples 3 6 catalytic removal performances towards antibiotic resistance genes args dna and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb the feasibility of mf pms system towards degradation of antibiotic resistance genes args was also investigated by using chromosomal kanr extracted from e coli k 12 mg 1655 antibiotic resistant bacteria arb containing kanamycin resistance genes kanr on chromosome and plasmid gmra extracted from e coli s17 1 arb containing gentamycin resistance genes gmra on plasmid as two model args fig 7 a and 7b note that chromosomal args mainly transport through transformation and vertical transmission processes while plasmid args could be easier to transport through conjugation transformation and transduction processes acman et al 2020 li et al 2021 thus the degradation performances of mf pms system towards two types of args located on either chromosome or plasmid were testified the specific kanr and gmra concentrations during the reaction duration in mf pms system were calculated according to the standard curves which were stablished using plasmids of pure kanr genes and gmra genes fig s20 pms alone could not degrade either kanr or gmra indicating that both types of args were stable in pms solution only a small portion of kanr 1 3 log and gmra 1 1 log could be removed by mf without the addition of pms during the reaction duration in contrast mf pms system could completely degrade kanr 8 2 log within 1 min and gmra 8 2 log within 3 min the observations revealed that in addition to dna bases mf pms system could also effectively degrade both chromosomal and plasmid args note that the initial concentrations of kanr containing 1303 dna bases and gmra containing 534 dna bases were 19 600 μg l about 0 046 μm using 330 g mol as the average molecular weight of deoxynucleotide and 13 710 μg l about 0 078 μm respectively both of which were lower than that of dna bases 10 μm thus the degradation kinetics of both types of args in mf pms system were faster than those of single dna bases to determine whether mf pms system could also degrade the whole dna the degradation performances towards dna extracted from two types of arb e coli k 12 mg 1655 and e coli s17 1 in mf pms system were also examined in very short time 1 min 86 6 of total 21 7 ng l dna of e coli k 12 mg 1655 and 97 2 of total 106 4 ng l dna of e coli s17 1 could be degraded in mf pms system fig 7c and 7d dna of e coli k 12 mg 1655 was used as model dna for electrophoresis analysis and sem characterization electrophoresis results showed that the signal for dna quickly reduced after 1 min of degradation in mf pms system fig s21 comparison between the sem images of dna before fig s22a and after the reaction fig s22b showed that the strands of dna were broken into small fragments after the degradation experiment in mf pms system the above results clearly showed that in addition to degradation of dna bases and args mf pms system also exhibited excellent catalytic performance towards the degradation of the whole dna the catalytic performances of mf pms system towards the disinfection of e coli k 12 mg 1655 and e coli s17 1 two types of model arb were further investigated fig 8 a and 8d without the addition of pms the concentrations of two types of arb did not obviously change during the 30 min experiments with k values of 0 0340 0 0082 min 1 for e coli k 12 mg 1655 and 0 0146 0 0016 min 1 for e coli s17 1 due to its acidity and self decomposition pms alone contained some disinfection capability rodríguez chueca et al 2017 complete disinfection of both e coli k 12 mg 1655 with an observed k value of 0 1671 0 0436 min 1 and e coli s17 1 with an observed k value of 0 2500 0 0245 min 1 by pms could be achieved within 30 min reaction duration addition of mf into pms system could significantly enhance the inactivation performances of two types of arb complete inactivation of e coli k 12 mg 1655 with k value of 0 3952 0 0807 min 1 and e coli s17 1 with k value of 0 2934 0 0434 min 1 could be achieved within 20 min in mf pms system the observation indicated that mf pms system also contained outstanding inactivation performances towards two types of arb during the inactivation process of arb mf pms system could also efficiently degrade both args and dna within two types of arb fig 8b and 8e specifically for both types of arb the concentrations of intracellular args iargs gradually reduced with increasing reaction duration due to the degradation by intracellular ros during the disinfection process liu et al 2023a the arb inactivation would lead to the damages of cell membrane liu et al 2022a which would release iargs into solution thus for both types of arb the concentrations of extracellular args eargs increased in the first 2 min inactivation process and then gradually decreased with the increasing reaction duration due to the degradation by ros generated in mf pms system similar to the trend of iargs the concentrations of intracellular dna idna within two types of arb would reduce due to the degradation by intracellular ros specifically with the increase of reaction duration idna of e coli k 12 mg 1655 and e coli s17 1 reduced from 13 5 μg ml to 7 3 μg ml and from 16 8 μg ml to 7 1 μg ml respectively fig 8c and 8f consistent with the trend of eargs the extracellular dna edna concentrations of both arb also increased to 29 μg ml for e coli k 12 mg 1655 and to 9 4 μg ml for e coli s17 1 in first 2 min disinfection process and subsequently reduced to 1 9 μg ml for e coli k 12 mg 1655 and to 4 4 μg ml for e coli s17 1 with increasing reaction duration due to the degradation by the generated ros clearly mf pms system not only could disinfect arb but also would eliminate the risk of args by degradation of args and dna 3 7 reuse experiment and continuous flow reactor experiment due to its strong superparamagnetic property mf could be easily separated from the reaction system after use by using an external magnet the collected mf could be pretreated with h2o2 du et al 2020 and then reused for the activation of pms to degrade t as representative dna bases over 95 of t could be degraded even in the fourth reused mf pms system fig 9 a indicating that mf contained excellent reusability no obvious change was observed in the xrd patterns of mf after the degradation experiment indicating the excellent stability of mf during the degradation process fig s4 moreover only 0 44 of mo and 0 23 of fe were released into the reaction system which further confirmed the stability of mf during the reaction duration table s6 the above observations clearly showed that mf were very stable and could be repeatedly use for activation of pms to degrade dna bases to further test the long term usage of mf pms system to degrade dna bases a continuous flow reactor with volume of 50 ml was designed fig 9b and the experimental device set up was provided in fig 9c in the experiment 500 mg of mf particles were dispersed in the bottom of the reactor which were stabilized by placing a permanent magnet underneath the reactor suspension with mixture of pms with the concentration of 200 mg l and t solution with the concentration of 250 μm were injected into the inlet of the reactor by a peristaltic pump at the flow rate of 500 μl min effluent from the reactor was also controlled by using a peristaltic pump the hydraulic retention time of the continuous flow reactor experiment was set to be 100 min during the 14 day experiment duration mf pms system could effectively remove more than 90 of dna base t in the continuous flow reactor fig 9d the observation clearly showed that mf particles could continuously activate pms and mf pms system had the potential to effectively degraded dna bases in long term experiments 4 conclusions mf was successfully fabricated and used to activate pms to degrade four types of dna bases args and dna as well as disinfect arb we found that mf pms system could effectively degrade bases t a c and g within 10 min 30 min 5 min and 5 min respectively during the reaction process mf could activate pms to form the reactive radicals such as oh so4 o2 and 1o2 contributing to the degradation of dna bases due to the low adsorption energy high charge transfer and better pms cleavage mf exhibited excellent pms adsorption and activation performances mos2 in mf could enhance the cycle of fe iii fe ii improving the catalytic performance the degradation pathways of the dna bases were mainly through dihydroxylation hydroxylation condensation ring fragmentation and other processes moreover we found that mf pms system could also efficiently degrade dna bases in different solution ph complex water matrix including coexisting of anions and natural organic matter as well as in real water samples including tap water river water sea water and sewage especially under high salinity conditions due to the generation of cl radicals and hclo species mf pms system also exhibited outstanding catalytic performances to degrade chromosomal plasmid args and dna in addition arb could be effectively disinfected by mf pms system during arb disinfection process args and dna within arb could also be efficiently degraded the efficient removal of dna bases in both reuse experiments for four consecutive reused cycles and continuous flow reactor experiments lasted for 14 days confirmed the stability of mf and potential of mf pms system for the repeated use as well as the long term use to degrade dna bases overall this study not only provided a deep insight on fe mo triggered pms activation process but also provided an effective and reliable technique for the treatment of dna bases args dna and arb in water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
