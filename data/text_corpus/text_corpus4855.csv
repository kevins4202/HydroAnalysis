24275,sediment phosphorus p biogeochemical processes impact water quality restoration measures and global warming lead to the same outcome namely that reactive p moves from the sediments to the bottom waters in this study a vertical compressed sediment p transport model was developed and coupled with a three dimensional 3 d hydrodynamic ecological model ecolake the proposed model was used to evaluate the effects of two different strategies external loads reduction and global warming on sediment p release flux and p concentrations in the water column of lake chaohu the fifth largest shallow lake in china the results found that the coupled model accurately reflected p transport in the water column sediment and dissolved reactive p srp diffusion at the sediment and water interface the degradable rate of rapidly degradable organic p v p 1 and adsorbed rate k a d are the most sensitive parameters influencing sediment p release flux the internal srp loads caused by diffusion accounted for roughly 5 of the total external p loads with higher values in heavily polluted lake basins western and eastern and during warmer seasons summer and autumn sediment p release may have caused the current lake water srp concentrations to increase by 31 1 12 0 and 21 2 in western central and eastern basins respectively due to the large difference of sediment srp concentration between three basins the srp concentration in water responded to changing loads and water temperature strategies more in the western basin than in the other two basins the sediment p release flux showed spatially contrary responses between two strategies these findings have important implications with respect to the effects of sediment p release on water quality and will assist water quality managers in developing appropriate p control measures keywords numerical modeling internal phosphorus loads water quality lake chaohu data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus p is the typical limiting nutrient for lake primary production over longtime scales vollenweider 1968 conley et al 2009 schindler and hecky 2008 excessive p inputs from exogenous loads are casually linked with lake eutrophication phenomenon such as excessive algal growth and poor water clarity scavia et al 2014 schindler et al 2012 thus the main focus of lake restoration projects is usually to control external sources of nutrient loading jeppesen et al 2007 wang et al 2018 however when external p loads are reduced in shallow lakes internal p release can be a key factor contributing to hysteresis in ecosystem response and thus may interfere with lake restoration effects schindler et al 2012 søndergaard et al 2013 internal p loading mechanisms are numerous and complex and interrelated with various physical and biogeochemical processes welch and cooke 2005 usually there is a surficial aerobic layer with a thickness ranging from less than one millimeter to several centimeters when the bottom water is aerobic chen et al 2018 below the aerobic layer is an anaerobic layer with a thickness ranging from several centimeters to meters li et al 2020 the most active physical and biogeochemical reactions always occur in the upper 10 30 cm of the sediment and the reaction intensity declines dramatically as depth increases zan et al 2011 2012 as a result sharp vertical gradients for both nutrient and oxygen concentrations develop in the sediment overall the vertical distributions of organic and inorganic p in the sediment are controlled by molecular diffusion burial and deposition of particulate p testa et al 2013 in shallow lakes these processes are further complicated by sediment resuspension huang et al 2016b tang et al 2020 in addition to physical processes many geochemical reactions such as mineralization adsorption and desorption are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and bottom water oxygen concentrations beutel and horne 2018 scavia et al 2014 obviously the sediment p release potential is related to the above processes and factors it is important to quantify sediment p transport release rates and their influential factors in eutrophic lakes and plan lake restoration programs many process based sediment models of varying complexity have been developed to describe biogeochemical processes of p transport vertical profiles and exchange fluxes at the sediment and water interface swi lewis et al 2007 smits 1991 wang et al 2003a 2020b early diagenesis models were mainly zero dimensional steady models and the nutrient deposition fluxes at the swi were used as the upper boundary ditoro and fitzpatrick 1993 smits 1991 this family of models was applied to explain the temporal variability and release rates of various nutrient species in the sediment while the simplification of biogeochemical processes in one integrated sediment layer loses the capability to resolve the vertical profiles of nutrients inside the sediment later modelling implemented non steady equations for organic matter deposition geochemical reactions between solid and dissolved components and were coupled with the physical processes of one dimensional diffusion and sedimentation berg et al 2003 fossing et al 2004 lewis et al 2007 mesnage et al 2014 tsandev et al 2012 wang et al 2003a these models typically divide sediment into multiple layers and tend to focus on simulating the sediment nutrient profiles rather than on the exchange fluxes at the swi compared to the steady models the solution for the partial differential equations in these models is relatively accurate and more complete nutrient processes are considered more sophisticated models investigated the influence of sediment processes on water ecosystems by coupling sediment diagenesis processes with physical and biogeochemical processes in the water column huang et al 2015 mcculloch et al 2013 reed et al 2011 in this regard depth resolution in such complex coupled models is usually associated with high computational demand due to the large spatial differences of sediment depth thus less vertically resolved diagenesis models are used when they are coupled to water column models hu et al 2006 huang et al 2016b moriarty et al 2017 smits and van beek 2013 testa et al 2013 as a result these coupling models may induce large errors in the sediment p transport and further influence the nutrient flux simulation at the swi especially for lake sediments with large variations of dissolved reactive nutrients in the vertical and horizontal scales liu et al 2016 although many sediment models are available a process based highly horizontal and vertical resolved and easy to apply sediment model is still lacking for coupled model used in shallow lakes in this study a vertical compressed sediment p transport model is proposed and coupled with ecolake model although ongoing research in shallow lakes has provided considerable insights into the interactions between external loads and ambient water quality conditions wang et al 2020a there is limited understanding of the role that sediments play in the lake p budget additionally field observations have suggested that p concentrations vary significantly in space and time in shallow lakes yang et al 2013b but we do not know to what extent this heterogeneity is influenced by internal p loading furthermore the mechanisms of sediment p release corresponding to external restoration measures and forcing conditions such as temperature are still unable to reveal from the prospective of p cycling processes at the interface thus the main objectives of this study are to i develop a 3 d coupled biogeochemical model for shallow lakes and to evaluate its performance in lake chaohu the fifth largest shallow lake in central china ii estimate the spatial temporal dynamics of sediment p diffusive fluxes and iii investigate the mechanisms of sediment p diffusive fluxes corresponding to two different strategies external loads reduction and air temperature increase 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake chaohu 116 24 118 00 e 30 58 32 06 n is located in central anhui province southeast china with a surface area of 780 km2 and an average depth of 3 06 m peng et al 2021 fig 1 it has a subtropical monsoon climate with a mean annual air temperature of about 15 16 c average annual precipitation of 1063 mm and mean hydraulic water residence time of 0 46 years peng et al 2021 wang et al 2020a typically the lake is divided into western central and eastern basins based on the water and sediment pollution levels wang et al 2021 in total 14 main rivers around the lake are identified and considered in this study of which hangbu river hb nanfei river nf baishitian river bst paihe river ph and zhegao river zg provide more than 90 of the inflow wang et al 2020a peng et al 2019 the yuxi river yx is the only outflow linking the lake to the yangtze river which is regulated by the chaohu sluice the mean annual water level increased from 7 36 m amsl 1956 1960 to 9 15 m amsl 2014 2020 and the annual water level amplitude decreased from approximately 2 94 m to 1 66 m excluding 2016 and 2020 administration bureau of lake chaohu in anhui province 2018 wang et al 2020a here amsl is defined as the height m above the mean sea level of wusong station in the yangtze river estuary zhang et al 2014 over the last several decades there has been rapid socio economic development in the lake chaohu basin huang et al 2016a zhang et al 2015b as a result sediments in lake chaohu have been moderately polluted by both nitrogen and phosphorus wang et al 2021 spatially the sediment total p content has high spatial variability with higher contents in the upper 30 cm of sediments in both western and eastern lake basins wang et al 2021 zan et al 2012 temporally the sediment total p contents have been relative stable over the last ten years without obvious seasonal variations wang et al 2021 xu et al 2011 inorganic p ip accounts for the main proportion of the total sediment p content mean proportion of 61 85 wang et al 2021 sediment srp is continually released into the bottom water due to concentration gradients at the swi especially in the heavily polluted confluence of the western lake basin and the estuaries of the eastern lake basin li et al 2020 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 in addition lake chaohu is a shallow lake with frequently sediment resuspension and wind induced waves greatly increase the risk of internal p release hu et al 2014 2 2 data collection for this study hydrological meteorological water quality and sediment p data were collected for lake chaohu in 2013 and 2018 water quality and sediment p data from 2013 were used to calibrate the model and data from 2018 were used to validate model performance meteorological hydrological and water quality data from 2018 were then used to drive model to predict the effects of two operation strategies on lake sediment p diffusive fluxes and water quality parameters monthly water quality data for the eight lake water sites and 14 inflow and outflow sites were provided by the administration bureau of lake chaohu in anhui province fig 1 daily discharge data for outflow yx river and inflow zh river were obtained from the chaohu bureau of hydrology daily water discharge for other inflows was calculated using a two stage runoff coefficient estimation and scaling approach peng et al 2019 daily precipitation and evaporation data were measured at the chaohu sluice station and tangxi station by the hefei bureau of hydrology and the mean value of the two stations was used in this study the daily lake water level was recorded by the hefei bureau of hydrology at three fixed stations located in the western tangxi station central zhongmiao station and eastern chaohu sluice station parts of the lake fig 1 and the average of all three values represented the averaged total lake water level hourly wind velocity and directions and radiation data were obtained from meteorological stations near lake chaohu the measured surface sediment contents of particulate organic p pop absorbed p ap and total p tp in 2013 were obtained from gong et al 2015 and miao et al 2017 the sediment srp concentrations in 2013 were obtained from li et al 2015 the seasonal measured tp contents of surface lake sediment in 2018 were obtained from yin h unpublished data all the sampling stations can be found in fig s1 specifically simulated tp content in surface lake sediments was calculated based on the simulated pop content and the average proportion of measured pop in tp table s1 due to the lack of experimental data the range of sediment p diffusive fluxes at the swi was obtained from various experimental observations table s2 2 3 model description 2 3 1 ecolake model ecolake is a vertically compressed 3 d structural dynamic model in which eco physiological functions can forecast changes in ecosystem structure hu 2016 hu et al 2011 2006 the ecolake model successfully couples hydrodynamics nutrient cycling and food chain networks into one coherent framework hu et al 2006 the model comprises three main modules and several sub modules the first module is a relatively independent hydrological module the second is a food chain network module including fish zooplankton organic detritus algae and aquatic macrophytes the third is a material transform and transport module including dissolved oxygen do nitrogen and phosphorus transport a detailed description of this model and its applications can be found in wang et al 2018 in particular the simplification of the sediment module into one integrated sediment layer loses the capability to resolve the vertical profiles of p in the sediment hu et al 2006 2 3 2 sediment p model considering the spatial temporal differences of sediment p in large shallow lakes a vertically compressed 3 d structural dynamic model for sediment p transport was created and coupled with the ecolake model a vertical compressed sigma coordinate with 30 evenly distributed vertical layers was applied to better simulate sediment topography fig s2 which can improve the coupled model simulation stability and efficiency while simultaneously linking with the nutrient cycling modules in the ecolake water column hu et al 2006 in this regard the vertical resolution varied considerably over the whole lake with the mean value of 1 89 1 0 cm based on the average sediment depth of lake chaohu wang et al 2021 compared to the high vertical resolution 1 89 cm sediment p diffusions in x and y directions x east west y north south were smaller around four orders of magnitude due to the relatively low horizontal resolution of 500 m and could be neglected during calculations all sediment parameters were expressed in three dimensional forms fig 2 and table 1 show a schematic representation of the sediment p transport model and the expressions of the reaction particulate phosphorus pp in water column is first deposited r1 2 table 1 followed by mineralization and burial of rapidly and slowly degradable portions r3 4 r8 9 mcculloch et al 2013 mineralization produces srp that can diffuse back into the water column the srp exchange fluxes across the interface are controlled by a mass diffusion coefficient and srp concentration differences between sediment and the water column which is also regulated by temperature ph and do level at the interface r6 mohajeri et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 it is worth noting that the diffusive direction of srp can be reversed when srp concentrations in bottom water are higher than in pore water meanwhile srp in the pore water and absorbed phosphorus ap keep in a dynamic balance through adsorption and desorption r5 temperature is clearly an important environmental factor that influences sediment biogeochemical processes as oxygen and nutrient fluxes often follow the seasonal temperature cycle in water systems wang et al 2020 in this sediment model pop mineralization at the interface generally follows an exponential temperature dependence r3 4 the state variables considered in this study were tp srp and do in lake water pop srp and ap in lake sediments the following four differential equations were used in the sediment p transport model to simulate srp pop1 pop2 and ap contents in the sediment respectively 1 t z c d r 3 r 4 r 5 r 6 r 7 2 t 1 z c p 1 r 1 r 3 r 8 3 t 1 z c p 2 r 2 r 4 r 9 4 t 1 z c a p r 5 r 10 where the calculation methods for sources and sinks in the right side of the eqs 1 4 can be found in table 1 all expressions parameters state variables and their abbreviations are stated in tables 1 2 and s3 2 3 3 coupled sediment p ecolake model the physio chemical conditions obtained in ecolake model were set to be the upper boundary of the sediment p model the coupled ecolake model applied in lake chaohu contained 3013 active grid cells in the horizontal pane with a uniform grid size of 500 m a time of step 30 s for the hydrological module and 300 s for biological modules the hydrological time step was determined according to grid size and water depth and preventing divergence during model simulation the concentration field was calculated once every 10 steps of flow field calculation simultaneously ensuring the simulation accuracy and efficiency the calculation period covered the water quality variability across four seasons the coupled ecolake model parameters were calibrated using sediment observations pop ap srp and tp and monthly water quality tp srp and do parameters obtained in 2013 model performance was then validated using the data lake water tp srp and do surface sediment tp obtained in 2018 the sediment p diffusive fluxes were calibrated and validated by comparing to the ranges during experimental observations a trial and error method was used in this study for model calibration and validation two quantitative fit criteria including the h index o b s e r v e d s i m u l a t e d 2 n o b s e r v e d 2 n s i m u l a t e d 2 n and relative standard deviation ar d o b s e r v e d s i m u l a t e d o b s e r v e d were used to evaluate model performance the calculation method can be found in wang et al 2018 the results are considered as acceptable if 0 h 1 and ard is less than 35 before calibrating the model sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the most influential parameter using the morris method morris 1991 this method has been widely applied in global sensitivity analysis due to its robust performance and less number requirement of model evaluations compared to monte carlo filtering variance based density based methods etc pianosi et al 2016 zhou et al 2022 parameter samples were generated using radial based latin hypercube sampling and 300 model evaluations were set to ensure convergence of the sensitivity analysis sensitivity indices absolute mean μ and standard deviation σ of each parameter s elementary effect were calculated using safe tool pianosi et al 2015 the sensitivity ranking was obtained by plotting μ vs σ for all parameters the more to the right and top of the point is located the more the parameter is influential and inter related with other parameters respectively 2 4 lake operation strategies nutrient related water quality deterioration in lake chaohu was recorded prior to 1960 and eutrophic conditions have especially prevailed in the heavily polluted northwestern bay within the western lake chen et al 2011 water pollution control efforts in this lake began in 1995 with strategies mainly involving the mitigation of external nutrient loads zhang and kong 2015 the nutrient concentration including total nitrogen tp and ammonia in main inflows has been decreased over 30 from 2012 to 2018 zhang et al 2020 for the reduction of total external nutrient loading three scenarios s1 s3 table 3 were set for the daily external load reduction which was accomplished by adjusting tributary nutrient concentrations but not flow at the same time the do concentration was increased in proportion to the load reduction in addition temperature is a significant factor influencing sediment p release due to the release of desorption from fe p and the promoted mineralization of organic p in the sediment at raised temperature xue and lu 2015 ipcc has reported that the air temperature increase will achieve or exceeds 1 5 by the mid 2030 compared to 1850 1900 ipcc 2021 two degrees of water temperature increase s4 s5 table 3 were thus set to investigate the internal p loading and water quality responses to global warming the validated 2018 simulation was taken as the baseline and then rerun through a progressive change to external nutrient loading and air temperature increase 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis and model calibration in this study the sediment model included 14 parameters the global sensitivity results for srp the most sensitive of the three state variables are shown fig 3 since the sediment pop and ap contents have little variation within a year the srp concentrations in pore water responded the most to variability in degradable rates of rapidly degradable organic p v p 1 and adsorbed rate k a d and the second most to variability in desorption rate k d e degradable rates of slowly degradable organic p v p 2 and diffusion coefficient d w 20 fig 3 specifically k a d is highly inter related with other parameters although d w 20 and burial velocity of dissolved phosphorus w d z is less sensitive compared to k a d and k d e the transform flux of p through diffusion and burial are much larger compared to ad desorption processes fig 2 water column and sediment data from 2013 were used to calibrate the coupled ecolake model figs 4 s3 and table 4 the simulations were in good agreement with the observations with all h values less than 1 and ard values less than 35 specifically the ard values of do in lake water and srp in pore water were 15 31 and 33 52 respectively indicating relatively good and poor calibration all eight stations had no hypoxia conditions over the whole year fig s3 the overall trends of measured variables were reasonably well represented by model simulations with larger systematic deviations between measured and simulated srp the simulation results matched the seasonal variation of do in capturing the lowest values in july september and peak values in december february the bottom do concentrations in lake chaohu were usually greater than 7 mg l 1 and surface sediments rarely became anoxic which suppressed srp diffusion at the interface although the whole water column in shallow lakes is usually aerobic several mechanisms warm weather high ph wind induced resuspension periodic anoxia etc can combine to produce relatively high sediment p release flux in shallow lakes welch and cooke 2005 overall the simulated tp and srp concentrations were higher in the western lake basin and lower in the eastern lake basin and the opposite was true for do which agreed with the observations the sediment p model reproduced different p fractions including srp ap pop and tp fig 4 of these tp simulation results were the best with ard and h index values of 9 4 and 0 05 respectively the simulated values of srp in the pore water captured the vertical trends at stations 3 and 4 but performed relatively poorly at stations 1 and 2 fig 4a sediment srp concentrations increased with depth at stations 3 and 4 and decreased at stations 1 and 2 it was noteworthy that the simulated pop contents at station 1 were much higher than the observations overall sediment pop contents were uniform in the whole lake ap contents decreased from west to east and tp contents were higher in west and east and lower in the central basin fig 4b for sediment srp release flux the daily averaged flux of the whole lake in 2013 was 0 22 mg m 2 d 1 and ranged from 0 0004 to 1 17 mg m 2 d 1 fig 6c which agreed with observed flux ranges in the references table s2 spatially sediment srp flux was lower in the center of the lake and higher in the east and west except for the area along the shore of the lake fig 6a in temporal sediment srp flux was lower in winter and spring 343d and 99d than in summer and autumn 190d and 282d fig 6a generally the ecolake model reproduced the references magnitude at both spatial and temporal scales 3 2 model validation figs 5 and s4 show the validation results by comparing the simulated tp srp do concentrations of the water column and tp contents of surface lake sediment in 2018 to measured values or ranges using the same model parameters in table 2 the measured concentrations of tp srp and do mainly ranged from 0 03 0 19 0 02 0 10 and 4 62 13 81 mg l 1 respectively fig s4 the ard for tp and srp in the water column were higher with values of 33 9 and 32 7 respectively table 4 stations 7 and 8 were located close to the yuxi river outflow and far from main inflows in the western lake basin this could cause underestimation of actual tp inputs from heavily polluted rivers in the west and overestimation of tp loads out of the lake through the outflow similarly the sediment tp contents were largely overestimated at station 1 and underestimated at station 5 fig 5 the observed sediment tp showed generally higher values in summer and autumn and lower values in winter and spring at stations 1 2 3 and 5 all these stations were distributed in the littoral zones and were extremely affected by the inflow rivers overall the simulated contents of sediment tp were within acceptable ranges with the ard and h index values of 34 5 and 0 22 respectively table 4 the daily averaged flux of srp at the swi over the whole lake in 2018 was 0 13 mg m 2 d 1 and ranged from 0 0007 0 89 mg m 2 d 1 fig 6 c which agreed with determined ranges in laboratory measurements with intact cores table s2 similar to the srp flux distribution during calibration the western and eastern lake basins possessed higher srp flux compared to the central lake basin particularly during summer and winter seasons fig 6b in addition the sediment srp flux showed significantly seasonal variability which followed temperatures being higher in summer and lower in winter fig 6b c specifically the estuary bay of nanfei river where the sediment srp release flux reached 4 35 mg m 2 d 1 in summer 190d implied there were significant effects of internal p loading on p concentrations in the water column in addition sediment srp fluxes in the central lake close to zh river and littoral areas were sometimes negative meaning srp diffused from the bottom water into the sediment in summary the coupled ecolake model results were generally satisfactory compared with measurements the model reproduced the spatial and seasonal variability in sediment srp flux and p concentrations of various forms in both the water column and sediment 3 3 features of the coupled ecolake model the contents of various p forms in the representative station 1 are shown in fig 7 the srp concentrations increased first with depth reached a peak around 15 cm and then gradually decreased fig 7e the peak srp concentrations in the sediment experienced an apparent seasonal variation with a maximum concentration of 0 21 mg l 1 in winter and minimum concentration of 0 16 mg l 1 in summer fig 7a in contrast the sediment ap contents showed an overall contrary variation with an amplitude of about 10 mg kg 1 and kept in dynamic equilibrium with srp concentration fig 7b the pop1 contents showed a considerable decrease during 2018 while less decrease for pop2 contents fig 7c d the fast diagenesis and burial for pop1 2 was probably the main reason the p transport flux in the sediment is shown in fig 2 the pp deposition was balanced by the burial of pop and the diagenesis of both rapidly and slowly degradable p the pop diagenesis then went into sediment srp flux and ad desorption process for the lake ecosystem sediment burial is the main p sink and large p deposition and burial fluxes were observed in this study this coupled ecolake model included the most key sediment p processes which were conceptualized using some simplified formulae by incorporating important environmental factors including temperature ph and do in particular simplified formulae were used for organic phosphorus degradation as a result the sediment p model was a relatively comprehensive process based model with fewer parameters compared to existing sediment models with vertical compressed coordinate the sediment model could discrete the sediment into 30 integrated sediment layers and run efficiently as well numerous process based models have been developed and applied to study eutrophication in shallow lakes such as salmo efdc wasp and ce qual w2 most models use sediment p release rate to characterize the sediment p release flux chen et al 2014 which cannot reveal the mechanism of sediment p responses to various management strategies in this case the sediment model was able to resolve the vertical profiles of different p forms in the sediment which can be of interest to studies focusing on the mechanisms of sediment p release and be able to apply in other shallow lakes additionally after being coupled in the ecolake model the vertical and spatial distributions of p concentrations for different forms in sediment and the water column could be simulated simultaneously 3 4 linking sediment p release with total p in the water column the annual total external p inputs were 233 8 227 5 266 1 and 727 4 t in the western central eastern and entire lake basins respectively in 2018 table 5 meanwhile the respective annual internal srp loads were predicted to be 17 7 6 1 12 7 and 36 4 t the relative contribution of internal srp loads amounted to 7 6 of the responding total external p inputs in the western lake basin and 2 7 and 4 8 in the central and eastern lake basins thus internal loading represented an important source of p in the western and eastern lake basins and had a lower contribution in the central lake due to the relatively low srp concentrations in the pore water for the entire lake the internal srp loads accounted for approximately 5 of the total external p loads which was lower than the obtained average value of 9 from 2014 to 2018 in lake chaohu wang et al 2020a it was probably because the resuspension release of internal p was not considered in this study in the similar shallow lake taihu china sediment resuspension could have significant effects on sediment p release huang et al 2016b the annual averaged srp concentrations were 0 077 0 070 and 0 071 mg l 1 in the western central and eastern basin water columns in 2018 the relatively low srp concentrations in the central and eastern basin were a result of weak p release from the bottom sediment the short residence time and the large amount of p output from the lake specifically sediment srp release altered the concentration of srp in the water body by 0 024 0 008 and 0 015 mg l 1 in the western central and eastern basin respectively these amounts accounted for 31 1 12 0 and 21 2 of the current srp concentrations in the three basins the amount of sediment p static release was an important contributor to algae blooms especially in the western lake basin similar results were also observed in lake ontario doan et al 2018 the relatively large internal p release rates have considerable implications for lake management and conservation measures as the sediment flux of bioavailable p is largely derived from historic loading of inflows then it is expected that this may decrease over time with management actions to reduce the external p inputs from inflows in addition the complexity of the system and the changes in nutrient import have occurred over the past several decades and future climate changes such as global warming render the system dynamic which suggest that investigation into the spatial temporal variability of the sediment based p input and cycling with coupled modeling in shallow lakes is of practical significance 3 5 model application 3 5 1 external loading reduction our model aimed to reproduce the spatial temporal variability of srp concentrations both in the water column and pore water and subsequently estimate the daily sediment srp diffusive fluxes across the interface in addition tp in the water column was also considered in the simulation because it is an important indicator for eutrophication in freshwater system the responses of daily srp and tp concentrations srp exchange flux at the interface srp concentration in profile in 99d 190d 282d and 343d at stations 1 and 5 and the relative change of annual averaged value compared to baseline can be seen in figs 8 10 both peak concentrations of tp and minimum srp concentrations at station 1 were observed in august fig 9a c the reason for this phenomenon may have been srp assimilation by fast growth phytoplankton during this time after different proportions of external loads reduction the srp concentrations in pore water decreased slightly with the average percentages 0 14 0 86 and 0 04 0 55 respectively at stations 1 and 5 fig 8 by contrast srp and tp concentrations in the water column significantly decreased fig 9a d in addition srp and tp concentrations in the western lake basin reacted and decreased more quickly compared to the eastern part fig 10 which may have been because more inflows with large discharge were distributed in the western basin at the same time the decreased proportion of tp was higher than srp at both stations fig 9a d furthermore external loads reduction significantly increased the sediment srp release flux in western and eastern lake basin while decreased in central lake basin fig 10 the annual mean sediment p release flux at station 1 increased by 11 9 43 6 and 76 1 from the baseline condition value 0 11 mg m 2 d 1 after different proportions of external loads reduction fig 9e overall the proportion of external loads reduction was significantly negatively correlated with decreasing srp and tp concentrations in the water column but was positively correlated with the sediment p release flux fig 11 3 5 2 temperature increase water temperature increases reduced srp concentrations in surface pore water at stations 1 and 5 in simulation day 99 and high temperature 1 5 possessed larger reduce effects fig 8a e subsequently the affected srp layers gradually increased to the total profile fig 8b d f h water temperature increases of 1 0 and 1 5 decreased the annual mean srp concentrations in the total profile by 1 4 and 2 2 respectively at both stations 1 and 5 higher temperature induced large diffusive coefficient at the interface promoted sediment srp diffusing to the overlying water and thereby decreased srp concentration in the pore water the decreased srp concentrations in pore water were negative correlated with water temperature increase data not shown water temperature increases clearly increased tp and srp concentrations in the water column fig 9a d which could be attributed to the simulated growth of aquatic plants and biological mineralization at higher temperature specifically tp concentrations in the water column increased less than srp after the water temperature increase water temperature increases of 1 0 and 1 5 at stations 1 and 5 clearly increased water srp concentrations by 6 8 10 3 and 3 9 5 7 respectively for tp increases were 2 3 3 6 and 0 9 1 3 respectively similar to the load reduction scenarios increased water srp and tp concentrations in the western lake basin were higher than in the eastern lake basin fig 10 water temperature increases improved the mean sediment srp release flux during winter and spring and decreased it during summer and autumn fig 9e f the annual mean sediment srp release flux declined by 10 7 and 32 6 at station 1 and increased by 2 1 and 1 6 at station 5 after respective water temperature increases of 1 0 and 1 5 3 5 3 mechanic of sediment srp release under different scenarios external loads reduction can significantly decrease srp concentrations in the water column simultaneously increasing srp concentration gradients at the interface and therefore increasing the sediment srp release flux table 6 this could partly mediate the effectiveness of water quality improvements after external loads reduction taking s1 loads reduction 10 as an example the decreased srp concentrations in lake water 6 6 were obviously lower compared to the reduction of external srp loads 10 previous studies found that water quality improvements lagged several decades after the implementation of external loads reduction doan et al 2018 schindler et al 2012 søndergaard et al 2013 it was also observed that the srp concentrations responded mostly to external loads reduction in summer and autumn fig 9 this was because most external loads were imported during summer and autumn fig s5 in addition srp concentration variability in the western lake basin reacted more quickly than the eastern lake basin fig 10 specifically the start date of the decrease of srp concentrations at station 5 75 d in eastern lake basin was approximately 25 days later than at station 1 50 d in western lake basin fig 9 this was because most large and heavily polluted input rivers are distributed in the western lake basin raised temperature simulated biological mineralization in both water and sediment and increased diffusion coefficient across the interface beutel and horne 2018 their joint effects changed the srp concentration gradient at the interface and therefore determined sediment srp flux in the present study temperature increases promoted sediment p release through increasing the diffusive coefficient temperature increase of 1 0 increased the mean sediment srp release flux by 1 8 table 6 which could be attributed to the positive effects of increased srp diffusion coefficient at higher temperature in contrast the increase proportion of mean sediment srp release flux dropped to 0 91 when air temperature was increased by 1 5 in this case the mineralization of organic matter may have produced higher srp concentrations in the water column compared to that in the pore water which led to a decline in the srp concentration gradient at the swi and therefore mediate the positive effects of sediment srp flux both kinds of scenarios will lead to the increase of sediment srp release while its impacts on lake water quality are on the contrary fig 10 and table 6 external loads reduction seemed to be an effective measure for improving tp and srp water quality which agreed with previous findings rucinski et al 2016 verhamme et al 2016 however this measure may have simultaneously increased sediment srp release flux especially in western and eastern lake basins fig 10 which in turn reduced restoration efficacy global warming will deteriorate water quality for tp and srp regardless of the changes in internal srp loading in previous studies sediment p release flux was typically obtained through laboratory incubation experiments the proposed model can be a useful tool to predict the sediment p flux in high spatial temporal scale and to assess the potential effectiveness of various strategies on water quality improvements and internal p loading 3 6 model limitations and research prospects although the coupled ecolake model performed well at most stations in both the sediment and the water column deviations did exist partly because it used constant parameter values at all locations this may not be an optimal choice for an ecosystem with complex bio geo chemical reactions and variable spatial temporal model parameters could potentially improve model performance for instance the model used uniform values for both r 1 and r 2 at different stations due to the lack of measurement data which may have resulted in deviations this was because organic matter in different lake regions may have had different sources e g allochthonous versus autochthonous which influenced particulate sizes and therefore affected their reactivities in the sediment the two parameters could be further determined both in laboratory and in situ experiment in addition a study conducted by huang et al 2016b in a shallow lake taihu found that a typical resuspension event could significantly increase sediment srp release flux therefore wind induced sediment resuspension is likely to dominate sediment srp release ideally resuspension of sediment detritus should be coupled with the sediment p transport model so that p adsorption and desorption processes are also included in the water column in this regard the coupled model requires more accurate bed bottom shear stress data lake current data and a very well calibrated resuspension rate which was beyond the scope of the available measurement data and the aim of this study future study may focus on the dynamic release of srp during sediment resuspension and including this process in the model furthermore there were no in situ sediment p release flux data with which to make direct comparisons most sediment p release flux data were measured in a laboratory and did not represent actual in situ physio chemical conditions resulting in uncertainty more systematic monitoring of sediment internal loading throughout the lake and at different times of the year to quantify this important flux will be needed ideally in addition to traditional sediment incubation method in laboratory in situ approaches such as the development of benthic chamber and ecological modelling found by jörgensen could be used simultaneously jörgensen and bendoricchio 1994 last spatial networks including the p interactions and features at the sediment and water interface may help real the mechanism corresponding to various strategies although the ecosystem structural dynamic model can simultaneously simulate parameter values in ecological network an effective method is lacking for analyzing the non linear relationship between parameters multiple non linear models such as convergent cross mapping and convertinoli and covertino 2021 and pcmci runge et al 2019 etc have been proven to be reliable methods to indicate the non linear parameter interactions thus theses non linear models could be coupled into ecolake to analyze the mechanism of p interactions at the interface in future work 4 conclusions in this study a dynamic sediment p model that coupled ecolake model was developed which considered sediment p cycling and its static release this coupled model should be generally applicable to a variety of lake conditions it was tested here to predict sediment p transport in lake chaohu and the effects of various operating strategies on sediment p release and p concentrations in the water column the main conclusions with respect to lake chaohu are as follows 1 the model was able to effectively describe the p dynamics both in the water column and lake sediments and provided a valid tool for evaluating the effects of lake operations on internal p release fluxes and p concentrations in the water column the degradable rate of rapidly degradable organic p v p 1 and adsorbed rate k a d are the most sensitive parameters influencing sediment p release flux 2 sediment p release fluxes were higher in heavily polluted lake basins western and eastern and during summer and autumn when temperature was warmer the relative contribution of internal srp loads amounted to 7 6 of the responding total external p inputs in the western lake basin and 2 7 and 4 8 in the central and eastern lake basins 3 the responses of sediment p flux and p concentrations in the water column varied spatial temporally between external loads reduction and water temperature increase strategies external p loads reduction increased sediment p flux through decreasing p concentrations in the water column the promoted effects on sediment p flux under higher temperature were the joint effects of increased biological mineralization and diffusion credit authorship contribution statement yanping wang conceptualization

24275,sediment phosphorus p biogeochemical processes impact water quality restoration measures and global warming lead to the same outcome namely that reactive p moves from the sediments to the bottom waters in this study a vertical compressed sediment p transport model was developed and coupled with a three dimensional 3 d hydrodynamic ecological model ecolake the proposed model was used to evaluate the effects of two different strategies external loads reduction and global warming on sediment p release flux and p concentrations in the water column of lake chaohu the fifth largest shallow lake in china the results found that the coupled model accurately reflected p transport in the water column sediment and dissolved reactive p srp diffusion at the sediment and water interface the degradable rate of rapidly degradable organic p v p 1 and adsorbed rate k a d are the most sensitive parameters influencing sediment p release flux the internal srp loads caused by diffusion accounted for roughly 5 of the total external p loads with higher values in heavily polluted lake basins western and eastern and during warmer seasons summer and autumn sediment p release may have caused the current lake water srp concentrations to increase by 31 1 12 0 and 21 2 in western central and eastern basins respectively due to the large difference of sediment srp concentration between three basins the srp concentration in water responded to changing loads and water temperature strategies more in the western basin than in the other two basins the sediment p release flux showed spatially contrary responses between two strategies these findings have important implications with respect to the effects of sediment p release on water quality and will assist water quality managers in developing appropriate p control measures keywords numerical modeling internal phosphorus loads water quality lake chaohu data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus p is the typical limiting nutrient for lake primary production over longtime scales vollenweider 1968 conley et al 2009 schindler and hecky 2008 excessive p inputs from exogenous loads are casually linked with lake eutrophication phenomenon such as excessive algal growth and poor water clarity scavia et al 2014 schindler et al 2012 thus the main focus of lake restoration projects is usually to control external sources of nutrient loading jeppesen et al 2007 wang et al 2018 however when external p loads are reduced in shallow lakes internal p release can be a key factor contributing to hysteresis in ecosystem response and thus may interfere with lake restoration effects schindler et al 2012 søndergaard et al 2013 internal p loading mechanisms are numerous and complex and interrelated with various physical and biogeochemical processes welch and cooke 2005 usually there is a surficial aerobic layer with a thickness ranging from less than one millimeter to several centimeters when the bottom water is aerobic chen et al 2018 below the aerobic layer is an anaerobic layer with a thickness ranging from several centimeters to meters li et al 2020 the most active physical and biogeochemical reactions always occur in the upper 10 30 cm of the sediment and the reaction intensity declines dramatically as depth increases zan et al 2011 2012 as a result sharp vertical gradients for both nutrient and oxygen concentrations develop in the sediment overall the vertical distributions of organic and inorganic p in the sediment are controlled by molecular diffusion burial and deposition of particulate p testa et al 2013 in shallow lakes these processes are further complicated by sediment resuspension huang et al 2016b tang et al 2020 in addition to physical processes many geochemical reactions such as mineralization adsorption and desorption are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and bottom water oxygen concentrations beutel and horne 2018 scavia et al 2014 obviously the sediment p release potential is related to the above processes and factors it is important to quantify sediment p transport release rates and their influential factors in eutrophic lakes and plan lake restoration programs many process based sediment models of varying complexity have been developed to describe biogeochemical processes of p transport vertical profiles and exchange fluxes at the sediment and water interface swi lewis et al 2007 smits 1991 wang et al 2003a 2020b early diagenesis models were mainly zero dimensional steady models and the nutrient deposition fluxes at the swi were used as the upper boundary ditoro and fitzpatrick 1993 smits 1991 this family of models was applied to explain the temporal variability and release rates of various nutrient species in the sediment while the simplification of biogeochemical processes in one integrated sediment layer loses the capability to resolve the vertical profiles of nutrients inside the sediment later modelling implemented non steady equations for organic matter deposition geochemical reactions between solid and dissolved components and were coupled with the physical processes of one dimensional diffusion and sedimentation berg et al 2003 fossing et al 2004 lewis et al 2007 mesnage et al 2014 tsandev et al 2012 wang et al 2003a these models typically divide sediment into multiple layers and tend to focus on simulating the sediment nutrient profiles rather than on the exchange fluxes at the swi compared to the steady models the solution for the partial differential equations in these models is relatively accurate and more complete nutrient processes are considered more sophisticated models investigated the influence of sediment processes on water ecosystems by coupling sediment diagenesis processes with physical and biogeochemical processes in the water column huang et al 2015 mcculloch et al 2013 reed et al 2011 in this regard depth resolution in such complex coupled models is usually associated with high computational demand due to the large spatial differences of sediment depth thus less vertically resolved diagenesis models are used when they are coupled to water column models hu et al 2006 huang et al 2016b moriarty et al 2017 smits and van beek 2013 testa et al 2013 as a result these coupling models may induce large errors in the sediment p transport and further influence the nutrient flux simulation at the swi especially for lake sediments with large variations of dissolved reactive nutrients in the vertical and horizontal scales liu et al 2016 although many sediment models are available a process based highly horizontal and vertical resolved and easy to apply sediment model is still lacking for coupled model used in shallow lakes in this study a vertical compressed sediment p transport model is proposed and coupled with ecolake model although ongoing research in shallow lakes has provided considerable insights into the interactions between external loads and ambient water quality conditions wang et al 2020a there is limited understanding of the role that sediments play in the lake p budget additionally field observations have suggested that p concentrations vary significantly in space and time in shallow lakes yang et al 2013b but we do not know to what extent this heterogeneity is influenced by internal p loading furthermore the mechanisms of sediment p release corresponding to external restoration measures and forcing conditions such as temperature are still unable to reveal from the prospective of p cycling processes at the interface thus the main objectives of this study are to i develop a 3 d coupled biogeochemical model for shallow lakes and to evaluate its performance in lake chaohu the fifth largest shallow lake in central china ii estimate the spatial temporal dynamics of sediment p diffusive fluxes and iii investigate the mechanisms of sediment p diffusive fluxes corresponding to two different strategies external loads reduction and air temperature increase 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake chaohu 116 24 118 00 e 30 58 32 06 n is located in central anhui province southeast china with a surface area of 780 km2 and an average depth of 3 06 m peng et al 2021 fig 1 it has a subtropical monsoon climate with a mean annual air temperature of about 15 16 c average annual precipitation of 1063 mm and mean hydraulic water residence time of 0 46 years peng et al 2021 wang et al 2020a typically the lake is divided into western central and eastern basins based on the water and sediment pollution levels wang et al 2021 in total 14 main rivers around the lake are identified and considered in this study of which hangbu river hb nanfei river nf baishitian river bst paihe river ph and zhegao river zg provide more than 90 of the inflow wang et al 2020a peng et al 2019 the yuxi river yx is the only outflow linking the lake to the yangtze river which is regulated by the chaohu sluice the mean annual water level increased from 7 36 m amsl 1956 1960 to 9 15 m amsl 2014 2020 and the annual water level amplitude decreased from approximately 2 94 m to 1 66 m excluding 2016 and 2020 administration bureau of lake chaohu in anhui province 2018 wang et al 2020a here amsl is defined as the height m above the mean sea level of wusong station in the yangtze river estuary zhang et al 2014 over the last several decades there has been rapid socio economic development in the lake chaohu basin huang et al 2016a zhang et al 2015b as a result sediments in lake chaohu have been moderately polluted by both nitrogen and phosphorus wang et al 2021 spatially the sediment total p content has high spatial variability with higher contents in the upper 30 cm of sediments in both western and eastern lake basins wang et al 2021 zan et al 2012 temporally the sediment total p contents have been relative stable over the last ten years without obvious seasonal variations wang et al 2021 xu et al 2011 inorganic p ip accounts for the main proportion of the total sediment p content mean proportion of 61 85 wang et al 2021 sediment srp is continually released into the bottom water due to concentration gradients at the swi especially in the heavily polluted confluence of the western lake basin and the estuaries of the eastern lake basin li et al 2020 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 in addition lake chaohu is a shallow lake with frequently sediment resuspension and wind induced waves greatly increase the risk of internal p release hu et al 2014 2 2 data collection for this study hydrological meteorological water quality and sediment p data were collected for lake chaohu in 2013 and 2018 water quality and sediment p data from 2013 were used to calibrate the model and data from 2018 were used to validate model performance meteorological hydrological and water quality data from 2018 were then used to drive model to predict the effects of two operation strategies on lake sediment p diffusive fluxes and water quality parameters monthly water quality data for the eight lake water sites and 14 inflow and outflow sites were provided by the administration bureau of lake chaohu in anhui province fig 1 daily discharge data for outflow yx river and inflow zh river were obtained from the chaohu bureau of hydrology daily water discharge for other inflows was calculated using a two stage runoff coefficient estimation and scaling approach peng et al 2019 daily precipitation and evaporation data were measured at the chaohu sluice station and tangxi station by the hefei bureau of hydrology and the mean value of the two stations was used in this study the daily lake water level was recorded by the hefei bureau of hydrology at three fixed stations located in the western tangxi station central zhongmiao station and eastern chaohu sluice station parts of the lake fig 1 and the average of all three values represented the averaged total lake water level hourly wind velocity and directions and radiation data were obtained from meteorological stations near lake chaohu the measured surface sediment contents of particulate organic p pop absorbed p ap and total p tp in 2013 were obtained from gong et al 2015 and miao et al 2017 the sediment srp concentrations in 2013 were obtained from li et al 2015 the seasonal measured tp contents of surface lake sediment in 2018 were obtained from yin h unpublished data all the sampling stations can be found in fig s1 specifically simulated tp content in surface lake sediments was calculated based on the simulated pop content and the average proportion of measured pop in tp table s1 due to the lack of experimental data the range of sediment p diffusive fluxes at the swi was obtained from various experimental observations table s2 2 3 model description 2 3 1 ecolake model ecolake is a vertically compressed 3 d structural dynamic model in which eco physiological functions can forecast changes in ecosystem structure hu 2016 hu et al 2011 2006 the ecolake model successfully couples hydrodynamics nutrient cycling and food chain networks into one coherent framework hu et al 2006 the model comprises three main modules and several sub modules the first module is a relatively independent hydrological module the second is a food chain network module including fish zooplankton organic detritus algae and aquatic macrophytes the third is a material transform and transport module including dissolved oxygen do nitrogen and phosphorus transport a detailed description of this model and its applications can be found in wang et al 2018 in particular the simplification of the sediment module into one integrated sediment layer loses the capability to resolve the vertical profiles of p in the sediment hu et al 2006 2 3 2 sediment p model considering the spatial temporal differences of sediment p in large shallow lakes a vertically compressed 3 d structural dynamic model for sediment p transport was created and coupled with the ecolake model a vertical compressed sigma coordinate with 30 evenly distributed vertical layers was applied to better simulate sediment topography fig s2 which can improve the coupled model simulation stability and efficiency while simultaneously linking with the nutrient cycling modules in the ecolake water column hu et al 2006 in this regard the vertical resolution varied considerably over the whole lake with the mean value of 1 89 1 0 cm based on the average sediment depth of lake chaohu wang et al 2021 compared to the high vertical resolution 1 89 cm sediment p diffusions in x and y directions x east west y north south were smaller around four orders of magnitude due to the relatively low horizontal resolution of 500 m and could be neglected during calculations all sediment parameters were expressed in three dimensional forms fig 2 and table 1 show a schematic representation of the sediment p transport model and the expressions of the reaction particulate phosphorus pp in water column is first deposited r1 2 table 1 followed by mineralization and burial of rapidly and slowly degradable portions r3 4 r8 9 mcculloch et al 2013 mineralization produces srp that can diffuse back into the water column the srp exchange fluxes across the interface are controlled by a mass diffusion coefficient and srp concentration differences between sediment and the water column which is also regulated by temperature ph and do level at the interface r6 mohajeri et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 it is worth noting that the diffusive direction of srp can be reversed when srp concentrations in bottom water are higher than in pore water meanwhile srp in the pore water and absorbed phosphorus ap keep in a dynamic balance through adsorption and desorption r5 temperature is clearly an important environmental factor that influences sediment biogeochemical processes as oxygen and nutrient fluxes often follow the seasonal temperature cycle in water systems wang et al 2020 in this sediment model pop mineralization at the interface generally follows an exponential temperature dependence r3 4 the state variables considered in this study were tp srp and do in lake water pop srp and ap in lake sediments the following four differential equations were used in the sediment p transport model to simulate srp pop1 pop2 and ap contents in the sediment respectively 1 t z c d r 3 r 4 r 5 r 6 r 7 2 t 1 z c p 1 r 1 r 3 r 8 3 t 1 z c p 2 r 2 r 4 r 9 4 t 1 z c a p r 5 r 10 where the calculation methods for sources and sinks in the right side of the eqs 1 4 can be found in table 1 all expressions parameters state variables and their abbreviations are stated in tables 1 2 and s3 2 3 3 coupled sediment p ecolake model the physio chemical conditions obtained in ecolake model were set to be the upper boundary of the sediment p model the coupled ecolake model applied in lake chaohu contained 3013 active grid cells in the horizontal pane with a uniform grid size of 500 m a time of step 30 s for the hydrological module and 300 s for biological modules the hydrological time step was determined according to grid size and water depth and preventing divergence during model simulation the concentration field was calculated once every 10 steps of flow field calculation simultaneously ensuring the simulation accuracy and efficiency the calculation period covered the water quality variability across four seasons the coupled ecolake model parameters were calibrated using sediment observations pop ap srp and tp and monthly water quality tp srp and do parameters obtained in 2013 model performance was then validated using the data lake water tp srp and do surface sediment tp obtained in 2018 the sediment p diffusive fluxes were calibrated and validated by comparing to the ranges during experimental observations a trial and error method was used in this study for model calibration and validation two quantitative fit criteria including the h index o b s e r v e d s i m u l a t e d 2 n o b s e r v e d 2 n s i m u l a t e d 2 n and relative standard deviation ar d o b s e r v e d s i m u l a t e d o b s e r v e d were used to evaluate model performance the calculation method can be found in wang et al 2018 the results are considered as acceptable if 0 h 1 and ard is less than 35 before calibrating the model sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the most influential parameter using the morris method morris 1991 this method has been widely applied in global sensitivity analysis due to its robust performance and less number requirement of model evaluations compared to monte carlo filtering variance based density based methods etc pianosi et al 2016 zhou et al 2022 parameter samples were generated using radial based latin hypercube sampling and 300 model evaluations were set to ensure convergence of the sensitivity analysis sensitivity indices absolute mean μ and standard deviation σ of each parameter s elementary effect were calculated using safe tool pianosi et al 2015 the sensitivity ranking was obtained by plotting μ vs σ for all parameters the more to the right and top of the point is located the more the parameter is influential and inter related with other parameters respectively 2 4 lake operation strategies nutrient related water quality deterioration in lake chaohu was recorded prior to 1960 and eutrophic conditions have especially prevailed in the heavily polluted northwestern bay within the western lake chen et al 2011 water pollution control efforts in this lake began in 1995 with strategies mainly involving the mitigation of external nutrient loads zhang and kong 2015 the nutrient concentration including total nitrogen tp and ammonia in main inflows has been decreased over 30 from 2012 to 2018 zhang et al 2020 for the reduction of total external nutrient loading three scenarios s1 s3 table 3 were set for the daily external load reduction which was accomplished by adjusting tributary nutrient concentrations but not flow at the same time the do concentration was increased in proportion to the load reduction in addition temperature is a significant factor influencing sediment p release due to the release of desorption from fe p and the promoted mineralization of organic p in the sediment at raised temperature xue and lu 2015 ipcc has reported that the air temperature increase will achieve or exceeds 1 5 by the mid 2030 compared to 1850 1900 ipcc 2021 two degrees of water temperature increase s4 s5 table 3 were thus set to investigate the internal p loading and water quality responses to global warming the validated 2018 simulation was taken as the baseline and then rerun through a progressive change to external nutrient loading and air temperature increase 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis and model calibration in this study the sediment model included 14 parameters the global sensitivity results for srp the most sensitive of the three state variables are shown fig 3 since the sediment pop and ap contents have little variation within a year the srp concentrations in pore water responded the most to variability in degradable rates of rapidly degradable organic p v p 1 and adsorbed rate k a d and the second most to variability in desorption rate k d e degradable rates of slowly degradable organic p v p 2 and diffusion coefficient d w 20 fig 3 specifically k a d is highly inter related with other parameters although d w 20 and burial velocity of dissolved phosphorus w d z is less sensitive compared to k a d and k d e the transform flux of p through diffusion and burial are much larger compared to ad desorption processes fig 2 water column and sediment data from 2013 were used to calibrate the coupled ecolake model figs 4 s3 and table 4 the simulations were in good agreement with the observations with all h values less than 1 and ard values less than 35 specifically the ard values of do in lake water and srp in pore water were 15 31 and 33 52 respectively indicating relatively good and poor calibration all eight stations had no hypoxia conditions over the whole year fig s3 the overall trends of measured variables were reasonably well represented by model simulations with larger systematic deviations between measured and simulated srp the simulation results matched the seasonal variation of do in capturing the lowest values in july september and peak values in december february the bottom do concentrations in lake chaohu were usually greater than 7 mg l 1 and surface sediments rarely became anoxic which suppressed srp diffusion at the interface although the whole water column in shallow lakes is usually aerobic several mechanisms warm weather high ph wind induced resuspension periodic anoxia etc can combine to produce relatively high sediment p release flux in shallow lakes welch and cooke 2005 overall the simulated tp and srp concentrations were higher in the western lake basin and lower in the eastern lake basin and the opposite was true for do which agreed with the observations the sediment p model reproduced different p fractions including srp ap pop and tp fig 4 of these tp simulation results were the best with ard and h index values of 9 4 and 0 05 respectively the simulated values of srp in the pore water captured the vertical trends at stations 3 and 4 but performed relatively poorly at stations 1 and 2 fig 4a sediment srp concentrations increased with depth at stations 3 and 4 and decreased at stations 1 and 2 it was noteworthy that the simulated pop contents at station 1 were much higher than the observations overall sediment pop contents were uniform in the whole lake ap contents decreased from west to east and tp contents were higher in west and east and lower in the central basin fig 4b for sediment srp release flux the daily averaged flux of the whole lake in 2013 was 0 22 mg m 2 d 1 and ranged from 0 0004 to 1 17 mg m 2 d 1 fig 6c which agreed with observed flux ranges in the references table s2 spatially sediment srp flux was lower in the center of the lake and higher in the east and west except for the area along the shore of the lake fig 6a in temporal sediment srp flux was lower in winter and spring 343d and 99d than in summer and autumn 190d and 282d fig 6a generally the ecolake model reproduced the references magnitude at both spatial and temporal scales 3 2 model validation figs 5 and s4 show the validation results by comparing the simulated tp srp do concentrations of the water column and tp contents of surface lake sediment in 2018 to measured values or ranges using the same model parameters in table 2 the measured concentrations of tp srp and do mainly ranged from 0 03 0 19 0 02 0 10 and 4 62 13 81 mg l 1 respectively fig s4 the ard for tp and srp in the water column were higher with values of 33 9 and 32 7 respectively table 4 stations 7 and 8 were located close to the yuxi river outflow and far from main inflows in the western lake basin this could cause underestimation of actual tp inputs from heavily polluted rivers in the west and overestimation of tp loads out of the lake through the outflow similarly the sediment tp contents were largely overestimated at station 1 and underestimated at station 5 fig 5 the observed sediment tp showed generally higher values in summer and autumn and lower values in winter and spring at stations 1 2 3 and 5 all these stations were distributed in the littoral zones and were extremely affected by the inflow rivers overall the simulated contents of sediment tp were within acceptable ranges with the ard and h index values of 34 5 and 0 22 respectively table 4 the daily averaged flux of srp at the swi over the whole lake in 2018 was 0 13 mg m 2 d 1 and ranged from 0 0007 0 89 mg m 2 d 1 fig 6 c which agreed with determined ranges in laboratory measurements with intact cores table s2 similar to the srp flux distribution during calibration the western and eastern lake basins possessed higher srp flux compared to the central lake basin particularly during summer and winter seasons fig 6b in addition the sediment srp flux showed significantly seasonal variability which followed temperatures being higher in summer and lower in winter fig 6b c specifically the estuary bay of nanfei river where the sediment srp release flux reached 4 35 mg m 2 d 1 in summer 190d implied there were significant effects of internal p loading on p concentrations in the water column in addition sediment srp fluxes in the central lake close to zh river and littoral areas were sometimes negative meaning srp diffused from the bottom water into the sediment in summary the coupled ecolake model results were generally satisfactory compared with measurements the model reproduced the spatial and seasonal variability in sediment srp flux and p concentrations of various forms in both the water column and sediment 3 3 features of the coupled ecolake model the contents of various p forms in the representative station 1 are shown in fig 7 the srp concentrations increased first with depth reached a peak around 15 cm and then gradually decreased fig 7e the peak srp concentrations in the sediment experienced an apparent seasonal variation with a maximum concentration of 0 21 mg l 1 in winter and minimum concentration of 0 16 mg l 1 in summer fig 7a in contrast the sediment ap contents showed an overall contrary variation with an amplitude of about 10 mg kg 1 and kept in dynamic equilibrium with srp concentration fig 7b the pop1 contents showed a considerable decrease during 2018 while less decrease for pop2 contents fig 7c d the fast diagenesis and burial for pop1 2 was probably the main reason the p transport flux in the sediment is shown in fig 2 the pp deposition was balanced by the burial of pop and the diagenesis of both rapidly and slowly degradable p the pop diagenesis then went into sediment srp flux and ad desorption process for the lake ecosystem sediment burial is the main p sink and large p deposition and burial fluxes were observed in this study this coupled ecolake model included the most key sediment p processes which were conceptualized using some simplified formulae by incorporating important environmental factors including temperature ph and do in particular simplified formulae were used for organic phosphorus degradation as a result the sediment p model was a relatively comprehensive process based model with fewer parameters compared to existing sediment models with vertical compressed coordinate the sediment model could discrete the sediment into 30 integrated sediment layers and run efficiently as well numerous process based models have been developed and applied to study eutrophication in shallow lakes such as salmo efdc wasp and ce qual w2 most models use sediment p release rate to characterize the sediment p release flux chen et al 2014 which cannot reveal the mechanism of sediment p responses to various management strategies in this case the sediment model was able to resolve the vertical profiles of different p forms in the sediment which can be of interest to studies focusing on the mechanisms of sediment p release and be able to apply in other shallow lakes additionally after being coupled in the ecolake model the vertical and spatial distributions of p concentrations for different forms in sediment and the water column could be simulated simultaneously 3 4 linking sediment p release with total p in the water column the annual total external p inputs were 233 8 227 5 266 1 and 727 4 t in the western central eastern and entire lake basins respectively in 2018 table 5 meanwhile the respective annual internal srp loads were predicted to be 17 7 6 1 12 7 and 36 4 t the relative contribution of internal srp loads amounted to 7 6 of the responding total external p inputs in the western lake basin and 2 7 and 4 8 in the central and eastern lake basins thus internal loading represented an important source of p in the western and eastern lake basins and had a lower contribution in the central lake due to the relatively low srp concentrations in the pore water for the entire lake the internal srp loads accounted for approximately 5 of the total external p loads which was lower than the obtained average value of 9 from 2014 to 2018 in lake chaohu wang et al 2020a it was probably because the resuspension release of internal p was not considered in this study in the similar shallow lake taihu china sediment resuspension could have significant effects on sediment p release huang et al 2016b the annual averaged srp concentrations were 0 077 0 070 and 0 071 mg l 1 in the western central and eastern basin water columns in 2018 the relatively low srp concentrations in the central and eastern basin were a result of weak p release from the bottom sediment the short residence time and the large amount of p output from the lake specifically sediment srp release altered the concentration of srp in the water body by 0 024 0 008 and 0 015 mg l 1 in the western central and eastern basin respectively these amounts accounted for 31 1 12 0 and 21 2 of the current srp concentrations in the three basins the amount of sediment p static release was an important contributor to algae blooms especially in the western lake basin similar results were also observed in lake ontario doan et al 2018 the relatively large internal p release rates have considerable implications for lake management and conservation measures as the sediment flux of bioavailable p is largely derived from historic loading of inflows then it is expected that this may decrease over time with management actions to reduce the external p inputs from inflows in addition the complexity of the system and the changes in nutrient import have occurred over the past several decades and future climate changes such as global warming render the system dynamic which suggest that investigation into the spatial temporal variability of the sediment based p input and cycling with coupled modeling in shallow lakes is of practical significance 3 5 model application 3 5 1 external loading reduction our model aimed to reproduce the spatial temporal variability of srp concentrations both in the water column and pore water and subsequently estimate the daily sediment srp diffusive fluxes across the interface in addition tp in the water column was also considered in the simulation because it is an important indicator for eutrophication in freshwater system the responses of daily srp and tp concentrations srp exchange flux at the interface srp concentration in profile in 99d 190d 282d and 343d at stations 1 and 5 and the relative change of annual averaged value compared to baseline can be seen in figs 8 10 both peak concentrations of tp and minimum srp concentrations at station 1 were observed in august fig 9a c the reason for this phenomenon may have been srp assimilation by fast growth phytoplankton during this time after different proportions of external loads reduction the srp concentrations in pore water decreased slightly with the average percentages 0 14 0 86 and 0 04 0 55 respectively at stations 1 and 5 fig 8 by contrast srp and tp concentrations in the water column significantly decreased fig 9a d in addition srp and tp concentrations in the western lake basin reacted and decreased more quickly compared to the eastern part fig 10 which may have been because more inflows with large discharge were distributed in the western basin at the same time the decreased proportion of tp was higher than srp at both stations fig 9a d furthermore external loads reduction significantly increased the sediment srp release flux in western and eastern lake basin while decreased in central lake basin fig 10 the annual mean sediment p release flux at station 1 increased by 11 9 43 6 and 76 1 from the baseline condition value 0 11 mg m 2 d 1 after different proportions of external loads reduction fig 9e overall the proportion of external loads reduction was significantly negatively correlated with decreasing srp and tp concentrations in the water column but was positively correlated with the sediment p release flux fig 11 3 5 2 temperature increase water temperature increases reduced srp concentrations in surface pore water at stations 1 and 5 in simulation day 99 and high temperature 1 5 possessed larger reduce effects fig 8a e subsequently the affected srp layers gradually increased to the total profile fig 8b d f h water temperature increases of 1 0 and 1 5 decreased the annual mean srp concentrations in the total profile by 1 4 and 2 2 respectively at both stations 1 and 5 higher temperature induced large diffusive coefficient at the interface promoted sediment srp diffusing to the overlying water and thereby decreased srp concentration in the pore water the decreased srp concentrations in pore water were negative correlated with water temperature increase data not shown water temperature increases clearly increased tp and srp concentrations in the water column fig 9a d which could be attributed to the simulated growth of aquatic plants and biological mineralization at higher temperature specifically tp concentrations in the water column increased less than srp after the water temperature increase water temperature increases of 1 0 and 1 5 at stations 1 and 5 clearly increased water srp concentrations by 6 8 10 3 and 3 9 5 7 respectively for tp increases were 2 3 3 6 and 0 9 1 3 respectively similar to the load reduction scenarios increased water srp and tp concentrations in the western lake basin were higher than in the eastern lake basin fig 10 water temperature increases improved the mean sediment srp release flux during winter and spring and decreased it during summer and autumn fig 9e f the annual mean sediment srp release flux declined by 10 7 and 32 6 at station 1 and increased by 2 1 and 1 6 at station 5 after respective water temperature increases of 1 0 and 1 5 3 5 3 mechanic of sediment srp release under different scenarios external loads reduction can significantly decrease srp concentrations in the water column simultaneously increasing srp concentration gradients at the interface and therefore increasing the sediment srp release flux table 6 this could partly mediate the effectiveness of water quality improvements after external loads reduction taking s1 loads reduction 10 as an example the decreased srp concentrations in lake water 6 6 were obviously lower compared to the reduction of external srp loads 10 previous studies found that water quality improvements lagged several decades after the implementation of external loads reduction doan et al 2018 schindler et al 2012 søndergaard et al 2013 it was also observed that the srp concentrations responded mostly to external loads reduction in summer and autumn fig 9 this was because most external loads were imported during summer and autumn fig s5 in addition srp concentration variability in the western lake basin reacted more quickly than the eastern lake basin fig 10 specifically the start date of the decrease of srp concentrations at station 5 75 d in eastern lake basin was approximately 25 days later than at station 1 50 d in western lake basin fig 9 this was because most large and heavily polluted input rivers are distributed in the western lake basin raised temperature simulated biological mineralization in both water and sediment and increased diffusion coefficient across the interface beutel and horne 2018 their joint effects changed the srp concentration gradient at the interface and therefore determined sediment srp flux in the present study temperature increases promoted sediment p release through increasing the diffusive coefficient temperature increase of 1 0 increased the mean sediment srp release flux by 1 8 table 6 which could be attributed to the positive effects of increased srp diffusion coefficient at higher temperature in contrast the increase proportion of mean sediment srp release flux dropped to 0 91 when air temperature was increased by 1 5 in this case the mineralization of organic matter may have produced higher srp concentrations in the water column compared to that in the pore water which led to a decline in the srp concentration gradient at the swi and therefore mediate the positive effects of sediment srp flux both kinds of scenarios will lead to the increase of sediment srp release while its impacts on lake water quality are on the contrary fig 10 and table 6 external loads reduction seemed to be an effective measure for improving tp and srp water quality which agreed with previous findings rucinski et al 2016 verhamme et al 2016 however this measure may have simultaneously increased sediment srp release flux especially in western and eastern lake basins fig 10 which in turn reduced restoration efficacy global warming will deteriorate water quality for tp and srp regardless of the changes in internal srp loading in previous studies sediment p release flux was typically obtained through laboratory incubation experiments the proposed model can be a useful tool to predict the sediment p flux in high spatial temporal scale and to assess the potential effectiveness of various strategies on water quality improvements and internal p loading 3 6 model limitations and research prospects although the coupled ecolake model performed well at most stations in both the sediment and the water column deviations did exist partly because it used constant parameter values at all locations this may not be an optimal choice for an ecosystem with complex bio geo chemical reactions and variable spatial temporal model parameters could potentially improve model performance for instance the model used uniform values for both r 1 and r 2 at different stations due to the lack of measurement data which may have resulted in deviations this was because organic matter in different lake regions may have had different sources e g allochthonous versus autochthonous which influenced particulate sizes and therefore affected their reactivities in the sediment the two parameters could be further determined both in laboratory and in situ experiment in addition a study conducted by huang et al 2016b in a shallow lake taihu found that a typical resuspension event could significantly increase sediment srp release flux therefore wind induced sediment resuspension is likely to dominate sediment srp release ideally resuspension of sediment detritus should be coupled with the sediment p transport model so that p adsorption and desorption processes are also included in the water column in this regard the coupled model requires more accurate bed bottom shear stress data lake current data and a very well calibrated resuspension rate which was beyond the scope of the available measurement data and the aim of this study future study may focus on the dynamic release of srp during sediment resuspension and including this process in the model furthermore there were no in situ sediment p release flux data with which to make direct comparisons most sediment p release flux data were measured in a laboratory and did not represent actual in situ physio chemical conditions resulting in uncertainty more systematic monitoring of sediment internal loading throughout the lake and at different times of the year to quantify this important flux will be needed ideally in addition to traditional sediment incubation method in laboratory in situ approaches such as the development of benthic chamber and ecological modelling found by jörgensen could be used simultaneously jörgensen and bendoricchio 1994 last spatial networks including the p interactions and features at the sediment and water interface may help real the mechanism corresponding to various strategies although the ecosystem structural dynamic model can simultaneously simulate parameter values in ecological network an effective method is lacking for analyzing the non linear relationship between parameters multiple non linear models such as convergent cross mapping and convertinoli and covertino 2021 and pcmci runge et al 2019 etc have been proven to be reliable methods to indicate the non linear parameter interactions thus theses non linear models could be coupled into ecolake to analyze the mechanism of p interactions at the interface in future work 4 conclusions in this study a dynamic sediment p model that coupled ecolake model was developed which considered sediment p cycling and its static release this coupled model should be generally applicable to a variety of lake conditions it was tested here to predict sediment p transport in lake chaohu and the effects of various operating strategies on sediment p release and p concentrations in the water column the main conclusions with respect to lake chaohu are as follows 1 the model was able to effectively describe the p dynamics both in the water column and lake sediments and provided a valid tool for evaluating the effects of lake operations on internal p release fluxes and p concentrations in the water column the degradable rate of rapidly degradable organic p v p 1 and adsorbed rate k a d are the most sensitive parameters influencing sediment p release flux 2 sediment p release fluxes were higher in heavily polluted lake basins western and eastern and during summer and autumn when temperature was warmer the relative contribution of internal srp loads amounted to 7 6 of the responding total external p inputs in the western lake basin and 2 7 and 4 8 in the central and eastern lake basins 3 the responses of sediment p flux and p concentrations in the water column varied spatial temporally between external loads reduction and water temperature increase strategies external p loads reduction increased sediment p flux through decreasing p concentrations in the water column the promoted effects on sediment p flux under higher temperature were the joint effects of increased biological mineralization and diffusion credit authorship contribution statement yanping wang conceptualization

24276,predicting dispersal and quantifying ecological connectivity are increasingly referenced as fundamental to understanding how biodiversity is structured across space and time dispersal models can provide insight but their predictions are influenced by our capacity to simulate the biology and physics known to influence dispersal in a marine context vertical swimming behaviour is considered important in influencing the spatial organisation of species across seascapes but the mechanisms underpinning these movements remain unresolved making it unclear how best to incorporate behaviour within models here using a 3 d hydrodynamic model coupled with a lagrangian particle tracker we show how different modelled larval behaviours alongside spatial and temporal hydrodynamic changes influence larval dispersal predictions additionally we compare the application of a novel approach of reverse engineered larval swimming behaviour against two commonly modelled behaviours passive dispersal and tidal vertical migration tvm we used statistical models lme and gam to test the effects of change in tidal state conditions season and planktonic larval duration in conjunction with behavioural parameters on dispersal for shorter plds i e 1 day we find that passive models match behaving model outputs but for longer plds excluding behaviour leads to overestimates of dispersal an effect that increases with time our results highlight the sensitivity of biophysical models to behavioural inputs specifically how vertical migration behaviour can significantly reduce dispersal distance especially for species with longer planktonic durations this study demonstrates the disproportionate effects that even a single behaviour vertical swimming can have on model predictions our understanding of ecosystem functioning and ultimately the ecological coherence of marine systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords larval dispersal larval behavior lagrangian modelling biophysical modelling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in marine systems the production and dispersal of planktonic life history stages creates connections fundamental to the spatial organisation of species across local and seascape scales baguette et al 2013 for a range of taxa blanco et al 2019 zeng et al 2019 increasingly ensuring ecological connectivity is promoted as one solution to biodiversity loss and considered a key feature of sustainable ecological networks gonzalez et al 2017 but assessment is often challenging especially when considering small planktonic organisms that are difficult to track predicting dispersal of planktonic organisms requires the use of genetics gilg and hilbish 2003 geochemical markers thorrold et al 2007 or increasingly biophysical models which combine hydrodynamics and biological processes see swearer et al 2019 for review to simulate movement these models are used for a range of theoretical and applied questions but their accuracy is reliant on our understanding of and ability to reproduce abiotic and biotic mechanisms that drive directed movement in nature biophysical models of larval dispersal can be implemented by adopting relatively simple advection diffusion models hill 1990 cowen et al 2000 or by combining a general ocean circulation model describing local hydrodynamics with an individual particle tracker to incorporate biological traits e g schlag and north 2012 paris et al 2013 in recent years advances in computational power and efficiency have allowed for circulation models to include greater spatial and or temporal resolution allowing complex velocity flow fields over intricate topography to be resolved due to this dispersal modelling using ocean circulation models has become the dominant method of larval dispersal research in order to capture realistic hydrodynamics as experienced by the larvae swearer et al 2019 however increasingly it is the parameterisation of biological traits or behaviours assigned to individual particles within the particle tracking component of the model that continues to attract research attention given the potential of those traits to influence model predictions hill 1990 cowen et al 2000 phelps et al 2015 daigle et al 2016 gary et al 2020 and decouple model predictions from patterns in nature marshall et al 2010 james et al 2019 biological parameterisation has previously relied heavily on the results of laboratory studies and current literature to infer traits and larval behaviours typically larval behaviours and behavioural triggers are parameterised using directly observed values from the laboratory e g robins et al 2013 phelps et al 2015 daigle et al 2016 bode et al 2019 gary et al 2020 for instance to quantify swimming speeds fisher and wilson 2004 chang et al 2018 it is argued however that laboratory derived swim speeds and behaviours are unlikely to represent realistic behaviours in nature due to an absence of one or more exogenous cues in those contrived contexts but which likely influence the expression of behaviour in natural settings e g bonar et al 1990 kingsford et al 2002 queiroga blanton 2005 morello and yund 2016 recent research has endeavoured to bridge the gap between individual larval ability and behavioural manifestation in nature by considering how realistic in situ swimming speeds can best be incorporated within dispersal models james et al 2019 leis 2020 these studies have shown that laboratory derived behaviours fail to accurately capture how larvae behave in the field and critically affect the vertical position of larvae which has repeatedly been shown to be an important mechanism for transport in a number of taxa e g garrison et al 1999 knights et al 2006 ospina alvarez et al 2018 indeed swearer et al 2019 suggest that behaviour should not be considered as an individual metric but instead as a product of its environment in any given space and at any given time given that biophysical models are increasingly being applied to fisheries management and marine conservation efforts effective decision making and confidence in those interventions requires accurate models botsford et al 2009 knights et al 2014 and a mismatch between modelled dispersal and realised ecological connectivity marshall et al 2010 james et al 2019 may undermine management and conservation efforts given behaviour may well be critical to this mismatch some suggest the omission of behaviour in its entirety may well be preferential to the inclusion of one or more inaccurate behaviours bode et al 2019 recreating the complexity of the natural environment identification of the cues used to govern when and where behaviour is expressed and assessment of the relative importance of each cue to the organism when multiple cues are present realistically cannot be captured in a laboratory setting studying larvae in their natural environment instead can provide insight for instance observed in situ change in vertical distribution profiles e g knights et al 2006 can be used in conjunction with a fine scale one dimensional ocean turbulence model e g brereton et al 2018 to reverse engineer larval behaviours and generate estimates of larval swimming speeds under variable environmental contexts that allow replication of observed vertical distribution patterns see james et al 2019 this study found that if models are to match in situ observations of vertical distribution profiles larvae must actively modify swimming behaviour in response to changes in tidal forcing conditions importantly this research showed that this swimming response would not be captured using a simple behavioural rule often implemented in models such as a tidal vertical migration tvm signature i e upward swimming during flood and downwards swimming during ebb or vice versa sensu forward et al 2003 kunze et al 2013 further james et al 2019 revealed a 2 5 fold differential in upward and downward swimming speeds suggesting differential response capacity to utilise vertically stratified horizontal advection for transport while james et al 2019 revealed previously undescribed idiosyncrasies in larval swimming over temporal scales ordinarily not considered the effect s of these nuanced behaviours on dispersal predictions have yet to be evaluated i e do they actually make a difference to dispersal predictions here we explore how this reverse engineered swimming behaviour affects larval dispersal estimates within a biophysical model framework and compare the output with those produced by a passive model i e without behaviour and a model implementing tvm behavioural rules 2 methods 2 1 the study area in situ vertical distribution data of mytilus spp collected in the southern irish sea described in knights et al 2006 were used to reverse engineer temporal changes in larval swimming behaviour over a tidal cycle described in james et al 2019 here we assess the effect of differential behavioural parameterisation on dispersal using an ocean circulation model coupled to a particle tracking module for the same irish sea region fig 1 water depths in this region are typically less than 100 m although depths can reach up to 150 m in the central channel and tidal flows typically oscillate in the north south direction the irish sea represents a typical semi enclosed tidally influenced coastal basin with dynamical length scales of 10 1000 km 2 2 the hydrodynamic model hydrodynamics in the study domain were simulated using the coastal ocean version 5 co5 o dea et al 2017 of the 7km atlantic margin model amm7 which uses the nemo madec et al 2016 ocean circulation model the nemo amm7 model was developed by the met office in collaboration with the national oceanography centre and has been extensively refined and validated against observations for the uk shelf seas region to be a good representation of the coastal ocean for the study region this model resolves prognostic variables velocity turbulence salinity temperature on a curvilinear orthogonal horizontal grid with a horizontal resolution of approximately 7 km and a vertical grid derived from 51 stretched σ levels with realistic gebco bathymetry madec et al 2016 o dea et al 2017 it includes atmospheric era interim tidal tpxo7 2 and open boundary orca0083 forcing providing realistic 3d current velocities the amm7 model domain encompasses the entire northwest european shelf region but here we focus on the irish sea subregion for which a suitable subdomain was selected the model was re run for a 6 month period from 1st april 2005 to 31st september 2005 to coincide with the timeframe of an in situ sampling programme undertaken by knights et al 2006 and hourly velocity fields were stored for the subdomain in order to capture the strong tidal flows present in the irish sea brown et al 2003 2 3 the particle tracking model particles were tracked using a version of the lagrangian transport model ltrans v 2 schlag and north 2012 in which larval behaviours can be governed by the tidal state see detailed explanation in the swimming behaviours subsection modified to work with nemo model output mayorga adame et al 2022 ltrans is an offline individual based particle tracking model that runs with the stored predictions of a 3d hydrodynamic model tracking the trajectories of particles in three dimensions based on advection diffusion and individual particle behaviours the model includes a 4th order runge kutta scheme for the advection of particles and a random walk scaled by the spatially and temporally variable vertical viscosity coefficient of the underlying hydrodynamic model to simulate vertical movement due to turbulence at sub grid scales visser et al 1997 ross and sharples 2004 this scheme solves for the u v and w current velocities representing the x y and z directions at the location of each particle using an iterative process that incorporates velocities at previous and future times to provide the most robust estimate of the trajectory of particle motion in water bodies with complex fronts and eddy fields such as the southern irish sea dippner 2004 preliminary convergence testing was undertaken to determine the appropriate number of particles to be released within the model this test following robins et al 2013 indicated that simulations with 10 000 particles were sufficient to capture variation within the population whilst maintaining computational efficiency 2 4 swimming behaviours larval behaviours can be specified within ltrans via the behaviour sub routine modifications were made to the behavioural sub routine to test two active swimming behaviours 1 applying a tidal vertical migration tvm whereby individuals are parameterised to swim up during the flood tide and down during the ebb tide at a fixed rate of 1 mms 1 in alignment with values in the literature e g chia et al 1984 sprung 1984 young 1995 and values used by other biophysical modelling studies focussing on bivalves e g robins et al 2013 daigle et al 2016 and 2 reverse engineered swimming behaviour rev in which virtual larvae were configured to swim at a random speed taken from a normal distribution profile fitted over the modelled predictive capability mpc for a range of swimming speeds for each tidal state james et al 2019 the mpc approach for calculating swimming speed is described in full in james et al 2019 approximations of best fit swimming speeds were identified for three of the four tidal states fig 2 top estimated swim speeds mm s 1 were 0 91 0 2 mid flood hw 0 74 0 07 mid ebb low water and 2 06 0 5 low water mid flood for the 3 h tidal period ranging from high water to mid ebb predictive capability of the mpc model was low during this stage of the tide particles were configured to swim downward at a fixed rate of 1 1mm s 1 which was the speed that achieved the closest match based on lowest total sum of squares error james et al 2019 both tvm and rev behavioural models were also compared against a passive model with no larval behaviour applied the nemo output was augmented with two additional gridded variables as functions of time hourly latitude and longitude these variables were 1 stateid which stored the current tidal state a mid flood to high water slack b high water slack to mid ebb c mid ebb to low water slack or d low water slack to mid flood see fig 2 and 2 tchange which stored the time in seconds of the state change if it occurs during the gridded hour period these variables were computed using the modelled sea surface height data every modelled hour ltrans was configured to read the variables stateid and tchange from the underlying hydrodynamic model the tchange variable was used so that if a change in the state occurred during the modelled hour larval behaviour changed at this point rather than at the next timestep to achieve this larval behaviour within the model was reconfigured at each internal timestep 30s in the case of the rev simulation the exact swimming speed of each individual particle was chosen randomly from a normal distribution around the best fit approximation allowing representation of behavioural stochasticity within the larval population this approach of quantifying the tidal state in space and time was chosen over simpler methods of determining the tidal state i e using tidal charts and a time counter within the model sensu daigle et al 2016 as at a single time point e g hour 1 the tidal state could be fundamentally different depending on its position within the study domain relative to an amphidromic point fig 2 bottom resulting in an incorrect behavioural response in both space and time 2 5 particle release and tracking the particle release location within the model was chosen to match the location of in situ sampling 52 2n 6 15w knights et al 2006 particles were released following observed proportional distribution patterns for each tidal state binned according to the vertical grid of the hydrodynamic model following the methodology of daigle et al 2016 and individual runs were undertaken for each starting profile correlating to the 4 identified tidal states runs simulating each of the three behavioural parameterisation approaches namely passive tidal vertical migration tvm and reverse engineered vertical migration rev were undertaken for spring april and summer july to account for potential differences in dispersal due to seasonal stratification and the frontal system that develops in the southern irish sea neill et al 2012 no difference in vertical distribution patterns of larvae with respect to tidal phase i e neap vs spring were identified in the field knights et al 2006 so phase was not considered here particles were released on the first spring tide following april 1st spring or july 1st summer particles were tracked for a duration of 28 days which is within the typical range for ciliated larvae siegel et al 2003 hartnett et al 2007 tian et al 2009 ltrans was configured to output the location lat lon and depth of each updated particle every 30 minutes output files were then processed in matlab v 2020a to calculate i radial distance travelled by the particle from its source to its end point and ii the cumulative distance travelled by the particle i e the total path length at 30 minute intervals 2 6 statistical analysis all analyses were undertaken in r r core team 2020 a linear mixed effects lme model in the r package

additive models gams were used to assess relationships between behaviour tidal state and season and their effect on radial distance and cumulative distance over a 28 day planktonic larval duration the gam modelling incorporated fitting a smooth function a thin plate regression spline to the timestep covariate days since release and followed a gamma distribution for each of the response variables

passive simulations travelling on average 79 km from source and 1359 km along their path respectively rev particles travelled significantly shorter distances travelling a mean radial distance of 33 7 km 2 3 shorter and a mean cumulative distance of 359 km 3 8 shorter notably mean radial distance of rev particles increased by only 1 6 km between 14 and 28 days with no significant difference in the radial distances between 14 and 21 days tukey s hsd p 0 329 in contrast tvm particles travelled 52 km 1 5 rev 1 5 passive after 28 days and a mean cumulative distance of 1024 km 2 9 rev 1 3 passive

particles from their source and 97 of the deviance in cumulative distance travelled by particles along their dispersal path tables 2 and 3 all incorporated covariates could significantly predict radial distance travelled from source table 2 results demonstrated that both radial distance and cumulative distance path length differed with respect to behavioural modelling approach and season although seasonal effects were only observed in passive model simulations and not in behavioural models fig 4 differences between dispersal depending on tidal state release point occurred only in the passive model with particles traveling greatest radial distances from source and shortest cumulative path distances when released on the ebb tide fig 4b h estimates of mean time point for a shift in central tendency of the time series indicated significant differences in the point of change for each behaviour season interaction combination fig 5 passive particles released in the spring were the latest to shift occurring at 15 59 0 57 days and 1 7 days later than in the summer 13 91 0 73 days shifts in the tvm model occurred at 14 92 days 0 15 days and 14 42 days 0 25 days in spring and summer respectively rev particles exhibited a shift in central tendency after just 9 68 days 0 17 days in spring but unlike the passive and tvm models showed an increase to 10 27 days 0 29 days in summer 3 3 density kernels probability density functions comparison of dispersal kernels revealed differences between the modelling approaches that increased in magnitude over time differences in dispersal distance between behaviors were small when larval duration was 1 day tvm particles travelled 1 8 km farther from source than rev particles and 1 7 km farther from source than passive particles and the median distance travelled by tvm particles 5 3 km was 1 4 km and 1 5 km greater than rev and passive particles respectively after 7 days median dispersal distance of rev particles 23 km was significantly greater than that of passive or tvm models both 18 2 km after 14 days there was a small but significant difference pairwise moods median test p 0 001 in the median dispersal distance between rev 31 9 km and tvm particles 32 4 km interestingly rev particles showed markedly lower propagule dispersion sd 5 5 km in comparison to passive sd 16 9 km and tvm sd 9 6 km simulations fig 6 with 50 of the population within 4 3 km of the median in contrast to passive 13 1 km and tvm 12 9 km simulations rev particles became increasingly clustered over time unlike in passive and tvm experiments in which particles continued to undergo dispersion over time fig 6 after 28 days there were significant differences in median radial dispersal distance for all models rev particles travelled shortest distances median distance 32 9 km and 50 off the population were aggregated between 30 5 km and 35 3 km from source in contrast median dispersal distance was 46 4 km 41 further and 54 9 km 67 further and propagule dispersion 16 7 and 9 6 greater in passive and tvm simulations respectively 3 4 biogeography the modelling approach implemented led to markedly different biogeographic distributions of larvae both in terms of biogeographic spread and direction of travel fig 6 rev simulations suggested a net south westerly movement whereas the tvm model predicted a net northward movement over time passive simulations indicated a considerable effect of season on dispersal with particles travelling offshore in spring and both north and southwest in summer and with a change in central tendency of up to 217 km fig 8 there were strong positive correlations between behavioural models and seasons for short planktonic durations lasting up to 14 d in summer and just 7 d in spring fig 7 4 discussion the capacity of biophysical models to predict dispersal and allow spatial and temporal assessment of connectivity are currently at the forefront of larval dispersal research and central to on going management and conservation efforts yet understanding if when and how to parameterise the biological component of these models and the potential effects of inaccurate representation of biological traits on model predictions has remained a key challenge metaxas and saunders 2009 it is largely accepted that larval behaviour plays a key role in larval transport and wider ecological functioning but despite this recognised importance many dispersal models still assume passive dispersal see swearer et al 2019 for review there is clear recognition of the need to include behaviour in biophysical models e g garland et al 2002 phelps et al 2015 daigle et al 2016 mayorga adame et al 2017 bode et al 2019 james et al 2019 but how behaviour should be incorporated remains debatable here we highlight the sensitivity of model predictions to modification of just a single behaviour larval swimming that results in markedly different dispersal predictions it has long been recognised that small changes in the vertical position of a larva could greatly influence dispersal trajectory due to depth related differences in the magnitude and direction of the current pringle 2007 correll et al 2012 torres et al 2018 and that some organisms actively migrate in the vertical in order to take advantage of favourable currents i e selective tidal stream transport forward et al 2003 knights et al 2006 kunze et al 2013 peterio and shanks 2015 avoid predation i e diel vertical migration lampbert 1993 scheuerell and schindler 2003 gibson et al 2016 pinti and visser 2019 and access available food sources gibson et al 2016 however what remains uncertain is the extent to which a larva can manipulate its position in situ here we incorporated a state of art assessment of larval swimming behaviour rev based on statistical models of likelihood of match between model simulations and field derived observations of vertical distribution profiles after james et al 2019 an approach developed to address some of the limitations of laboratory observations of behaviour specifically their failure to capture real life interactions between larvae and their environment bowler and benton 2005 and subsequent expression of a behaviour as movement there is also mounting evidence that not all larvae are equal see toonen and pawlik 2001 marshall et al 2010 and nanninga and berumen 2014 for reviews with a high degree of intra specific variability the rev method of behavioural parameterisation developed in james et al 2019 inherently captures this intra population variation by stochastically assigning behaviours within the larval cohort based on a range of likely swimming speeds inferred from the field an approach previously advocated by fisken et al 2007 interestingly we demonstrate that even with inclusion of intra population variability in capacity to behave the dispersal of rev particles displayed the lowest variance and dispersal distances of all three model scenarios with particles travelling considerably shorter distances than passive or tvm equivalents on average 1000 km less than passive particles and 665 km less than tvm particles these results further reinforce the potential for active behaviours such as vertical migration knights et al 2006 to be an effective transport mechanism for even small relatively slow swimming organisms despite exposure to flow fields that are often orders of magnitude faster our results suggest that for organisms with short planktonic durations i e 1 day dispersal predictions are largely the same irrespective of the exclusion inclusion of behaviour suggesting that a passive dispersal model will provide comparable dispersal predictions to behaviourally complex models over time however we show that the incorporation of a behaviour and b differences in behaviour parameterisation become increasingly important james et al 2019 suggested that inaccurate parameterisation of behaviours would lead to additive errors in model predictions as a function of time here all model comparisons but especially that of rev vs tvm simulations reinforce this concern where after 14 days the rev modelling approach results in biogeographic stability and promotes localised retention irrespective of time whereas the tvm and passive models indicate continued dispersal away from source over time fig 3 4 1 cohort clustering implementation of the rev approach led to rapid early dispersal followed by high levels of clustering and short median dispersal distances from their source clustering of the larval cohort has ecological pros and cons it can provide advantages such as allowing organisms to evade predation and offer protection through a safety in numbers approach but may lead to increased mortality due to intraspecific competition for resources hixon and jones 2005 mortality was not considered here as its inclusion was beyond the scope of our objectives but it is a key factor to consider in estimating population dynamics from dispersal models treml et al 2015 and hence the design of connectivity informed conservation agendas should endeavour to include temporal and spatial species specific mortality rates carr et al 2017 4 2 biogeography the need for a 3d approach inspection of the tidal hydrogeography fig 2 illustrates spatial gradients in the timing of the tides and errors in particle placement manifested as differences in behavioural cue timing clearly then it is unsurprising that passive particles will have a different dispersive kernel when compared to tvm or rev that respond to the tides and which are not significantly different from one another there is also a notable difference between the seasons for the passive particles these particles which are not being vertically mixed remain at their initial depths on the other hand tvm and rev particles experience a degree of vertical homogenisation because of the particle behaviours in summer the stratification results in enhanced surface currents which persistently advect the surface cohort of passive particles southwards fig 1 in the spring the water column is more evenly mixed and so there is no surface intensification of the mean drift currents it is likely that specific details of the local hydrogeography lead to the tvm and rev particles being more retentive than passive particles and that differences in the spatial distribution of the dispersal clouds of rev and tvm particles were also the result of regionally dependent phenomena for example when tidal ellipses change direction with depth soulsby 1983 for examples in liverpool bay see polton et al 2011 fig 3 we might expect the particles that respond to tidal cues to be more dispersive as both ebb and flood could send the particles in the same direction spatial mapping of the dispersal clouds revealed a marked difference between the tvm and rev models not identified by the dispersal kernel specifically a net north easterly movement by tvm particles and a net south westerly movement of rev particles using a single non spatial resolved metric like radial dispersal distance in this instance failed to differentiate between the two behavioural models which without a spatial analysis as performed here would provide misleading information with respect to the size and or positioning of a spatial management intervention such as a marine protected area furthermore distance travelled from source was also an order of magnitude shorter than cumulative distance travelled path length irrespective of behaviour and timing of release we therefore strongly advocate for the use of a lagrangian approach for predicting dispersal that couples local circulation models with individual based models cowen et al 2006 rochette et al 2012 over other simplified approaches that apply mean estimates of dispersal distance lockwood et al 2002 sala et al 2002 white et al 2010 or distance speed time calculations shanks et al 2003 shanks 2009 4 3 implications despite the importance of dispersal to the ecological and evolutionary success of marine organisms our results highlight our limited understanding of the role of behaviour in dispersal predictions and the need to integrate in situ and modelled data more effectively dispersal is a key consideration in estimates of population connectivity and models continue to play a critical theoretical and applied role in science today whether being used to design marine protected areas mpas gaines et al 2003 2010 almany et al 2009 kaplan et al 2009 costello et al 2010 krueck et al 2017 ross et al 2017 identify pathways of invasion viard et al 2006 kitchens et al 2017 or understand metapopulation dynamics and biogeography sanvicente añorve et al 2018 we consider models to be an invaluable tool in these endeavours but the results here highlight the disproportionate effects that even a single behaviour larval swimming can have on model predictions our understanding of ecosystem functioning and ultimately the ecological coherence of marine systems jonsson et al 2020 although the question of which behavioural modelling approach is best still remains the results of our rev model are in broad alignment with the findings of other studies woodson and mcmanus 2007 shanks 2009 sundelöf jonsson 2011 and reinforces our thinking that 1 active larval behaviour does serve as a mechanism to reduce larval dispersal 2 coastal marine systems and even physically dynamic systems like the irish sea can be relatively closed sensu cowen et al 2000 and 3 mpas and other coherent networks may need to be closer together to ensure coherence our results suggest that management decisions made on incorrect behavioural assumptions in dispersal models may overestimate the connectivity between local populations in contention with the suggestions of costello and connor 2019 and manel et al 2019 who argue that the spatial scale of marine connectivity is underestimated leading to a false sense of security in the ecological coherence of protected networks although further work is needed we suggest that in the meantime best estimates of dispersal and specifically biogeography requires i use of a lagrangian particle tracking approach coupled with localised circulation models and ii empirical data of vertical distribution profiles that allow estimation of larval swimming speeds likely to occur in situ to be resolved and their subsequent application in model simulations 5 conclusion dispersal models play a critical role in theoretical and applied science and remain invaluable tools contributing to our understanding and management of sustainable ecological networks the work undertaken in this study provides a novel framework that describes i implementation of field derived descriptors of larval behaviours in a dispersal model and ii comparative analysis of such behaviours against other methods of behavioural parameterisation in these models to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to use field data both to inform larval behaviour in a dispersal model and to seed the behaving particles at the same location as the field study bridging the gap between models and nature and providing a unique insight into how the manifestation of larval behaviour in situ may influence dispersal the methodologies and analytical techniques designed in this study can be applied to any species with a planktonic dispersal phase in any location and provide an important step towards improving the biological realism of

24276,predicting dispersal and quantifying ecological connectivity are increasingly referenced as fundamental to understanding how biodiversity is structured across space and time dispersal models can provide insight but their predictions are influenced by our capacity to simulate the biology and physics known to influence dispersal in a marine context vertical swimming behaviour is considered important in influencing the spatial organisation of species across seascapes but the mechanisms underpinning these movements remain unresolved making it unclear how best to incorporate behaviour within models here using a 3 d hydrodynamic model coupled with a lagrangian particle tracker we show how different modelled larval behaviours alongside spatial and temporal hydrodynamic changes influence larval dispersal predictions additionally we compare the application of a novel approach of reverse engineered larval swimming behaviour against two commonly modelled behaviours passive dispersal and tidal vertical migration tvm we used statistical models lme and gam to test the effects of change in tidal state conditions season and planktonic larval duration in conjunction with behavioural parameters on dispersal for shorter plds i e 1 day we find that passive models match behaving model outputs but for longer plds excluding behaviour leads to overestimates of dispersal an effect that increases with time our results highlight the sensitivity of biophysical models to behavioural inputs specifically how vertical migration behaviour can significantly reduce dispersal distance especially for species with longer planktonic durations this study demonstrates the disproportionate effects that even a single behaviour vertical swimming can have on model predictions our

connections fundamental to the spatial organisation of species across local and seascape scales baguette et al 2013 for a range of taxa blanco et al 2019 zeng et al 2019 increasingly ensuring ecological connectivity is promoted as one solution to biodiversity loss and considered a key feature of sustainable ecological networks gonzalez et al 2017 but assessment is often challenging especially when considering small planktonic organisms that are difficult to track predicting dispersal of planktonic organisms requires the use of genetics gilg and hilbish 2003 geochemical markers thorrold et al 2007 or increasingly biophysical models which combine hydrodynamics and biological processes see swearer et al 2019 for review to simulate movement these models are used for a range of theoretical and applied questions but their accuracy is reliant on our understanding of and ability to reproduce abiotic and biotic mechanisms that drive directed movement in nature biophysical models of larval dispersal can be implemented by adopting relatively simple advection diffusion models hill 1990 cowen et al 2000 or by combining a general ocean circulation model describing local hydrodynamics with an individual particle tracker to incorporate biological traits e g schlag and north 2012 paris et al 2013 in recent years advances in computational power and efficiency have allowed for circulation models to include greater spatial and or temporal resolution allowing complex velocity flow fields over intricate topography to be resolved due to this dispersal modelling using ocean circulation models has become the dominant method of larval dispersal research in order to capture realistic hydrodynamics as experienced by the larvae swearer et al 2019 however increasingly it is the parameterisation of biological traits or behaviours assigned to individual particles within the particle tracking component of the model that continues to attract research attention given the potential of those traits to influence model predictions hill 1990 cowen et al 2000 phelps et al 2015 daigle et al 2016 gary et al 2020 and decouple model predictions from patterns in nature marshall et al 2010 james et al 2019 biological parameterisation has previously relied heavily on the results of laboratory studies and current literature to infer traits and larval behaviours typically larval behaviours and behavioural triggers are parameterised using directly observed values from the laboratory e g robins et al 2013 phelps et al 2015 daigle et al 2016 bode et al 2019 gary et al 2020 for instance to quantify swimming speeds fisher and wilson 2004 chang et al 2018 it is argued however that laboratory derived swim speeds and behaviours are unlikely to represent realistic behaviours in nature due to an absence of one or more exogenous cues in those contrived contexts but which likely influence the expression of behaviour in natural settings e g bonar et al 1990 kingsford et al 2002 queiroga blanton 2005 morello and yund 2016 recent research has endeavoured to bridge the gap between individual larval ability and behavioural manifestation in nature by considering how realistic in situ swimming speeds can best be incorporated within dispersal models james et al 2019 leis 2020 these studies have shown that laboratory derived behaviours fail to accurately capture how larvae behave in the field and critically affect the vertical position of larvae which has repeatedly been shown to be an important mechanism for transport in a number of taxa e g garrison et al 1999 knights et al 2006 ospina alvarez et al 2018 indeed swearer et al 2019 suggest that behaviour should not be considered as an individual metric but instead as a product of its environment in any given space and at any given time given that biophysical models are increasingly being applied to fisheries management and marine conservation efforts effective decision making and confidence in those interventions requires accurate models botsford et al 2009 knights et al 2014 and a mismatch between modelled dispersal and realised ecological connectivity marshall et al 2010 james et al 2019 may undermine management and conservation efforts given behaviour may well be critical to this mismatch some suggest the omission of behaviour in its entirety may well be preferential to the inclusion of one or more inaccurate behaviours bode et al 2019 recreating the complexity of the natural environment identification of the cues used to govern when and where behaviour is expressed and assessment of the relative importance of each cue to the organism when multiple cues are present realistically cannot be captured in a laboratory setting studying larvae in their natural environment instead can provide insight for instance observed in situ change in vertical distribution profiles e g knights et al 2006 can be used in conjunction with a fine scale one dimensional ocean turbulence model e g brereton et al 2018 to reverse engineer larval behaviours and generate estimates of larval swimming speeds under variable environmental contexts that allow replication of observed vertical distribution patterns see james et al 2019 this study found that if models are to match in situ observations of vertical distribution profiles larvae must actively modify swimming behaviour in response to changes in tidal forcing conditions importantly this research showed that this swimming response would not be captured using a simple behavioural rule often implemented in models such as a tidal vertical migration tvm signature i e upward swimming during flood and downwards swimming during ebb or vice versa sensu forward et al 2003 kunze et al 2013 further james et al 2019 revealed a 2 5 fold differential in upward and downward swimming speeds suggesting differential response capacity to utilise vertically stratified horizontal advection for transport while james et al 2019 revealed previously undescribed idiosyncrasies in larval swimming over temporal scales ordinarily not considered the effect s of these nuanced behaviours on dispersal predictions have yet to be evaluated i e do they actually make a difference to dispersal predictions here we explore how this reverse engineered swimming behaviour affects larval dispersal estimates within a biophysical model framework and compare the output with those produced by a passive model i e without behaviour and a model implementing tvm behavioural rules 2 methods 2 1 the study area in situ vertical distribution data of mytilus spp collected in the southern irish sea described in knights et al 2006 were used to reverse engineer temporal changes in larval swimming behaviour over a tidal cycle described in james et al 2019 here we assess the effect of differential behavioural parameterisation on dispersal using an ocean circulation model coupled to a particle tracking module for the same irish sea region fig 1 water depths in this region are typically less than 100 m although depths can reach up to 150 m in the central channel and tidal flows typically oscillate in the north south direction the irish sea represents a typical semi enclosed tidally influenced coastal basin with dynamical length scales of 10 1000 km 2 2 the hydrodynamic model hydrodynamics in the study domain were simulated using the coastal ocean version 5 co5 o dea et al 2017 of the 7km atlantic margin model amm7 which uses the nemo madec et al 2016 ocean circulation model the nemo amm7 model was developed by the met office in collaboration with the national oceanography centre and has been extensively refined and validated against observations for the uk shelf seas region to be a good representation of the coastal ocean for the study region this model resolves prognostic variables velocity turbulence salinity temperature on a curvilinear orthogonal horizontal grid with a horizontal resolution of approximately 7 km and a vertical grid derived from 51 stretched σ levels with realistic gebco bathymetry madec et al 2016 o dea et al 2017 it includes atmospheric era interim tidal tpxo7 2 and open boundary orca0083 forcing providing realistic 3d current velocities the amm7 model domain encompasses the entire northwest european shelf region but here we focus on the irish sea subregion for which a suitable subdomain was selected the model was re run for a 6 month period from 1st april 2005 to 31st september 2005 to coincide with the timeframe of an in situ sampling programme undertaken by knights et al 2006 and hourly velocity fields were stored for the subdomain in order to capture the strong tidal flows present in the irish sea brown et al 2003 2 3 the particle tracking model particles were tracked using a version of the lagrangian transport model ltrans v 2 schlag and north 2012 in which larval behaviours can be governed by the tidal state see detailed explanation in the swimming behaviours subsection modified to work with nemo model output mayorga adame et al 2022 ltrans is an offline individual based particle tracking model that runs with the stored predictions of a 3d hydrodynamic model tracking the trajectories of particles in three dimensions based on advection diffusion and individual particle behaviours the model includes a 4th order runge kutta scheme for the advection of particles and a random walk scaled by the spatially and temporally variable vertical viscosity coefficient of the underlying hydrodynamic model to simulate vertical movement due to turbulence at sub grid scales visser et al 1997 ross and sharples 2004 this scheme solves for the u v and w current velocities representing the x y and z directions at the location of each particle using an iterative process that incorporates velocities at previous and future times to provide the most robust estimate of the trajectory of particle motion in water bodies with complex fronts and eddy fields such as the southern irish sea dippner 2004 preliminary convergence testing was undertaken to determine the appropriate number of particles to be released within the model this test following robins et al 2013 indicated that simulations with 10 000 particles were sufficient to capture variation within the population whilst maintaining computational efficiency 2 4 swimming behaviours larval behaviours can be specified within ltrans via the behaviour sub routine modifications were made to the behavioural sub routine to test two active swimming behaviours 1 applying a tidal vertical migration tvm whereby individuals are parameterised to swim up during the flood tide and down during the ebb tide at a fixed rate of 1 mms 1 in alignment with values in the literature e g chia et al 1984 sprung 1984 young 1995 and values used by other biophysical modelling studies focussing on bivalves e g robins et al 2013 daigle et al 2016 and 2 reverse engineered swimming behaviour rev in which virtual larvae were configured to swim at a random speed taken from a normal distribution profile fitted over the modelled predictive capability mpc for a range of swimming speeds for each tidal state james et al 2019 the mpc approach for calculating swimming speed is described in full in james et al 2019 approximations of best fit swimming speeds were identified for three of the four tidal states fig 2 top estimated swim speeds mm s 1 were 0 91 0 2 mid flood hw 0 74 0 07 mid ebb low water and 2 06 0 5 low water mid flood for the 3 h tidal period ranging from high water to mid ebb predictive capability of the mpc model was low during this stage of the tide particles were configured to swim downward at a fixed rate of 1 1mm s 1 which was the speed that achieved the closest match based on lowest total sum of squares error james et al 2019 both tvm and rev behavioural models were also compared against a passive model with no larval behaviour applied the nemo output was augmented with two additional gridded variables as functions of time hourly latitude and longitude these variables were 1 stateid which stored the current tidal state a mid flood to high water slack b high water slack to mid ebb c mid ebb to low water slack or d low water slack to mid flood see fig 2 and 2 tchange which stored the time in seconds of the state change if it occurs during the gridded hour period these variables were computed using the modelled sea surface height data every modelled hour ltrans was configured to read the variables stateid and tchange from the underlying hydrodynamic model the tchange variable was used so that if a change in the state occurred during the modelled hour larval behaviour changed at this point rather than at the next timestep to achieve this larval behaviour within the model was reconfigured at each internal timestep 30s in the case of the rev simulation the exact swimming speed of each individual particle was chosen randomly from a normal distribution around the best fit approximation allowing representation of behavioural stochasticity within the larval population this approach of quantifying the tidal state in space and time was chosen over simpler methods of determining the tidal state i e using tidal charts and a time counter within the model sensu daigle et al 2016 as at a single time point e g hour 1 the tidal state could be fundamentally different depending on its position within the study domain relative to an amphidromic point fig 2 bottom resulting in an incorrect behavioural response in both space and time 2 5 particle release and tracking the particle release location within the model was chosen to match the location of in situ sampling 52 2n 6 15w knights et al 2006 particles were released following observed proportional distribution patterns for each tidal state binned according to the vertical grid of the hydrodynamic model following the methodology of daigle et al 2016 and individual runs were undertaken for each starting profile correlating to the 4 identified tidal states runs simulating each of the three behavioural parameterisation approaches namely passive tidal vertical migration tvm and reverse engineered vertical migration rev were undertaken for spring april and summer july to account for potential differences in dispersal due to seasonal stratification and the frontal system that develops in the southern irish sea neill et al 2012 no difference in vertical distribution patterns of larvae with respect to tidal phase i e neap vs spring were identified in the field knights et al 2006 so phase was not considered here particles were released on the first spring tide following april 1st spring or july 1st summer particles were tracked for a duration of 28 days which is within the typical range for ciliated larvae siegel et al 2003 hartnett et al 2007 tian et al 2009 ltrans was configured to output the location lat lon and depth of each updated particle every 30 minutes output files were then processed in matlab v 2020a to calculate i radial distance travelled by the particle from its source to its end point and ii the cumulative distance travelled by the particle i e the total path length at 30 minute intervals 2 6 statistical analysis all analyses were undertaken in r r core team 2020 a linear mixed effects lme model in the r package

although seasonal effects were only observed in passive model simulations and not in behavioural models fig 4 differences between dispersal depending on tidal state release point occurred only in the passive model with particles traveling greatest radial distances from source and shortest cumulative path distances when released on the ebb tide fig 4b h estimates of mean time point for a shift in central tendency of the time series indicated significant differences in the point of change for each behaviour season interaction combination fig 5 passive particles released in the spring were the latest to shift occurring at 15 59 0 57 days and 1 7 days later than in the summer 13 91 0 73 days shifts in the tvm model occurred at 14 92 days 0 15 days and 14 42 days 0 25 days in spring and summer respectively rev particles exhibited a shift in central tendency after just 9 68 days 0 17 days in spring but unlike the passive and tvm models showed an increase to 10 27 days 0 29 days in summer 3 3 density kernels probability density functions comparison of dispersal kernels revealed differences between the modelling approaches that increased in magnitude over time differences in dispersal distance between behaviors were small when larval duration was 1 day tvm particles travelled 1 8 km farther from source than rev particles and 1 7 km farther from source than passive particles and the median distance travelled by tvm particles 5 3 km was 1 4 km and 1 5 km greater than rev and passive particles respectively after 7 days median dispersal distance of rev particles 23 km was significantly greater than that of passive or tvm models both 18 2 km after 14 days there was a small but significant difference pairwise moods median test p 0 001 in the median dispersal distance between rev 31 9 km and tvm particles 32 4 km interestingly rev particles showed markedly lower propagule dispersion sd 5 5 km in comparison to passive sd 16 9 km and tvm sd 9 6 km simulations fig 6 with 50 of the population within 4 3 km of the median in contrast to passive 13 1 km and tvm 12 9 km simulations rev particles became increasingly clustered over time unlike in passive and tvm experiments in which particles continued to undergo dispersion over time fig 6 after 28 days there were significant differences in median radial dispersal distance for all models rev particles travelled shortest distances median distance 32 9 km and 50 off the population were aggregated between 30 5 km and 35 3 km from source in contrast median dispersal distance was 46 4 km 41 further and 54 9 km 67 further and propagule dispersion 16 7 and 9 6 greater in passive and tvm simulations respectively 3 4 biogeography the modelling approach implemented led to markedly different biogeographic distributions of larvae both in terms of biogeographic spread and direction of travel fig 6 rev simulations suggested a net south westerly movement whereas the tvm model predicted a net northward movement over time passive simulations indicated a considerable effect of season on dispersal with particles travelling offshore in spring and both north and southwest in summer and with a change in central tendency of up to 217 km fig 8 there were strong positive correlations between behavioural models and seasons for short planktonic durations lasting up to 14 d in summer and just 7 d in spring fig 7 4 discussion the capacity of biophysical models to predict dispersal and allow spatial and temporal assessment of connectivity are currently at the forefront of larval dispersal research and central to on going management and conservation efforts yet understanding if when and how to parameterise the biological component of these models and the potential effects of inaccurate representation of biological traits on model predictions has remained a key challenge metaxas and saunders 2009 it is largely accepted that larval behaviour plays a key role in larval transport and wider ecological functioning but despite this recognised importance many dispersal models still assume passive dispersal see swearer et al 2019 for review there is clear recognition of the need to include behaviour in biophysical models e g garland et al 2002 phelps et al 2015 daigle et al 2016 mayorga adame et al 2017 bode et al 2019 james et al 2019 but how behaviour should be incorporated remains debatable here we highlight the sensitivity of model predictions to modification of just a single behaviour larval swimming that results in markedly different dispersal predictions it has long been recognised that small changes in the vertical position of a larva could greatly influence dispersal trajectory due to depth related differences in the magnitude and direction of the current pringle 2007 correll et al 2012 torres et al 2018 and that some organisms actively migrate in the vertical in order to take advantage of favourable currents i e selective tidal stream transport forward et al 2003 knights et al 2006 kunze et al 2013 peterio and shanks 2015 avoid predation i e diel vertical migration lampbert 1993 scheuerell and schindler 2003 gibson et al 2016 pinti and visser 2019 and access available food sources gibson et al 2016 however what remains uncertain is the extent to which a larva can manipulate its position in situ here we incorporated a state of art assessment of larval swimming behaviour rev based on statistical models of likelihood of match between model simulations and field derived observations of vertical distribution profiles after james et al 2019 an approach developed to address some of the limitations of laboratory observations of behaviour specifically their failure to capture real life interactions between larvae and their environment bowler and benton 2005 and subsequent expression of a behaviour as movement there is also mounting evidence that not all larvae are equal see toonen and pawlik 2001 marshall et al 2010 and nanninga and berumen 2014 for reviews with a high degree of intra specific variability the rev method of behavioural parameterisation developed in james et al 2019 inherently captures this intra population variation by stochastically assigning behaviours within the larval cohort based on a range of likely swimming speeds inferred from the field an approach previously advocated by fisken et al 2007 interestingly we demonstrate that even with inclusion of intra population variability in capacity to behave the dispersal of rev particles displayed the lowest variance and dispersal distances of all three model scenarios with particles travelling considerably shorter distances than passive or tvm equivalents on average 1000 km less than passive particles and 665 km less than tvm particles these results further reinforce the potential for active behaviours such as vertical migration knights et al 2006 to be an effective transport mechanism for even small relatively slow swimming organisms despite exposure to flow fields that are often orders of magnitude faster our results suggest that for organisms with short planktonic durations i e 1 day dispersal predictions are largely the same irrespective of the exclusion inclusion of behaviour suggesting that a passive dispersal model will provide comparable dispersal predictions to behaviourally complex models over time however we show that the incorporation of a behaviour and b differences in behaviour parameterisation become increasingly important james et al 2019 suggested that inaccurate parameterisation of behaviours would lead to additive errors in model predictions as a function of time here all model comparisons but especially that of rev vs tvm simulations reinforce this concern where after 14 days the rev modelling approach results in biogeographic stability and promotes localised retention irrespective of time whereas the tvm and passive models indicate continued dispersal away from source over time fig 3 4 1 cohort clustering implementation of the rev approach led to rapid early dispersal followed by high levels of clustering and short median dispersal distances from their source clustering of the larval cohort has ecological pros and cons it can provide advantages such as allowing organisms to evade predation and offer protection through a safety in numbers approach but may lead to increased mortality due to intraspecific competition for resources hixon and jones 2005 mortality was not considered here as its inclusion was beyond the scope of our objectives but it is a key factor to consider in estimating population dynamics from dispersal models treml et al 2015 and hence the design of connectivity informed conservation agendas should endeavour to include temporal and spatial species specific mortality rates carr et al 2017 4 2 biogeography the need for a 3d approach inspection of the tidal hydrogeography fig 2 illustrates spatial gradients in the timing of the tides and errors in particle placement manifested as differences in behavioural cue timing clearly then it is unsurprising that passive particles will have a different dispersive kernel when compared to tvm or rev that respond to the tides and which are not significantly different from one another there is also a notable difference between the seasons for the passive particles these particles which are not being vertically mixed remain at their initial depths on the other hand tvm and rev particles experience a degree of vertical homogenisation because of the particle behaviours in summer the stratification results in enhanced surface currents which persistently advect the surface cohort of passive particles southwards fig 1 in the spring the water column is more evenly mixed and so there is no surface intensification of the mean drift currents it is likely that specific details of the local hydrogeography lead to the tvm and rev particles being more retentive than passive particles and that differences in the spatial distribution of the dispersal clouds of rev and tvm particles were also the result of regionally dependent phenomena for example when tidal ellipses change direction with depth soulsby 1983 for examples in liverpool bay see polton et al 2011 fig 3 we might expect the particles that respond to tidal cues to be more dispersive as both ebb and flood could send the particles in the same direction spatial mapping of the dispersal clouds revealed a marked difference between the tvm and rev models not identified by the dispersal kernel specifically a net north easterly movement by tvm particles and a net south westerly movement of rev particles using a single non spatial resolved metric like radial dispersal distance in this instance failed to differentiate between the two behavioural models which without a spatial analysis as performed here would provide misleading information with respect to the size and or positioning of a spatial management intervention such as a marine protected area furthermore distance travelled from source was also an order of magnitude shorter than cumulative distance travelled path length irrespective of behaviour and timing of release we therefore strongly advocate for the use of a lagrangian approach for predicting dispersal that couples local circulation models with individual based models cowen et al 2006 rochette et al 2012 over other simplified approaches that apply mean estimates of dispersal distance lockwood et al 2002 sala et al 2002 white et al 2010 or distance speed time calculations shanks et al 2003 shanks 2009 4 3 implications despite the importance of dispersal to the ecological and evolutionary success of marine organisms our results highlight our limited understanding of the role of behaviour in dispersal predictions and the need to integrate in situ and modelled data more effectively dispersal is a key consideration in estimates of population connectivity and models continue to play a critical theoretical and applied role in science today whether being used to design marine protected areas mpas gaines et al 2003 2010 almany et al 2009 kaplan et al 2009 costello et al 2010 krueck et al 2017 ross et al 2017 identify pathways of invasion viard et al 2006 kitchens et al 2017 or understand metapopulation dynamics and biogeography sanvicente añorve et al 2018 we consider models to be an invaluable tool in these endeavours but the results here highlight the disproportionate effects that even a single behaviour larval swimming can have on model predictions our understanding of ecosystem functioning and ultimately the ecological coherence of marine systems jonsson et al 2020 although the question of which behavioural modelling approach is best still remains the results of our rev model are in broad alignment with the findings of other studies woodson and mcmanus 2007 shanks 2009 sundelöf jonsson 2011 and reinforces our thinking that 1 active larval behaviour does serve as a mechanism to reduce larval dispersal 2 coastal marine systems and even physically dynamic systems like the irish sea can be relatively closed sensu cowen et al 2000 and 3 mpas and other coherent networks may need to be closer together to ensure coherence our results suggest that management decisions made on incorrect behavioural assumptions in dispersal models may overestimate the connectivity between local populations in contention with the suggestions of costello and connor 2019 and manel et al 2019 who argue that the spatial scale of marine connectivity is underestimated leading to a false sense of security in the ecological coherence of protected networks although further work is needed we suggest that in the meantime best estimates of dispersal and specifically biogeography requires i use of a lagrangian particle tracking approach coupled with localised circulation models and ii empirical data of vertical distribution profiles that allow estimation of larval swimming speeds likely to occur in situ to be resolved and their subsequent application in model simulations 5 conclusion dispersal models play a critical role in theoretical and applied science and remain invaluable tools contributing to our understanding and management of sustainable ecological networks the work undertaken in this study provides a novel framework that describes i implementation of field derived descriptors of larval behaviours in a dispersal model and ii comparative analysis of such behaviours against other methods of behavioural parameterisation in these models to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to use field data both to inform larval behaviour in a dispersal model and to seed the behaving particles at the same location as the field study bridging the gap between models and nature and providing a unique insight into how the manifestation of larval behaviour in situ may influence dispersal the methodologies and analytical techniques designed in this study can be applied to any species with a planktonic dispersal phase in any location and provide an important step towards improving the biological realism of

24277,a comprehensive undertanding of land use change processes and their future trajectories is essential for the development of land use management plans required for conservation of ecological resources in east africa however there is still limited information on historical current and future land cover change trends within the vulnerable watersheds in such data constrained areas a few studies have adapted spatial models employing historical land cover change trends derived from satellite remote sensing to provide the requisite landscape metrics for ecological modelling and management in this study the ensemble conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent clue s model was used to model potential land use cover change trajectories in the transboundary sio malaba malakisi watershed of kenya and uganda historical change trends were obtained from consistently classified land cover datasets the model parameters which included climatic biophysical and human factors were estimated from physical datasets in a geographical information system gis two scenarios that represented options for agricultural expansion scenarion i and land reclamation scenarion ii were investigated for the period between 2027 and 2047 to support ongoing regional inititiaves towards ecological resource conservation and watershed management across the transboundary region from the results scenario i indicated an increase in the cropland area by 24 covering approximately 62 of the whole basin area by 2047 a scenario ii indicated a 30 increase in forest cover indicating an improvement in forest recovery and restoration of ecosystem area the results obtained can be used to support baseline studies on the management of the transboundary region with varied country management options keywords land use change modeling transboundary catchment east africa sio malaba malakisi catchment clue s model scenario analyses data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction land use changes are universal earth processes of global importance and environmental change research cegielska et al 2018 duveiller et al 2020 this is largely because changes in land use are often dynamic and pervese at localised scales but collectively affect the sustainability and proper functioning of atmospheric and land surface processes across the globe lambin et al 2001 midekisa et al 2017 song et al 2018 in most developing countries the effects of land use change are today manifesting through accelerated rates of soil erosion duveiller et al 2020 schürz et al 2020 habitat and biodiversity loss ban et al 2015 du and huang 2017 liu et al 2020 and alteration of hydrological regimes guzha et al 2018 mati et al 2008 olang et al 2014 consequently several initiatives aimed at coordinating conservation and management of the affected ecosystems have been established at global levels to support comprehensive understanding of the land use change processes their trends and future trajectories requisite for the conservation and sustainable utilization of ecological resources the convention on biological diversity chandra and idrisova 2011 for instance aims at promoting sustainable utilization of biodiversity while the kyoto protocol böhringer 2003 and unfccc kuyper et al 2018 aim at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change respectively in east africa such initiatives include the nile basin initiative khorbotly 2003 and the mt elgon regional ecosystem conservation programme batvik et al 2002 both aiming at ensuring efficient land and water resource conservation together with equitable and optimal use of existing resources of the region however due to the existence of disparate national legal frameworks on environmental management and conservation uitto and duda 2002 coupled with competing geopolitical interests and different national development priorities in the region consensus building on adopting a common environmental and resource management framework remains a challenge mcintyre and schechinger 2008 uitto and duda 2002 the situation is further complicated by a lack of consistent baseline data and limited studies detailing the space time alterations considering the subtle nature of the land use cover changes consequent of rural activities especially across affected transboundary regions mati et al 2008 in order to develop institutional structures for cooperation in transboundary watersheds effective land use policy framework based on a factual analysis of the prevailing problems of the basin is required mati et al 2008 uitto and duda 2002 this includes an assesment of the interactions between multiple drivers influencing land use changes at different scales as a basis for the identification of resource management priorities for the concerned regions guzha et al 2018 uitto and duda 2002 to this end unpacking and evaluating the complex interrelationships between the biophysical and socio economic factors using empirical models that ingest earth observation data in combination with field measurements is inevitable to understand the existing land patterns behera and behera 2020 veldkamp and verburg 2004 in cases where long term sustainable land use management plans are required the historical and current land use states can then be used to estimate future land use trajectories using techniques that exptrapolate the historical trends based on the possible scenarios briassoulis 2019 verburg et al 2002b in the transboundary smm of kenya and uganda where rapid increases in human population are eminent a transboundary catchment management plan to support the ongoing regional land use policy framework is indispensable however efforts to develop such plans have been hampered by a lack of standardized policy frameworks across the two countries coupled with limited consistent baseline land cover data required to identify common priority areas for conservation management nonethelese the data scarcity challenge can today be surmounted through the integration of freely available biophysical and topographical global datasets consequent of advances in satellite remote sensing congalton and green 2008 yu et al 2015 with support of spatial ecological models the global spatial datasets can be used to improve our understanding of the land use change dynamics in such areas providing opportunities for planning and management guzha et al 2018 f zhang et al 2017 generally ecological models help create abstractions and approximation of reality through simplification of complex ecological processes briassoulis 2019 schmolke et al 2010 land use change models provide a means to disentangle and explore complex and dynamic spatio temporal relationships between lulc and its potential driving factors briassoulis 2019 verburg et al 2004 thereby supporting in the design of spatial policies luo et al 2010 to date several models have been developed across the globe to enhance our understanding of the complex linkages and feedbacks between land use changes and potential driving factors chaudhuri and clarke 2013 van soesbergen and macarthur foundation 2016 these models can be classified as spatially explicit or agent based verburg et al 2004 cellular automata models empirical and hybrid integrated models verburg et al 2004 spatially explicit models operate both at local and regional scales by allocating land use types on the basis of biophysical and socio economic properties agarwal et al 2002 chaudhuri and clarke 2013 agent based models on the other hand focus on the underlying decision process behind lulc changes driven by demand and supply factors and their net affect on land use allocation decisions veldkamp and verburg 2004 ultimately the predictive ability of a land use model would normally be assessed by comparing simulation results against the actual land use map in cases where datasets are available van vliet 2013 verburg et al 2004 the conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent clue s model is one of the most widely used modeling tools developed to spatially allocate land use changes for purposes of visualizing the impacts of different scenarios on land use patterns given a set of potential driving factors verburg and overmars 2009 the model uses a wide range of biophysical and human drivers influencing lulc at different spatio temporal scales providing a dynamic modeling framework agarwal et al 2002 briassoulis 2019 the model has consequently been utilized in various studies i e simulating spatial dynamics of wetlands under different scenarios peng et al 2020 soil erosion investigations zare et al 2017 environmental and land cover change dynamics behera and behera 2020 kucsicsa et al 2019 mohammady et al 2018 urban studies huang et al 2019 jiang et al 2015 and land cover change simulation judex and menz 2006 tizora et al 2018 unlike other spatially explicit models clue s is capable of simuteneously simulating multiple land use types by explicitly addressing competition between land use types verburg et al 2002a in this study therefore we applied clue s to simulate future land cover patterns in smm catchment using physical datasets derived with support of a geographical information system judex and menz 2006 verburg et al 2005 future scenarios that represented options for increased agriculture consequent of the population increases or improved land conservations were investigated to provide baseline informtion towards the development of a transboundary and integrted land use management plan that promotes sustainable development and secures livelihoods of the people in the catchment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in transboundary sio malaba malakisi catchment area located in the border region between kenya and uganda fig 1 covering approximately 5 200 km2 with geographical extents between longitudes 33042 11 e and 34033 14 e and latitudes 0013 07 n and 1007 59 n the upper reaches of the catchment form the headwaters of rivers malakisi malaba and sio that flow southwards towards lake victoria the altitude ranges between approximately 1 100 4 200m above sea level the study area experiences a bimodal rainfall pattern alemayehu et al 2017 with a mean annual rainfall of approximately 1500 2000mm reed and clokie 2000 wanyama et al 2020 characterized by a period of long rains march to may and short rains october to december ongoma et al 2018 this coincides with the passage of north south south north intertropical convergence zone itcz camberlin and okoola 2003 yang et al 2015 vegetation distribution is influenced by altitude and is comprised of montane forest bushland and grassland communities reed and clokie 2000 the rich volcanic soils support the cultivation of various crops i e maize soy beans sorghum millet rice peanuts vegetables coffee sugarcane cotton etc plate 1 data obtained from both uganda and kenya bureau of statistics estimates the population density at 192 persons km 2 with the high concentration around the border towns of busia and malaba this population occupies potential arable land of more than 60 of the total basin area thereby exerting pressure on the limited land resource as a transboundary water catchment area the smm experiences many challenges such as severe soil erosion siltation and sedimentation of major rivers plate 1 unregulated land use activities and fragmentation and destruction of critical habitats due to lack of a common catchment management plan and hence practical land use policy framework between countries that share the catchment area it is envisaged that further destruction of the basin could precipitate an environmental catastrophe further risking livelihoods of communities eking a living from the rural agricultural activities consequently this study proposes to employ baseline data on trends to enhance knowledge on the land use change dynamics to support establishment of a framework for transboundary catchment management 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 socio economic and spatial datasets in order to calibrate the model and analyze future potential land cover patterns in the area we acquired and analyzed other datasets that comprise key potential driving factors for lulc change in the catchment topographical information of the study area was derived from a digital elevation model dem developed by the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm yang et al 2011 the dem available at a spatial resolution of 90m was processed in a gis to derive altitude slope and aspect parameters required by the model liu et al 2021 f zhang et al 2017 a summary of the biophysical socioeconomic and spatial datasets collated and used to derive the model parameters are summarized in table 1 the spatial datasets acquired were projected wgs 1984 utm zone 36n and resampled were et al 2013 to the same pixel resolution 250m and subsequently converted to ascii format verburg et al 2005 covering the study extent datasets for proximity to roads rivers and major towns were prepared by calculating the euclidean distance 1km buffer to enable the spatial allocation of land use in the model based on proximity h zhang et al 2017 2 2 2 historical land cover datasets historical land use cover maps were obtained from consistently classified land cover remote sensing datasets chasia et al 2021 the maps were prepared from raw landsat satellite data based on a hybrid image classification approach supported by rigorous ground truthing exercise carried out within the context of the capnex project 1 1 capacity building on the water energy food security nexus through research and training in kenya and uganda capnex funded by the austrian government through the appear of the austrian development cooperation https appear at en completed project websites project158 capnex in may july 2017 the maps depicting nine dominant lulc classes found in the study area table 2 were available for the period between 1986 and 2017 for this study the 2008 land use map was used for purposes of defining land requirements and the setting the initial lulc state required during clue s model testing the 2017 land use map on the other hand was used to validate the results of simulating historical land changes and allocating scenarios when modeling future lulc state kucsicsa et al 2019 2 3 study scenarios for the basin 2 3 1 scenario i agricultural expansion this scenario explored possible land use configuration patterns and trajectories given favorable prevailing climatic conditions i e annual average precipitation rates of between 1 500 2 000mm and access to subsidized inorganic fertilizer usd 20 30 capable of sustaining low input agricultural systems with no fallow periods in this case a 0 40 annual increase in cropland was projected using trend extrapolation verburg et al 2002b and thus 0 37 and 0 03 of open fields and permanent wetlands respectively were converted to cropland this expansion however would not spread to zones of ecological importance and nature conservation i e natural forest which are protected by government policy and existing laws consequently pixels representing these geographical areas were constrained in the model from converting to other cover classes in this scenario also built up areas were projected to increase annually by less than 1 following historical trends open water and barren land classes remained unchanged during the modelling period due to their high elasticity values table 3 2 3 2 scenario ii land reclamation in this scenario areas covered by mixed forest class were expected to increase annually by 0 62 through various programs aimed at reducing deforestation and forest degradation this could be achieved through afforestation and agroforestry programs such as plantation establishment and livelihood improvement scheme pelis witcomb and dorward 2009 and the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc redd 2 2 a climate change mitigation approach by unfccc designed to incentivize developing countries reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation program this is aimed at guaranteeing food production while enhancing forest regeneration which helps in reducing the rate of land degradation and soil erosion in this scenario therefore 0 39 of open land was converted to mixed forest class we assumed the open land has been fallow for morethan five years to allow forest regrowth further increase in tree growth was projected along riparian zones and less than 0 10 on agricultural land it was also assumed that population growth rate would remain stable over the modelling period following historical trends 2 5 and that proposed soil conservation and watershed management programs would be embraced and implemented by the communities living in smm catchment 2 4 the clue s model application 2 4 1 description of the model the conversion of land use and its effects at small regions extent clue s modelling framework verburg et al 2000 is a spatially explicit model developed to simulate land use change by analyzing empirical relations between land use and potential driving factors including biophysical and human factors using multivariate statistical techniques i e logistic regression verburg et al 2002a structurally clue s is composed of a non spatial demand module for calculating cumulative area change in lulc and a spatially explicit allocation module used for allocating projected demands in land cover to cell grids based on factors such as location characteristics land use transition sequences and demand verburg 2010 verburg et al 2002a application of the model requires selection of driving factors configuration of land use conversion settings and identification of suitable locations and spatial distribution probability the above steps as applied in the study are outlined below 2 4 2 selection of driving factors a stepwise logistic regression model was used to develop empirical model relationships among the potential driving factors of land cover and lulc patterns in smm catchment sohl et al 2012 the classified 2017 land use map chasia et al 2021 served as the dependent variable while independent variables in the multivariate analysis include climatic demographic physical soil properties and topographic data driving factors with the greatest influence on the distribution of lulc pattern were determined using a logistic regression model eq 1 at 0 05 significant level greenland et al 2016 the occurrence of land use type y was predicted using twelve predictors in a logistic regression model denoted as x 1 x 2 and x k 1 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b k x k ε where ŷ is the dependent variable occurrence of lulc class b 0 is a constant term representing the y intercept b 1 b 2 and b k are slope coefficients for the explanatory variables x 1 x 2 and x k respectively the random error component is denoted as ε driving factors with p values p 0 05 were considered to be statistically significant in explaining the dependent variable in order to meaningfully interpret regression coefficients and ensure stability of the regression model a multicollinear analysis was conducted for all the selected driving factors to identify and eliminate independent variables with collinearity which may reduce observed differences of individual variables in the model michetti 2012 here a new regression model was created for each independent variable leaving out the original dependent variable and replacing it with one of the independent variables in eq 2 therefore multicollinearity for variable x 1 against variables b 1 and b k was determined by regression equation 2 x 1 b 2 x 2 b k x k a where x 1 is a chosen independent variable i e altitude from eq 1 modeled against the other eleven independent variables in the study denoted as x 2 and x k finally the presence of multicollinearity in the dataset was detected by calculating the tolerance value using the variance inflation factor vif eq 3 which measures the degree in which variance is inflated using the coefficient of determination r 1 2 daoud 2018 3 v i f 1 1 r i 2 values with a vif greater than 10 vif 10 were considered critical therefore indicating presence of severe multicollinearity among variables in the data daoud 2018 2 4 3 configuration of land use conversion settings during the simulation land use types were allowed to change from one state to another based on their elasticity value elasticity usually defines the ease with which a given lulc type could be converted to another type verburg et al 2004 verburg and overmars 2007 land use types with high capital investment or irreversible impact on the environment were allocated higher elasticity values and therefore not allowed to easily change to other cover types verburg et al 2002a table 3 illustrates the elasticity values assigned to lulc classes based on local knowledge and land use conversion trends in the study area generally areas with permanent cover type i e urban centers and protected areas like permanent forests and wetlands were assigned high elasticity values 0 7 0 9 which constrained them from easily changing to other land use types cropland and open land on the other hand were assigned lower elasticity values 0 0 4 following observed interactions and historical trends between the two classes 2 4 4 location suitability and spatial distribution probability generally land use conversions normally occur at locations characterized by suitable conditions capable of supporting a given lulc type luo et al 2010 the preference of a location r k i devoted to location i is normally an empirical estimation of biophysical and socio economic characteristics x 1 and x 2 of the location i and the relative impact a k and b k of these characteristics on the preferred land use type k verburg et al 2005 4 r k i a k x 1 i b k x 2 i however since the preferred location r k i can neither be observed nor measured directly judex and menz 2006 verburg et al 2002b it is calculated as a probability p i of a grid cell for the occurrence of the considered land use type on location i which relates biophysical and socio economic location characteristics x 1 x 2 and x n using a logit model 5 l o g p i 1 p i β 0 β 1 x 1 i β 2 x 2 i β n x n i the coefficients β 1 β 2 and β n were estimated with a logistic regression model by applying the actual 2017 land use map as the dependent variable while β 0 represents the y intercept gil pontius jr and schneider 2001 verburg et al 2005 2 5 modelling framework adopted the clue s model was used to simulate observed historical land use patterns in smm catchment using key model parameters i e land use type specific conversion settings which define the temporal dynamics of land use simulations land use requirements constraining the simulation by defining total required change in land use and the location characteristics van vliet 2013 a methodological framework adopted for this study is provided in fig 2 for a given scenario the clue s model produces annual lulc change maps from 2017 to 2047 at 250m spatial resolution sohl et al 2012 each scenario was investigated for periods 2027 2037 and 2047 this is largely because studies have shown that analysis of long term changes usually provoke land use changes with significant hydrological impacts in the basin mati et al 2008 olang et al 2011 in this study while testing the model the 2008 land use map represented the initial land use cover status for year 0 t1 while 2017 land use map represented the end of the simulation period t2 the final land use map from model simulation was compared to the actual classified 2017 land use map chasia et al 2021 in order to assess model performance during the simulation conversion elasticities for all lulc classes were initially set to 0 1 which allowed conversions in all the land cover classes thereafter elasticity values were adjusted based on the observed optical elasticity value for each land use class the final simulated land use map was validated using the kappa simulation k simulation method van vliet 2013 the k simulation is an extension of kappa gil pontius jr and schneider 2001 which evaluates the agreement between simulated land use transitions and the actual land use transitions by randomly allocating class transitions relative to the initial map k simulation values normally range from 1 to 1 van vliet 2013 where 1 denotes a perfect agreement while scores below 0 indicate less accurate class transitions as compared to scores from a random allocation of class transitions van vliet 2013 this was done by cross tabulating each class in the simulated map against the actual classified 2017 land use map of the study area in order to determine the accuracy of the results done by measuring the degree of agreement used 3 results 3 1 influence of land use cover change driving factors a logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the importance of potential lulc driving factors in influencing occurrence and spatial distribution of land use cover classes in the study area and the results of which are summarized in table 4 the main drivers of land use change considered for this study are present in fig 3 the drivers represented as spatial layers in a gis were converted to a text format which is readable in a statistical software package they represented the predictor variable in a regression model against all land use classes which acted as the dependent variable the coefficients for the topographic parameters in the regression equation displayed a positive correlation between vegetation and general topography in the catchment however when correlated against altitude built up areas recorded a negative correlation variables representing prevailing climatic conditions on the other hand produced a positive correlation across all land cover classes considered table 4 proximity variables didn t have any noticeable influence on the distribution all land cover classes except for limited influence on built up areas soil properties recorded a positive correlation against all vegetation classes however ph and cec were negatively correlated with mixed forest and cropland classes respectively population density was analyzed to explore the effect of human settlement on forest condition and agricultural expansion and intensification as a result low coefficient values were recorded against mixed forest class and cropland areas high correlation values were only recorded against built up areas 3 1 1 multi collinearity analysis the study investigated collinearity within the dataset by fitting a linear model using eleven variables out of the total twelve against altitude as the predicted value an adjusted r2 of 0 68 and a p value p 2 2e 16 were obtained table 5 illustrates results from a multicollinearity analysis indicating the variance inflation factors vif when the variable altitude alt is correlated with all other driving factors in the regression equation the cec and soc factors recorded a moderate degree of collinearity against altitude factor however the score was still below vif threshold value considered significant i e 5 none of the driving factors recorded a vif collinearity score above the severe threshold of 10 against the independent variable altitude 3 2 evaluation of model accuracy results after performing several model runs elasticity values that provided the most reliable and optimal results were 1 0 0 9 0 7 0 8 0 2 0 3 1 0 1 0 and 0 1 for barren mixed forest open bushland permanent wetland cropland pasture built up water and open land dependent variables respectively during the simulation pixels representing barren and water land cover types remained static and therefore unchanged over the modeling period since they were not significantly affected by human activities during the performance of accuracy assessment simulation map s6 produced comparatively higher values for both ksimulation and kappa statistic table 6 illustrates scores obtained from using ksimulation and the kappa statistic methods during the validation process on average the model simulation produced ksimulation of 0 4 and a kappa statistic of 0 78 3 3 scenario prediction of land use cover dynamics for a given scenario the clue s model produced stacks of maps representing annual lulc change from 2017 to 2047 at 250m spatial resolution sohl et al 2012 the simulation results highlighting demand for land use cover under the two scenarios are highlighted in fig 4 in both scenarios water and barren land cover classes remained static due to the high elasticity values 0 9 and 1 0 respectively allocated for the classes in the model which prevented pixels representing these classes from converting to other classes 3 3 1 agricultural expansion scenario scenario i this scenario assumes an acceleration of agricultural expansion following observed historical trends and patterns in the catchment here an annual expansion of 0 8 of the initial total area was simulated in the model by 2047 cropland was projected to cumulatively increase by 24 to occupy 62 of the basin fig 5 this involved an annual conversion of approximately 1 7 and less than 1 of open land and permanent wetland respectively to cropland category 3 3 2 land reclamation scenario scenario ii in scenario two expansion of mixed forest class was expected to occupy areas under open land and limited cropland areas as a result mixed forest was projected to increase annually by 1 from the initial modeling period representing a 30 growth from the initial total area thus representing 8 of total basin area by 2047 this entailed conversion of approximately 80 of available and potential open land and less than 2 of available and cropland area the mean changes observed for each sub catchment in smm basin are illustrated in fig 6 in both scenarios i and ii overall more changes were recorded in the mpologoma sub catchment area located on the western flank of the study area while the least changes were recorded in the lwakhakha sub catchment area for scenario ii more tree density was concentrated in areas around busitema forest where from a previous land cover analysis chasia et al 2021 natural forest interspersed with open shrublands used to occupy the area mean changes in cropland cover in scenario i also followed the same trend observed in each sub basin larger sub basins experienced more changes however the intensity of these changes correlated with locations where biophysical factors had the greatest impact 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of driving factors we measured the influence of the driving factors on different lulc classes using a logistic regression model suitable for modelling categorical data sohl et al 2012 overall the influence of different potential drivers on the distribution of land cover classes varied across the study however when different drivers in a given cover type acted together their combined influence was observed at varying degrees as outlined in fig 7 in the cropland class category for instance altitude temperature precipitation and soil organic carbon variables were significant in explaining the spatial distribution of cropland with p values p 0 01 at 0 05 significant level the effect of precipitation and temperature variables in this research corresponds with a study done in east africa by hawinkel et al 2016 which highlighted the importance of weather on vegetation distribution and characteristics in the region the location of permanent wetlands on the other hand could be explained by altitude precipitation and cec factors producing significant p values of 2e 16 temperature produced p value of p 0 054 in all the lulc classes this could help in explaining the distribution of these classes the correlation between mixed forest class and population density in the regression model was consistent with results obtained in a similar catchment in west africa judex and menz 2006 in both cases population density was negatively correlated with mixed forest class in our study this could be attributed to the steep slope on the upper reaches of smm catchment offering a natural buffer against encroachment by neighboring farming communities in addition the forest is located in a protected area this unique condition was enforced in the model using high elasticity values that restricted conversion of forest land to other land use classes additionally slope and cec with p values of 0 046 and 0 002 respectively had an influence on open shrubland the study further observed that location of built up areas was influenced mainly by altitude temperature precipitation proximity to major roads and towns factors this distribution coincides with settlement patterns observed across the catchment during field surveys overall the occurrence of vegetation sub classes in the study could be partly explained by a combination of soil conditions cec soc ph altitude and prevailing climatic conditions precipitation and temperature however the degree of influence among the variables varied among different vegetation types further exogenous factors not included in the model i e use organic and inorganic fertilizers soil conservation practices and agro cultural traditions etc could also affect crop distribution 4 2 logistic regression model performance results from evaluating logistic regression model performance are illustrated in fig 8 in order to ensure model stability and eliminate highly correlated independent variables from the regression model we used the variance inflation factor statistic to detect presence of collinearity in the dataset we used altitude as the dependent variable in the equation to quantify degree of collinearity with all the other independent variables all the variables recorded a vif score of less than five which indicate they were not highly correlated 4 3 assessment of calibration and validation of clue s model the clue s model was calibrated by adjusting parameters of potential driving factors for land cover change in the study area against the existing 2008 land cover map at t1 after several model runs the model output at t2 2017 was compared to the existing land cover map for the same year elasticity values for different lulc classes were thereafter assigned based on the model s ability to replicate reality visual assessment of the model s output was also conducted to compare the two maps and evaluate model s performance the quality of the calibration was assessed using the ksimulation method which accounts for change in lulc and avoids inflating simulation results where little change has occurred van vliet 2013 on average the model produced a ksimulation score of 0 4 which indicated the model was able to replicate change in lulc 40 of the time conversely the kappa statistic score of 0 78 indicated an overall 78 agreement in classification of land cover classes between the final model s output and the actual classified map 4 4 scenario analysis for smm catchment in scenario one it was postulated that in an environment with prevailing optimum weather conditions capable of supporting crop cultivation access to affordable farm inputs such as inorganic fertilizer and improvements in commodity prices for cash crops grown in the area the area under cropland was projected to increase further to occupy 62 of the total basin area these changes were expected especially in sub catchments situated on the upper reaches of smm basin i e sio lwakhakha and malakisi which are characterized by elevation of more than 2 500m rich volcanic soils and orographic rainfall the expansion of cropland was however constrained in the model to exclude critical ecological areas and protected land this was achieved by reducing conversion elasticity values of permanent wetlands and mixed forest class to 0 7 and 0 9 respectively section 2 4 3 table 3 while the constraints in the model increased the conversion cost limited reduction on permanent wetland cover was expected mainly in areas which are no longer covered by water overall areas under barren and permanent water land cover were allocated the maximum constraining elasticity value of 1 0 and thus remained static over the modelling period this is because barren areas were located in very high altitude zones in the catchment 4000mamsl an area mainly covered by rock outcrops on the other hand areas under permanent water were treated as critical aquatic habitats and thus protected from human activities scenario two explored possible future land cover patterns when afforestation programs are implemented across the catchment in order to mitigate against the negative impacts of soil erosion and land degradation here it was assumed that availability of land area suitable for tree growth coupled with other incentives would act as catalysts that promote the growth of both exotic and indigenous trees by local communities in addition areas which were previously under natural forest before being converted to cropland i e areas near busitema forest in uganda and the southern edges of mt elgon forest would be reclaimed back in this scenario therefore mixed forest class and open shrubland land cover areas were projected to increase significantly from 6 2 in 2017 to 8 1 in 2047 5 conclusion we examined future potential land use cover changes in a transboundary catchment of smm to achieve this goal we explored two scenarios scenario i analyzed agricultural expansion while scenario ii focused on reclamation using an ensemble land use maps and biophysical data in a spatially explicit clue s model initially we employed a logistic regression model to analysis potential biophysical and socio economic factors likely to influence spatial distribution and patterns of land use classes in the catchment and later used the information for calibrating clue s model in an agricultural expansion scenario cropland area increased by 12 from the modeling base year 2017 to cover 62 of the total basin area by the final modeling year 2047 this mainly involved annual conversion of open land cover by 1 7 to agricultural land in the reclamation scenario mixed forest class and open shrubland were projected to increase by 1 annually thus occupying 30 of the basin by 2047 generally land cover classes with high conversion costs such as barren land with rock outcrops open water and areas under permanent wetland unsuitable for crop growth remained unchanged during model simulation overall our results were consistent with observed patterns showing spatial distribution of vegetation classes across the catchment and corresponding driving factors such as weather patterns soil properties and topography which often determine the suitability of areas for cultivation and plant growth the outputs will be used to model soil erosion patterns in smm catchment as part of the capnex project being implemented in the area the findings are expected to provide insights into how future land use trajectories under different scenarios could affect soil erosion in a transboundary water catchment area and ecological stability the data could also support studies on earth system modeling and provide policy makers in the region with baseline data and information needed for developing practical soil conservation strategies funding this work was supported by the austrian

24277,a comprehensive undertanding of land use change processes and their future trajectories is essential for the development of land use management plans required for conservation of ecological resources in east africa however there is still limited information on historical current and future land cover change trends within the vulnerable watersheds in such data constrained areas a few studies have adapted spatial models employing historical land cover change trends derived from satellite remote sensing to provide the requisite landscape metrics for ecological modelling and management in this study the ensemble conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent clue s model was used to model potential land use cover change trajectories in the transboundary sio malaba malakisi watershed of kenya and uganda historical change trends were obtained from consistently classified land cover datasets the model parameters which included climatic biophysical and human factors were estimated from physical datasets in a geographical information system gis two scenarios that represented options for agricultural expansion scenarion i and land reclamation scenarion ii were investigated for the period between 2027 and 2047 to support ongoing regional inititiaves towards ecological resource conservation and watershed management across the transboundary region from the results scenario i indicated an increase in the cropland area by 24 covering approximately 62 of the whole basin area by 2047 a scenario ii indicated a 30 increase in forest cover indicating an improvement in forest recovery and restoration of ecosystem area the results obtained can be used to support baseline studies on the management of the transboundary region with varied country management options keywords land use change modeling transboundary catchment east africa sio malaba malakisi catchment clue s model scenario analyses data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction land use changes are universal earth processes of global importance and environmental change research cegielska et al 2018 duveiller et al 2020 this is largely because changes in land use are often dynamic and pervese at localised scales but collectively affect the sustainability and proper functioning of atmospheric and land surface processes across the globe lambin et al 2001 midekisa et al 2017 song et al 2018 in most developing countries the effects of land use change are today manifesting through accelerated rates of soil erosion duveiller et al 2020 schürz et al 2020 habitat and biodiversity loss ban et al 2015 du and huang 2017 liu et al 2020 and alteration of hydrological regimes guzha et al 2018 mati et al 2008 olang et al 2014 consequently several initiatives aimed at coordinating conservation and management of the affected ecosystems have been established at global levels to support comprehensive understanding of the land use change processes their trends and future trajectories requisite for the conservation and sustainable utilization of ecological resources the convention on biological diversity chandra and idrisova 2011 for instance aims at promoting sustainable utilization of biodiversity while the kyoto protocol böhringer 2003 and unfccc kuyper et al 2018 aim at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change respectively in east africa such initiatives include the nile basin initiative khorbotly 2003 and the mt elgon regional ecosystem conservation programme batvik et al 2002 both aiming at ensuring efficient land and water resource conservation together with equitable and optimal use of existing resources of the region however due to the existence of disparate national legal frameworks on environmental management and conservation uitto and duda 2002 coupled with competing geopolitical interests and different national development priorities in the region consensus building on adopting a common environmental and resource management framework remains a challenge mcintyre and schechinger 2008 uitto and duda 2002 the situation is further complicated by a lack of consistent baseline data and limited studies detailing the space time alterations considering the subtle nature of the land use cover changes consequent of rural activities especially across affected transboundary regions mati et al 2008 in order to develop institutional structures for cooperation in transboundary watersheds effective land use policy framework based on a factual analysis of the prevailing problems of the basin is required mati et al 2008 uitto and duda 2002 this includes an assesment of the interactions between multiple drivers influencing land use changes at different scales as a basis for the identification of resource management priorities for the concerned regions guzha et al 2018 uitto and duda 2002 to this end unpacking and evaluating the complex interrelationships between the biophysical and socio economic factors using empirical models that ingest earth observation data in combination with field measurements is inevitable to understand the existing land patterns behera and behera 2020 veldkamp and verburg 2004 in cases where long term sustainable land use management plans are required the historical and current land use states can then be used to estimate future land use trajectories using techniques that exptrapolate the historical trends based on the possible scenarios briassoulis 2019 verburg et al 2002b in the transboundary smm of kenya and uganda where rapid increases in human population are eminent a transboundary catchment management plan to support the ongoing regional land use policy framework is indispensable however efforts to develop such plans have been hampered by a lack of standardized policy frameworks across the two countries coupled with limited consistent baseline land cover data required to identify common priority areas for conservation management nonethelese the data scarcity challenge can today be surmounted through the integration of freely available biophysical and topographical global datasets consequent of advances in satellite remote sensing congalton and green 2008 yu et al 2015 with support of spatial ecological models the global spatial datasets can be used to improve our understanding of the land use change dynamics in such areas providing opportunities for planning and management guzha et al 2018 f zhang et al 2017 generally ecological models help create abstractions and approximation of reality through simplification of complex ecological processes briassoulis 2019 schmolke et al 2010 land use change models provide a means to disentangle and explore complex and dynamic spatio temporal relationships between lulc and its potential driving factors briassoulis 2019 verburg et al 2004 thereby supporting in the design of spatial policies luo et al 2010 to date several models have been developed across the globe to enhance our understanding of the complex linkages and feedbacks between land use changes and potential driving factors chaudhuri and clarke 2013 van soesbergen and macarthur foundation 2016 these models can be classified as spatially explicit or agent based verburg et al 2004 cellular automata models empirical and hybrid integrated models verburg et al 2004 spatially explicit models operate both at local and regional scales by allocating land use types on the basis of biophysical and socio economic properties agarwal et al 2002 chaudhuri and clarke 2013 agent based models on the other hand focus on the underlying decision process behind lulc changes driven by demand and supply factors and their net affect on land use allocation decisions veldkamp and verburg 2004 ultimately the predictive ability of a land use model would normally be assessed by comparing simulation results against the actual land use map in cases where datasets are available van vliet 2013 verburg et al 2004 the conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent clue s model is one of the most widely used modeling tools developed to spatially allocate land use changes for purposes of visualizing the impacts of different scenarios on land use patterns given a set of potential driving factors verburg and overmars 2009 the model uses a wide range of biophysical and human drivers influencing lulc at different spatio temporal scales providing a dynamic modeling framework agarwal et al 2002 briassoulis 2019 the model has consequently been utilized in various studies i e simulating spatial dynamics of wetlands under different scenarios peng et al 2020 soil erosion investigations zare et al 2017 environmental and land cover change dynamics behera and behera 2020 kucsicsa et al 2019 mohammady et al 2018 urban studies huang et al 2019 jiang et al 2015 and land cover change simulation judex and menz 2006 tizora et al 2018 unlike other spatially explicit models clue s is capable of simuteneously simulating multiple land use types by explicitly addressing competition between land use types verburg et al 2002a in this study therefore we applied clue s to simulate future land cover patterns in smm catchment using physical datasets derived with support of a geographical information system judex and menz 2006 verburg et al 2005 future scenarios that represented options for increased agriculture consequent of the population increases or improved land conservations were investigated to provide baseline informtion towards the development of a transboundary and integrted land use management plan that promotes sustainable development and secures livelihoods of the people in the catchment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in transboundary sio malaba malakisi catchment area located in the border region between kenya and uganda fig 1 covering approximately 5 200 km2 with geographical extents between longitudes 33042 11 e and 34033 14 e and latitudes 0013 07 n and 1007 59 n the upper reaches of the catchment form the headwaters of rivers malakisi malaba and sio that flow southwards towards lake victoria the altitude ranges between approximately 1 100 4 200m above sea level the study area experiences a bimodal rainfall pattern alemayehu et al 2017 with a mean annual rainfall of approximately 1500 2000mm reed and clokie 2000 wanyama et al 2020 characterized by a period of long rains march to may and short rains october to december ongoma et al 2018 this coincides with the passage of north south south north intertropical convergence zone itcz camberlin and okoola 2003 yang et al 2015 vegetation distribution is influenced by altitude and is comprised of montane forest bushland and grassland communities reed and clokie 2000 the rich volcanic soils support the cultivation of various crops i e maize soy beans sorghum millet rice peanuts vegetables coffee sugarcane cotton etc plate 1 data obtained from both uganda and kenya bureau of statistics estimates the population density at 192 persons km 2 with the high concentration around the border towns of busia and malaba this population occupies potential arable land of more than 60 of the total basin area thereby exerting pressure on the limited land resource as a transboundary water catchment area the smm experiences many challenges such as severe soil erosion siltation and sedimentation of major rivers plate 1 unregulated land use activities and fragmentation and destruction of critical habitats due to lack of a common catchment management plan and hence practical land use policy framework between countries that share the catchment area it is envisaged that further destruction of the basin could precipitate an environmental catastrophe further risking livelihoods of communities eking a living from the rural agricultural activities consequently this study proposes to employ baseline data on trends to enhance knowledge on the land use change dynamics to support establishment of a framework for transboundary catchment management 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 socio economic and spatial datasets in order to calibrate the model and analyze future potential land cover patterns in the area we acquired and analyzed other datasets that comprise key potential driving factors for lulc change in the catchment topographical information of the study area was derived from a digital elevation model dem developed by the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm yang et al 2011 the dem available at a spatial resolution of 90m was processed in a gis to derive altitude slope and aspect parameters required by the model liu et al 2021 f zhang et al 2017 a summary of the biophysical socioeconomic and spatial datasets collated and used to derive the model parameters are summarized in table 1 the spatial datasets acquired were projected wgs 1984 utm zone 36n and resampled were et al 2013 to the same pixel resolution 250m and subsequently converted to ascii format verburg et al 2005 covering the study extent datasets for proximity to roads rivers and major towns were prepared by calculating the euclidean distance 1km buffer to enable the spatial allocation of land use in the model based on proximity h zhang et al 2017 2 2 2 historical land cover datasets historical land use cover maps were obtained from consistently classified land cover remote sensing datasets chasia et al 2021 the maps were prepared from raw landsat satellite data based on a hybrid image classification approach supported by rigorous ground truthing exercise carried out within the context of the capnex project 1 1 capacity building on the water energy food security nexus through research and training in kenya and uganda capnex funded by the austrian government through the appear of the austrian development cooperation https appear at en completed project websites project158 capnex in may july 2017 the maps depicting nine dominant lulc classes found in the study area table 2 were available for the period between 1986 and 2017 for this study the 2008 land use map was used for purposes of defining land requirements and the setting the initial lulc state required during clue s model testing the 2017 land use map on the other hand was used to validate the results of simulating historical land changes and allocating scenarios when modeling future lulc state kucsicsa et al 2019 2 3 study scenarios for the basin 2 3 1 scenario i agricultural expansion this scenario explored possible land use configuration patterns and trajectories given favorable prevailing climatic conditions i e annual average precipitation rates of between 1 500 2 000mm and access to subsidized inorganic fertilizer usd 20 30 capable of sustaining low input agricultural systems with no fallow periods in this case a 0 40 annual increase in cropland was projected using trend extrapolation verburg et al 2002b and thus 0 37 and 0 03 of open fields and permanent wetlands respectively were converted to cropland this expansion however would not spread to zones of ecological importance and nature conservation i e natural forest which are protected by government policy and existing laws consequently pixels representing these geographical areas were constrained in the model from converting to other cover classes in this scenario also built up areas were projected to increase annually by less than 1 following historical trends open water and barren land classes remained unchanged during the modelling period due to their high elasticity values table 3 2 3 2 scenario ii land reclamation in this scenario areas covered by mixed forest class were expected to increase annually by 0 62 through various programs aimed at reducing deforestation and forest degradation this could be achieved through afforestation and agroforestry programs such as plantation establishment and livelihood improvement scheme pelis witcomb and dorward 2009 and the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc redd 2 2 a climate change mitigation approach by unfccc designed to incentivize developing countries reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation program this is aimed at guaranteeing food production while enhancing forest regeneration which helps in reducing the rate of land degradation and soil erosion in this scenario therefore 0 39 of open land was converted to mixed forest class we assumed the open land has been fallow for morethan five years to allow forest regrowth further increase in tree growth was projected along riparian zones and less than 0 10 on agricultural land it was also assumed that population growth rate would remain stable over the modelling period following historical trends 2 5 and that proposed soil conservation and watershed management programs would be embraced and implemented by the communities living in smm catchment 2 4 the clue s model application 2 4 1 description of the model the conversion of land use and its effects at small regions extent clue s modelling framework verburg et al 2000 is a spatially explicit model developed to simulate land use change by analyzing empirical relations between land use and potential driving factors including biophysical and human factors using multivariate statistical techniques i e logistic regression verburg et al 2002a structurally clue s is composed of a non spatial demand module for calculating cumulative area change in lulc and a spatially explicit allocation module used for allocating projected demands in land cover to cell grids based on factors such as location characteristics land use transition sequences and demand verburg 2010 verburg et al 2002a application of the model requires selection of driving factors configuration of land use conversion settings and identification of suitable locations and spatial distribution probability the above steps as applied in the study are outlined below 2 4 2 selection of driving factors a stepwise logistic regression model was used to develop empirical model relationships among the potential driving factors of land cover and lulc patterns in smm catchment sohl et al 2012 the classified 2017 land use map chasia et al 2021 served as the dependent variable while independent variables in the multivariate analysis include climatic demographic physical soil properties and topographic data driving factors with the greatest influence on the distribution of lulc pattern were determined using a logistic regression model eq 1 at 0 05 significant level greenland et al 2016 the occurrence of land use type y was predicted using twelve predictors in a logistic regression model denoted as x 1 x 2 and x k 1 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b k x k ε where ŷ is the dependent variable occurrence of lulc class b 0 is a constant term representing the y intercept b 1 b 2 and b k are slope coefficients for the explanatory variables x 1 x 2 and x k respectively the random error component is denoted as ε driving factors with p values p 0 05 were considered to be statistically significant in explaining the dependent variable in order to meaningfully interpret regression coefficients and ensure stability of the regression model a multicollinear analysis was conducted for all the selected driving factors to identify and eliminate independent variables with collinearity which may reduce observed differences of individual variables in the model michetti 2012 here a new regression model was created for each independent variable leaving out the original dependent variable and replacing it with one of the independent variables in eq 2 therefore multicollinearity for variable x 1 against variables b 1 and b k was determined by regression equation 2 x 1 b 2 x 2 b k x k a where x 1 is a chosen independent variable i e altitude from eq 1 modeled against the other eleven independent variables in the study denoted as x 2 and x k finally the presence of multicollinearity in the dataset was detected by calculating the tolerance value using the variance inflation factor vif eq 3 which measures the degree in which variance is inflated using the coefficient of determination r 1 2 daoud 2018 3 v i f 1 1 r i 2 values with a vif greater than 10 vif 10 were considered critical therefore indicating presence of severe multicollinearity among variables in the data daoud 2018 2 4 3 configuration of land use conversion settings during the simulation land use types were allowed to change from one state to another based on their elasticity value elasticity usually defines the ease with which a given lulc type could be converted to another type verburg et al 2004 verburg and overmars 2007 land use types with high capital investment or irreversible impact on the environment were allocated higher elasticity values and therefore not allowed to easily change to other cover types verburg et al 2002a table 3 illustrates the elasticity values assigned to lulc classes based on local knowledge and land use conversion trends in the study area generally areas with permanent cover type i e urban centers and protected areas like permanent forests and wetlands were assigned high elasticity values 0 7 0 9 which constrained them from easily changing to other land use types cropland and open land on the other hand were assigned lower elasticity values 0 0 4 following observed interactions and historical trends between the two classes 2 4 4 location suitability and spatial distribution probability generally land use conversions normally occur at locations characterized by suitable conditions capable of supporting a given lulc type luo et al 2010 the preference of a location r k i devoted to location i is normally an empirical estimation of biophysical and socio economic characteristics x 1 and x 2 of the location i and the relative impact a k and b k of these characteristics on the preferred land use type k verburg et al 2005 4 r k i a k x 1 i b k x 2 i however since the preferred location r k i can neither be observed nor measured directly judex and menz 2006 verburg et al 2002b it is calculated as a probability p i of a grid cell for the occurrence of the considered land use type on location i which relates biophysical and socio economic location characteristics x 1 x 2 and x n using a logit model 5 l o g p i 1 p i β 0 β 1 x 1 i β 2 x 2 i β n x n i the coefficients β 1 β 2 and β n were estimated with a logistic regression model by applying the actual 2017 land use map as the dependent variable while β 0 represents the y intercept gil pontius jr and schneider 2001 verburg et al 2005 2 5 modelling framework adopted the clue s model was used to simulate observed historical land use patterns in smm catchment using key model parameters i e land use type specific conversion settings which define the temporal dynamics of land use simulations land use requirements constraining the simulation by defining total required change in land use and the location characteristics van vliet 2013 a methodological framework adopted for this study is provided in fig 2 for a given scenario the clue s model produces annual lulc change maps from 2017 to 2047 at 250m spatial resolution sohl et al 2012 each scenario was investigated for periods 2027 2037 and 2047 this is largely because studies have shown that analysis of long term changes usually provoke land use changes with significant hydrological impacts in the basin mati et al 2008 olang et al 2011 in this study while testing the model the 2008 land use map represented the initial land use cover status for year 0 t1 while 2017 land use map represented the end of the simulation period t2 the final land use map from model simulation was compared to the actual classified 2017 land use map chasia et al 2021 in order to assess model performance during the simulation conversion elasticities for all lulc classes were initially set to 0 1 which allowed conversions in all the land cover classes thereafter elasticity values were adjusted based on the observed optical elasticity value for each land use class the final simulated land use map was validated using the kappa simulation k simulation method van vliet 2013 the k simulation is an extension of kappa gil pontius jr and schneider 2001 which evaluates the agreement between simulated land use transitions and the actual land use transitions by randomly allocating class transitions relative to the initial map k simulation values normally range from 1 to 1 van vliet 2013 where 1 denotes a perfect agreement while scores below 0 indicate less accurate class transitions as compared to scores from a random allocation of class transitions van vliet 2013 this was done by cross tabulating each class in the simulated map against the actual classified 2017 land use map of the study area in order to determine the accuracy of the results done by measuring the degree of agreement used 3 results 3 1 influence of land use cover change driving factors a logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the importance of potential lulc driving factors in influencing occurrence and spatial distribution of land use cover classes in the study area and the results of which are summarized in table 4 the main drivers of land use change considered for this study are present in fig 3 the drivers represented as spatial layers in a gis were converted to a text format which is readable in a statistical software package they represented the predictor variable in a regression model against all land use classes which acted as the dependent variable the coefficients for the topographic parameters in the regression equation displayed a positive correlation between vegetation and general topography in the catchment however when correlated against altitude built up areas recorded a negative correlation variables representing prevailing climatic conditions on the other hand produced a positive correlation across all land cover classes considered table 4 proximity variables didn t have any noticeable influence on the distribution all land cover classes except for limited influence on built up areas soil properties recorded a positive correlation against all vegetation classes however ph and cec were negatively correlated with mixed forest and cropland classes respectively population density was analyzed to explore the effect of human settlement on forest condition and agricultural expansion and intensification as a result low coefficient values were recorded against mixed forest class and cropland areas high correlation values were only recorded against built up areas 3 1 1 multi collinearity analysis the study investigated collinearity within the dataset by fitting a linear model using eleven variables out of the total twelve against altitude as the predicted value an adjusted r2 of 0 68 and a p value p 2 2e 16 were obtained table 5 illustrates results from a multicollinearity analysis indicating the variance inflation factors vif when the variable altitude alt is correlated with all other driving factors in the regression equation the cec and soc factors recorded a moderate degree of collinearity against altitude factor however the score was still below vif threshold value considered significant i e 5 none of the driving factors recorded a vif collinearity score above the severe threshold of 10 against the independent variable altitude 3 2 evaluation of model accuracy results after performing several model runs elasticity values that provided the most reliable and optimal results were 1 0 0 9 0 7 0 8 0 2 0 3 1 0 1 0 and 0 1 for barren mixed forest open bushland permanent wetland cropland pasture built up water and open land dependent variables respectively during the simulation pixels representing barren and water land cover types remained static and therefore unchanged over the modeling period since they were not significantly affected by human activities during the performance of accuracy assessment simulation map s6 produced comparatively higher values for both ksimulation and kappa statistic table 6 illustrates scores obtained from using ksimulation and the kappa statistic methods during the validation process on average the model simulation produced ksimulation of 0 4 and a kappa statistic of 0 78 3 3 scenario prediction of land use cover dynamics for a given scenario the clue s model produced stacks of maps representing annual lulc change from 2017 to 2047 at 250m spatial resolution sohl et al 2012 the simulation results highlighting demand for land use cover under the two scenarios are highlighted in fig 4 in both scenarios water and barren land cover classes remained static due to the high elasticity values 0 9 and 1 0 respectively allocated for the classes in the model which prevented pixels representing these classes from converting to other classes 3 3 1 agricultural expansion scenario scenario i this scenario assumes an acceleration of agricultural expansion following observed historical trends and patterns in the catchment here an annual expansion of 0 8 of the initial total area was simulated in the model by 2047 cropland was projected to cumulatively increase by 24 to occupy 62 of the basin fig 5 this involved an annual conversion of approximately 1 7 and less than 1 of open land and permanent wetland respectively to cropland category 3 3 2 land reclamation scenario scenario ii in scenario two expansion of mixed forest class was expected to occupy areas under open land and limited cropland areas as a result mixed forest was projected to increase annually by 1 from the initial modeling period representing a 30 growth from the initial total area thus representing 8 of total basin area by 2047 this entailed conversion of approximately 80 of available and potential open land and less than 2 of available and cropland area the mean changes observed for each sub catchment in smm basin are illustrated in fig 6 in both scenarios i and ii overall more changes were recorded in the mpologoma sub catchment area located on the western flank of the study area while the least changes were recorded in the lwakhakha sub catchment area for scenario ii more tree density was concentrated in areas around busitema forest where from a previous land cover analysis chasia et al 2021 natural forest interspersed with open shrublands used to occupy the area mean changes in cropland cover in scenario i also followed the same trend observed in each sub basin larger sub basins experienced more changes however the intensity of these changes correlated with locations where biophysical factors had the greatest impact 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of driving factors we measured the influence of the driving factors on different lulc classes using a logistic regression model suitable for modelling categorical data sohl et al 2012 overall the influence of different potential drivers on the distribution of land cover classes varied across the study however when different drivers in a given cover type acted together their combined influence was observed at varying degrees as outlined in fig 7 in the cropland class category for instance altitude temperature precipitation and soil organic carbon variables were significant in explaining the spatial distribution of cropland with p values p 0 01 at 0 05 significant level the effect of precipitation and temperature variables in this research corresponds with a study done in east africa by hawinkel et al 2016 which highlighted the importance of weather on vegetation distribution and characteristics in the region the location of permanent wetlands on the other hand could be explained by altitude precipitation and cec factors producing significant p values of 2e 16 temperature produced p value of p 0 054 in all the lulc classes this could help in explaining the distribution of these classes the correlation between mixed forest class and population density in the regression model was consistent with results obtained in a similar catchment in west africa judex and menz 2006 in both cases population density was negatively correlated with mixed forest class in our study this could be attributed to the steep slope on the upper reaches of smm catchment offering a natural buffer against encroachment by neighboring farming communities in addition the forest is located in a protected area this unique condition was enforced in the model using high elasticity values that restricted conversion of forest land to other land use classes additionally slope and cec with p values of 0 046 and 0 002 respectively had an influence on open shrubland the study further observed that location of built up areas was influenced mainly by altitude temperature precipitation proximity to major roads and towns factors this distribution coincides with settlement patterns observed across the catchment during field surveys overall the occurrence of vegetation sub classes in the study could be partly explained by a combination of soil conditions cec soc ph altitude and prevailing climatic conditions precipitation and temperature however the degree of influence among the variables varied among different vegetation types further exogenous factors not included in the model i e use organic and inorganic fertilizers soil conservation practices and agro cultural traditions etc could also affect crop distribution 4 2 logistic regression model performance results from evaluating logistic regression model performance are illustrated in fig 8 in order to ensure model stability and eliminate highly correlated independent variables from the regression model we used the variance inflation factor statistic to detect presence of collinearity in the dataset we used altitude as the dependent variable in the equation to quantify degree of collinearity with all the other independent variables all the variables recorded a vif score of less than five which indicate they were not highly correlated 4 3 assessment of calibration and validation of clue s model the clue s model was calibrated by adjusting parameters of potential driving factors for land cover change in the study area against the existing 2008 land cover map at t1 after several model runs the model output at t2 2017 was compared to the existing land cover map for the same year elasticity values for different lulc classes were thereafter assigned based on the model s ability to replicate reality visual assessment of the model s output was also conducted to compare the two maps and evaluate model s performance the quality of the calibration was assessed using the ksimulation method which accounts for change in lulc and avoids inflating simulation results where little change has occurred van vliet 2013 on average the model produced a ksimulation score of 0 4 which indicated the model was able to replicate change in lulc 40 of the time conversely the kappa statistic score of 0 78 indicated an overall 78 agreement in classification of land cover classes between the final model s output and the actual classified map 4 4 scenario analysis for smm catchment in scenario one it was postulated that in an environment with prevailing optimum weather conditions capable of supporting crop cultivation access to affordable farm inputs such as inorganic fertilizer and improvements in commodity prices for cash crops grown in the area the area under cropland was projected to increase further to occupy 62 of the total basin area these changes were expected especially in sub catchments situated on the upper reaches of smm basin i e sio lwakhakha and malakisi which are characterized by elevation of more than 2 500m rich volcanic soils and orographic rainfall the expansion of cropland was however constrained in the model to exclude critical ecological areas and protected land this was achieved by reducing conversion elasticity values of permanent wetlands and mixed forest class to 0 7 and 0 9 respectively section 2 4 3 table 3 while the constraints in the model increased the conversion cost limited reduction on permanent wetland cover was expected mainly in areas which are no longer covered by water overall areas under barren and permanent water land cover were allocated the maximum constraining elasticity value of 1 0 and thus remained static over the modelling period this is because barren areas were located in very high altitude zones in the catchment 4000mamsl an area mainly covered by rock outcrops on the other hand areas under permanent water were treated as critical aquatic habitats and thus protected from human activities scenario two explored possible future land cover patterns when afforestation programs are implemented across the catchment in order to mitigate against the negative impacts of soil erosion and land degradation here it was assumed that availability of land area suitable for tree growth coupled with other incentives would act as catalysts that promote the growth of both exotic and indigenous trees by local communities in addition areas which were previously under natural forest before being converted to cropland i e areas near busitema forest in uganda and the southern edges of mt elgon forest would be reclaimed back in this scenario therefore mixed forest class and open shrubland land cover areas were projected to increase significantly from 6 2 in 2017 to 8 1 in 2047 5 conclusion we examined future potential land use cover changes in a transboundary catchment of smm to achieve this goal we explored two scenarios scenario i analyzed agricultural expansion while scenario ii focused on reclamation using an ensemble land use maps and biophysical data in a spatially explicit clue s model initially we employed a logistic regression model to analysis potential biophysical and socio economic factors likely to influence spatial distribution and patterns of land use classes in the catchment and later used the information for calibrating clue s model in an agricultural expansion scenario cropland area increased by 12 from the modeling base year 2017 to cover 62 of the total basin area by the final modeling year 2047 this mainly involved annual conversion of open land cover by 1 7 to agricultural land in the reclamation scenario mixed forest class and open shrubland were projected to increase by 1 annually thus occupying 30 of the basin by 2047 generally land cover classes with high conversion costs such as barren land with rock outcrops open water and areas under permanent wetland unsuitable for crop growth remained unchanged during model simulation overall our results were consistent with observed patterns showing spatial distribution of vegetation classes across the catchment and corresponding driving factors such as weather patterns soil properties and topography which often determine the suitability of areas for cultivation and plant growth the outputs will be used to model soil erosion patterns in smm catchment as part of the capnex project being implemented in the area the findings are expected to provide insights into how future land use trajectories under different scenarios could affect soil erosion in a transboundary water catchment area and ecological stability the data could also support studies on earth system modeling and provide policy makers in the region with baseline data and information needed for developing practical soil conservation strategies funding this work was supported by the austrian

24278,evaluating the state of ecosystems is a major concern for humanity for that purpose the concept of ecological integrity has been present in both public policy and academia for decades here the concept is reviewed from its origin as an ambiguous notion through the main discourses and concepts associated with it over time and its main critiques it is shown that a shift towards complexity sciences has permeated the study of ecosystems functioning over the last years and two main pathways have been taken network theory and information theory and that the concept of integrity has been gradually replaced by more transparent terms focusing on network theory i first review developments in single interaction networks and find that a lack of consensus has characterized results in this area partly due to the restrictions of these methodologies then i review recent advances in networks that allow for multiple types of interactions and spatiotemporal scales highlighting the kind of insights that can be gained from each methodology and the questions ahead implementing these new frameworks will likely continue to bring novel insights into the functioning of ecosystems and how different management strategies contribute to it keywords ecological integrity ecological networks multiple interaction networks high order interactions data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction assessing ecological integrity the word integrity was first used in the context of ecology by the famous environmentalist aldo leopold in 1949 leopold 1949 and it has been present in public policy at an international level since its appearance in the 1972 u s clean water act barbour et al 2000 soon after karr and coworkers defined it for the first time as the ability to support and maintain a balanced adaptive community of organisms having a species composition diversity and functional organization comparable to that of natural habitats within a region and started using it to evaluate aquatic environments karr 1981 karr and dudley 1981 they also said that it is the ability to withstand and recover from perturbations ideas that are now embedded in the concepts of resistance and resilience andreasen et al 2001 according to manuel navarrete and coworkers 2004 the main discourses around integrity have evolved as follows i early conceptualizations of integrity considered it as a measure of pristineness as a state of the environment when humans are absent that can be measured empirically and objectively these ideas prevailed during the seventies and eighties ii in the nineties ecosystems started to be thought of as dynamic systems whose integrity falls in their ability to deal with perturbations attention shifted from elements to processes but the existence of an objective ideal state was still present and it was still supposed to be measured independently of social values iii later complex systems theory permeated integrity conceptions along with the notion of alternate equilibriums the role of science became providing information on how different ecological regimes could be pursued and their compatibility with socially dictated values was now acknowledged as an important factor for determining integrity manuel navarrete et al 2004 nevertheless these ideas have not replaced each other rather they coexist and it is not uncommon to find elements from the three of them in a single paper in this review i ask how integrity is measured according to the three main discourses around it i show how concepts like resilience robustness stability sustainability see glossary and others have been historically linked to integrity as they have been explicitly or implicitly regarded as proxies for it as a part of it or even used as synonyms for it i refrain from aligning myself with a particular definition of integrity as my goal is for the reader to know that its definition is changing and to understand the different meanings and implications it has had nevertheless i align with those authors who consider a better choice to use these last concepts alone without obscuring them with the use of integrity and the sense of morality it entails marris and rohwer 2022 i focus on the complexity based approach to these concepts particularly the analysis of ecological networks has brought major insights in the way ecological communities are structured and how this affects their dynamics this is why i include research that does not necessarily claim to measure integrity but deals with some of the mentioned concepts and with structure dynamic relationships i review the principal insights that the study of single interaction networks has brought on how structure and dynamics of ecosystems influence each other and then i review the more recent advances on multiple interaction networks and adaptive networks to show how they promise to expand our understanding of the mechanisms that shape ecological systems 2 the very changing definitions of ecological integrity 2 1 origins the healthy ecosystems most research traces the concept of ecological integrity to aldo leopold whose ideas on environmental ethics greatly influenced the movement for wildlife conservation in the u s barillas 1996 betancourt 2014 it was in his essay the land ethic that he wrote a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise leopold 1949 he did not define the concept but leopold s thinking had a major influence on environmental public policy and by 1972 the clean water act which is the federal law that governs water pollution in the u s mentioned integrity in its primary goal restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of our nation s waters from there it was included in many other public policy documents and in the scientific agenda a reality that continues to this day karr 1993 kim and bosselmann 2015 nonetheless it was until 1981 that james karr and his co workers gave the first formal definition in the context of aquatic environments karr and dudley 1981 during these first years scientists focused on the development of indexes to measure integrity noss 1990 o connell et al 1998 karr and chu 1999 karr 1981 developed the first index of biotic integrity ibi in order to assess the quality of water resources which was based on the richness of fish species trophic composition and health of individuals this index was quickly implemented in policy in the u s and europe plafkin et al 1989 kerans and karr 1994 with agencies and states adapting it to their particular goals e g oberdorff and hughes 1992 in these approaches ecological integrity is continuously compared to an organism s health and measurements are compared to an optimal unperturbed condition evaluations should reflect the multivariate nature of biological systems karr 1993 hence indexes are multimetric and should be relative to expected regional conditions at various scales as such they are aimed to detect the position of an ecosystem along a gradient of degradation and help identify the factors responsible for it even though karr himself advised caution about the adherence to a strict human health metaphor noting that biological assemblages are not precise analogues of mammalian bodies he still called for the expansion of the health concept and the convergence of medicine and ecology on ecological integrity mixed with formal definitions these researchers too often included ambiguous notions for example that systems have integrity when their inherent potential is realized and its condition is stable complete or undivided karr 1993 these concepts were commonly mixed with an ethical view of nature conservation in which integrity was deemed as an indicator of goodness in ecosystems lemons and westra 1995 this ethical view of nature since the eighteenth century through leopold and well into contemporary conservationism has too often been used to justify the exclusion of local residents from their lands mainly native americans and black people in order to protect an ideally pristine wilderness dowie 2011 sarkar 2021 andreasen et al 2001 discuss the optimal condition that serves as point of comparison for integrity indexes according to them the optimum condition is that in which naturalness is present but they define naturalness as something of great esthetic and spiritual importance a quality that should be measured in relation to what would have happened in america if the european settlers had not interfered as in all studies following this discourse an artificial dichotomy between human and nature is present in the idealization of pristineness a notion that has permeated american environmentalism since its origins and which is deeply plagued with racist and colonial biases sarkar 2021 this integrity discourse continues to be used and it is materialized for example in the natural parks system in the u s where a pristine nucleus is assumed to represent the optimal condition buffer areas are sought to be kept healthy and the rest is regarded merely as a human polluted area woodley 1990 parks canada 2001 its measurement relies on experts who are supposed to determine integrity empirically through indicators and inform legislators who in turn execute commands to maintain it manuel navarrete et al 2004 2 2 systemic approaches beginning in the nineties integrity discourses started to emphasize the dynamic nature of ecosystems and attention was put in their ability to self organize in this discourse integrity lies in the systems capacity to deal with perturbations so the concepts of resilience and resistance are fully adopted kay 1991 it is acknowledged that all ecosystems are influenced by humans so pristineness is no longer the main focus there is still an assumption of a better overall direction for ecosystem evolution but integrity is now about how much can they deviate from it without arriving at an irreversible change manuel navarrete et al 2004 holling s ideas on alternate attractors and adaptive cycles were very influential for this conception holling 2001 disturbances are deviations from the so called attractors and management s goal is to keep these deviations from pushing the system into a different attractor in this discourse ecosystem function is more relevant than its composition so functional groups are measured instead of species and aspects like redundancy are rendered important to attenuate the effects of species loss research focuses on processes not elements resilience which is generally understood as the ability of a system to deal with perturbations and reorganize in the face of changes maintaining its structure functioning and identity walker et al 2004 is the main wanted characteristic nonetheless some authors have pointed out that caution should be had when applying this concept mainly resilience is understood as an intrinsically positive and desired property of ecosystems biggs et al 2012 but it is generally measured from an ahistorical point of view which ignores the power relations and conflicts that influence the systems olsson et al 2015 stojanovic et al 2016 moreover some critics have said that the resilience framework can be used to justify and perpetuate the status quo thus maintaining unequal power relations in order to avoid this resilience studies should specify what it is that we are seeking to maintain for whom and in the face of what walker and cooper 2011 cretney 2014 cretney and bond 2014 this caution however is lacking in the integrity analyses that fall into this discourse in these studies the ethical imperative of preserving nature remains present and it is presumed to be objective instead of recognizing the interests behind of what is trying to be preserved this is reflected in the fact that even though management is now supposed to be adaptive meaning that it should evolve in the face of the social and ecological changes these changes are rendered inevitable and implementation schemes are done through top down policy making ecological integrity is still deemed as an objective state that can be determined by scientific experts by understanding structural relations this discourse was broadly adopted in north america born and sonzogni 1995 for example parrish et al 2003 outline a way to measure ecological integrity that has been used within protected areas this consists of selecting target taxa then identifying ecological attributes that are key for them and defining an acceptable range of variation for these attributes the status of each target is rated through an assessment of the state of their ecological attributes and they are combined into an overall measure of the whole area the ecological attributes are the focus of management not the species themselves instead of being compared with an optimum value they are allowed to vary inside an acceptable range which is obtained from sources like ecological models expert knowledge and comparisons with similar systems and among gradients of disturbance with the adoption of holling s ideas ecological integrity entered the realm of the complexity sciences and the consolidation of these ideas along with the recognition of social values gave birth to a third discourse manuel navarrete et al 2004 in it the role of science shifts from discovering an objectively better state of ecosystems to facilitating negotiation among conflicting values the possibility of different ecological regimes to have integrity is recognized and science s job is no longer to decide which one is correct but to say what the different ecological regimes look like and the trade offs involved in management actions integrity in this discourse is determined by the states that are both biophysically possible and compatible with the needs of a society characterized by diverse and often conflicting values methods overall are the same as before but they incorporate uncertainty and the fact that the criteria by which one makes decisions are subjective examples of this conceptualization is the ecosystem based management which has been applied for example in the great lakes basin of the u s konisky and beierle 2001 and the environmental integrated management born and sonzogni 1995 another example is collaborative management in which stakeholder s values are considered dynamical and an emphasis is made on the process of learning so their opinions on management can change and common interests can be discovered saarikoski 2000 allen et al 2001 several limitations to this approach have been pointed out for example that different social actors usually come from different positions of power so weighing their interests on an equal basis can result in an artificial sense of justice that overshadows political differences and historical debts luke 2002 instead the interests of local and historically marginalized actors should be prioritized as they are the first affected by environmental management strategies indeed it has been shown that the demands of local social movements have historically been at the front of many environmental causes with academia and public institutions summing up later so listening to the demands of people and providing them with social learning spaces and tools for capacity building can be a better management strategy stirling 2019 in an example of this last approach some groups have developed games that are based on a system s driving processes for example the ecological network associated with a coffee agroecosystem which involves direct and trait mediated interactions that shape an autonomous pest control system was translated into a board game that enables peasants to reflect on the role of biodiversity in their systems garcía barrios et al 2016 on another example farmers that share the irrigation systems of the senegal river valley used a role playing game in order to discuss different strategies of co ordination amongst themselves barreteau et al 2003 through playing local social actors can grasp the complex dynamics of a biological system and to analyze the implications of different management decisions which they can then take into their hands see also garcía barrios et al 2008 speelman et al 2014 garcía barrios et al 2015 and speelman and garcía barrios 2006 for more examples on the use of games for promoting learning and decision making in various socio ecological systems 2 3 novel approaches from a complexity viewpoint mainly in the last decade complexity based approaches to integrity have thrived along two pathways namely network theory and information theory equihua et al 2020 while both approaches aim to understand the function of complex phenomena through the use of mathematical formalisms network theory does it by analyzing the structure of connected entities while information theory looks in the response variables of a system for activity patterns i will briefly describe the main proposals of the information theory approach and then focus on network based analyses even though i present the most recent advances in methodological terms most of them fall into the second discourse of integrity this is approaches with a systemic view of biological assemblages that use tools from complexity theory but that lack the incorporation of explicit social values and power relations equihua et al 2020 review and propose information theory as a unifying framework to understand ecological integrity and resilience which they treat as different but linked concepts for them integrity is defined by the particular structure and functions of ecosystems and resilience is their ability to preserve them in the face of perturbations for equihua and co workers integrity arises from processes of self organization derived from thermodynamic mechanisms that operate through the existing biota as well as the energy and materials at their disposal until attaining optimal operational points which vary according to changes in the biophysical conditions equihua et al 2014 equihua et al 2020 they point out the main approaches for assessing integrity with information theory the first one is through the concept of ascendancy a measure of information flow gustavson et al 2002 saint béat et al 2015 explain that to understand ascendancy two kinds of stability must be differentiated a system with high inner stability has inner constraints typical of an organized structure which results in high ascendancy on the other hand low ascendancy is linked to redundancy which makes ecosystems resilient to external disturbances too little ascendancy is interpreted as a lack of internal constraints whereas too much of it makes them inflexible and vulnerable to external perturbations so ecosystems should have intermediate ascendancy levels a second approach to integrity returns to the concepts of ecosystem health and stability ramírez carrillo and collaborators 2018 propose an ecosystem health index based on the notion of criticality which they define as a balance between order and disorder in the fluctuations of the system s state variables according to these authors healthy ecosystems have state variables like respiration whose fluctuations are characterized by pink noise which happens when fluctuation autocorrelation is intermediate between zero which they associate to the system s adaptability and high values which they associate with robustness several authors have found evidence of this criticality in physiological processes such as heart activity and they have associated it with a healthy state ivanov et al 1996 rivera et al 2016 however exciting this line of research may be we should be cautious about the analogy between human and ecosystem health a strict analogy would require the existence of an unequivocally optimum condition for ecosystems and homeostatic processes that maintain it even though there may be mechanisms that enable ecosystems to be disturbed without profound structural or functional changes they are fundamentally different from homeostatic processes because the components of ecosystems do not function as a co dependent unit like organs in a body do ecosystems may change but they do not die altogether wicklum and davies 1995 in this sense monitoring variables such as ecosystem respiration certainly gives information on the ecosystem s state but is not equivalent to monitoring vital signs in an organism and hence they cannot be used to objectively call an ecosystem s state good or bad finally cabezas et al 2005 proposed the fisher information index to measure variation and order as conditions relevant for sustainability for further developments of this idea see ahmad et al 2016 very ordered systems have a fisher information that tends to zero while disordered systems have a high fisher information the thesis proposed by frieden and gatenby 2010 is that systems in stable dynamic states have constant fisher information while changes in it can signal regime changes their results are consistent with michaelian 2005 ideas about ecosystem stability and entropy where stable ecosystems have higher values of entropy as we can see information theory approaches to integrity have focused on the balance between order and disorder fisher information and criticality approaches or constraint and flexibility ascendancy approach they are phenomenological approaches since they do not seek to find out the mechanisms behind the state variables that are measured these methodologies benefit from the huge amounts of data on ecological phenomena that are now available a major challenge to these developments is to distinguish quality from quantity in their choice of data and to be cautious as to the applicability of their analogies and assumptions 3 ecological networks the study of ecological assemblages with network theory has brought a great number of insights about the processes governing them the multiplicity of contexts in which networks have been applied just in the science of ecology is outstanding of course all these developments have not been without controversy as the search of general relations between structure and function of networks has often given contradicting results here i will start by reviewing the major topics and results brought on by the study of single interaction networks and then move on to more recent proposals involving adaptive networks spatially distributed networks and multiple interaction networks most of these studies do not refer explicitly to ecological integrity but they all measure relationships between structure and function of ecosystems and use resilience stability robustness and other better defined concepts that have been related to ecological integrity i will focus on the kind of insights that have been gained with each methodological approach and how they contribute to our knowledge of the state of ecosystems 3 1 single interaction networks the majority of research on network theory has focused on networks composed of nodes representing species or functional groups and which are connected by a single type of ecological interaction mainly antagonic e g herbivory predation parasitism mutualistic e g pollination or competitive landi and collaborators 2018 reviewed publications on these three types of networks and synthesized their main questions and findings overall these studies focus on finding the relationships between some structural characteristics of the networks and their function measured as robustness stability resilience and other concepts that were discussed in earlier sections generally there is a lack of consensus in many of the relationships that have been studied which is probably due to methodological differences and working definitions in addition to the intrinsic complexity that stems from the numerous elements processes and scales that interact to give rise to these qualities ives and carpenter 2007 the main structural characteristics that have been measured are species richness connectance weighted connectance connectivity linkage density weighted linkage density species strength species dependance modularity and nestedness these features have usually been studied as independent variables and the corresponding dependent variables have been linear stability resilience persistence structural stability extinction cascade robustness and invasibility in the most simplified way to put it the overall question asked has been if these independent variables have a positive or a negative effect on the dependent variables but different answers have often been provided by researchers using different methodologies both empirical and theoretical for a comprehensive review on the impacts of structural properties on network function see landi and collaborators 2018 here i will summarize the main findings in order to show the overwhelming diversity of answers that have been given to this question and how they vary depending on the type of network used trophic mutualistic or competitive and general methodology 3 1 1 species richness early ideas on the topic mainly said that enhanced diversity made ecosystems stable through species limiting each other s growth through predation or competition thus preventing destabilizing outbreaks odum 1953 macarthur 1955 elton 2020 these notions remained unchallenged until the now classic work of robert may 1972 using linear stability analyses he showed that communities modelled as random networks lose stability as the number of species the number of interactions or their strength rise these results have been causing controversy for decades as they seem counterintuitive in the face of the staggering biodiversity of some of the world s ecosystems the work of may conveyed all interaction types as the sign of the elements in the community matrix could be positive or negative since then researchers have tackled the issue mostly with single interaction networks and the result has been a general lack of consensus for example in networks defined by predation or competition richness has been found to have both a positive and a negative effect on integrity related concepts like stability robustness productivity invasibility feasibility coexistance and diversity pimm 1979 lawlor 1980 pimm 1980 tilman and downing 1994 tilman 1999 borrvall et al 2000 dunne et al 2002a christianou and kokkoris 2008 dunne and williams 2009 fowler 2009 gross et al 2009 maynard et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 maureaud et al 2020 on the other hand in mutualistic communities there has been more consensus around a positive relationship between species richness and both resilience and persistence okuyama and holland 2008 thebault fontaine 2010 vidal et al 2020 3 1 2 connectance and connectivity there is also widespread controversy around the relationship between connectance and community function with many studies supporting both positive and negative relationships depending on the methods used to generate theoretical networks or the particular empirical dataset landi et al 2018 for food webs and competition networks connectance and connectivity have been found to have a positive effect on stability haydon 2000 fowler 2009 van altena et al 2016 baumgartner 2020 while in mutualistic webs they have had both positive and negative effects on local stability propagation of perturbations extinction cascades persistence and resilience okuyama and holland 2008 thebault fontaine 2010 allesina and tang 2012 james et al 2012 suweis et al 2015 vieira and almeida neto 2015 3 1 3 degree distribution the degree distribution of networks has been associated with their capacity to persist and different distributions have been found to characterize different types of networks food webs have a degree distribution that differs from a poisson which is typical of random webs aside from that the specific distributions associated with food webs have been highly controversial and different authors have found different fits for example the exponential distribution has been commonly found camacho et al 2002 dunne et al 2002b a uniform distribution has also been associated with webs with high connectance and power law and truncated power law distributions have been found for communities with very low connectance dunne et al 2002b montoya sole 2002 in mutualistic networks a major interest has been the proportion of generalists against specialists jordano et al 2003 found truncated power laws which is in agreement with the idea that mutualistic webs have a high prevalence of specialists and rare super generalists okuyama 2008 found a gamma distribution the impact of degree distribution on network function is also debated as feng and takemoto 2014 found that heterogeneity in node degree distribution negatively affects their local stability while james et al 2012 found that individual node degrees are good predictors of species survival 3 1 4 strength of interactions working with weighted interactions has brought a lot of new insights to our knowledge of ecological networks variability in link strength has been found to be related with trophic network stability and it has been commonly observed in empirical networks berlow et al 2004 wootton and emmerson 2005 in particular the existence of many weak interactions and few strong ones appears to promote stability by dampening oscillations or reducing the amount of intraspecific competition needed for stability mccann et al 1998 neutel et al 2002 thebault fontaine 2010 van altena et al 2016 emmerson and yearsley 2004 supported these findings but only when omnivory is present in contrast allesina and pascual 2008 found that stability is robust to changes in the strength of the jacobian elements further allesina and tang 2012 showed that a preponderance of weak interactions decreases the probability of communities to be stable a result previously found with different methods by borrvall et al 2000 a different approximation has been the use of bioenergetic models where interaction strengths are parameterized according to body mass ratios emmerson raffaelli 2004 and otto et al 2007 show that such scaling promotes stability in food webs considered together with trophic interactions it is recognized that adding intraspecific competition negative terms on the diagonal of the interaction or community matrix increases stability haydon 1994 furthermore de angelis 1975 found that a bias towards strong self regulation of the species at higher trophic levels stabilizes food webs haydon 2000 showed that a high connectance between highly and weakly self regulated components is required in mutualistic networks the strength of interactions is often inferred by the relative number of visits of pollinators to the plant doing so jordano 1987 and bascompte et al 2006 found an even stronger skewness towards weak interactions the last one also found that while animals depend strongly on the plants plants rely poorly on their animal pollinators or seed dispersers bascompte et al 2006 concluding that both heterogeneity in interaction strength distribution and asymmetry of species dependences facilitate the maintenance of biodiversity the ability of the system to reduce the propagation of perturbations had been linked to connectance as shown above but suweis et al 2015 found that heterogeneity in interaction strength distribution also contributes to it even though most studies agree on this issue there have been exceptions who have found the opposite relationships okuyama and holland 2008 feng and takemoto 2014 also rohr et al 2014 showed that the distribution of interaction strength had no impact on structural stability and that it was an average high strength that mattered 3 1 5 modularity and nestedness it has almost been accepted that food webs have a more modular structure than other types of networks and that this is related to their stability along with a weakly connected arquitecture many studies reported that modularity increased the stability or the persistence of food webs moore and hunt 1988 ives et al 2000 krause et al 2003 thebault fontaine 2010 stouffer and bascompte 2011 however grilli and collaborators 2016 used a random networks approach to show that modularity influences stability in different ways depending on other parameters like connectance mean interaction strength variance correlation and size of modules for mutualistic networks nestedness has proven a more important feature than modularity while olesen et al 2007 and mello et al 2011 noticed that modularity is present in some mutualist networks and that it tends to increase as webs get bigger thebault and fontaine 2010 emphasized that its effect on persistence and resilience is negative nestedness on the other hand has been accepted as a characteristic topological feature of mutualist networks bascompte et al 2003 it has been shown to prevent extinction cascades memmott et al 2004 enable coexistence bastolla et al 2009 increase persistence and resilience okuyama and holland 2008 thebault fontaine 2010 and maximize the parameter domain that leads to stable and feasible equilibriums rohr et al 2014 however this has also been refuted by some studies for example james et al 2012 studied 59 empirical webs and found nestedness to be a secondary covariate to the number of mutualistic partners which they found to be a better causal predictor enabling coexistence allesina and tang 2012 found local stability to be negatively affected by nestedness and campbell et al 2012 showed that extreme nestedness promotes extinction cascades in conclusion basically all structure function relationships that have been studied in single interaction networks have been controversial aside from methodological differences the big number of contradicting results may be because almost none of them have controlled for the influence of other types of ecological interactions nor have they studied temporal changes in their properties if there are generalities to be found in the relationship between the structural and functional features of ecological networks it may be that a broader view is necessary in the next section we will see approaches that tackle these shortcomings 3 2 multiple interaction networks spatial networks and adaptive networks it has become clear that the effects of different types of interactions need to be assessed in order to understand ecosystems sander et al 2015 soliveres et al 2015 golubski et al 2016 kéfi et al 2016 pilosof et al 2017 in addition to all the structural features discussed above for single interaction networks communities that take into account various types of interactions will probably be influenced at least by 1 the proportion of the different interaction types 2 the relative strength of interactions within and among interaction types and 3 the structural properties of each sub network and the overall aggregated network garcía callejas et al 2018 the recollection of empirical data on multiple interaction networks can be challenging as even single interaction networks are commonly undersampled chacoff et al 2012 and quantifying interaction strength requires a huge sampling effort berlow et al 2004 strategies for multiple interaction network construction have basically been aggregating data from previous work with a particular network kefi et al 2015 or the design of massive sampling programs following this second strategy pocock et al 2012 sampled different habitats in an agroecosystem in the uk obtaining a network containing trophic mutualistic and parasitic sub networks they showed that overall the sub networks robustness did not strongly covary suggesting that restoration programs aimed at benefiting one functional group will not necessarily benefit the others on the other hand they found that some species were disproportionately linked to species in all sub graphs suggesting that a better strategy for restoration should focus on them as for estimating interaction strength evidence seems to support a neutral view of interactions in which their frequency can be approximated as the result of random encounters mediated by the relative abundances of the populations involved and their frequency can be in turn used as a proxy for their strength canard et al 2012 2014 faust and raes 2012 araújo and rozenfeld 2014 cazelles et al 2016 garcía callejas et al 2018 reviewed developments on multiple interaction networks which have only appeared in the last decade and recognized three non exclusive methodologies extended food webs equal footing networks and multilayer networks see their paper for a complete list of articles published with each methodology these are differentiated based on how different interactions are classified either by the general positive negative or null effect they produce on other species or by the particular mechanism by which the interaction occurs whether they are expressed in the same units or not these three approaches have different assumptions and are best at addressing different kinds of questions 3 2 1 extended food webs extended food webs take trophic interactions as the backbone of the community whose dynamic is modelled through differential equations e g lotka volterra but which incorporate non trophic interactions as functional modifiers of the equation s parameters for example arditi et al 2005 built a model of mass conservation in which non trophic positive interactions that can be understood as mutualisms have a positive effect on the species ability to efficiently incorporate nutrients into their biomass importantly this effect of non trophic interactions was found to be much stronger than that of species richness in the web arditi et al 2005 inserted non trophic interactions as modifiers of the elements of the community matrix aij meaning that the population density of species k modulates the trophic interaction between two other species i and j without directly affecting the population densities of either of them this kind of mechanism has also been called high order interactions by bairey et al 2016 and they have been shown to promote community linear stability in random networks they have also been documented empirically for example in agroecosystems vandermeer et al 2010 describe an ecological network composed of the main coffee pests and their natural enemies in a diversified coffee plantation where they find that a series of high order interactions are essential to regulate the pest population densities resulting in an autonomous pest control system more recently kefi et al 2012 extended the methodology by arditi et al 2005 to allow for non trophic interactions to influence any parameter of a food web dynamic model for example reproduction and mortality rates migration rates or others according to the mechanism by which they happen for example the provisioning of nesting sites by some species positively affects the reproduction rate of another species or foot stamping by big mammals can increase mortality rates of some herbs in this way extended food webs have the potential to include direct and indirect effects on unlimited biological detail at the cost of an ever increasing number of parameters and larger equations 3 2 2 equal footing networks in equal footing networks it is assumed that all kinds of interaction mechanisms can be summarized by the positive negative or null effect they produce in the species growth rate so they are all aggregated in the elements of the community matrix aij instead of being modelled with auxiliary equations hence the community matrix includes all possible pairwise combinations 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 at the cost of losing detail about the mechanisms that produce the effect equal footing networks gain generality and scalability as the number of parameters does not increase so fast this approach was used to show that local stability is enhanced by a combination of trophic and mutualistic interactions mougi and kondoh 2012 kondoh and mougi 2015 afterwards they expanded their studies to show that commensalism and amensalism mougi 2016a also increase local stability since equal footing networks can be modelled with the same equations as single interaction networks and their stability can be analyzed in the same way they are a natural opportunity to compare results with one and many types of interactions it may still be too soon to say but studies so far indicate that networks with many interaction types are more locally stable than their counterparts garcía callejas et al 2018 3 2 3 multilayer networks pilosof et al 2017 formally defined multilayer networks as 1 a set of physical nodes representing entities for example species ii a set of layers which can include multiple aspects of layering for example interaction type iii a set of state nodes each of which corresponds to the state of the physical node on a specific layer and iv a set of edges to connect the state nodes to each other in a pairwise fashion the edge set includes both the familiar intralayer edges and interlayer ones this idea has already been used in areas like engineering economy or social network analysis see boccaletti et al 2014 and kivelä et al 2014 for reviews for representing the dynamics of a multilayer network state nodes in each layer can be modelled with a particular equation corresponding to one type of interaction and auxiliary equations may connect the state of nodes of a given entity in different layers such inter layer links may represent any kind of relationship between layers which makes this approach particularly flexible of course this entails the difficulty of choosing how to define them garcía callejas et al 2018 the application of multilayer networks in ecology has begun to show that communities when many kinds of interactions are considered are highly structured melián et al 2009 kéfi et al 2015 and that this has repercussions on different community properties pocock et al 2012 evans et al 2013 kéfi et al 2016 for example kéfi et al 2016 combine a multilayer and an extended food web approach as i have said these methodologies are non exclusive to analyze a marine ecosystem they find that hundreds of nodes and links belonging to trophic positive non trophic and negative non trophic interactions form a strikingly simple 3 d structure with few modules that are taxonomically coherent and easily interpreted in terms of species traits e g mobile consumers sessile habitat facilitators competing primary producers etc they also found that the structure of non trophic interactions allow for a higher persistence and total biomass than what would be expected from their random allocation this approach is a powerful tool as it can provide a way to analyze the importance of different interaction types in processes such as population dynamics and properties such as resilience it can also give a broader definition of node centrality which can be used as a proxy for finding keystone species that can incorporate their participation in several types of interaction pilosof et al 2017 interestingly the equal footing framework can be thought of as a particular type of multilayer framework in which all layers are flattened into a single one erasing inter layer links and making each node simultaneously affected by all interaction types garcía callejas et al 2018 melián et al 2009 provide an example of an equal footing model made from a multilayer dataset 3 2 4 spatial and temporal variables in networks as the reader may already have noticed layers in a multilayer network can not only represent different types of interaction but also different moments in time different spatial locations levels of organization or group identities pilosof et al 2017 for example layers can represent patches while interlayer edges can represent species dispersal between them or layers can represent seasons and while interlayer edges can be changes in the species abundance spatially defined multilayer networks can help explore the stability of communities under different spatial patterns and help advance metacommunity theory these multilayer objects can be thought of as networks of networks where habitat patches are the nodes of a spatial network across the landscape and each at the same time contains a local network of species interaction with each other single interaction networks have already explored spatiality for example bunn et al 2000 used a focal species analysis with a graph approach to landscape connectivity in the coastal plain of north carolina they built graphs using gis to define habitat patches and determined the functional distance between them with least cost path modeling performing edge and node removals they analyzed how species with different dispersal capacities perceived the landscape and each patch s role in maintaining connectivity a similar study using the mexican spotted owl can be found in urban and keitt 2001 these approaches have proven useful for conservation planning at a landscape scale according to reza and abdullah 2011 a regional index of integrity should incorporate measures on fragmentation and landscape connectivity among others the use of multilayer networks promises to improve them by allowing researchers to study the impact of environmental changes landscape and species at the same time and recent frameworks are seeking to organize how we deal with these new tools fortin et al 2021 on the other hand networks that change through time have been called adaptive networks and their analysis has revealed that important structural changes take place in communities according to seasonal or successional changes villa galaviz et al 2012 lópez carretero et al 2014 saavedra et al 2017 for example in tropical ecosystems with seasonal climatic variation it has been shown that the specialization and structural patterns of plant herbivore networks can dramatically change lópez carretero et al 2014 2018 according to lópez carretero and collaborators 2014 selectivity and modularity of plant herbivore networks decrease during the dry season and in poorly structured habitats as generalist species expand their host preferences in the face of resource limitation this increase in connectance can then reflect species ability to adapt and buffer the negative impacts of disturbance in another study villa galaviz and collaborators 2012 studied the changes in network structure of a plant herbivore community across successional stages of a tropical dry forest by focusing on networks structure rather than on species identities they found that robustness e g low extinction in the face of random node removal was quickly recovered after perturbation as they found no significant differences in robustness related structural measures between mature forests and middle and late successional forests the importance of rewiring interactions in ecological networks has just begun to be understood while the above mentioned studies indicate that changes in interactions do result in structural changes other studies have claimed that these have a minimal effect on network architecture petanidou et al 2008 carstensen et al 2016 trøjelsgaard and olesen 2016 however saavedra et al 2017 demonstrated that network reorganization can play an important role in modulating succession even when global structural properties remain invariable in an interesting fusion of empirical and theoretical analyses they use a lotka volterra competition model calibrated through field observations of plant herbivore interactions shared hosts to study inter annual change in interaction networks and its impact on the persistence of species at different successional stages they found that as time advances network reorganization makes it more and more difficult for new colonizers to establish they used a niche overlap framework macarthur and levins 1967 saavedra et al 2014 to estimate herbivore competition as the number of shared plants and a structural stability analysis rohr et al 2014 to measure inter annual changes in stability and in the parameter space that promoted feasible stable equilibriums they found that early arriving species increase their likelihood of persistence as time advances while the reorganization of their interactions increasingly impedes late arrivers to colonize multilayer networks can also be used to study adaptive networks with layers representing different temporal instances of a community in addition to the insights provided by studies like the ones discussed multilayer networks can provide a unified framework to test hypotheses related to the temporal structure of the community pilosof et al 2017 for example if one has a community that gains and loses species over time the multilayer network would include all species as physical nodes and interlayer connections would represent changes in presence absence status with this one could test if the modular structure in each layer is affected by changes in species persistence by randomly reshuffling interlayer connections and comparing observed patterns to the ones obtained by random equal footing networks can also be used for this purpose for example mougi 2016b showed that communities with antagonistic and mutualistic interactions have an increased stability when there is interaction change across time as these studies exemplify the potential of these frameworks to include multiple types of interactions and temporal or spatial scales at the same time will surely bring us a much more realistic knowledge of ecosystems the relationship between structure and function has been studied in a mainly linear way in which structure is assumed to be the cause of function however structure itself is influenced by function and we have just seen how studies that incorporate different spatial and temporal scales are beginning to shed light on how many ecological evolutionary and social factors can alter them in the last section i will describe some other insights into how these factors can change ecosystems structure and dynamics 4 the forces that shape network structure and function when an ecological network is defined by choosing nodes and links a decision is made on what elements and processes will form the system consequently everything that is not included epistemologically becomes an external force as we have seen there is much to learn on how the internal properties of networks shape each other but this knowledge will not be complete if we do not address the role of the external processes that are left aside here i will show some of the main topics that are currently being studied on how ecological evolutionary and social aspects impact the function of ecological networks this is a very relevant line of work as ecological networks permanently interact with such forces and in the spirit of ensuring ecological integrity understanding their interrelation is necessary to make informed decisions on how to manage ecosystems 4 1 phylogenetics phylogenetic distances are known to influence the probability of species to interact and rapid evolution of functional traits has been demonstrated in several contexts thompson 1998 koch et al 2014 this means that feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary dynamics can influence the structure of networks even at short time scales thompson 1998 fussman et al 2007 montesinos navarro et al 2019 in this context raimundo et al 2018 propose the use of phylogenetically informed adaptive networks for application in restoration ecology according to their proposal eco evolutionary networks using phylogenetically structured interaction data can help predict the results of manipulation species composition in terms of robustness resilience or functional diversity devoto et al 2012 montoya et al 2012 kaiser bunbury et al 2017 for example when an invasive species is added to a network where it lacks eco evolutionary history a rapid adaptive evolution process can be triggered larue et al 2017 resulting in changes in the previous interaction network that may or may not be reversible by simply eliminating the invasive species knowing the phylogenetic background of ecologic systems can thus be relevant for management that looks to preserve its diversity resilience or other integrity linked concepts at the face of species invasion or loss 4 2 species traits species traits like foraging behavior defenses against predation lópez carretero et al 2018 mobility kefi et al 2016 or plasticity gray et al 2021 can shape or restrict interactions among them for example defensive metabolites in some tropical species have been shown to positively correlate to the specialization and diversification of herbivores resulting in plants that maintain a very high herbivore richness kursar et al 2009 becerra 2015 richards et al 2015 also the simultaneous expression of foliar toughness trichome density and phenolic content in plants can influence the strength and selectivity of herbivore plant interactions lópez carretero et al 2018 feeding mechanisms have also been found to be related to network architecture for example granivorous insects leaf miners frugivores leaf chewers and sap suckers are much more specialized and tend to form more modular structures than xylophages and root feeders novotny and basset 2005 lópez carretero et al 2018 when showing plastic responses organisms can have changing effects on their surroundings a phenomena that has been shown to alter the ecosystem services they provide gray et al 2021 in this sense knowledge about how species traits influence their role in communities can hint towards management actions that pays attention to those species which play important or endangered functions 4 3 habitat disturbance disturbance spontaneous or recurrent human induced or not is known to significantly alter ecosystems e g roxburgh et al 2004 krebs et al 2010 changes in tree canopy light availability rainfall patterns or soil cover are just some examples of ecosystem changes that impact species in different ways for example tree removal implies the disappearance of herbivores that depend on them but it can also facilitate the production of young leaves on the remaining plants which suddenly have a better access to light indirectly benefiting other herbivore species lópez carretero et al 2018 indeed habitat changes have been shown to have an impact on network parameters like in the work of valladares et al 2006 2012 who showed how forest loss diminished the richness size and connectance of a plant herbivore network as a function of the remaining fragments size just as lópez carretero et al 2014 found an increase in generalist species and connectance when resources were scarce because of normal seasonal changes araujo et al 2015 found the same tendency in several empirical networks under anthropogenic land use change if we understand how certain disturbances affect different aspects of networks we could design better restoration plans that work in synergy with the tendencies that arise from the systems structure 4 4 agricultural management agriculture is recognized as a major source of ecosystem alteration as it covers around 40 of earth s surface foley et al 2005 nevertheless not many examples exist that analyze agroecosystems from a network perspective pocock et al 2012 bohan et al 2013 the insights that network theory has brought to ecology remain mostly unexploited in the agricultural context a lag in knowledge that must be overcome such a system level approach holds the potential to guide our actions around major issues like autonomous pest control disease outbreaks and biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes vandermeer et al 2010 2018 ramos et al 2018 from an evolutionary perspective agroecosystems are tightly integrated ensembles because they are subjected to artificial selection at both the species and the community levels a characteristic that distinguishes them from other ecosystems the study of agroecosystems could thus help us address how selection on multiple species assemblages shapes ecosystem structure and function benítez et al 2014 a very interesting line of research deals with the repercussions of different types of agricultural management on ecosystem structure and function for example sosa aranda et al 2018 showed that management intensity in coffee plantations decreased lepidopteran diversity but increased leaf damage this suggests that as shade trees are removed with increasing management intensity a few specialist species are lost but many herbivores that normally feed on trees are recruited by coffee explaining the higher leaf damage importantly this implies that non intensive management that favors shade canopy can contribute to the conservation of lepidoptera while also decreasing leaf damage to coffee plants on a different approach vandermeer et al 2018 modelled the dynamics of the coffee rust disease using spatially explicit networks and found that the patterns formed by plants that are below a critical distance from each other have an effect on the transmission process because planting density changes with management intensity this implies that plantations along an intensity gradient will have infection rates that could presumably alter the outcome of the disease because agriculture alters landscapes the impact of different management types should also be assessed at broad spatial scales it has been shown that patches of habitat distributed among an agricultural matrix can show source sink dynamics perfecto and vandermeer 2015 furthermore different types of agricultural management play a role in determining how different species perceive the landscape and whether they are able to sustain viable populations in it or not perfecto et al 2009 in a metacommunity approach using multiple interaction networks ramos et al 2018 showed that the combination of habitat availability spatial distribution of habitat fragments and permeability of agricultural patches regulates the persistence of species at a landscape level these and other applications of network theory can help farmers and other social actors in the assessment of different management scenarios with differential repercussions on the function of ecosystems 5 conclusion given that the term ecological integrity is commonly employed in the public agenda i have exposed its evolution and implications however this revision coincides with recent work which has questioned the pertinence of the concept because of its loose definitions rohwer and marris 2021 marris and rohwer 2022 it is true that in the name of ecological integrity many methods for assessing monitoring and managing ecosystems have been created and that they have proven useful tools to counter the degradation of ecosystems karr et al 2022 nevertheless employing the concept of integrity obscures the fact that a judgement of value has been made in order to determine the state variables that are deemed desirable such as biodiversity or resilience and it obscures for whom and by whom these cultural preferences are being defined marris and rohwer 2022 like the most recent approaches with ecological networks show terms with formal definitions such as richness persistence or functional diversity are a better choice for assessing the state of ecosystems and they should be accompanied by a clear statement of why these aspects are deemed desirable following this logic i focused on the most recent methodological tools for assessing ecosystems from a complexity framework particularly with ecological networks i reviewed how single interaction networks have been used to study the relationships between structure and function of biotic assemblages highlighting the contradicting results that probably stem from both methodological differences and the real word complexities that these studies have left aside then i showed recent advances in multiple interaction networks and adaptive networks that bring a more realistic view of ecosystems by allowing the integration of several types of interactions and any spatial and temporal scales in the same analysis together these studies have taught us a lot about the way in which interactions among species shape their dynamics and how these dynamics can in turn change their interactions exciting lines of research have started to evaluate the role of cultural evolutionary and other ecological processes in the shaping of networks for example studies on succession have revealed that networks rewire through time in a non random way that has an effect on the persistence of species through its different stages villa galaviz et al 2012 saavedra et al 2017 also phylogenetic history and body traits can inform on the probability of species to interact with each other a fact that can be used both to infer present networks and to build possible evolutionary scenarios raimundo et al 2018 finally some studies have assessed the effects on ecological networks of important human activities like agricultural management and land use change de araújo et al 2015 ramos et al 2018 sosa aranda et al 2018 together these frameworks can be used to answer questions that can guide the management of natural resources at different spatiotemporal scales and inform on the effects of human activities on ecosystems such as production restoration and conservation this review showed that the study of the state of ecosystems is an area in continuous development the analysis of the relationships between the structure and function of ecosystems has led to a diversity of frameworks from integrity indexes to complex network analyses along the way concepts have evolved from being morally charged to being formally defined and implicit subjectivities are starting to get recognized as frameworks are increasingly able to encompass different types of processes and scales future challenges will probably include how to balance weights and assign units to qualitatively different processes how to couple different spatial and temporal scales and how to deal with the increasing number of parameters that tend to come with more detailed models although computational capacity keeps increasing researchers will need to be careful not to get lost in ever increasing models to the point of losing interpretability additionally no model is ever complete or free from the subjectivities of those who make it so caution should be taken to avoid confusing the use of complexity based tools with the use of a complexity based philosophy the use of huge amounts of data and sophisticated models does not guarantee a complete grasp of a complex phenomena and it certainly does not free our studies from our personal biases indeed simple qualitative models have brought huge insights and the most elaborate models have been used to justify prejudices thus when measuring ecological integrity or when using any model to define the state of ecosystems it is necessary to recognize the assumptions and value judgments behind our criteria and to understand their limitations furthermore rather than trying to assess phenomena with one all inclusive model it is a better strategy to employ several smaller models with different assumptions and different trade offs between interpretability precision generality and realism levins 1966 6 glossary information theory information theory is the mathematical treatment of the concepts parameters and rules governing the transmission of messages through communication systems abstractly information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty network theory the study of graphs as representation of relationships between discrete objects with the use of nodes and edges with certain attributes types of ecological networks adaptive

produce in the interacting species hence the community matrix can include 0 0 0 0 0 0 or 0 0 extended food webs multiple interaction networks where trophic interactions are modelled through differential equations which then incorporate non trophic interactions as functional modifiers or their parameters multilayer networks networks where a set of physical nodes exist in several layers with each layer representing a particular aspect of layering for example interaction type and both intralayer and interlayer nodes multiple interaction networks networks that encompass different types

of the amount of disturbance a system can take without shifting to an alternate regime assuming there are various stable states engineering resilience is the rate at which a system returns after a disturbance to the equilibrium state assuming that there is only one stable state holling 1996 gunderson 2000 robustness relates to the durability of the stability of the system it is a measure of the amount of disturbance an ecosystem can endure before it changes to a different state loreau et al 2002 in network analysis it is often measured as the ability of the system to resist extinction cascades borrvall et al 2000 dunne et al 2002a stability linear used in theoretical studies where each entry of the community or jacobian matrix usually quantifies the change in population growth rate of species i caused by a small perturbation in the abundance of species j around an equilibrium novak et al 2016 linear stability is defined by the real part of the leading eigenvalue of the jacobian matrix if it is positive the equilibrium is unstable otherwise it is stable moreover if stable the inverse of the absolute value of the real part of the leading eigenvalue gives an indication of the time needed by the system to return to its equilibrium a measure of resilience global vs local stability implies that any vs small perturbation from the equilibrium will be dampened stability structural it refers to the probability of coexistence of all the species in the ecosystem an equilibrium at which all the species coexist with positive abundances is called feasible the region in parameter space for which the system has a feasible equilibrium is its domain of stable coexistence and its size gives a probability of its structural stability the bigger the domain the more structurally stable the system is rohr et al 2014 sustainability the most frequently quoted definition is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs measures of network structure adapted from landi et al 2018 connectance total number of realized interactions divided by the number of possible interactions

24278,evaluating the state of ecosystems is a major concern for humanity for that purpose the concept of ecological integrity has been present in both public policy and academia for decades here the concept is reviewed from its origin as an ambiguous notion through the main discourses and concepts associated with it over time and its main critiques it is shown that a shift towards complexity sciences has permeated the study of ecosystems functioning over the last years and two main pathways have been taken network theory and information theory and that the concept of integrity has been gradually replaced by more transparent terms focusing on network theory i first review developments in single interaction networks and find that a lack of consensus has characterized results in this area partly due to the restrictions of these methodologies then i review recent advances in networks that allow for multiple types of interactions and spatiotemporal scales highlighting the kind of insights that can be gained from each methodology and the questions ahead implementing these new frameworks will likely continue to bring novel insights into the functioning of ecosystems and how different management strategies contribute to it keywords ecological integrity ecological networks multiple interaction networks high order interactions data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction assessing ecological integrity the word integrity was first used in the context of ecology by the famous environmentalist aldo leopold in 1949 leopold 1949 and it has been present in public policy at an international level since its appearance in the 1972 u s clean water act barbour et al 2000 soon after karr and coworkers defined it for the first time as the ability to support and maintain a balanced adaptive community of organisms having a species composition diversity and functional organization comparable to that of natural habitats within a region and started using it to evaluate aquatic environments karr 1981 karr and dudley 1981 they also said that it is the ability to withstand and recover from perturbations ideas that are now embedded in the concepts of resistance and resilience andreasen et al 2001 according to manuel navarrete and coworkers 2004 the main discourses around integrity have evolved as follows i early conceptualizations of integrity considered it as a measure of pristineness as a state of the environment when humans are absent that can be measured empirically and objectively these ideas prevailed during the seventies and eighties ii in the nineties ecosystems started to be thought of as dynamic systems whose integrity falls in their ability to deal with perturbations attention shifted from elements to processes but the existence of an objective ideal state was still present and it was still supposed to be measured independently of social values iii later complex systems theory permeated integrity conceptions along with the notion of alternate equilibriums the role of science became providing information on how different ecological regimes could be pursued and their compatibility with socially dictated values was now acknowledged as an important factor for determining integrity manuel navarrete et al 2004 nevertheless these ideas have not replaced each other rather they coexist and it is not uncommon to find elements from the three of them in a single paper in this review i ask how integrity is measured according to the three main discourses around it i show how concepts like resilience robustness stability sustainability see glossary and others have been historically linked to integrity as they have been explicitly or implicitly regarded as proxies for it as a part of it or even used as synonyms for it i refrain from aligning myself with a particular definition of integrity as my goal is for the reader to know that its definition is changing and to understand the different meanings and implications it has had nevertheless i align with those authors who consider a better choice to use these last concepts alone without obscuring them with the use of integrity and the sense of morality it entails marris and rohwer 2022 i focus on the complexity based approach to these concepts particularly the analysis of ecological networks has brought major insights in the way ecological communities are structured and how this affects their dynamics this is why i include research that does not necessarily claim to measure integrity but deals with some of the mentioned concepts and with structure dynamic relationships i review the principal insights that the study of single interaction networks has brought on how structure and dynamics of ecosystems influence each other and then i review the more recent advances on multiple interaction networks and adaptive networks to show how they promise to expand our understanding of the mechanisms that shape ecological systems 2 the very changing definitions of ecological integrity 2 1 origins the healthy ecosystems most research traces the concept of ecological integrity to aldo leopold whose ideas on environmental ethics greatly influenced the movement for wildlife conservation in the u s barillas 1996 betancourt 2014 it was in his essay the land ethic that he wrote a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise leopold 1949 he did not define the concept but leopold s thinking had a major influence on environmental public policy and by 1972 the clean water act which is the federal law that governs water pollution in the u s mentioned integrity in its primary goal restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of our nation s waters from there it was included in many other public policy documents and in the scientific agenda a reality that continues to this day karr 1993 kim and bosselmann 2015 nonetheless it was until 1981 that james karr and his co workers gave the first formal definition in the context of aquatic environments karr and dudley 1981 during these first years scientists focused on the development of indexes to measure integrity noss 1990 o connell et al 1998 karr and chu 1999 karr 1981 developed the first index of biotic integrity ibi in order to assess the quality of water resources which was based on the richness of fish species trophic composition and health of individuals this index was quickly implemented in policy in the u s and europe plafkin et al 1989 kerans and karr 1994 with agencies and states adapting it to their particular goals e g oberdorff and hughes 1992 in these approaches ecological integrity is continuously compared to an organism s health and measurements are compared to an optimal unperturbed condition evaluations should reflect the multivariate nature of biological systems karr 1993 hence indexes are multimetric and should be relative to expected regional conditions at various scales as such they are aimed to detect the position of an ecosystem along a gradient of degradation and help identify the factors responsible for it even though karr himself advised caution about the adherence to a strict human health metaphor noting that biological assemblages are not precise analogues of mammalian bodies he still called for the expansion of the health concept and the convergence of medicine and ecology on ecological integrity mixed with formal definitions these researchers too often included ambiguous notions for example that systems have integrity when their inherent potential is realized and its condition is stable complete or undivided karr 1993 these concepts were commonly mixed with an ethical view of nature conservation in which integrity was deemed as an indicator of goodness in ecosystems lemons and westra 1995 this ethical view of nature since the eighteenth century through leopold and well into contemporary conservationism has too often been used to justify the exclusion of local residents from their lands mainly native americans and black people in order to protect an ideally pristine wilderness dowie 2011 sarkar 2021 andreasen et al 2001 discuss the optimal condition that serves as point of comparison for integrity indexes according to them the optimum condition is that in which naturalness is present but they define naturalness as something of great esthetic and spiritual importance a quality that should be measured in relation to what would have happened in america if the european settlers had not interfered as in all studies following this discourse an artificial dichotomy between human and nature is present in the idealization of pristineness a notion that has permeated american environmentalism since its origins and which is deeply plagued with racist and colonial biases sarkar 2021 this integrity discourse continues to be used and it is materialized for example in the natural parks system in the u s where a pristine nucleus is assumed to represent the optimal condition buffer areas are sought to be kept healthy and the rest is regarded merely as a human polluted area woodley 1990 parks canada 2001 its measurement relies on experts who are supposed to determine integrity empirically through indicators and inform legislators who in turn execute commands to maintain it manuel navarrete et al 2004 2 2 systemic approaches beginning in the nineties integrity discourses started to emphasize the dynamic nature of ecosystems and attention was put in their ability to self organize in this discourse integrity lies in the systems capacity to deal with perturbations so the concepts of resilience and resistance are fully adopted kay 1991 it is acknowledged that all ecosystems are influenced by humans so pristineness is no longer the main focus there is still an assumption of a better overall direction for ecosystem evolution but integrity is now about how much can they deviate from it without arriving at an irreversible change manuel navarrete et al 2004 holling s ideas on alternate attractors and adaptive cycles were very influential for this conception holling 2001 disturbances are deviations from the so called attractors and management s goal is to keep these deviations from pushing the system into a different attractor in this discourse ecosystem function is more relevant than its composition so functional groups are measured instead of species and aspects like redundancy are rendered important to attenuate the effects of species loss research focuses on processes not elements resilience which is generally understood as the ability of a system to deal with perturbations and reorganize in the face of changes maintaining its structure functioning and identity walker et al 2004 is the main wanted characteristic nonetheless some authors have pointed out that caution should be had when applying this concept mainly resilience is understood as an intrinsically positive and desired property of ecosystems biggs et al 2012 but it is generally measured from an ahistorical point of view which ignores the power relations and conflicts that influence the systems olsson et al 2015 stojanovic et al 2016 moreover some critics have said that the resilience framework can be used to justify and perpetuate the status quo thus maintaining unequal power relations in order to avoid this resilience studies should specify what it is that we are seeking to maintain for whom and in the face of what walker and cooper 2011 cretney 2014 cretney and bond 2014 this caution however is lacking in the integrity analyses that fall into this discourse in these studies the ethical imperative of preserving nature remains present and it is presumed to be objective instead of recognizing the interests behind of what is trying to be preserved this is reflected in the fact that even though management is now supposed to be adaptive meaning that it should evolve in the face of the social and ecological changes these changes are rendered inevitable and implementation schemes are done through top down policy making ecological integrity is still deemed as an objective state that can be determined by scientific experts by understanding structural relations this discourse was broadly adopted in north america born and sonzogni 1995 for example parrish et al 2003 outline a way to measure ecological integrity that has been used within protected areas this consists of selecting target taxa then identifying ecological attributes that are key for them and defining an acceptable range of variation for these attributes the status of each target is rated through an assessment of the state of their ecological attributes and they are combined into an overall measure of the whole area the ecological attributes are the focus of management not the species themselves instead of being compared with an optimum value they are allowed to vary inside an acceptable range which is obtained from sources like ecological models expert knowledge and comparisons with similar systems and among gradients of disturbance with the adoption of holling s ideas ecological integrity entered the realm of the complexity sciences and the consolidation of these ideas along with the recognition of social values gave birth to a third discourse manuel navarrete et al 2004 in it the role of science shifts from discovering an objectively better state of ecosystems to facilitating negotiation among conflicting values the possibility of different ecological regimes to have integrity is recognized and science s job is no longer to decide which one is correct but to say what the different ecological regimes look like and the trade offs involved in management actions integrity in this discourse is determined by the states that are both biophysically possible and compatible with the needs of a society characterized by diverse and often conflicting values methods overall are the same as before but they incorporate uncertainty and the fact that the criteria by which one makes decisions are subjective examples of this conceptualization is the ecosystem based management which has been applied for example in the great lakes basin of the u s konisky and beierle 2001 and the environmental integrated management born and sonzogni 1995 another example is collaborative management in which stakeholder s values are considered dynamical and an emphasis is made on the process of learning so their opinions on management can change and common interests can be discovered saarikoski 2000 allen et al 2001 several limitations to this approach have been pointed out for example that different social actors usually come from different positions of power so weighing their interests on an equal basis can result in an artificial sense of justice that overshadows political differences and historical debts luke 2002 instead the interests of local and historically marginalized actors should be prioritized as they are the first affected by environmental management strategies indeed it has been shown that the demands of local social movements have historically been at the front of many environmental causes with academia and public institutions summing up later so listening to the demands of people and providing them with social learning spaces and tools for capacity building can be a better management strategy stirling 2019 in an example of this last approach some groups have developed games that are based on a system s driving processes for example the ecological network associated with a coffee agroecosystem which involves direct and trait mediated interactions that shape an autonomous pest control system was translated into a board game that enables peasants to reflect on the role of biodiversity in their systems garcía barrios et al 2016 on another example farmers that share the irrigation systems of the senegal river valley used a role playing game in order to discuss different strategies of co ordination amongst themselves barreteau et al 2003 through playing local social actors can grasp the complex dynamics of a biological system and to analyze the implications of different management decisions which they can then take into their hands see also garcía barrios et al 2008 speelman et al 2014 garcía barrios et al 2015 and speelman and garcía barrios 2006 for more examples on the use of games for promoting learning and decision making in various socio ecological systems 2 3 novel approaches from a complexity viewpoint mainly in the last decade complexity based approaches to integrity have thrived along two pathways namely network theory and information theory equihua et al 2020 while both approaches aim to understand the function of complex phenomena through the use of mathematical formalisms network theory does it by analyzing the structure of connected entities while information theory looks in the response variables of a system for activity patterns i will briefly describe the main proposals of the information theory approach and then focus on network based analyses even though i present the most recent advances in methodological terms most of them fall into the second discourse of integrity this is approaches with a systemic view of biological assemblages that use tools from complexity theory but that lack the incorporation of explicit social values and power relations equihua et al 2020 review and propose information theory as a unifying framework to understand ecological integrity and resilience which they treat as different but linked concepts for them integrity is defined by the particular structure and functions of ecosystems and resilience is their ability to preserve them in the face of perturbations for equihua and co workers integrity arises from processes of self organization derived from thermodynamic mechanisms that operate through the existing biota as well as the energy and materials at their disposal until attaining optimal operational points which vary according to changes in the biophysical conditions equihua et al 2014 equihua et al 2020 they point out the main approaches for assessing integrity with information theory the first one is through the concept of ascendancy a measure of information flow gustavson et al 2002 saint béat et al 2015 explain that to understand ascendancy two kinds of stability must be differentiated a system with high inner stability has inner constraints typical of an organized structure which results in high ascendancy on the other hand low ascendancy is linked to redundancy which makes ecosystems resilient to external disturbances too little ascendancy is interpreted as a lack of internal constraints whereas too much of it makes them inflexible and vulnerable to external perturbations so ecosystems should have intermediate ascendancy levels a second approach to integrity returns to the concepts of ecosystem health and stability ramírez carrillo and collaborators 2018 propose an ecosystem health index based on the notion of criticality which they define as a balance between order and disorder in the fluctuations of the system s state variables according to these authors healthy ecosystems have state variables like respiration whose fluctuations are characterized by pink noise which happens when fluctuation autocorrelation is intermediate between zero which they associate to the system s adaptability and high values which they associate with robustness several authors have found evidence of this criticality in physiological processes such as heart activity and they have associated it with a healthy state ivanov et al 1996 rivera et al 2016 however exciting this line of research may be we should be cautious about the analogy between human and ecosystem health a strict analogy would require the existence of an unequivocally optimum condition for ecosystems and homeostatic processes that maintain it even though there may be mechanisms that enable ecosystems to be disturbed without profound structural or functional changes they are fundamentally different from homeostatic processes because the components of ecosystems do not function as a co dependent unit like organs in a body do ecosystems may change but they do not die altogether wicklum and davies 1995 in this sense monitoring variables such as ecosystem respiration certainly gives information on the ecosystem s state but is not equivalent to monitoring vital signs in an organism and hence they cannot be used to objectively call an ecosystem s state good or bad finally cabezas et al 2005 proposed the fisher information index to measure variation and order as conditions relevant for sustainability for further developments of this idea see ahmad et al 2016 very ordered systems have a fisher information that tends to zero while disordered systems have a high fisher information the thesis proposed by frieden and gatenby 2010 is that systems in stable dynamic states have constant fisher information while changes in it can signal regime changes their results are consistent with michaelian 2005 ideas about ecosystem stability and entropy where stable ecosystems have higher values of entropy as we can see information theory approaches to integrity have focused on the balance between order and disorder fisher information and criticality approaches or constraint and flexibility ascendancy approach they are phenomenological approaches since they do not seek to find out the mechanisms behind the state variables that are measured these methodologies benefit from the huge amounts of data on ecological phenomena that are now available a major challenge to these developments is to distinguish quality from quantity in their choice of data and to be cautious as to the applicability of their analogies and assumptions 3 ecological networks the study of ecological assemblages with network theory has brought a great number of insights about the processes governing them the multiplicity of contexts in which networks have been applied just in the science of ecology is outstanding of course all these developments have not been without controversy as the search of general relations between structure and function of networks has often given contradicting results here i will start by reviewing the major topics and results brought on by the study of single interaction networks and then move on to more recent proposals involving adaptive networks spatially distributed networks and multiple interaction networks most of these studies do not refer explicitly to ecological integrity but they all measure relationships between structure and function of ecosystems and use resilience stability robustness and other better defined concepts that have been related to ecological integrity i will focus on the kind of insights that have been gained with each methodological approach and how they contribute to our knowledge of the state of ecosystems 3 1 single interaction networks the majority of research on network theory has focused on networks composed of nodes representing species or functional groups and which are connected by a single type of ecological interaction mainly antagonic e g herbivory predation parasitism mutualistic e g pollination or competitive landi and collaborators 2018 reviewed publications on these three types of networks and synthesized their main questions and findings overall these studies focus on finding the relationships between some structural characteristics of the networks and their function measured as robustness stability resilience and other concepts that were discussed in earlier sections generally there is a lack of consensus in many of the relationships that have been studied which is probably due to methodological differences and working definitions in addition to the intrinsic complexity that stems from the numerous elements processes and scales that interact to give rise to these qualities ives and carpenter 2007 the main structural characteristics that have been measured are species richness connectance weighted connectance connectivity linkage density weighted linkage density species strength species dependance modularity and nestedness these features have usually been studied as independent variables and the corresponding dependent variables have been linear stability resilience persistence structural stability extinction cascade robustness and invasibility in the most simplified way to put it the overall question asked has been if these independent variables have a positive or a negative effect on the dependent variables but different answers have often been provided by researchers using different methodologies both empirical and theoretical for a comprehensive review on the impacts of structural properties on network function see landi and collaborators 2018 here i will summarize the main findings in order to show the overwhelming diversity of answers that have been given to this question and how they vary depending on the type of network used trophic mutualistic or competitive and general methodology 3 1 1 species richness early ideas on the topic mainly said that enhanced diversity made ecosystems stable through species limiting each other s growth through predation or competition thus preventing destabilizing outbreaks odum 1953 macarthur 1955 elton 2020 these notions remained unchallenged until the now classic work of robert may 1972 using linear stability analyses he showed that communities modelled as random networks lose stability as the number of species the number of interactions or their strength rise these results have been causing controversy for decades as they seem counterintuitive in the face of the staggering biodiversity of some of the world s ecosystems the work of may conveyed all interaction types as the sign of the elements in the community matrix could be positive or negative since then researchers have tackled the issue mostly with single interaction networks and the result has been a general lack of consensus for example in networks defined by predation or competition richness has been found to have both a positive and a negative effect on integrity related concepts like stability robustness productivity invasibility feasibility coexistance and diversity pimm 1979 lawlor 1980 pimm 1980 tilman and downing 1994 tilman 1999 borrvall et al 2000 dunne et al 2002a christianou and kokkoris 2008 dunne and williams 2009 fowler 2009 gross et al 2009 maynard et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 maureaud et al 2020 on the other hand in mutualistic communities there has been more consensus around a positive relationship between species richness and both resilience and persistence okuyama and holland 2008 thebault fontaine 2010 vidal et al 2020 3 1 2 connectance and connectivity there is also widespread controversy around the relationship between connectance and community function with many studies supporting both positive and negative relationships depending on the methods used to generate theoretical networks or the particular empirical dataset landi et al 2018 for food webs and competition networks connectance and connectivity have been found to have a positive effect on stability haydon 2000 fowler 2009 van altena et al 2016 baumgartner 2020 while in mutualistic webs they have had both positive and negative effects on local stability propagation of perturbations extinction cascades persistence and resilience okuyama and holland 2008 thebault fontaine 2010 allesina and tang 2012 james et al 2012 suweis et al 2015 vieira and almeida neto 2015 3 1 3 degree distribution the degree distribution of networks has been associated with their capacity to persist and different distributions have been found to characterize different types of networks food webs have a degree distribution that differs from a poisson which is typical of random webs aside from that the specific distributions associated with food webs have been highly controversial and different authors have found different fits for example the exponential distribution has been commonly found camacho et al 2002 dunne et al 2002b a uniform distribution has also been associated with webs with high connectance and power law and truncated power law distributions have been found for communities with very low connectance dunne et al 2002b montoya sole 2002 in mutualistic networks a major interest has been the proportion of generalists against specialists jordano et al 2003 found truncated power laws which is in agreement with the idea that mutualistic webs have a high prevalence of specialists and rare super generalists okuyama 2008 found a gamma distribution the impact of degree distribution on network function is also debated as feng and takemoto 2014 found that heterogeneity in node degree distribution negatively affects their local stability while james et al 2012 found that individual node degrees are good predictors of species survival 3 1 4 strength of interactions working with weighted interactions has brought a lot of new insights to our knowledge of ecological networks variability in link strength has been found to be related with trophic network stability and it has been commonly observed in empirical networks berlow et al 2004 wootton and emmerson 2005 in particular the existence of many weak interactions and few strong ones appears to promote stability by dampening oscillations or reducing the amount of intraspecific competition needed for stability mccann et al 1998 neutel et al 2002 thebault fontaine 2010 van altena et al 2016 emmerson and yearsley 2004 supported these findings but only when omnivory is present in contrast allesina and pascual 2008 found that stability is robust to changes in the strength of the jacobian elements further allesina and tang 2012 showed that a preponderance of weak interactions decreases the probability of communities to be stable a result previously found with different methods by borrvall et al 2000 a different approximation has been the use of bioenergetic models where interaction strengths are parameterized according to body mass ratios emmerson raffaelli 2004 and otto et al 2007 show that such scaling promotes stability in food webs considered together with trophic interactions it is recognized that adding intraspecific competition negative terms on the diagonal of the interaction or community matrix increases stability haydon 1994 furthermore de angelis 1975 found that a bias towards strong self regulation of the species at higher trophic levels stabilizes food webs haydon 2000 showed that a high connectance between highly and weakly self regulated components is required in mutualistic networks the strength of interactions is often inferred by the relative number of visits of pollinators to the plant doing so jordano 1987 and bascompte et al 2006 found an even stronger skewness towards weak interactions the last one also found that while animals depend strongly on the plants plants rely poorly on their animal pollinators or seed dispersers bascompte et al 2006 concluding that both heterogeneity in interaction strength distribution and asymmetry of species dependences facilitate the maintenance of biodiversity the ability of the system to reduce the propagation of perturbations had been linked to connectance as shown above but suweis et al 2015 found that heterogeneity in interaction strength distribution also contributes to it even though most studies agree on this issue there have been exceptions who have found the opposite relationships okuyama and holland 2008 feng and takemoto 2014 also rohr et al 2014 showed that the distribution of interaction strength had no impact on structural stability and that it was an average high strength that mattered 3 1 5 modularity and nestedness it has almost been accepted that food webs have a more modular structure than other types of networks and that this is related to their stability along with a weakly connected arquitecture many studies reported that modularity increased the stability or the persistence of food webs moore and hunt 1988 ives et al 2000 krause et al 2003 thebault fontaine 2010 stouffer and bascompte 2011 however grilli and collaborators 2016 used a random networks approach to show that modularity influences stability in different ways depending on other parameters like connectance mean interaction strength variance correlation and size of modules for mutualistic networks nestedness has proven a more important feature than modularity while olesen et al 2007 and mello et al 2011 noticed that modularity is present in some mutualist networks and that it tends to increase as webs get bigger thebault and fontaine 2010 emphasized that its effect on persistence and resilience is negative nestedness on the other hand has been accepted as a characteristic topological feature of mutualist networks bascompte et al 2003 it has been shown to prevent extinction cascades memmott et al 2004 enable coexistence bastolla et al 2009 increase persistence and resilience okuyama and holland 2008 thebault fontaine 2010 and maximize the parameter domain that leads to stable and feasible equilibriums rohr et al 2014 however this has also been refuted by some studies for example james et al 2012 studied 59 empirical webs and found nestedness to be a secondary covariate to the number of mutualistic partners which they found to be a better causal predictor enabling coexistence allesina and tang 2012 found local stability to be negatively affected by nestedness and campbell et al 2012 showed that extreme nestedness promotes extinction cascades in conclusion basically all structure function relationships that have been studied in single interaction networks have been controversial aside from methodological differences the big number of contradicting results may be because almost none of them have controlled for the influence of other types of ecological interactions nor have they studied temporal changes in their properties if there are generalities to be found in the relationship between the structural and functional features of ecological networks it may be that a broader view is necessary in the next section we will see approaches that tackle these shortcomings 3 2 multiple interaction networks spatial networks and adaptive networks it has become clear that the effects of different types of interactions need to be assessed in order to understand ecosystems sander et al 2015 soliveres et al 2015 golubski et al 2016 kéfi et al 2016 pilosof et al 2017 in addition to all the structural features discussed above for single interaction networks communities that take into account various types of interactions will probably be influenced at least by 1 the proportion of the different interaction types 2 the relative strength of interactions within and among interaction types and 3 the structural properties of each sub network and the overall aggregated network garcía callejas et al 2018 the recollection of empirical data on multiple interaction networks can be challenging as even single interaction networks are commonly undersampled chacoff et al 2012 and quantifying interaction strength requires a huge sampling effort berlow et al 2004 strategies for multiple interaction network construction have basically been aggregating data from previous work with a particular network kefi et al 2015 or the design of massive sampling programs following this second strategy pocock et al 2012 sampled different habitats in an agroecosystem in the uk obtaining a network containing trophic mutualistic and parasitic sub networks they showed that overall the sub networks robustness did not strongly covary suggesting that restoration programs aimed at benefiting one functional group will not necessarily benefit the others on the other hand they found that some species were disproportionately linked to species in all sub graphs suggesting that a better strategy for restoration should focus on them as for estimating interaction strength evidence seems to support a neutral view of interactions in which their frequency can be approximated as the result of random encounters mediated by the relative abundances of the populations involved and their frequency can be in turn used as a proxy for their strength canard et al 2012 2014 faust and raes 2012 araújo and rozenfeld 2014 cazelles et al 2016 garcía callejas et al 2018 reviewed developments on multiple interaction networks which have only appeared in the last decade and recognized three non exclusive methodologies extended food webs equal footing networks and multilayer networks see their paper for a complete list of articles published with each methodology these are differentiated based on how different interactions are classified either by the general positive negative or null effect they produce on other species or by the particular mechanism by which the interaction occurs whether they are expressed in the same units or not these three approaches have different assumptions and are best at addressing different kinds of questions 3 2 1 extended food webs extended food webs take trophic interactions as the backbone of the community whose dynamic is modelled through differential equations e g lotka volterra but which incorporate non trophic interactions as functional modifiers of the equation s parameters for example arditi et al 2005 built a model of mass conservation in which non trophic positive interactions that can be understood as mutualisms have a positive effect on the species ability to efficiently incorporate nutrients into their biomass importantly this effect of non trophic interactions was found to be much stronger than that of species richness in the web arditi et al 2005 inserted non trophic interactions as modifiers of the elements of the community matrix aij meaning that the population density of species k modulates the trophic interaction between two other species i and j without directly affecting the population densities of either of them this kind of mechanism has also been called high order interactions by bairey et al 2016 and they have been shown to promote community linear stability in random networks they have also been documented empirically for example in agroecosystems vandermeer et al 2010 describe an ecological network composed of the main coffee pests and their natural enemies in a diversified coffee plantation where they find that a series of high order interactions are essential to regulate the pest population densities resulting in an autonomous pest control system more recently kefi et al 2012 extended the methodology by arditi et al 2005 to allow for non trophic interactions to influence any parameter of a food web dynamic model for example reproduction and mortality rates migration rates or others according to the mechanism by which they happen for example the provisioning of nesting sites by some species positively affects the reproduction rate of another species or foot stamping by big mammals can increase mortality rates of some herbs in this way extended food webs have the potential to include direct and indirect effects on unlimited biological detail at the cost of an ever increasing number of parameters and larger equations 3 2 2 equal footing networks in equal footing networks it is assumed that all kinds of interaction mechanisms can be summarized by the positive negative or null effect they produce in the species growth rate so they are all aggregated in the elements of the community matrix aij instead of being modelled with auxiliary equations hence the community matrix includes all possible pairwise combinations 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 at the cost of losing detail about the mechanisms that produce the effect equal footing networks gain generality and scalability as the number of parameters does not increase so fast this approach was used to show that local stability is enhanced by a combination of trophic and mutualistic interactions mougi and kondoh 2012 kondoh and mougi 2015 afterwards they expanded their studies to show that commensalism and amensalism mougi 2016a also increase local stability since equal footing networks can be modelled with the same equations as single interaction networks and their stability can be analyzed in the same way they are a natural opportunity to compare results with one and many types of interactions it may still be too soon to say but studies so far indicate that networks with many interaction types are more locally stable than their counterparts garcía callejas et al 2018 3 2 3 multilayer networks pilosof et al 2017 formally defined multilayer networks as 1 a set of physical nodes representing entities for example species ii a set of layers which can include multiple aspects of layering for example interaction type iii a set of state nodes each of which corresponds to the state of the physical node on a specific layer and iv a set of edges to connect the state nodes to each other in a pairwise fashion the edge set includes both the familiar intralayer edges and interlayer ones this idea has already been used in areas like engineering economy or social network analysis see boccaletti et al 2014 and kivelä et al 2014 for reviews for representing the dynamics of a multilayer network state nodes in each layer can be modelled with a particular equation corresponding to one type of interaction and auxiliary equations may connect the state of nodes of a given entity in different layers such inter layer links may represent any kind of relationship between layers which makes this approach particularly flexible of course this entails the difficulty of choosing how to define them garcía callejas et al 2018 the application of multilayer networks in ecology has begun to show that communities when many kinds of interactions are considered are highly structured melián et al 2009 kéfi et al 2015 and that this has repercussions on different community properties pocock et al 2012 evans et al 2013 kéfi et al 2016 for example kéfi et al 2016 combine a multilayer and an extended food web approach as i have said these methodologies are non exclusive to analyze a marine ecosystem they find that hundreds of nodes and links belonging to trophic positive non trophic and negative non trophic interactions form a strikingly simple 3 d structure with few modules that are taxonomically coherent and easily interpreted in terms of species traits e g mobile consumers sessile habitat facilitators competing primary producers etc they also found that the structure of non trophic interactions allow for a higher persistence and total biomass than what would be expected from their random allocation this approach is a powerful tool as it can provide a way to analyze the importance of different interaction types in processes such as population dynamics and properties such as resilience it can also give a broader definition of node centrality which can be used as a proxy for finding keystone species that can incorporate their participation in several types of interaction pilosof et al 2017 interestingly the equal footing framework can be thought of as a particular type of multilayer framework in which all layers are flattened into a single one erasing inter layer links and making each node simultaneously affected by all interaction types garcía callejas et al 2018 melián et al 2009 provide an example of an equal footing model made from a multilayer dataset 3 2 4 spatial and temporal variables in networks as the reader may already have noticed layers in a multilayer network can not only represent different types of interaction but also different moments in time different spatial locations levels of organization or group identities pilosof et al 2017 for example layers can represent patches while interlayer edges can represent species dispersal between them or layers can represent seasons and while interlayer edges can be changes in the species abundance spatially defined multilayer networks can help explore the stability of communities under different spatial patterns and help advance metacommunity theory these multilayer objects can be thought of as networks of networks where habitat patches are the nodes of a spatial network across the landscape and each at the same time contains a local network of species interaction with each other single interaction networks have already explored spatiality for example bunn et al 2000 used a focal species analysis with a graph approach to landscape connectivity in the coastal plain of north carolina they built graphs using gis to define habitat patches and determined the functional distance between them with least cost path modeling performing edge and node removals they analyzed how species with different dispersal capacities perceived the landscape and each patch s role in maintaining connectivity a similar study using the mexican spotted owl can be found in urban and keitt 2001 these approaches have proven useful for conservation planning at a landscape scale according to reza and abdullah 2011 a regional index of integrity should incorporate measures on fragmentation and landscape connectivity among others the use of multilayer networks promises to improve them by allowing researchers to study the impact of environmental changes landscape and species at the same time and recent frameworks are seeking to organize how we deal with these new tools fortin et al 2021 on the other hand networks that change through time have been called adaptive networks and their analysis has revealed that important structural changes take place in communities according to seasonal or successional changes villa galaviz et al 2012 lópez carretero et al 2014 saavedra et al 2017 for example in tropical ecosystems with seasonal climatic variation it has been shown that the specialization and structural patterns of plant herbivore networks can dramatically change lópez carretero et al 2014 2018 according to lópez carretero and collaborators 2014 selectivity and modularity of plant herbivore networks decrease during the dry season and in poorly structured habitats as generalist species expand their host preferences in the face of resource limitation this increase in connectance can then reflect species ability to adapt and buffer the negative impacts of disturbance in another study villa galaviz and collaborators 2012 studied the changes in network structure of a plant herbivore community across successional stages of a tropical dry forest by focusing on networks structure rather than on species identities they found that robustness e g low extinction in the face of random node removal was quickly recovered after perturbation as they found no significant differences in robustness related structural measures between mature forests and middle and late successional forests the importance of rewiring interactions in ecological networks has just begun to be understood while the above mentioned studies indicate that changes in interactions do result in structural changes other studies have claimed that these have a minimal effect on network architecture petanidou et al 2008 carstensen et al 2016 trøjelsgaard and olesen 2016 however saavedra et al 2017 demonstrated that network reorganization can play an important role in modulating succession even when global structural properties remain invariable in an interesting fusion of empirical and theoretical analyses they use a lotka volterra competition model calibrated through field observations of plant herbivore interactions shared hosts to study inter annual change in interaction networks and its impact on the persistence of species at different successional stages they found that as time advances network reorganization makes it more and more difficult for new colonizers to establish they used a niche overlap framework macarthur and levins 1967 saavedra et al 2014 to estimate herbivore competition as the number of shared plants and a structural stability analysis rohr et al 2014 to measure inter annual changes in stability and in the parameter space that promoted feasible stable equilibriums they found that early arriving species increase their likelihood of persistence as time advances while the reorganization of their interactions increasingly impedes late arrivers to colonize multilayer networks can also be used to study adaptive networks with layers representing different temporal instances of a community in addition to the insights provided by studies like the ones discussed multilayer networks can provide a unified framework to test hypotheses related to the temporal structure of the community pilosof et al 2017 for example if one has a community that gains and loses species over time the multilayer network would include all species as physical nodes and interlayer connections would represent changes in presence absence status with this one could test if the modular structure in each layer is affected by changes in species persistence by randomly reshuffling interlayer connections and comparing observed patterns to the ones obtained by random equal footing networks can also be used for this purpose for example mougi 2016b showed that communities with antagonistic and mutualistic interactions have an increased stability when there is interaction change across time as these studies exemplify the potential of these frameworks to include multiple types of interactions and temporal or spatial scales at the same time will surely bring us a much more realistic knowledge of ecosystems the relationship between structure and function has been studied in a mainly linear way in which structure is assumed to be the cause of function however structure itself is influenced by function and we have just seen how studies that incorporate different spatial and temporal scales are beginning to shed light on how many ecological evolutionary and social factors can alter them in the last section i will describe some other insights into how these factors can change ecosystems structure and dynamics 4 the forces that shape network structure and function when an ecological network is defined by choosing nodes and links a decision is made on what elements and processes will form the system consequently everything that is not included epistemologically becomes an external force as we have seen there is much to learn on how the internal properties of networks shape each other but this knowledge will not be complete if we do not address the role of the external processes that are left aside here i will show some of the main topics that are currently being studied on how ecological evolutionary and social aspects impact the function of ecological networks this is a very relevant line of work as ecological networks permanently interact with such forces and in the spirit of ensuring ecological integrity understanding their interrelation is necessary to make informed decisions on how to manage ecosystems 4 1 phylogenetics phylogenetic distances are known to influence the probability of species to interact and rapid evolution of functional traits has been demonstrated in several contexts thompson 1998 koch et al 2014 this means that feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary dynamics can influence the structure of networks even at short time scales thompson 1998 fussman et al 2007 montesinos navarro et al 2019 in this context raimundo et al 2018 propose the use of phylogenetically informed adaptive networks for application in restoration ecology according to their proposal eco evolutionary networks using phylogenetically structured interaction data can help predict the results of manipulation species composition in terms of robustness resilience or functional diversity devoto et al 2012 montoya et al 2012 kaiser bunbury et al 2017 for example when an invasive species is added to a network where it lacks eco evolutionary history a rapid adaptive evolution process can be triggered larue et al 2017 resulting in changes in the previous interaction network that may or may not be reversible by simply eliminating the invasive species knowing the phylogenetic background of ecologic systems can thus be relevant for management that looks to preserve its diversity resilience or other integrity linked concepts at the face of species invasion or loss 4 2 species traits species traits like foraging behavior defenses against predation lópez carretero et al 2018 mobility kefi et al 2016 or plasticity gray et al 2021 can shape or restrict interactions among them for example defensive metabolites in some tropical species have been shown to positively correlate to the specialization and diversification of herbivores resulting in plants that maintain a very high herbivore richness kursar et al 2009 becerra 2015 richards et al 2015 also the simultaneous expression of foliar toughness trichome density and phenolic content in plants can influence the strength and selectivity of herbivore plant interactions lópez carretero et al 2018 feeding mechanisms have also been found to be related to network architecture for example granivorous insects leaf miners frugivores leaf chewers and sap suckers are much more specialized and tend to form more modular structures than xylophages and root feeders novotny and basset 2005 lópez carretero et al 2018 when showing plastic responses organisms can have changing effects on their surroundings a phenomena that has been shown to alter the ecosystem services they provide gray et al 2021 in this sense knowledge about how species traits influence their role in communities can hint towards management actions that pays attention to those species which play important or endangered functions 4 3 habitat disturbance disturbance spontaneous or recurrent human induced or not is known to significantly alter ecosystems e g roxburgh et al 2004 krebs et al 2010 changes in tree canopy light availability rainfall patterns or soil cover are just some examples of ecosystem changes that impact species in different ways for example tree removal implies the disappearance of herbivores that depend on them but it can also facilitate the production of young leaves on the remaining plants which suddenly have a better access to light indirectly benefiting other herbivore species lópez carretero et al 2018 indeed habitat changes have been shown to have an impact on network parameters like in the work of valladares et al 2006 2012 who showed how forest loss diminished the richness size and connectance of a plant herbivore network as a function of the remaining fragments size just as lópez carretero et al 2014 found an increase in generalist species and connectance when resources were scarce because of normal seasonal changes araujo et al 2015 found the same tendency in several empirical networks under anthropogenic land use change if we understand how certain disturbances affect different aspects of networks we could design better restoration plans that work in synergy with the tendencies that arise from the systems structure 4 4 agricultural management agriculture is recognized as a major source of ecosystem alteration as it covers around 40 of earth s surface foley et al 2005 nevertheless not many examples exist that analyze agroecosystems from a network perspective pocock et al 2012 bohan et al 2013 the insights that network theory has brought to ecology remain mostly unexploited in the agricultural context a lag in knowledge that must be overcome such a system level approach holds the potential to guide our actions around major issues like autonomous pest control disease outbreaks and biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes vandermeer et al 2010 2018 ramos et al 2018 from an evolutionary perspective agroecosystems are tightly integrated ensembles because they are subjected to artificial selection at both the species and the community levels a characteristic that distinguishes them from other ecosystems the study of agroecosystems could thus help us address how selection on multiple species assemblages shapes ecosystem structure and function benítez et al 2014 a very interesting line of research deals with the repercussions of different types of agricultural management on ecosystem structure and function for example sosa aranda et al 2018 showed that management intensity in coffee plantations decreased lepidopteran diversity but increased leaf damage this suggests that as shade trees are removed with increasing management intensity a few specialist species are lost but many herbivores that normally feed on trees are recruited by coffee explaining the higher leaf damage importantly this implies that non intensive management that favors shade canopy can contribute to the conservation of lepidoptera while also decreasing leaf damage to coffee plants on a different approach vandermeer et al 2018 modelled the dynamics of the coffee rust disease using spatially explicit networks and found that the patterns formed by plants that are below a critical distance from each other have an effect on the transmission process because planting density changes with management intensity this implies that plantations along an intensity gradient will have infection rates that could presumably alter the outcome of the disease because agriculture alters landscapes the impact of different management types should also be assessed at broad spatial scales it has been shown that patches of habitat distributed among an agricultural matrix can show source sink dynamics perfecto and vandermeer 2015 furthermore different types of agricultural management play a role in determining how different species perceive the landscape and whether they are able to sustain viable populations in it or not perfecto et al 2009 in a metacommunity approach using multiple interaction networks ramos et al 2018 showed that the combination of habitat availability spatial distribution of habitat fragments and permeability of agricultural patches regulates the persistence of species at a landscape level these and other applications of network theory can help farmers and other social actors in the assessment of different management scenarios with differential repercussions on the function of ecosystems 5 conclusion given that the term ecological integrity is commonly employed in the public agenda i have exposed its evolution and implications however this revision coincides with recent work which has questioned the pertinence of the concept because of its loose definitions rohwer and marris 2021 marris and rohwer 2022 it is true that in the name of ecological integrity many methods for assessing monitoring and managing ecosystems have been created and that they have proven useful tools to counter the degradation of ecosystems karr et al 2022 nevertheless employing the concept of integrity obscures the fact that a judgement of value has been made in order to determine the state variables that are deemed desirable such as biodiversity or resilience and it obscures for whom and by whom these cultural preferences are being defined marris and rohwer 2022 like the most recent approaches with ecological networks show terms with formal definitions such as richness persistence or functional diversity are a better choice for assessing the state of ecosystems and they should be accompanied by a clear statement of why these aspects are deemed desirable following this logic i focused on the most recent methodological tools for assessing ecosystems from a complexity framework particularly with ecological networks i reviewed how single interaction networks have been used to study the relationships between structure and function of biotic assemblages highlighting the contradicting results that probably stem from both methodological differences and the real word complexities that these studies have left aside then i showed recent advances in multiple interaction networks and adaptive networks that bring a more realistic view of ecosystems by allowing the integration of several types of interactions and any spatial and temporal scales in the same analysis together these studies have taught us a lot about the way in which interactions among species shape their dynamics and how these dynamics can in turn change their interactions exciting lines of research have started to evaluate the role of cultural evolutionary and other ecological processes in the shaping of networks for example studies on succession have revealed that networks rewire through time in a non random way that has an effect on the persistence of species through its different stages villa galaviz et al 2012 saavedra et al 2017 also phylogenetic history and body traits can inform on the probability of species to interact with each other a fact that can be used both to infer present networks and to build possible evolutionary scenarios raimundo et al 2018 finally some studies have assessed the effects on ecological networks of important human activities like agricultural management and land use change de araújo et al 2015 ramos et al 2018 sosa aranda et al 2018 together these frameworks can be used to answer questions that can guide the management of natural resources at different spatiotemporal scales and inform on the effects of human activities on ecosystems such as production restoration and conservation this review showed that the study of the state of ecosystems is an area in continuous development the analysis of the relationships between the structure and function of ecosystems has led to a diversity of frameworks from integrity indexes to complex network analyses along the way concepts have evolved from being morally charged to being formally defined and implicit subjectivities are starting to get recognized as frameworks are increasingly able to encompass different types of processes and scales future challenges will probably include how to balance weights and assign units to qualitatively different processes how to couple different spatial and temporal scales and how to deal with the increasing number of parameters that tend to come with more detailed models although computational capacity keeps increasing researchers will need to be careful not to get lost in ever increasing models to the point of losing interpretability additionally no model is ever complete or free from the subjectivities of those who make it so caution should be taken to avoid confusing the use of complexity based tools with the use of a complexity based philosophy the use of huge amounts of data and sophisticated models does not guarantee a complete grasp of a complex phenomena and it certainly does not free our studies from our personal biases indeed simple qualitative models have brought huge insights and the most elaborate models have been used to justify prejudices thus when measuring ecological integrity or when using any model to define the state of ecosystems it is necessary to recognize the assumptions and value judgments behind our criteria and to understand their limitations furthermore rather than trying to assess phenomena with one all inclusive model it is a better strategy to employ several smaller models with different assumptions and different trade offs between interpretability precision generality and realism levins 1966 6 glossary information theory information theory is the mathematical treatment of the concepts parameters and rules governing the transmission of messages through communication systems abstractly information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty network theory the study of graphs as representation of relationships between discrete objects with the use of nodes and edges with certain attributes types of ecological networks adaptive networks networks whose structure is allowed to change through time equal footing networks multiple interaction networks where all types of interaction are summarized by the sign of the effect they produce in the interacting species hence the community matrix can include 0 0 0 0 0 0 or 0 0 extended food webs multiple interaction networks where trophic interactions are modelled through differential equations which then incorporate non trophic interactions as functional modifiers or their parameters multilayer networks networks where a set of physical nodes exist in several layers with each layer representing a particular aspect of layering for example interaction type and both intralayer and interlayer nodes multiple interaction networks networks that encompass different types of ecological interactions for example predation mutualism commensalism amensalism etc single interaction networks networks that are defined by only one type of ecological interaction for example food webs or pollination networks concepts linked to ecosystem function adapted from saint béat et al 2015 ramirez carrillo et al 2018 walker et al 2016 landi et al 2018 adaptability self organization in the face of external changes without system level intent or centralized control adaptive cycles characteristic phases for the dynamics of ecosystems characterized by holling 1986 2001 composed of phases of growth and flexibility stabilization and loss of flexibility structure collapse and reorganization extinction cascade measures the loss of additional species after the removal of one target species species removal can be random or targeted invasibility the propensity of a system to be invaded by new species persistence the time for a variable to remain in the same state before changing to a different one pimm and pimm 1991 loreau et al 2002 resilience the capacity of a system to experience perturbations and return to the same structure and functions it follows holling s 1973 notion of the amount of disturbance a system can take without shifting to an alternate regime assuming there are various stable states engineering resilience is the rate at which a system returns after a disturbance to the equilibrium state assuming that there is only one stable state holling 1996 gunderson 2000 robustness relates to the durability of the stability of the system it is a measure of the amount of disturbance an ecosystem can endure before it changes to a different state loreau et al 2002 in network analysis it is often measured as the ability of the system to resist extinction cascades borrvall et al 2000 dunne et al 2002a stability linear used in theoretical studies where each entry of the community or jacobian matrix usually quantifies the change in population growth rate of species i caused by a small perturbation in the abundance of species j around an equilibrium novak et al 2016 linear stability is defined by the real part of the leading eigenvalue of the jacobian matrix if it is positive the equilibrium is unstable otherwise it is stable moreover if stable the inverse of the absolute value of the real part of the leading eigenvalue gives an indication of the time needed by the system to return to its equilibrium a measure of resilience global vs local stability implies that any vs small perturbation from the equilibrium will be dampened stability structural it refers to the probability of coexistence of all the species in the ecosystem an equilibrium at which all the species coexist with positive abundances is called feasible the region in parameter space for which the system has a feasible equilibrium is its domain of stable coexistence and its size gives a probability of its structural stability the bigger the domain the more structurally stable the system is rohr et al 2014 sustainability the most frequently quoted definition is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs measures of network structure adapted from landi et al 2018 connectance total number of realized interactions divided by the number of possible interactions connectivity total number of interactions linkage density average number of interactions per species modularity depicts the extent to which a network is compartmentalized into groups where species are strongly interacting with species within the same module and less so with species from other groups olesen et al 2007 nestedness it is a pattern of interactions in which specialists can only interact with a subset of species with which more generalists interact bascompte et al 2003 node degree distribution the distribution of the number of interactions per species a generalization of the node degree distribution is the interaction strength distribution taking into account the weights associated with each link newman 2010 species dependence the dependence of a species i on a species j is defined as the fraction of interactions between i and j relative to the total number of interactions of species i bascompte et al 2006 vieira and almeida neto 2015 in this context a species strength refers to the sum of dependences of the mutualistic partners relying on it species richness number of species trophic species a functional group of species sharing the same set of predators and prey while it avoids redundancy of interactions it is now recognized that redundancy can be important for ecosystems weighted connectance the weighted linkage density divided by species richness weighted linkage density considers the proportion of biomass flow to weight the contribution of each link to and from all equivalent species equivalent species are defined using the shannon metric of entropy

24279,processed based biogeochemical mathematical models are powerful tools that are increasingly being used to estimate potential carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas ghg impacts of management at a landscape level these models can simulate some or all of the processes responsible for carbon sequestration and ghg emissions which can relieve some of the burdensome in situ monitoring requirements that make many blue carbon projects cost prohibitive here we selectively review five publicly available and widely used biogeochemical models mem peprmt dndc daycent and fvs including their current applications and limitations towards blue carbon project development of the five models only the dndc model can be applied to fully account for net sequestration as applicable to blue carbon offset methodologies with further development the daycent and the combined mem peprmt models may prove to be applicable successful application of such models will address one of the biggest barriers to landscape scale blue carbon project development keywords carbon sequestration blue carbon carbon markets wetlands data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wetland restoration and conservation provide a wealth of benefits such as storm surge reduction fish and wildlife habitat water quality improvement recreation job creation and carbon sequestration batker et al 2010 jenkins et al 2010 one of the largest challenges to wetland management is finding sufficient financing for coastal restoration and conservation that is on the scale that most stakeholders agree is needed carbon sequestration refers to the removal of atmospheric carbon in this case by plants photosynthesis or other storage mechanisms i e soils which can mitigate greenhouse gasses released as a result of changes in land use and the burning of fossil fuels lal 2004 euliss et al 2006 kayranli et al 2010 traditionally the carbon sequestered in vegetated coastal ecosystems specifically mangrove forests seagrass beds and salt marshes has been termed blue carbon nellemann et al 2009 mcleod et al 2011 although the authors believe this definition should be expanded to include tidally influenced cypress tupelo forests and freshwater marshes lane et al 2017 edwards et al 2019 wetland restoration is an effective climate change mitigation strategy because it enhances carbon sequestration and avoids carbon releases over time that would occur in the absence of restoration activities pendleton et al 2012 lane et al 2016 sapkota and white 2019 because wetlands sequester large amounts of carbon in soils and plants the growing carbon market provides a potential funding source to support restoration and conservation of these valuable ecosystems murray et al 2011 however burdensome in situ monitoring and large monitoring uncertainties associated with measurement constraints may add to the already high cost of blue carbon projects potentially making them cost prohibitive the foundational principle underpinning high quality offset projects is called additionality additionality maintains that an offset credit is granted only to the extent that the associated amount of emissions reduced or sequestered within the project boundary is additional to that which would occur without the project or under business as usual conditions mack et al 2015 murray et al 2007 murray et al 2011 this requires estimation of the carbon sequestered and ghg emissions under the baseline scenario i e business as usual and the project scenario i e the restoration

2002 these models can simulate some or all of the processes responsible for carbon sequestration and ghg emissions models can also be used to compare alternative management scenarios intended to reduce emissions as well as address many of the challenges of blue carbon project development the appropriate wetland carbon model would significantly reduce project costs by facilitating the practice of mrv which consists of monitoring m reporting r and verification v to catalyze landscape scale blue carbon project development that provide multiple co benefits to society conventional mrv can be costly and complicated to implement assessments auditing and registering tend to be labor intensive time consuming and require extensive in situ monitoring to meet carbon market uncertainty requirements most land use change luc project types require the use of a process based biogeochemical model that can predict the greenhouse gas fluxes from living systems de rosa et al 2016 these models do not usually account for hydrologic features meaning that a project developer would need to utilize multiple models necessitating a broader expertise than most project developers possess as noted in the usda quantifying greenhouse gas fluxes in agriculture and forestry methods for entity scale inventory section 4 21 states improving modeling capabilities that integrate surrounding areas with the wetlands that receive surface and subsurface drainage waters will allow for modeling the flows of nutrients and organic matter into wetlands and subsequent losses to other wetlands beyond the entity s operation this type of assessment framework is used in several established spatially explicit hydrologic models the need is to integrate the biogeochemistry linked models can be used at present but development of a functionally integrated system is needed to support broad based applications at this time no adequate publicly available biogeochemical model for the mississippi delta region exists leaving project developers with no other option than to conduct extensive field measurements overwhelming measurement and monitoring criteria may stifle any financial benefits that carbon credits may deliver robertson et al 2004 agriculture forestry and other land use afolu projects use a combination of modeled and measured data to quantify the emission reductions associated with luc de rosa et al 2016 forest carbon projects can rely on robust data sets to inform allometric equations that are universally agreed upon pilli et al 2006 agricultural carbon projects utilize publicly available datasets that require costly model validation and geographic calibration which is just coming to the forefront of offset project development wetlands offset projects however do not have a single sufficient model that is universally accepted making extensive in situ monitoring necessary which can be cost prohibitive monitoring and measuring requirements for blue carbon projects may have made the possibility of scaling this project type unfeasible to address this barrier a process based biogeochemical model is needed that can simulate the ghg fluxes and net sequestration for wetland restoration activities such a model would need to be tested at multiple sites with differing soils climates and land use and management scenarios to establish efficacy and then once deemed reliable used to simulate sequestration and emissions and derive stock change factors smith et al 2020 the development and application of such a model would reduce 1 the uncertainty associated with measurement constraints 2 the cost of monitoring and 3 safety issues associated with on the ground monitoring of inaccessible areas deterministic or process modeling provides the ability to simulate the physical chemical and biological processes that comprise the exchange of greenhouse gasses between the atmosphere vegetation and soil lloyd et al 2013 in wetlands these models need to be extended to include microbial activity processes responsible for ch4 production and oxidation water table depth seasonal changes in wetland expanse as well as lateral exchanges of carbon c and nitrogen n between wetland and surrounding areas this paper serves as a review of five publicly available and widely used ecosystem models that show promise towards being applied to blue carbon projects including their current applications and limitations the ultimate goal is to provide guidance for future spatial biogeochemical model development or refinement that can be used to estimate various carbon pools or fluxes i e soil organic carbon biomass greenhouse gasses from fresh brackish and saltwater wetlands in the mississippi delta for various baseline and restoration scenarios this will address one of the biggest barriers to landscape scale blue carbon project development in the mississippi delta 2 model analysis here we discuss five publicly available process based models currently being used or show promise to be applied to estimate net carbon sequestration the mem marsh equilibrium model the peprmt peatland ecosystem photosynthesis respiration and methane transport model the dndc denitrification decomposition model the daycent model and the fvs forest vegetation simulator model table 1 the marsh equilibrium model mem predicts how aboveground biomass and surface elevation of salt marshes respond to projected sea level rise the peprmt model estimates net ecosystem exchange of co2 and ch4 the peprmt model is currently being merged with the mem mem peprmt to account for accretion and better account for net sequestration but is only designed for non forested emergent wetlands salt to fresh and cannot be applied to forested systems such as mangroves and cypress the dndc model is a process based model simulating c and n dynamics in forested and emergent wetland ecosystems including mangrove forests dai et al 2018a b but has not been applied to cypress forests and can have high levels of uncertainty under some conditions gilhespy et al 2014 the daycent model is a daily time step version of the century biogeochemical model and simulates fluxes of c and n between the atmosphere vegetation and soil the fvs model projects the growth and development of forest stands with application of various silvicultural treatments the time step used by empirical models has implications for data collection and input a daily time step is used by the peprmt dndc and daycent models table 1 which allows for the direct use of field observations of greenhouse gas emissions to calibrate and evaluate the model and to answer questions about climatic change and management practices zhang et al 2002 the mem model uses an annual timestep which correlates to field measurements of emergent biomass and surface elevation changes which are normally measured once per year the fvs model has the longest time step of 5 or 10 years for tree growth however this period of time correlates with the five year monitoring interval mandated by most carbon registries such as the american carbon registry acr below are more detailed descriptions of the models 2 1 mem marsh equilibrium model the marsh equilibrium model mem is a one dimensional mechanistic model with and annual time step that incorporates feedbacks of organic and inorganic inputs to project accretion and wetland surface elevations under varying sea level rise and sediment availability scenarios fitzgerald and hughes 2021 combining a simple spreadsheet based model interface with a fast processing time the mem is accessible for a broad array of end users additionally the mem can be run using upland elevations that are not currently inundated to examine the timing and extent of marsh migration with a given rate of sea level rise schile et al 2014 physical inputs for the model include the initial rate of sea level rise mean sea level mean higher high water mhhw suspended sediment concentration and starting marsh elevation fig 1 biotic inputs include the minimum and maximum elevation for marsh vegetation the peak aboveground biomass and the elevation at which it occurs root to shoot ratio organic matter decay rate percent of refractory carbon belowground turnover rate and maximum rooting depth of 95 of the roots byrd et al 2016 used values derived from remote sensing to provide inputs of suspended sediment concentration and aboveground peak biomass the model assumes that plant productivity is constrained by upper and lower elevation limits and there is an optimum elevation for growth within the tidal frame morris et al 2002 mem relies on the idea that 1 marshes either increase or decrease biomass production in relation to changes in sea level 2 a combination of biomass and inundation time influences the settling of suspended inorganic sediment and 3 these two factors influence changes in marsh elevation morris et al 2002 plant productivity varies with relative elevation in a parabolic response across a limited range of the tidal frame with peak productivity occurring at an optimal mid elevation point morris et al 2013 2016 an increase in the rate of slr may cross a threshold whereby relative elevation becomes sub optimal for growth and accretion rates are insufficient to maintain elevation leading to elevation loss morris et al 2002 since the mem only forecasts changes in elevation at a single point it is often coupled with another spatially explicit landscape scale model in order to accurately capture the dynamics of a marsh system for example schile et al 2014 coupled the mem with a high spatial resolution lidar based digital elevation model to estimate changes in marsh elevation and extent including upland migration under a variety of sea level rise and suspended sediment concentration scenarios several researchers have coupled the mem with two dimensional hydrodynamic models to forecast the fate of coastal wetlands in response to sea level rise mudd et al 2004 hagen et al 2013 alizad et al 2016 while d alpaos et al 2006 coupled the mem to a hydrodynamic model to investigate the geomorphology of tidal channels the strengths of the mem model include the ability to forecast saltmarsh productivity and relative elevation and decomposition rates can easily be converted to co2 the model was recently revised to include mangroves and allows for mangrove growth to maturity episodic storm inputs of sediment or thin layer sediment applications tlp therefore this model can be used to quantify carbon sequestration in saltmarshes and mangroves and in some instances prevented loss for example the user can by trial and error optimize the periodic application of sediment by tlp to maximize carbon sequestration and resilience to sea level rise the model makes a distinction between sustained carbon sequestration defined as the annual increase in soil carbon standing stock and sequestered carbon the actual standing stock of organic matter or organic carbon in soils standing stock includes living and labile organic matter the live standing stock in a salt marsh or mature mangrove forest is a constant and does not add to carbon sequestration and labile organic matter will decay decaying organic matter does not contribute to sequestration but it is part of the standing stock sustained carbon sequestration is defined as the annual input to soil of refractory or stable organic matter which is a function of the turnover of roots and rhizomes and the lignin concentration in live organic matter if the salinity is input the model can also estimate ch4 as in poffenbarger et al 2011 jim morris personal communication in general this model the ability to fully account for all ghgs i e n2o and ch4 a weakness of mem is that it does not allow for net erosion erosion of the marsh platform is not explicitly included in the model neither can it simulate edge erosion the model can simulate a drowning marsh overwhelmed by rising sea level but the model marsh cannot drown by erosion in the absence of rising water level furthermore the publicly available model version does not allow for temporal changes in suspended sediment concentration but scenarios such as that can be coded by the developer the mem interface is relatively simple and does not require an extensive background to apply the model it was designed to be parsimonious one aspect of carbon project development is determining the permanence of a restoration activity i e the risk that a carbon sink having delivered emissions reductions may deteriorate or become depleted over the long term given adequate elevation data this model is ideal for determining the sustainability of a given wetland ecosystem including the period of time before submergence and when deterioration of the carbon sink begins to take place however detailed elevation data are rare and may be expensive to acquire an executable version of mem with an excel user interface is available upon request and an older version of mem is publicly available online at http 129 252 139 226 model marsh mem2 asp 2 2 peprmt peatland ecosystem photosynthesis respiration and methane transport the peatland ecosystem photosynthesis respiration and methane transport peprmt pronounced peppermint model is a process based biogeochemical model that predicts co2 and ch4 exchange in peat soil freshwater wetlands and rice paddies using a daily time step fertitta roberts et al 2019 the model makes the assumption that n2o emissions are insignificant due to fully saturated soils emitting n2 patty oikawa personal communication it is designed to simulate the complex biogeochemistry of peatlands using few inputs and simple model structure fig 2 originally developed for the sacramento san joaquin delta california it is cited in the restoration of california and coastal wetlands methodology by the american carbon registry acr and is being modified to be used in tidal marshes patty oikawa personal communication it can estimate emissions from both natural and restored wetlands the biogeochemistry and greenhouse gas flux dynamics of restored wetlands are very different compared to natural undisturbed wetlands since large amounts of soil may be moved in the restoration process likely exposing previously inaccessible carbon leading to high greenhouse gas fluxes oikawa et al 2017 the model requires leaf area index lai meteorological data initial soil organic carbon content soc and water table height carbon flux dynamics in the peprmt model are sensitive to water table height substrate availability leaf area temperature and light fertitta 2017 the model simulates three carbon c pools in order to predict ecosystem co2 and ch4 production recently fixed labile c c stored in plant biomass and older more recalcitrant soil organic carbon soc oikawa et al 2017 the model simulates the top meter of soil and tracks the water level in the soil horizon which governs co2 and ch4 emissions whenever the water table falls below the soil surface ch4 production is strongly inhibited fertitta roberts et al 2019 the peprmt model is ideal for use in carbon market systems that calculate co2 and ch4 exchange on an annual basis using measured inputs but the model is not suitable for estimating long term c storage in soils in order to predict long term c storage the model would require additional data such as soc measurements and soil c turnover times in order to constrain model parameters that predict soil c pools over long time scales oikawa et al 2017 net co2 exchange is calculated as the difference between photosynthesis and respiration meaning that the net uptake of co2 by the system is either being stored in biomass or lost laterally this would include below and aboveground biomass but would not differentiate how the carbon is distributed across these two pools the peprmt model also provides rigorous estimates of uncertainty in co2 and ch4 fluxes as it is parameterized using a model data fusion approach with high resolution ecosystem scale ghg flux measurements oikawa et al 2017 highly constrained estimates of uncertainty are helpful when participating in carbon markets as unconstrained uncertainty can lead to conservative estimates of uncertainty with associated credit deductions this model was successfully applied to the first wetland restoration carbon offset project in the united states located within the sacramento san joaquin delta that converted agricultural lands back to wetlands i e flooding lands previously used for agriculture this project reduces ghg emissions by 1 halting the oxidation of organic soils due to farming that results in the release of co2 and ch4 and 2 stopping ch4 and n2o emission from fertilization and grazing animals existing under the baseline scenario the methodology developed for this project specifically uses the peprmt model to estimate co2 and ch4 emissions 1 1 https americancarbonregistry org carbon accounting standards methodologies restoration of california deltaic and coastal wetlands the peprmt model is publicly available at https github com pattyoikawa peprmt git however currently the model requires professional coding skills which is beyond the expertise of most project developers other limitations of the model include the inability to quantify aboveground biomass soil organic carbon and n2o the peprmt model is currently being merged with the mem to account for accretion and better account for net sequestration personal communication with patty oikawa the merged mem peprmt model uses mem to simulate soil organic carbon and accretion and relies on soil core data from the coastal carbon research coordination network ccrcn for model validation 2 2 https serc si edu coastalcarbon the mem peprmt model is being designed for non forested wetland systems ranging from fresh to saltwater currently there are two sites in louisiana that this model is being applied one with the assistance of the united states geological service usgs in a floating freshwater tidal marsh influenced by the davis pond river diversion and the other site is at a brackish saltmarsh the model does not measure n2o and assumes that this source is negligible which may require further scientific justification by the carbon standard dependent upon the specific methodology the model would be applied to the mem peprmt model validation is believed to be applicable to non forested marshes throughout louisiana and should be available in the near future currently this model is not publicly available but there is an intent to make this model public it is currently unknown the level of expertise that would be required to operate the model the main gap of this model is that it cannot be applied to forested systems such as mangroves and bald cypress however this model shows promise to be applied in non forested wetland systems 2 3 dndc denitrification decomposition model the dndc denitrification decomposition model was first described by li et al 1992 as a process orientated biogeochemical model for simulating n2o and soc change from agricultural soils in the u s gilhespy et al 2014 the dndc model has incorporated a suite of biogeochemical processes e g decomposition fermentation ammonia volatilization nitrification denitrification as influenced by the soil environment to predict c and n turnover in agricultural soils the model can run from a year to several hundred years with a primary time step of 1 day during the past 30 years the original dndc model has been modified and adapted to simulate other ecosystems including wetlands the dndc model was developed for wetlands by integrating two existing models namely pnet n dndc and flatwoods gilhespy et al 2014 to predict co2 and ch4 emissions from wetland ecosystems zhang et al 2002 several new functions were developed for the dndc model to represent the unique features of wetland ecosystems such as water table dynamics growth of mosses and herbaceous plants and soil biogeochemical processes under anaerobic conditions zhang et al 2002 forested wetlands can be modeled using the forest dndc model which simulates forest biomass dynamics by tracking the growth of upperstory understory e g bushes or shrubs and ground level vegetation e g moss herbaceous plants or lichens based on their competition for light water and n li et al 2004 model inputs primarily include initial conditions e g plant biomass soil physical and chemical properties water table position hydrological parameters e g lateral inflow outflow parameters vegetation phenological and physiological parameters e g maximum photosynthesis rate and its partitioning to shoot and root respiration rate and climate drivers e g daily maximum and minimum temperature precipitation solar radiation model outputs primarily include c pools and fluxes e g c in plants and soil photosynthesis plant respiration soil decomposition ch4 emissions and net ecosystem productivity n pools and fluxes e g n in plants and soil and emissions of n gasses and soil thermal hydrological conditions e g soil moisture water table position water fluxes soil temperature profile the dndc model consists of four interacting sub models that simulate water table dynamics soil temperature plant growth of wetland species and the anaerobic biogeochemical processes in wetlands fig 3 zhang et al 2002 li et al 2004 modified the anaerobic balloon concept to integrate the nernst and michaelis menten equations enabling the modeling of soils where aerobic and anaerobic microsites exist simultaneously and the prediction of both nitrification and denitrification in the soil at the same time in recent years the model has been further improved to simulate c and n dynamics in northern peatlands zhang et al 2012 deng et al 2014 2015 2017 and mangrove forests dai et al 2018a b by integrating new processes to represent these systems the primary strength of the dndc model is its inclusion of most of the carbon pools of interest however it currently cannot model the growth of cypress trees and the model itself is rather complicated requiring expertise and computational skills 2 4 daycent the daycent model is a version of the century ecosystem model but with a daily time step and is used to simulate ecosystem responses to changes in climate and agricultural management practices in crop grassland forest and savanna ecosystems necpálová et al 2015 the daycent model was developed to permit more realistic estimates of greenhouse gas exchange between the soil and the atmosphere parton et al 1998 2001 it has been used to estimate n2o emissions from agricultural soils for the us national greenhouse gas inventory olander and haugen kozyra 2011 usepa 2021 and the usda relies on the century and daycent models to estimate direct and indirect ghg emissions for major croplands in the united states usgs 2010 daycent consists of sub models for soil water content and temperature by layer plant production and allocation of net primary production npp decomposition of litter and soil organic matter som as well as carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur cycling n gas emissions from nitrification and denitrification and ch4 formation from unsaturated soils fig 4 methane emissions from saturated rice paddy soils have also been added cheng et al 2013 and work is currently being done to use the daycent to model natural wetlands systems personal communication ellen herbert ducks unlimited ducks unlimited and its partners are collecting data on carbon stocks of wetland soils as well as vegetation carbon levels at 250 wetland sites across a 15 state area in the central united states the primary strengths of the daycent model are its inclusion of all of the carbon pools of interest and relative ease of use compared to the dndc and peprmt models the daycent model can be accessed by request through century colostate edu daily maximum minimum temperature and precipitation timing and description of management events e g fertilization tillage harvest soil texture vegetation productivity and root shoot ratios and land cover use data are needed as model inputs the plant growth sub model simulates plant productivity as a function of genetic potential phenology nutrient availability soil water and temperature and solar radiation necpálová et al 2015 nutrient supply is a function of soil organic matter som decomposition and external nutrient additions del grosso et al 2005 som is simulated in the top 20 cm soil layer as a sum of dead plant matter and three som pools divided on the basis of decomposition rates which are controlled by substrate availability substrate quality lignin content c n ratio soil moisture oxygen concentrations temperature and ph del grosso et al 2008a malone et al 2015 the som pool is divided into active 0 5 1 0 yr slow 10 50 yr and passive 1000 5000 yr pools based on residence time weiler et al 2018 the methanogenesis sub module simulates ch4 production based on carbon substrate supply for methanogens which is derived from decomposition of som and root rhizodeposition and the impact of environmental variables parameters controlling methanogenesis include soil texture soil ph redox potential eh soil temperature climate and management practices cheng et al 2013 plant mediated emissions account for nearly 90 of ch4 emissions from soil while a smaller proportion of the ch4 is emitted via ebullition which occurs when the soil ch4 concentration exceeds a critical state that leads to formation of bubbles cheng et al 2013 the trace gas sub model of daycent simulates soil n2o and nox i e no and no 2 gas emissions from nitrification and denitrification processes the model includes legacy effects such that n added to the system one year may be taken up by vegetation and returned to the soil in organic form during that year then remineralized and emitted as n2o in following years del grosso et al 2005 the sub model assumes that nitrification and denitrification both contribute to n2o and nox emissions but that nox emissions are due mainly to nitrification n2o emissions from nitrification are calculated as a function of modeled soil nh4 concentration water filled pore spaces wfps temperature ph and texture while n2o emissions from denitrification are a function of soil nitrate concentration wfps heterotrophic respiration and soil texture del grosso et al 2008a b nox emissions are calculated as a function of soil bulk density field capacity and wfps that influence gas diffusivity parton et al 2001 2 5 fvs forest vegetation simulator the forest vegetation simulator fvs is the u s forest service s nationally supported framework for forest growth and yield modeling particularly with respect to the application of silvicultural treatments usfs 2002 2020 at its core fvs is an individual tree distance independent growth model it predicts changes in tree diameter height crown ratio and crown width as well as mortality over time usda forest service 2011 fvs evolved from a relatively focused growth and yield model the prognosis model for stand development and growth equations were developed for other parts of north america geographically specific versions of fvs are called variants twenty two fvs variants have been developed for the forested areas of the united states and for part of british columbia canada fig 5 the southern sn variant released in 2001 includes cypress and water tupelo forests ecological unit codes euc of the southern variant include categories such as coastal marsh and island tidal area gulf coastal lowlands and la gulf coast marshes and inland bays appendix a of usfs 2008 the fvs software package is freely available at http www fs fed us fmsc fvs the fvs models individual trees with key state variables for each tree being density species diameter height crown ratio diameter growth and height growth crookston and dixon 2005 key variables for each sampling site include slope aspect elevation density and a measure of site potential if these values are not provided default values are used a distinguishing feature of fvs is its ability to automatically calibrate internal models to reflect local deviations from the regional growth trends represented in the variant crookston and dixon 2005 if three or more tree records for a species have measured heights the model parameters of the height diameter function for that species are adjusted time steps are generally between 5 and 10 years long and the total projection is between a few years and several hundred years to meet increased demand for forest carbon information a tool was developed to calculate forest carbon stocks two carbon reports can now be requested the stand carbon report and the harvested carbon report usda forest service 2011 the stand carbon report includes the major carbon pools as defined by the u s carbon accounting rules and guidelines and the ipcc good practice guidance aboveground live tree belowground live tree coarse roots belowground dead tree standing dead trees down dead wood forest floor and understory shrubs herbs the harvested carbon report tracks the fate of carbon in harvested merchantable material including salvaged logs most carbon registries require that forest carbon storage be additional or above and beyond business as usual bau to receive emission offsets using data from an appropriately designed forest inventory managers can generate baseline carbon stock estimates by simulating the bau management actions for a given stand and carbon stock estimates can be made for alternative management scenarios for comparison a major limitation of the fvs was that it was not directly sensitive to environmental changes that influence tree growth such as increasing temperatures changes in rainfall and changes in atmospheric co2 making the model insensitive to climate change crookston and dixon 2005 this changed with the development of the climate fvs a modification to the fvs designed to take climate change into account when predicting forest dynamics at decadal to century time scales usda forest service 2014 the climate fvs uses individual tree climate viability scores which measure the likelihood that the climate at a given location and at a given point in time is consistent with the climate recorded for species contemporary distribution and adjusts growth and mortality accordingly now the biggest limitation of the fvs model is that it does not model the soil carbon pool nor are there estimates of greenhouse gasses the fvs software package is freely available at http www fs fed us fmsc fvs modeling would benefit from an experienced user but special expertise is not necessary and there are several comprehensive users manuals available 3 discussion 3 1 carbon model limitations of the five models included in this analysis the dndc model includes the most carbon pools of interest and is currently the only model that has potential to be applied to fully account for net sequestration as applicable to blue carbon offset methodologies the daycent model and the mem peprmt combined model may prove with time and development to be applicable there are limitations and uncertainties for almost all wetland carbon models including uncertainties in biological processes of relevant parameters as discussed in deng et al 2017 and limitations in simulating landscape interactions and evaluation of regional outputs uncertainties associated with these limitations require associated credit deductions that can ultimately become cost prohibitive to a project in general these limitations need to be addressed but are beyond the scope of carbon market applications to blue carbon projects the mem is most applicable to projecting the interaction of sea level rise and wetland surface elevation to aboveground biomass in the baseline and project scenarios but does not quantify carbon sequestration in a way that is applicable to existing methodologies however this model is applicable towards forecasting the impacts of sea level rise for baseline and project scenarios the uncertainty in data inputs to coastal forecasting models such as mem can limit prediction accuracy and as a result the usefulness of models in management and planning byrd et al 2016 consequently accurate information on baseline conditions of tidal marshes across the modeling spatial extent is essential for generating realistic forecasts as baseline conditions set the starting trajectory of change the mem can predict above ground biomass agb and by extension below ground biomass bgb using a root shoot ratio for salt marshes and mangroves leaving a knowledge gap for freshwater forested and emergent wetlands the peprmt model was developed to predict co2 and ch4 from peat wetlands in california but when combined with the mem is applicable to all non forested wetlands patty oikawa personal communication however it does not account for n2o the dndc model predicts greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands though estimates of n2o in the absence of any additional n fertilization have been questioned by some modeling experts gilhespy et al 2014 the daycent model predicts all necessary parameters but is not yet applicable to deltaic wetlands the forest vegetation simulator fvs effectively models agb of trees in freshwater forests and a root shoot ratio can be applied to estimate bgb but the model does not account for greenhouse gasses or hydrology 3 2 carbon market requirements and implications it is important for model developers to understand carbon market requirements to develop models that address the identified limitations fully quantify net carbon sequestration and are approved for application towards blue carbon project development a discussion of carbon market requirements is provided as guidance to model developers currently the carbon market is comprised of both compliance and voluntary emissions trading schemes these emissions trading programs are collectively referred to as carbon markets carbon market standards and registries typically administer the programs and ensure the credibility of emission reduction projects examples of voluntary carbon market registries include the american carbon registry acr the climate action reserve car and the verified carbon standard vcs a program of verra methods to develop a carbon offset align with international standards iso 14 064 2 and are detailed in what is referred to as a carbon protocol or methodology depending on the offset registry sapkota and white 2020 these carbon market standards and registries have specific requirements for the use of models both at the overall standard level and at the more specific protocol or methodology level protocols and methodologies typically undergo some combination of public consultation peer review and stakeholder input to provide a transparent rigorous scientific framework and accounting procedure for the development verification and monitoring of offset projects gillenwater et al 2007 a protocol or methodology addresses each aspect of the project such as eligibility criteria including temporal and spatial boundaries baseline establishment monitoring of emission sources sinks and pools qa qc methods risk accounting and quantification of emission reductions which pending verification become carbon offsets the protocol becomes the foundation for third party validation and verification in accordance with standardized and transparent market practices overall the protocol works in concert with programmatic requirements set by the registry to ensure that credits issued will meet the underlying principles that offsets are real additional quantifiable verifiable permanent and enforceable there are many commonalities across the multiple standards on the use of models for carbon project development generally models must be specified or meet eligibility criteria in an approved protocol or methodology in order to be applied by a carbon project developer in addition the outputs of the model must align with the parameters and equations of a given methodology to be applied therefore models need to be developed in concert with carbon market and methodological requirements currently the most viable protocols for blue carbon are within acr and vcs below are requirements of models for acr and vcs methodologies for acr process based biogeochemical models and empirical models may be approved for use under specific acr approved afolu methodologies to quantify emissions acr 2020 to be applicable a model must have the potential to model emissions from the relevant practice change s with consideration of relevant factors have been accepted in a peer reviewed scientific publication and or been published by a government agency and allow for the calculation of uncertainty in predicted emissions acr may also approve other models on a case by case basis via an acr lead peer review process acr has a list of factors that must be considered where relevant such as atmospheric factors i e nitrogen concentration in rainfall daily meteorology soil conditions hydrology etc acr 2020 acr also requires that there be a study or studies that demonstrate that the use of the selected model is appropriate for the relevant ipcc climactic region in which the project is situated the ipcc afolu 2006 guidelines note that an appropriate model should be capable of representing the relevant management practices and that the model inputs i e driving variables are validated from country or region specific locations that are representative of the variability of climate soil and management systems in the country acr 2020 where a project consists of multiple sites the model must be validated for at least 50 of the total project area relevant to the restoration practice where the project area covers up to 50 000 ha or at least 75 of the total project area where the project area relevant to the restoration practice covers more than 50 000 ha in addition the area for which the model is validated generates at least two thirds of the total project emission reductions acr 2020 one methodology within acr added further requirements that models must also be parameterized calibrated and validated for a specific scenario project type and area and should preferably use at least 2 years of ecosystem flux data 3 3 https americancarbonregistry org carbon accounting standards methodologies restoration of california deltaic and coastal wetlands with respect to the use of models under vcs the use of models must be specified in the methodology applied by a project all of the current vcs blue carbon methodologies allow for models to be used in place of field measurements to estimate certain parameters e g soil organic carbon or expected submergence in the baseline scenario vcs 2019 no methodologies are necessarily built around a specific model although the mem model is referred to in one wetland methodology vcs 2019 vcs requires that models be publicly available from a reputable and recognized source such as the ipcc or government agency parameters chosen based on studies by appropriately qualified experts reviewed and tested by an appropriate organization or an appropriate peer review group have comprehensive and appropriate requirements for estimating uncertainty be calibrated by parameters such as geographic location and local climate data and use conservative assumptions and parameters that are likely to underestimate ghg emission reductions or removals these criteria however are targeted at more complex models and may not be necessary for simpler models some vcs methodologies have specific requirements such as validating models with direct measurements from a proxy area that exceed the general vcs requirements though measurement approaches for acr and vcs are broadly similar there are differences that can affect the cost of model development and on the ground monitoring of projects the vcs methodologies allow the use of several notable default factors for the calculation of emissions default values for ch4 are offered for areas with mean salinities 18 ppt and 20 ppt default values for n2o are offered for areas with mean salinities between 5 ppt and 18 ppt and for when they are 18 ppt with values given for both open water and wetland sites also sites in louisiana can use default factors for n2o emissions in fresh to saline habitats that are not receiving nutrient inputs for both acr and vcs existing methodologies may go through a revision process to modify a methodology to account for the use of a model or entirely new methodologies may be developed to apply models and advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence ai machine learning ml and remote sensing rs such as lidar these emerging technologies show potential to facilitate the scaling up cost effectiveness and accuracy of mrv for instance machine learning remote sensing and scientific modeling may help improve the accuracy of accounting for net sequestration in wetlands and reduce burdensome on the ground monitoring and large monitoring uncertainties that make many blue carbon projects cost prohibitive brown et al 2005 heuvelink et al 2020 lloyd et al 2013 however it remains uncertain whether these technologies may ever be entirely relied upon without additional or complementary ground truthing due to the complexity of wetland ecosystem data required for mrv this will also require scientific knowledge gaps to be addressed which based on our review of the scientific literature for the mississippi delta include 1 baseline ch4 and n2o emissions from fresh brackish and saltwater emergent wetlands 2 soil sequestration and n2o emission rates for wetlands receiving hydrologic restoration and 3 ch4 emissions and soil and tree sequestration rates of wetlands impacted by sediment diversions to address barriers preventing blue carbon project development adoption user friendly and publicly available wetland models need to be developed that are in sync with carbon market protocols to reduce uncertainty deductions and facilitate mrv ultimately enhancing methods of mrv are key to ensuring the integrity and scalability of wetland carbon credits that maximize co benefits to society declaration of competing interest the authors

24279,processed based biogeochemical mathematical models are powerful tools that are increasingly being used to estimate potential carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas ghg impacts of management at a landscape level these models can simulate some or all of the processes responsible for carbon sequestration and ghg emissions which can relieve some of the burdensome in situ monitoring requirements that make many blue carbon projects cost prohibitive here we selectively review five publicly available and widely used biogeochemical models mem peprmt dndc daycent and fvs including their current applications and limitations towards blue carbon project development of the five models only the dndc model can be applied to fully account for net sequestration as applicable to blue carbon offset methodologies with further development the daycent and the combined mem peprmt models may prove to be applicable successful application of such models will address one of the biggest barriers to landscape scale blue carbon project development keywords carbon sequestration blue carbon carbon markets wetlands data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wetland restoration and conservation provide a wealth of benefits such as storm surge reduction fish and wildlife habitat water quality improvement recreation job creation and carbon sequestration batker et al 2010 jenkins et al 2010 one of the largest challenges to wetland management is finding sufficient financing for coastal restoration and conservation that is on the scale that most stakeholders agree is needed carbon sequestration refers to the removal of atmospheric carbon in this case by plants photosynthesis or other storage mechanisms i e soils which can mitigate greenhouse gasses released as a result of changes in land use and the burning of fossil fuels lal 2004 euliss et al 2006 kayranli et al 2010 traditionally the carbon sequestered in vegetated coastal ecosystems specifically mangrove forests seagrass beds and salt marshes has been termed blue carbon nellemann et al 2009 mcleod et al 2011 although the authors believe this definition should be expanded to include tidally influenced cypress tupelo forests and freshwater marshes lane et al 2017 edwards et al 2019 wetland restoration is an effective climate change mitigation strategy because it enhances carbon sequestration and avoids carbon releases over time that would occur in the absence of restoration activities pendleton et al 2012 lane et al 2016 sapkota and white 2019 because wetlands sequester large amounts of carbon in soils and plants the growing carbon market provides a potential funding source to support restoration and conservation of these valuable ecosystems murray et al 2011 however burdensome in situ monitoring and large monitoring uncertainties associated with measurement constraints may add to the already high cost of blue carbon projects potentially making them cost prohibitive the foundational principle underpinning high quality offset projects is called additionality additionality maintains that an offset credit is granted only to the extent that the associated amount of emissions reduced or sequestered within the project boundary is additional to that which would occur without the project or under business as usual conditions mack et al 2015 murray et al 2007 murray et al 2011 this requires estimation of the carbon sequestered and ghg emissions under the baseline scenario i e business as usual and the project scenario i e the restoration activity with the net difference being counted towards carbon offsets bridgham et al 2006 processed based biogeochemical mathematical models are powerful tools that are increasingly being used to estimate potential carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas ghg impacts of management at a landscape level e g alizad et al 2016 baustian et al 2018 gilhespy et al 2004 schile et al 2004 zhang et al 2002 these models can simulate some or all of the processes responsible for carbon sequestration and ghg emissions models can also be used to compare alternative management scenarios intended to reduce emissions as well as address many of the challenges of blue carbon project development the appropriate wetland carbon model would significantly reduce project costs by facilitating the practice of mrv which consists of monitoring m reporting r and verification v to catalyze landscape scale blue carbon project development that provide multiple co benefits to society conventional mrv can be costly and complicated to implement assessments auditing and registering tend to be labor intensive time consuming and require extensive in situ monitoring to meet carbon market uncertainty requirements most land use change luc project types require the use of a process based biogeochemical model that can predict the greenhouse gas fluxes from living systems de rosa et al 2016 these models do not usually account for hydrologic features meaning that a project developer would need to utilize multiple models necessitating a broader expertise than most project developers possess as noted in the usda quantifying greenhouse gas fluxes in agriculture and forestry methods for entity scale inventory section 4 21 states improving modeling capabilities that integrate surrounding areas with the wetlands that receive surface and subsurface drainage waters will allow for modeling the flows of nutrients and organic matter into wetlands and subsequent losses to other wetlands beyond the entity s operation this type of assessment framework is used in several established spatially explicit hydrologic models the need is to integrate the biogeochemistry linked models can be used at present but development of a functionally integrated system is needed to support broad based applications at this time no adequate publicly available biogeochemical model for the mississippi delta region exists leaving project developers with no other option than to conduct extensive field measurements overwhelming measurement and monitoring criteria may stifle any financial benefits that carbon credits may deliver robertson et al 2004 agriculture forestry and other land use afolu projects use a combination of modeled and measured data to quantify the emission reductions associated with luc de rosa et al 2016 forest carbon projects can rely on robust data sets to inform allometric equations that are universally agreed upon pilli et al 2006 agricultural carbon projects utilize publicly available datasets that require costly model validation and geographic calibration which is just coming to the forefront of offset project development wetlands offset projects however do not have a single sufficient model that is universally accepted making extensive in situ monitoring necessary which can be cost prohibitive monitoring and measuring requirements for blue carbon projects may have made the possibility of scaling this project type unfeasible to address this barrier a process based biogeochemical model is needed that can simulate the ghg fluxes and net sequestration for wetland restoration activities such a model would need to be tested at multiple sites with differing soils climates and land use and management scenarios to establish efficacy and then once deemed reliable used to simulate sequestration and emissions and derive stock change factors smith et al 2020 the development and application of such a model would reduce 1 the uncertainty associated with measurement constraints 2 the cost of monitoring and 3 safety issues associated with on the ground monitoring of inaccessible areas deterministic or process modeling provides the ability to simulate the physical chemical and biological processes that comprise the exchange of greenhouse gasses between the atmosphere vegetation and soil lloyd et al 2013 in wetlands these models need to be extended to include microbial activity processes responsible for ch4 production and oxidation water table depth seasonal changes in wetland expanse as well as lateral exchanges of carbon c and nitrogen n between wetland and surrounding areas this paper serves as a review of five publicly available and widely used ecosystem models that show promise towards being applied to blue carbon projects including their current applications and limitations the ultimate goal is to provide guidance for future spatial biogeochemical model development or refinement that can be used to estimate various carbon pools or fluxes i e soil organic carbon biomass greenhouse gasses from fresh brackish and saltwater wetlands in the mississippi delta for various baseline and restoration scenarios this will address one of the biggest barriers to landscape scale blue carbon project development in the mississippi delta 2 model analysis here we discuss five publicly available process based models currently being used or show promise to be applied to estimate net carbon sequestration the mem marsh equilibrium model the peprmt peatland ecosystem photosynthesis respiration and methane transport model the dndc denitrification decomposition model the daycent model and the fvs forest vegetation simulator model table 1 the marsh equilibrium model mem predicts how aboveground biomass and surface elevation of salt marshes respond to projected sea level rise the peprmt model estimates net ecosystem exchange of co2 and ch4 the peprmt model is currently being merged with the mem mem peprmt to account for accretion and better account for net sequestration but is only designed for non forested emergent wetlands salt to fresh and cannot be applied to forested systems such as mangroves and cypress the dndc model is a process based model simulating c and n dynamics in forested and emergent wetland ecosystems including mangrove forests dai et al 2018a b but has not been applied to cypress forests and can have high levels of uncertainty under some conditions gilhespy et al 2014 the daycent model is a daily time step version of the century biogeochemical model and simulates fluxes of c and n between the atmosphere vegetation and soil the fvs model projects the growth and development of forest stands with application of various silvicultural treatments the time step used by empirical models has implications for data collection and input a daily time step is used by the peprmt dndc and daycent models table 1 which allows for the direct use of field observations of greenhouse gas emissions to calibrate and evaluate the model and to answer questions about climatic change and management practices zhang et al 2002 the mem model uses an annual timestep which correlates to field measurements of emergent biomass and surface elevation changes which are normally measured once per year the fvs model has the longest time step of 5 or 10 years for tree growth however this period of time correlates with the five year monitoring interval mandated by most carbon registries such as the american carbon registry acr below are more detailed descriptions of the models 2 1 mem marsh equilibrium model the marsh equilibrium model mem is a one dimensional mechanistic model with and annual time step that incorporates feedbacks of organic and inorganic inputs to project accretion and wetland surface elevations under varying sea level rise and sediment availability scenarios fitzgerald and hughes 2021 combining a simple spreadsheet based model interface with a fast processing time the mem is accessible for a broad array of end users additionally the mem can be run using upland elevations that are not currently inundated to examine the timing and extent of marsh migration with a given rate of sea level rise schile et al 2014 physical inputs for the model include the initial rate of sea level rise mean sea level mean higher high water mhhw suspended sediment concentration and starting marsh elevation fig 1 biotic inputs include the minimum and maximum elevation for marsh vegetation the peak aboveground biomass and the elevation at which it occurs root to shoot ratio organic matter decay rate percent of refractory carbon belowground turnover rate and maximum rooting depth of 95 of the roots byrd et al 2016 used values derived from remote sensing to provide inputs of suspended sediment concentration and aboveground peak biomass the model assumes that plant productivity is constrained by upper and lower elevation limits and there is an optimum elevation for growth within the tidal frame morris et al 2002 mem relies on the idea that 1 marshes either increase or decrease biomass production in relation to changes in sea level 2 a combination of biomass and inundation time influences the settling of suspended inorganic sediment and 3 these two factors influence changes in marsh elevation morris et al 2002 plant productivity varies with relative elevation in a parabolic response across a limited range of the tidal frame with peak productivity occurring at an optimal mid elevation point morris et al 2013 2016 an increase in the rate of slr may cross a threshold whereby relative elevation becomes sub optimal for growth and accretion rates are insufficient to maintain elevation leading to elevation loss morris et al 2002 since the mem only forecasts changes in elevation at a single point it is often coupled with another spatially explicit landscape scale model in order to accurately capture the dynamics of a marsh system for example schile et al 2014 coupled the mem with a high spatial resolution lidar based digital elevation model to estimate changes in marsh elevation and extent including upland migration under a variety of sea level rise and suspended sediment concentration scenarios several researchers have coupled the mem with two dimensional hydrodynamic models to forecast the fate of coastal wetlands in response to sea level rise mudd et al 2004 hagen et al 2013 alizad et al 2016 while d alpaos et al 2006 coupled the mem to a hydrodynamic model to investigate the geomorphology of tidal channels the strengths of the mem model include the ability to forecast saltmarsh productivity and relative elevation and decomposition rates can easily be converted to co2 the model was recently revised to include mangroves and allows for mangrove growth to maturity episodic storm inputs of sediment or thin layer sediment applications tlp therefore this model can be used to quantify carbon sequestration in saltmarshes and mangroves and in some instances prevented loss for example the user can by trial and error optimize the periodic application of sediment by tlp to maximize carbon sequestration and resilience to sea level rise the model makes a distinction between sustained carbon sequestration defined as the annual increase in soil carbon standing stock and sequestered carbon the actual standing stock of organic matter or organic carbon in soils standing stock includes living and labile organic matter the live standing stock in a salt marsh or mature mangrove forest is a constant and does not add to carbon sequestration and labile organic matter will decay decaying organic matter does not contribute to sequestration but it is part of the standing stock sustained carbon sequestration is defined as the annual input to soil of refractory or stable organic matter which is a function of the turnover of roots and rhizomes and the lignin concentration in live organic matter if the salinity is input the model can also estimate ch4 as in poffenbarger et al 2011 jim morris personal communication in general this model the ability to fully account for all ghgs i e n2o and ch4 a weakness of mem is that it does not allow for net erosion erosion of the marsh platform is not explicitly included in the model neither can it simulate edge erosion the model can simulate a drowning marsh overwhelmed by rising sea level but the model marsh cannot drown by erosion in the absence of rising water level furthermore the publicly available model version does not allow for temporal changes in suspended sediment concentration but scenarios such as that can be coded by the developer the mem interface is relatively simple and does not require an extensive background to apply the model it was designed to be parsimonious one aspect of carbon project development is determining the permanence of a restoration activity i e the risk that a carbon sink having delivered emissions reductions may deteriorate or become depleted over the long term given adequate elevation data this model is ideal for determining the sustainability of a given wetland ecosystem including the period of time before submergence and when deterioration of the carbon sink begins to take place however detailed elevation data are rare and may be expensive to acquire an executable version of mem with an excel user interface is available upon request and an older version of mem is publicly available online at http 129 252 139 226 model marsh mem2 asp 2 2 peprmt peatland ecosystem photosynthesis respiration and methane transport the peatland ecosystem photosynthesis respiration and methane transport peprmt pronounced peppermint model is a process based biogeochemical model that predicts co2 and ch4 exchange in peat soil freshwater wetlands and rice paddies using a daily time step fertitta roberts et al 2019 the model makes the assumption that n2o emissions are insignificant due to fully saturated soils emitting n2 patty oikawa personal communication it is designed to simulate the complex biogeochemistry of peatlands using few inputs and simple model structure fig 2 originally developed for the sacramento san joaquin delta california it is cited in the restoration of california and coastal wetlands methodology by the american carbon registry acr and is being modified to be used in tidal marshes patty oikawa personal communication it can estimate emissions from both natural and restored wetlands the biogeochemistry and greenhouse gas flux dynamics of restored wetlands are very different compared to natural undisturbed wetlands since large amounts of soil may be moved in the restoration process likely exposing previously inaccessible carbon leading to high greenhouse gas fluxes oikawa et al 2017 the model requires leaf area index lai meteorological data initial soil organic carbon content soc and water table height carbon flux dynamics in the peprmt model are sensitive to water table height substrate availability leaf area temperature and light fertitta 2017 the model simulates three carbon c pools in order to predict ecosystem co2 and ch4 production recently fixed labile c c stored in plant biomass and older more recalcitrant soil organic carbon soc oikawa et al 2017 the model simulates the top meter of soil and tracks the water level in the soil horizon which governs co2 and ch4 emissions whenever the water table falls below the soil surface ch4 production is strongly inhibited fertitta roberts et al 2019 the peprmt model is ideal for use in carbon market systems that calculate co2 and ch4 exchange on an annual basis using measured inputs but the model is not suitable for estimating long term c storage in soils in order to predict long term c storage the model would require additional data such as soc measurements and soil c turnover times in order to constrain model parameters that predict soil c pools over long time scales oikawa et al 2017 net co2 exchange is calculated as the difference between photosynthesis and respiration meaning that the net uptake of co2 by the system is either being stored in biomass or lost laterally this would include below and aboveground biomass but would not differentiate how the carbon is distributed across these two pools the peprmt model also provides rigorous estimates of uncertainty in co2 and ch4 fluxes as it is parameterized using a model data fusion approach with high resolution ecosystem scale ghg flux measurements oikawa et al 2017 highly constrained estimates of uncertainty are helpful when participating in carbon markets as unconstrained uncertainty can lead to conservative estimates of uncertainty with associated credit deductions this model was successfully applied to the first wetland restoration carbon offset project in the united states located within the sacramento san joaquin delta that converted agricultural lands back to wetlands i e flooding lands previously used for agriculture this project reduces ghg emissions by 1 halting the oxidation of organic soils due to farming that results in the release of co2 and ch4 and 2 stopping ch4 and n2o emission from fertilization and grazing animals existing under the baseline scenario the methodology developed for this project specifically uses the peprmt model to estimate co2 and ch4 emissions 1 1 https americancarbonregistry org carbon accounting standards methodologies restoration of california deltaic and coastal wetlands the peprmt model is publicly available at https github com pattyoikawa peprmt git however currently the model requires professional coding skills which is beyond the expertise of most project developers other limitations of the model include the inability to quantify aboveground biomass soil organic carbon and n2o the peprmt model is currently being merged with the mem to account for accretion and better account for net sequestration personal communication with patty oikawa the merged mem peprmt model uses mem to simulate soil organic carbon and accretion and relies on soil core data from the coastal carbon research coordination network ccrcn for model validation 2 2 https serc si edu coastalcarbon the mem peprmt model is being designed for non forested wetland systems ranging from fresh to saltwater currently there are two sites in louisiana that this model is being applied one with the assistance of the united states geological service usgs in a floating freshwater tidal marsh influenced by the davis pond river diversion and the other site is at a brackish saltmarsh the model does not measure n2o and assumes that this source is negligible which may require further scientific justification by the carbon standard dependent upon the specific methodology the model would be applied to the mem peprmt model validation is believed to be applicable to non forested marshes throughout louisiana and should be available in the near future currently this model is not publicly available but there is an intent to make this model public it is currently unknown the level of expertise that would be required to operate the model the main gap of this model is that it cannot be applied to forested systems such as mangroves and bald cypress however this model shows promise to be applied in non forested wetland systems 2 3 dndc denitrification decomposition model the dndc denitrification decomposition model was first described by li et al 1992 as a process orientated biogeochemical model for simulating n2o and soc change from agricultural soils in the u s gilhespy et al 2014 the dndc model has incorporated a suite of biogeochemical processes e g decomposition fermentation ammonia volatilization nitrification denitrification as influenced by the soil environment to predict c and n turnover in agricultural soils the model can run from a year to several hundred years with a primary time step of 1 day during the past 30 years the original dndc model has been modified and adapted to simulate other ecosystems including wetlands the dndc model was developed for wetlands by integrating two existing models namely pnet n dndc and flatwoods gilhespy et al 2014 to predict co2 and ch4 emissions from wetland ecosystems zhang et al 2002 several new functions were developed for the dndc model to represent the unique features of wetland ecosystems such as water table dynamics growth of mosses and herbaceous plants and soil biogeochemical processes under anaerobic conditions zhang et al 2002 forested wetlands can be modeled using the forest dndc model which simulates forest biomass dynamics by tracking the growth of upperstory understory e g bushes or shrubs and ground level vegetation e g moss herbaceous plants or lichens based on their competition for light water and n li et al 2004 model inputs primarily include initial conditions e g plant biomass soil physical and chemical properties water table position hydrological parameters e g lateral inflow outflow parameters vegetation phenological and physiological parameters e g maximum photosynthesis rate and its partitioning to shoot and root respiration rate and climate drivers e g daily maximum and minimum temperature precipitation solar radiation model outputs primarily include c pools and fluxes e g c in plants and soil photosynthesis plant respiration soil decomposition ch4 emissions and net ecosystem productivity n pools and fluxes e g n in plants and soil and emissions of n gasses and soil thermal hydrological conditions e g soil moisture water table position water fluxes soil temperature profile the dndc model consists of four interacting sub models that simulate water table dynamics soil temperature plant growth of wetland species and the anaerobic biogeochemical processes in wetlands fig 3 zhang et al 2002 li et al 2004 modified the anaerobic balloon concept to integrate the nernst and michaelis menten equations enabling the modeling of soils where aerobic and anaerobic microsites exist simultaneously and the prediction of both nitrification and denitrification in the soil at the same time in recent years the model has been further improved to simulate c and n dynamics in northern peatlands zhang et al 2012 deng et al 2014 2015 2017 and mangrove forests dai et al 2018a b by integrating new processes to represent these systems the primary strength of the dndc model is its inclusion of most of the carbon pools of interest however it currently cannot model the growth of cypress trees and the model itself is rather complicated requiring expertise and computational skills 2 4 daycent the daycent model is a version of the century ecosystem model but with a daily time step and is used to simulate ecosystem responses to changes in climate and agricultural management practices in crop grassland forest and savanna ecosystems necpálová et al 2015 the daycent model was developed to permit more realistic estimates of greenhouse gas exchange between the soil and the atmosphere parton et al 1998 2001 it has been used to estimate n2o emissions from agricultural soils for the us national greenhouse gas inventory olander and haugen kozyra 2011 usepa 2021 and the usda relies on the century and daycent models to estimate direct and indirect ghg emissions for major croplands in the united states usgs 2010 daycent consists of sub models for soil water content and temperature by layer plant production and allocation of net primary production npp decomposition of litter and soil organic matter som as well as carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur cycling n gas emissions from nitrification and denitrification and ch4 formation from unsaturated soils fig 4 methane emissions from saturated rice paddy soils have also been added cheng et al 2013 and work is currently being done to use the daycent to model natural wetlands systems personal communication ellen herbert ducks unlimited ducks unlimited and its partners are collecting data on carbon stocks of wetland soils as well as vegetation carbon levels at 250 wetland sites across a 15 state area in the central united states the primary strengths of the daycent model are its inclusion of all of the carbon pools of interest and relative ease of use compared to the dndc and peprmt models the daycent model can be accessed by request through century colostate edu daily maximum minimum temperature and precipitation timing and description of management events e g fertilization tillage harvest soil texture vegetation productivity and root shoot ratios and land cover use data are needed as model inputs the plant growth sub model simulates plant productivity as a function of genetic potential phenology nutrient availability soil water and temperature and solar radiation necpálová et al 2015 nutrient supply is a function of soil organic matter som decomposition and external nutrient additions del grosso et al 2005 som is simulated in the top 20 cm soil layer as a sum of dead plant matter and three som pools divided on the basis of decomposition rates which are controlled by substrate availability substrate quality lignin content c n ratio soil moisture oxygen concentrations temperature and ph del grosso et al 2008a malone et al 2015 the som pool is divided into active 0 5 1 0 yr slow 10 50 yr and passive 1000 5000 yr pools based on residence time weiler et al 2018 the methanogenesis sub module simulates ch4 production based on carbon substrate supply for methanogens which is derived from decomposition of som and root rhizodeposition and the impact of environmental variables parameters controlling methanogenesis include soil texture soil ph redox potential eh soil temperature climate and management practices cheng et al 2013 plant mediated emissions account for nearly 90 of ch4 emissions from soil while a smaller proportion of the ch4 is emitted via ebullition which occurs when the soil ch4 concentration exceeds a critical state that leads to formation of bubbles cheng et al 2013 the trace gas sub model of daycent simulates soil n2o and nox i e no and no 2 gas emissions from nitrification and denitrification processes the model includes legacy effects such that n added to the system one year may be taken up by vegetation and returned to the soil in organic form during that year then remineralized and emitted as n2o in following years del grosso et al 2005 the sub model assumes that nitrification and denitrification both contribute to n2o and nox emissions but that nox emissions are due mainly to nitrification n2o emissions from nitrification are calculated as a function of modeled soil nh4 concentration water filled pore spaces wfps temperature ph and texture while n2o emissions from denitrification are a function of soil nitrate concentration wfps heterotrophic respiration and soil texture del grosso et al 2008a b nox emissions are calculated as a function of soil bulk density field capacity and wfps that influence gas diffusivity parton et al 2001 2 5 fvs forest vegetation simulator the forest vegetation simulator fvs is the u s forest service s nationally supported framework for forest growth and yield modeling particularly with respect to the application of silvicultural treatments usfs 2002 2020 at its core fvs is an individual tree distance independent growth model it predicts changes in tree diameter height crown ratio and crown width as well as mortality over time usda forest service 2011 fvs evolved from a relatively focused growth and yield model the prognosis model for stand development and growth equations were developed for other parts of north america geographically specific versions of fvs are called variants twenty two fvs variants have been developed for the forested areas of the united states and for part of british columbia canada fig 5 the southern sn variant released in 2001 includes cypress and water tupelo forests ecological unit codes euc of the southern variant include categories such as coastal marsh and island tidal area gulf coastal lowlands and la gulf coast marshes and inland bays appendix a of usfs 2008 the fvs software package is freely available at http www fs fed us fmsc fvs the fvs models individual trees with key state variables for each tree being density species diameter height crown ratio diameter growth and height growth crookston and dixon 2005 key variables for each sampling site include slope aspect elevation density and a measure of site potential if these values are not provided default values are used a distinguishing feature of fvs is its ability to automatically calibrate internal models to reflect local deviations from the regional growth trends represented in the variant crookston and dixon 2005 if three or more tree records for a species have measured heights the model parameters of the height diameter function for that species are adjusted time steps are generally between 5 and 10 years long and the total projection is between a few years and several hundred years to meet increased demand for forest carbon information a tool was developed to calculate forest carbon stocks two carbon reports can now be requested the stand carbon report and the harvested carbon report usda forest service 2011 the stand carbon report includes the major carbon pools as defined by the u s carbon accounting rules and guidelines and the ipcc good practice guidance aboveground live tree belowground live tree coarse roots belowground dead tree standing dead trees down dead wood forest floor and understory shrubs herbs the harvested carbon report tracks the fate of carbon in harvested merchantable material including salvaged logs most carbon registries require that forest carbon storage be additional or above and beyond business as usual bau to receive emission offsets using data from an appropriately designed forest inventory managers can generate baseline carbon stock estimates by simulating the bau management actions for a given stand and carbon stock estimates can be made for alternative management scenarios for comparison a major limitation of the fvs was that it was not directly sensitive to environmental changes that influence tree growth such as increasing temperatures changes in rainfall and changes in atmospheric co2 making the model insensitive to climate change crookston and dixon 2005 this changed with the development of the climate fvs a modification to the fvs designed to take climate change into account when predicting forest dynamics at decadal to century time scales usda forest service 2014 the climate fvs uses individual tree climate viability scores which measure the likelihood that the climate at a given location and at a given point in time is consistent with the climate recorded for species contemporary distribution and adjusts growth and mortality accordingly now the biggest limitation of the fvs model is that it does not model the soil carbon pool nor are there estimates of greenhouse gasses the fvs software package is freely available at http www fs fed us fmsc fvs modeling would benefit from an experienced user but special expertise is not necessary and there are several comprehensive users manuals available 3 discussion 3 1 carbon model limitations of the five models included in this analysis the dndc model includes the most carbon pools of interest and is currently the only model that has potential to be applied to fully account for net sequestration as applicable to blue carbon offset methodologies the daycent model and the mem peprmt combined model may prove with time and development to be applicable there are limitations and uncertainties for almost all wetland carbon models including uncertainties in biological processes of relevant parameters as discussed in deng et al 2017 and limitations in simulating landscape interactions and evaluation of regional outputs uncertainties associated with these limitations require associated credit deductions that can ultimately become cost prohibitive to a project in general these limitations need to be addressed but are beyond the scope of carbon market applications to blue carbon projects the mem is most applicable to projecting the interaction of sea level rise and wetland surface elevation to aboveground biomass in the baseline and project scenarios but does not quantify carbon sequestration in a way that is applicable to existing methodologies however this model is applicable towards forecasting the impacts of sea level rise for baseline and project scenarios the uncertainty in data inputs to coastal forecasting models such as mem can limit prediction accuracy and as a result the usefulness of models in management and planning byrd et al 2016 consequently accurate information on baseline conditions of tidal marshes across the modeling spatial extent is essential for generating realistic forecasts as baseline conditions set the starting trajectory of change the mem can predict above ground biomass agb and by extension below ground biomass bgb using a root shoot ratio for salt marshes and mangroves leaving a knowledge gap for freshwater forested and emergent wetlands the peprmt model was developed to predict co2 and ch4 from peat wetlands in california but when combined with the mem is applicable to all non forested wetlands patty oikawa personal communication however it does not account for n2o the dndc model predicts greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands though estimates of n2o in the absence of any additional n fertilization have been questioned by some modeling experts gilhespy et al 2014 the daycent model predicts all necessary parameters but is not yet applicable to deltaic wetlands the forest vegetation simulator fvs effectively models agb of trees in freshwater forests and a root shoot ratio can be applied to estimate bgb but the model does not account for greenhouse gasses or hydrology 3 2 carbon market requirements and implications it is important for model developers to understand carbon market requirements to develop models that address the identified limitations fully quantify net carbon sequestration and are approved for application towards blue carbon project development a discussion of carbon market requirements is provided as guidance to model developers currently the carbon market is comprised of both compliance and voluntary emissions trading schemes these emissions trading programs are collectively referred to as carbon markets carbon market standards and registries typically administer the programs and ensure the credibility of emission reduction projects examples of voluntary carbon market registries include the american carbon registry acr the climate action reserve car and the verified carbon standard vcs a program of verra methods to develop a carbon offset align with international standards iso 14 064 2 and are detailed in what is referred to as a carbon protocol or methodology depending on the offset registry sapkota and white 2020 these carbon market standards and registries have specific requirements for the use of models both at the overall standard level and at the more specific protocol or methodology level protocols and methodologies typically undergo some combination of public consultation peer review and stakeholder input to provide a transparent rigorous scientific framework and accounting procedure for the development verification and monitoring of offset projects gillenwater et al 2007 a protocol or methodology addresses each aspect of the project such as eligibility criteria including temporal and spatial boundaries baseline establishment monitoring of emission sources sinks and pools qa qc methods risk accounting and quantification of emission reductions which pending verification become carbon offsets the protocol becomes the foundation for third party validation and verification in accordance with standardized and transparent market practices overall the protocol works in concert with programmatic requirements set by the registry to ensure that credits issued will meet the underlying principles that offsets are real additional quantifiable verifiable permanent and enforceable there are many commonalities across the multiple standards on the use of models for carbon project development generally models must be specified or meet eligibility criteria in an approved protocol or methodology in order to be applied by a carbon project developer in addition the outputs of the model must align with the parameters and equations of a given methodology to be applied therefore models need to be developed in concert with carbon market and methodological requirements currently the most viable protocols for blue carbon are within acr and vcs below are requirements of models for acr and vcs methodologies for acr process based biogeochemical models and empirical models may be approved for use under specific acr approved afolu methodologies to quantify emissions acr 2020 to be applicable a model must have the potential to model emissions from the relevant practice change s with consideration of relevant factors have been accepted in a peer reviewed scientific publication and or been published by a government agency and allow for the calculation of uncertainty in predicted emissions acr may also approve other models on a case by case basis via an acr lead peer review process acr has a list of factors that must be considered where relevant such as atmospheric factors i e nitrogen concentration in rainfall daily meteorology soil conditions hydrology etc acr 2020 acr also requires that there be a study or studies that demonstrate that the use of the selected model is appropriate for the relevant ipcc climactic region in which the project is situated the ipcc afolu 2006 guidelines note that an appropriate model should be capable of representing the relevant management practices and that the model inputs i e driving variables are validated from country or region specific locations that are representative of the variability of climate soil and management systems in the country acr 2020 where a project consists of multiple sites the model must be validated for at least 50 of the total project area relevant to the restoration practice where the project area covers up to 50 000 ha or at least 75 of the total project area where the project area relevant to the restoration practice covers more than 50 000 ha in addition the area for which the model is validated generates at least two thirds of the total project emission reductions acr 2020 one methodology within acr added further requirements that models must also be parameterized calibrated and validated for a specific scenario project type and area and should preferably use at least 2 years of ecosystem flux data 3 3 https americancarbonregistry org carbon accounting standards methodologies restoration of california deltaic and coastal wetlands with respect to the use of models under vcs the use of models must be specified in the methodology applied by a project all of the current vcs blue carbon methodologies allow for models to be used in place of field measurements to estimate certain parameters e g soil organic carbon or expected submergence in the baseline scenario vcs 2019 no methodologies are necessarily built around a specific model although the mem model is referred to in one wetland methodology vcs 2019 vcs requires that models be publicly available from a reputable and recognized source such as the ipcc or government agency parameters chosen based on studies by appropriately qualified experts reviewed and tested by an appropriate organization or an appropriate peer review group have comprehensive and appropriate requirements for estimating uncertainty be calibrated by parameters such as geographic location and local climate data and use conservative assumptions and parameters that are likely to underestimate ghg emission reductions or removals these criteria however are targeted at more complex models and may not be necessary for simpler models some vcs methodologies have specific requirements such as validating models with direct measurements from a proxy area that exceed the general vcs requirements though measurement approaches for acr and vcs are broadly similar there are differences that can affect the cost of model development and on the ground monitoring of projects the vcs methodologies allow the use of several notable default factors for the calculation of emissions default values for ch4 are offered for areas with mean salinities 18 ppt and 20 ppt default values for n2o are offered for areas with mean salinities between 5 ppt and 18 ppt and for when they are 18 ppt with values given for both open water and wetland sites also sites in louisiana can use default factors for n2o emissions in fresh to saline habitats that are not receiving nutrient inputs for both acr and vcs existing methodologies may go through a revision process to modify a methodology to account for the use of a model or entirely new methodologies may be developed to apply models and advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence ai machine learning ml and remote sensing rs such as lidar these emerging technologies show potential to facilitate the scaling up cost effectiveness and accuracy of mrv for instance machine learning remote sensing and scientific modeling may help improve the accuracy of accounting for net sequestration in wetlands and reduce burdensome on the ground monitoring and large monitoring uncertainties that make many blue carbon projects cost prohibitive brown et al 2005 heuvelink et al 2020 lloyd et al 2013 however it remains uncertain whether these technologies may ever be entirely relied upon without additional or complementary ground truthing due to the complexity of wetland ecosystem data required for mrv this will also require scientific knowledge gaps to be addressed which based on our review of the scientific literature for the mississippi delta include 1 baseline ch4 and n2o emissions from fresh brackish and saltwater emergent wetlands 2 soil sequestration and n2o emission rates for wetlands receiving hydrologic restoration and 3 ch4 emissions and soil and tree sequestration rates of wetlands impacted by sediment diversions to address barriers preventing blue carbon project development adoption user friendly and publicly available wetland models need to be developed that are in sync with carbon market protocols to reduce uncertainty deductions and facilitate mrv ultimately enhancing methods of mrv are key to ensuring the integrity and scalability of wetland carbon credits that maximize co benefits to society declaration of competing interest the authors
