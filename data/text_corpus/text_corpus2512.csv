12560,limited freshwater availability increasing competition for water among multiple users cost of purification corporate sustainability goals etc are the main factors driving many industries to focus on water quality and usage increasing water reuse and accessing alternative sources of freshwater are potential strategies to improve water efficiency this paper aims to identify water treatment options that produce suitable water for flotation and other mineral processing operations it investigates the performance of nanofiltration membranes in producing suitable water quality for the separation of minerals based on the ionic strength tolerance threshold at which impurities begin to impact the separation process in this study the membranes used could reject 95 of divalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 and 74 of monovalent ions e g na and cl under the conditions of 12 bar of transmembrane pressure and 65 of the recovery these rejection rates were found to be sufficient to produce fit for purpose water for mineral processing in addition the effect of pressure on the mass transfer mechanism of each membrane was determined keywords water treatment mineral processing nanofiltration bore water pilot scale data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the mineral processing sector consumes a considerable amount of water for instance processes that do not reuse water utilise between 1 9 and 3 m3 per ton of ore processed 1 water is used in a wide range of mining activities and due to the environmental preoccupation and the lack of water the industry has become aware of its responsibilities it is constantly evaluating the best way to use water the search for improvements in conservation and reuse increases the recycling and the use of lower quality water in different sections of the operation such as groundwater or seawater which usually contains high concentrations of ions and salts at the same time mining operations tend to be in areas where there is competition among other industrial sectors for the use of domestic water or in areas where access to water quality is scarce and expensive for the operation due to transportation costs 2 several mine sites in australia have introduced saline water in their mineral processing practice base metal sulphide flotation plants at mt keith leinster and the kambalda nickel concentrator in western australia use bore water with high ionic strength 3 saline water is used at kcgm and kanowna belle for sulphide gold ore flotation saline or seawater is also used in many other flotation plants worldwide including copper plants in chile gold rich copper ore processing plants in indonesia and base metal sulphides flotation in south africa in some cases e g kanowna belle gold mine the salinity of the water used in flotation can reach up to 200 000 mg l which is several times higher than that of seawater 4 multiple studies have reported on the effect of electrolytic species dissolved in water on mineral processing operations 1 4 5 the extent of the impact of these species on the recovery of valuable minerals depends on the ore type and the physicochemical characteristics of the water for example flotation of phosphate minerals such as monazite which is one of the primary sources of rare earth elements is affected by bivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 due to their interaction with the mineral and reagents causing an increase in the consumption of reagents 6 zhang et al 7 demonstrated that in the process of monazite flotation with fatty acid collectors ions of caoh present in the water were attached by hydrogen bonding at the surface of the monazite decreasing the hydrophobicity of the monazite hence reducing its recovery by flotation salts and hardness in water are highly reactive with fatty acids developing insoluble compounds resulting in loss of selectivity of the reagents making froth flotation and tailing management operations exceedingly difficult 8 5 in a recent study it has been shown that the presence of divalent metal ions mg2 ca2 was highly detrimental to monazite flotation while the presence of monovalent metal ions cl k and na affected monazite flotation slightly only 9 keeping in mind the flotation of the ionic strength tolerance a threshold at which ions in the water begin to impact the separation process can be defined this would help identify suitable water treatment methods to produce fit for purpose water without significantly impacting mineral recovery and product quality currently several treatment options involve physical electro and chemical processes that remove salts through a membrane or an ion exchange resin inducted by a specific current or precipitation of the ions as an insoluble salt membrane separation methods such as reverse osmosis ro have been implemented in several processes because this method provides rates of removal of dissolved species as high as 98 10 many mineral processing operations do not require ultra high quality water thus reverse osmosis becomes an overvalued and expensive option in ro treatment water with sulphate concentration of 700 mg l and calcium 100 mg l is not recommended because of the high scaling potential of caso4 and the expenses associated with frequent membrane replacement 11 ro is an energy intensive process accounting for around 44 of the total treatment cost in countries such as australia where the energy cost has a fundamental role in the industry it becomes an appreciable portion of the processing expenses 12 nanofiltration is an option that can provide suitable water quality for mineral processing operations by removing divalent ions and a portion of monovalent ions under the proper membrane selection and specific conditions it has lower cost implications because nanofiltration uses lower transmembrane pressures as compared with ro 13 nanofiltration membranes have a microporous structure and can retain particles with a size of 0 1 nm 0 001 Î¼m which allows most impurities to be separated from the water although those of lower molecular weight are partially retained in the membrane 13 in this process the separation of substances is carried out both by the size of the pores and by the solution diffusion mechanisms that is characteristic of processes such as ultrafiltration and ro respectively therefore nanofiltration allows the separation of organic substances proteins sugars microorganisms and some multivalent salts 14 different studies with brackish water have demonstrated that nanofiltration can remove up to 98 of calcium and magnesium salts and up to 66 of sodium chloride 15 16 17 despite the promising performance of nanofiltration demonstrated at lab scale studies a recent review indicated that there is still a lack of detailed pilot scale trials that are crucial to realise its application on a larger scale mineral processing operations 18 therefore in this study a pilot scale nanofiltration rig was employed to investigate the possibility of producing high quality water from groundwater obtained from a mining operation in western australia multiple operation parameters such as pressure and recovery were investigated to evaluate the performance of two different membranes in removing dissolved ions that would otherwise be problematic for different mineral processing operations furthermore a two stage nanofiltration system was evaluated to improve water recovery the results obtained in this study present nanofiltration as a technology that can be implemented in the mining industry to supply water of suitable quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the raw water for this study was provided from a mining operation in western australia and the characterization of the water is shown in table 1 it is a relatively low total dissolved solids tds raw water with the main ions of interest being mg2 ca2 na cl and so4 2 two organic nanofiltrations nf membranes fabricated by different companies dow filmtec and ecotechnol were studied the nanofiltration membranes used are thin film composite membranes nf90 4040 and 4040 a are characterised as tight nanofiltration membranes with relatively high sodium chloride rejection 85 in addition one ultrafiltration uf membrane was used as pre treatment to remove suspended solids to avoid undesirable fouling of the nf membranes studied table 2 shows the commercial names of the membranes and their corresponding suppliers as the primary polymer used for their fabrication 2 2 methods 2 2 1 nanofiltration before each experiment the membranes were washed with caustic solution 0 2 w w to restore the membrane s permeability each membrane was pressurised using deionised water at 4 bars for 30 min until the conductivity of the permeate was steady and similar to the initial deionised water the raw water used in the experiments went through an ultrafiltration stage as pre treatment to avoid nanofiltration membrane fouling the nanofiltration experiments were carried out with two different nanofiltration membranes and an initial mass of 22 kg of ultra filtrated bore water the feed was limited to a small volume to avoid the effect of concentration polarization the concentrate was recirculated to the feed tank and the permeate was collected and sampled at three different recoveries 15 45 and 65 the feed pressure was adjusted for each test and was varied in the range of 8 to 20 bar additionally the permeate flux and the ion s rejection were determined by measuring the permeate flow and the concentration of ions in the permeate the filtration experiments were conducted in a pilot unit supplied by ecotechnol australia fig 1 this pilot unit was designed to test different ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes under other conditions such as pressure and permeate recovery the ecotechnol rig is mainly composed of one feed tank with a volume of 0 1 m3 a high pressure booster pump which was used for the filtration and for the cleaning of the membrane and one pressure vessel housing on a standard 40 x4 membrane module with retractile end and feed caps allowing the change of membrane a manual regulation valve on the concentrate line to adjust the pressure of operation and the permeate and concentrate lines which can be fitted as recirculation loop with the feed tank and an external scale to measure the weight of the desirable recovery of permeate 2 2 2 water analysis the analysis of ion concentrations in the feed and permeated was performed by three different methods for the analysis of cations such as ca2 mg2 na a icp oes agilent technologies inc usa technique was used following the standard method us epa 6010 sulphate concentration was measured following the standardised procedure apha 4500 so4 2 e and the concentration of chloride was determined by the standard colorimetric method apha 4500 cl g 3 theory 3 1 spigeler kedem katchalsky skk model the model of spiegler kedem and katchalsky skk presents the transport of the solvent trough membranes as a black box where principles of phenomenological mass transfer can be applied this model approaches the transport phenomenon for a two component system solute and solvent using the theory of irreversible thermodynamics with the following equations 1 j v l p p Ï Ð¿ 2 j s p s c s 1 Ï j v c s where jv and js are the solvent and solute flux lp is the hydraulic permeability Î´p represents the pressure drop across the membrane ps is the solute permeability Î´cs is the difference of concentration from the surface of the membrane in the bulk side and in the permeate Ï is the reflection coefficient and Î´Ð¿ is respectively the osmotic pressure through the membrane in addition the term Ï Î´Ð¿ can be defined as the critical pressure which is the pressure when the transmembrane pressure is equal to osmotic pressure triggering the mobilisation of ions from the feed water to the concentrate 19 c s represents the solute concentration in the membrane which is represented as the average concentration on both side of the membrane to represent accurately the solute concentration in the membrane spiegler and kedem applied eq 2 in a differential membrane layer and integrated it across a membrane resulting in the following expressions which are dependent on the experimental ion rejection robs and the solvent flux jv 20 21 3 r obs Ï 1 f 1 Ïf and f 4 f e j v 1 Ï p s the skk model is a model that provides phenomenological information such as the ions permeability ps and the reflection coefficient Ï related to the transport of the solute from the skk expression it can be noticed that if jv tends to be infinite then robs Ï additionally if the solutes are small enough to pass through the membrane pore the Ï is expected to be below 1 meaning that the convective solute transport takes place into the solute transport otherwise the membranes will have dense structure with extremely low porosity where solute transport takes place only by diffusion as is the case on ro membranes it is well known that the skk model was developed initially for uncharged membranes with dense structure such as ro membranes unlike ro membranes nf membranes are characterised by slightly charged surface 22 however in this study we have neglected the membranes charge because those membranes have been classified by the manufacturer as tightest nf membranes with similar characteristics and behaviour as ro membranes in this study we have restricted the effect of concentration polarization using high flow rates and small volumes monitoring any changes in fluxes during each experiment that can indicate concentration polarization effect in addition the permeability of the membranes was restored by chemical cleaning after each experiment to reduce the concentration polarization effect at maximum the skk model was applied in this study having in mind the following assumptions the only forces affecting the mass transfer are pressure and concentration gradient regardless of the solute charge solvent and membrane charge the model predicts the solute and solvent mass transfer through the membrane the concentration polarization is neglected due the high flow rates used and monitoring on fluxes changes during each experiment having minimized and neglecting phenomenon of polarization and surface charge Ï and ps parameters were calculate solving the eq 3 and eq 4 through the non lineal method of the least square which uses the minimum sum of the square deviations between robs and r calculated from the model for the different jv given form the experimental data 3 2 mass transport hydrodynamical approach for pressure driven systems like nanofiltration the solute flux and solute rejection are described by the convective and diffusive phenomena convection is the result of the solute transport due to the pressure gradient across the membrane and diffusion is the result of the concentration gradient on both sides of the membrane while separation in the ultrafiltration process is described phenomenologically by size repulsion and reverse osmosis is driven by diffusive transport nanofiltration is a complex transitionary process between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis in which the transfer of solute depends on a combination of size repulsion and gradient concentration the model of spiegler and kedem katchalsky assumes that the membrane does not have a charge to express the global mass transfer of a solute in a pressurised nanofiltration membrane system from which the solute transport is quantified as the sum of both phenomena convectional and diffusional allowing to determining the dominant mass transfer mechanism in the process 19 22 5 j s j v c diff j v c conv j v c p 6 j s j diff j v c conv c p j v 7 c p j diff j v c conv by plotting the concentration of ions in the permeate c p and the inverse of the flux trough each membrane jv it is possible to determine the solute flux due to diffusion by the slope jdiff and the solute concentration due to convection by the intercept cconv in addition to better understand the predominant ions transport in each membrane the peclet number was determined for each membrane at each operation pressure evaluated as follows 23 8 pe j v c conv j diff with a pe 1 convective mass transfer is dominant with a pe 1 diffusional mass transfer is dominant the hydraulic permeability lp of the nanofiltration membranes tested was determined from the slope of the fluxes jv obtained at different pressures and the critical pressure pc was determined from the x intercept 3 3 steric hindrance pore model shp nakao and kimura 24 used the theory of the spiegler and kedem katchalsky model to develop a model shp which consider the transport of spherical ions through cylindrical pores hindered by friction forces to determine and approximation of membrane structural parameters such as pore radius nair et al 25 in their study apply the shp model to determine an average pore radius when seawater was subject of different nanofiltration membranes through the ion permeability of each ion 9 Ï 1 s f g q 16 9 q 2 f q 10 s f 2 1 q 2 1 q 4 11 g q 1 2 3 q 2 0 20217 q 5 1 0 75857 q 5 12 f q 1

is the stokes radios of the ion and rp which is the pore radius through the eqs 9 to 13 using the transport parameters determined from the skk model it is possible to establish an average pore radius from the estimation of the pore radius for each membrane related to each ion table 3 3 4 molecular weight cut off mwco values the molecular weight cut off is widely used to express the ability of certain membranes to reject the solute c0 due to selectivity related to the pore diameter cconv and solute characteristics such as the diameter ds of the ion and the pore diameter of the membrane dp 14 c conv c 0 1 d s d p 2 as long as the ion rejections is 90 this expression can be written in terms of the molecular weight of ionic solutes m and the mwco of the membrane 19 15 c conv c 0 1 m mwco 1 3 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 nanofiltration performance and ion rejection the performance of the two membranes i e 4040a and nf90 4040 towards the rejection of calcium magnesium sodium sulphate and chloride ions was evaluated under various conditions table 4 the pattern of ion rejection is similar for the two membranes as the transmembrane pressure increases the ion rejection increase which agrees with results reported by other researchers 26 from fig 2 it can be noticed that while the recovery increases the membrane performance decreases this is because the concentration returns to the feed stream increasing the concentration of ions to be rejected growing the ion driving force and changing membrane surface characteristics affecting the rejection of ions table 4 shows the concentration of the ions achieved at different conditions of operation removal of problematic ions in mineral processing operations such as calcium magnesium and sulphate are removed at concentrations where their concentration has a negligible effect on the processes 50 mg l whit low pressures as 4 bar for processes such as flotation of monazite where the concentration of monovalent ions such as sodium and chloride are also important it is required to go for operational pressures over 16 bar to achieve concentrations 500 mg l where the process is not affected fig 3 shows the trend of ions rejection by the membranes which revealed that 4040a and nf90 4040 performed better overall the rejection mechanisms with these membranes seem to be strictly driven by the transmembrane pressure where rejection increase with the applied pressure achieving the maximum rejection over 12 bar of pressure on the other hand the nf90 4040 seems to have a high rejection of divalent ions when 8 bar of pressure was applied it can be further seen from fig 3 that the 4040a and the nf90 4040 membranes reject 95 of the divalent cations ca2 mg2 and 74 of na at a pressure higher than 12 bar and all recovery range evaluated in the case of the anions membranes 4040a and nf90 4040 could reject over 87 of sulphate and over 73 of chloride 4 2 estimation of reflection coefficient and ion permeability through the spiegler kedem katchalsky model table 5 shows the ps and the Ï for the different ions for the membranes evaluated the reflection coefficient of the nf90 for calcium ions was the highest of the two membranes as the divalent ion rejection of this membrane was superior to the other membrane on the other hand the Ï value for monovalent ions was greater for the 4040a which was the membrane that better performed on monovalent ions rejection from fig 4 it is acceptable to conclude that the skk model can be used to explain the retention obtained experimentally as the experimental data fits well with the theoretical data from the model 4 3 membrane properties 4 3 1 hydraulic permeability of the membranes as it has been reported in previous studies with similar membranes it was found that the flux through the membranes is proportional to the transmembrane pressure fig 5 27 28 obeying the homogenous solution diffusion through the polymeric membrane model that describes the proportionality of the water mass transfer flux and the pressure differential across the membrane the permeate flux with the membranes nf90 4040 starts at an applied pressure of 0 884 while with the membrane 4040a start at 2 45 bar on the other hand membrane 4040a could present a surface with the tightest pores and is more dependent on osmotic pressure requiring more force to mobilise the feed through the membrane additionally because of the differences in pore size between the membranes the permeability of the membranes differs from one to another as the pore size decrease the ions in the solution make the surface of the membrane more compact reducing the permeability of the membranes 4 3 2 calculated molecular weight cut off mwco values the mwco on this occasion was established by the cconv of each membrane determined for the main salt in the feed sodium chloride table 6 shows the mwco values calculated for the two membranes the mwco can be related to mass transport as bigger molecules will diffuse more slowly than smaller molecules in this order of ideas when the mwco is small the diffusion and the chemical interactions will increase for monovalent ions 19 29 it means that membrane 4040a is the one with the more diffusive transfer 4 3 3 estimation of membrane pore radius an average pore radius was determined using the data of the reflection coefficient determined by the skk model for each ion at each recovery table 7 shows that the nf90 and 4040a have similar pore radius the findings demonstrate that a pore size dispersion rather than a fixed pore size was more a distribution pore size with not geometrically define pores for these membranes it was expected to have a similar pattern to the one obtained with the mwco 4040a smallest pore radius than the other membrane however the ionic interactions the complex separation mechanism of nf membranes and ions present in the bore water that might not be accounted in the analysis are obstacles for the accuracy of any model implemented 4 4 mass transport through each membrane hydrodynamical approach by plotting the concentration of ions in the permeate c p and the flux trough each membrane jv it is possible to determine the solute flux due to diffusion by the slope jdiff and the solute transport due to convection by the intercept cconv in nanofiltration the transport of ions is not well defined it seems to be a complex mechanism that combines the sieving effect of the ultra and microfiltration and the diffusion transport by membrane ionic strength that is characterised in reverse osmosis processes fig 6 displays and hydrodynamical approach however it is limited due the assumption of non charged membranes table 8 shows the pe values for each membrane at different operating pressures the mass transport through the membranes is affected by the changes in pressure at low pressures the diffusional mass transfer is dominant for the nf90 4040 and 4040 a pe 1 this effect is due that convective mass transfer being governed by physical parameters such as pressure 35 additionally diffusive mass transfer is stronger than convective mass transfer which means that the solvation energies and the effect of ion concentration are more notorious at low operation pressures 36 as discussed previously 4 5 the effect of a second nanofiltration stage on water recovery recovery of high percentages of water is one of the main limitations of water treatment processes fig 7 shows the implementation of two stages of nanofiltration using the membrane 4040a membrane this experiment was evaluated at 12 bar of pressure and by recovering the concentrate from the first stage which is mixed in the same proportion with bore water this mix is fed into a second nanofiltration stage and filtration was conducted from these experiments it was determined that the final ion removal at 90 recovery of the permeate was 91 for ca2 and mg2 70 for na 63 for cl and 93 for so4 2 for mineral processing operations where the presence of divalent ions ca2 mg2 and so4 2 is critical such as the flotation of phosphate minerals the operation of a two stage system could be a promising option to maximize water resources utilization the removal of monovalent ions through the two stage system may not be adequate for operations such as the monazite flotation where the concentration of monovalent ions na cl over 500 ppm could slightly affect the recovery and grade of the concentrate these results indicate that nanofiltration systems could be tailor made according to the necessities of each operation as different minerals are susceptible to a different ion in solution 4 6 energy cost estimation for single stage and two stage processes in pressure driven processes energy cost is the main component in the operating cost of these systems representing the high consumption of energy in processes such as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are principally associated with the high pressure pumps used which could represents up to 60 of total water treatment cost 37 the specific energy requirements for a pressure driven process can be quantified by the correlation of the pressure and the recovery of permeate and generally the energy requirement increases linearly with increasing the pressure of the system 36 38 the specific energy consumption sec of membrane based water treatment can be given by 16 sec p 100 É³ r 36 where Î´p is the transmembrane pressure in bar É³ is the global pumping efficiency generally 85 and r is the water recovery of the system table 9 shows the comparison of specific energy consumption at different transmembrane pressures in this comparison an assumption of standard water consumption in mineral processing operations of 3 m3 per ton of ore processed and electricity prices of 0 123 kwh for industry reported by the australian energy council in 2022 were considered 1 39 in this study it was found that a single stage with 4040a membrane at 12 bar of transmembrane pressure resulted in conditions to produce water with sufficient quality for mineral separation processes representing an energy cost of 0 192 ton comparing a single stage with the two stage process it can be noticed that the increment on energy cost is 33 on the other hand the water recovery increases up to 90 comparing the result in table 9 with high pressure systems such as reverse osmosis that usually require around 20 bar to treat brackish water with similar quality as the one tested in this study is expected an estimated energy cost increase of up to a 67 rising the energy consumption from 0 871 to 0 523 kwh m3 and producing water with ultrahigh purity that in mineral processing operations sometimes is not required 37 40 even though comparing the two stage nanofiltration process will represent a 25 less energy consumption than process with high transmembrane pressure membrane replacement cost is another key operating cost this variable is associated with the permeability production rate of each membrane and its lifetime this parameter can be expressed through the following expression 41 17 rc 2 74 f r m c m p 1 m l 1 where rc is the unit replacement cost represented in aud per every m3 of water produced at different time of membrane lifetime mc is the cost of the membrane aud ft2 which was obtained from a local membrane provider fr is the water recovery mp is the membrane productivity and ml is the membrane fig 8 shows how the permeability of each membrane can modify the cost of replacement of a unit for each m3 of water produced therefore a membrane with low mwco will represent an increase in cost due to the low membrane production rate in that order ideas the cost of replacement of membranes that performed with low ion rejection but high permeate flow rate will be lower than membranes that have similar characteristics to a reverse osmosis membrane such as the 4040a or the nf90 4040 a factor to consider in the membrane replacement cost is the lifetime of the membrane as the ion rejection increases the lifetime of the membrane is reduced due to multiple factors such as fouling and concentration polarization resulting in increase of pressure to achieve the same results 42 43 hence comparing nanofiltration membranes with reverse osmosis membranes since in nanofiltration the ion rejection is lower than in ro it is expected to have a higher lifetime operating with nanofiltration membranes resulting in reasonable membrane replacement costs producing water with the quality required it is important to mention that cost optimization in pressure driven processes will depend mainly of the operation pressure of the system and the right selection of membrane to achieve the water quality required 5 conclusions mineral processing operations that require high water purity use methods such as reverse osmosis to remove impurities which usually is associated with high energy consumption and high operational costs therefore this study presents nanofiltration as an alternative method that under the right conditions of operation and the suitable membrane can be used as a potential method to treat bore water with high salinity as pressure is the main factor on pressure driven processes impacting up to 60 of operational costs it was demonstrated that using nanofiltration instead of reverse osmosis could be decreased the sec significatively the nanofiltration membranes nf90 4040 and 4040a were considered in a pilot scale rig to study their performance in producing water with concentrations under the threshold of 50 mg l of calcium and magnesium and 500 mg l of sodium the influence of pressure was evaluated and it was found that the ion rejection is proportional to the transmembrane pressure additionally it was determined that pressure is an important factor in the transfer mass mechanism in this case the rejection of ions by nanofiltration through the 4040a and the nf90 membranes at low pressures was driven by diffusional mass transfer however over 12 bars of transmembrane pressure the process is driven by convection or sieving effect through the pores from the hydraulic point of view it was demonstrated that the high permeate leads to a low ion rejection concluding that the highest permeate flux between leads to low rejection also it was found that both membranes nf90 4040 4040a reject 95 of calcium and magnesium and 74 of sodium at pressures over 12 bar and recovery of 65 the mwco determined in this study of 4040a ecotechnol was lower than the other membrane used mwco of nf90 4040 estimated agrees with the range reported in other studies that used this membrane in similar conditions the skk model was fitted to predict the ion removal of the two nanofiltration membranes used the solute permeability and reflection coefficient constants were obtained reflecting a satisfactory representation of the nanofiltration process of the bore water used in this study furthermore it was demonstrated that the permeability of divalent ions is lower than that of monovalent ions declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

processing operations furthermore a two stage nanofiltration system was evaluated to improve water recovery the results obtained in this study present nanofiltration as a technology that can be implemented in the mining industry to supply water of suitable quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the raw water for this study was provided from a mining operation in western australia and the characterization of the water is shown in table 1 it is a relatively low total dissolved solids tds raw water with the main ions of interest being mg2 ca2 na cl and so4 2 two organic nanofiltrations nf membranes fabricated by different companies dow filmtec and ecotechnol were studied the nanofiltration membranes used are thin film composite membranes nf90 4040 and 4040 a are characterised as tight nanofiltration membranes with relatively high sodium chloride rejection 85 in addition one ultrafiltration uf membrane was used as pre treatment to remove suspended solids to avoid undesirable fouling of the nf membranes studied table 2 shows the commercial names of the membranes and their corresponding suppliers as the primary polymer used for their fabrication 2 2 methods 2 2 1 nanofiltration before each experiment the membranes were washed with caustic solution 0 2 w w to restore the membrane s permeability each membrane was pressurised using deionised water at 4 bars for 30 min until the conductivity of the permeate was steady and similar to the initial deionised water the raw water used in the experiments went through an ultrafiltration stage as pre treatment to avoid nanofiltration membrane fouling the nanofiltration experiments were carried out with two different nanofiltration membranes and an initial mass of 22 kg of ultra filtrated bore water the feed was limited to a small volume to avoid the effect of concentration polarization the concentrate was recirculated to the feed tank and the permeate was collected and sampled at three different recoveries 15 45 and 65 the feed pressure was adjusted for each test and was varied in the range of 8 to 20 bar additionally the permeate flux and the ion s rejection were determined by measuring the permeate flow and the concentration of ions in the permeate the filtration experiments were conducted in a pilot unit supplied by ecotechnol australia fig 1 this pilot unit was designed to test different ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes under other conditions such as pressure and permeate recovery the ecotechnol rig is mainly composed of one feed tank with a volume of 0 1 m3 a high pressure booster pump which was used for the filtration and for the cleaning of the membrane and one pressure vessel housing on a standard 40 x4 membrane module with retractile end and feed caps allowing the change of membrane a manual regulation valve on the concentrate line to adjust the pressure of operation and the permeate and concentrate lines which can be fitted as recirculation loop with the feed tank and an external scale to measure the weight of the desirable recovery of permeate 2 2 2 water analysis the analysis of ion concentrations in the feed and permeated was performed by three different methods for the analysis of cations such as ca2 mg2 na a icp oes agilent technologies inc usa technique was used following the standard method us epa 6010 sulphate concentration was measured following the standardised procedure apha 4500 so4 2 e and the concentration of chloride was determined by the standard colorimetric method apha 4500 cl g 3 theory 3 1 spigeler kedem katchalsky skk model the model of spiegler kedem and katchalsky skk presents the transport of the solvent trough membranes as a black box where principles of phenomenological mass transfer can be applied this model approaches the transport phenomenon for a two component system solute and solvent using the theory of irreversible thermodynamics with the following equations 1 j v l p p Ï Ð¿ 2 j s p s c s 1 Ï j v c s where jv and js are the solvent and solute flux lp is the hydraulic permeability Î´p represents the pressure drop across the membrane ps is the solute permeability Î´cs is the difference of concentration from the surface of the membrane in the bulk side and in the permeate Ï is the reflection coefficient and Î´Ð¿ is respectively the osmotic pressure through the membrane in addition the term Ï Î´Ð¿ can be defined as the critical pressure which is the pressure when the transmembrane pressure is equal to osmotic pressure triggering the mobilisation of ions from the feed water to the concentrate 19 c s represents the solute concentration in the membrane which is represented as the average concentration on both side of the membrane to represent accurately the solute concentration in the membrane spiegler and kedem applied eq 2 in a differential membrane layer and integrated it across a membrane resulting in the following expressions which are dependent on the experimental ion rejection robs and the solvent flux jv 20 21 3 r obs Ï 1 f 1 Ïf and f 4 f e j v 1 Ï p s the skk model is a model that provides phenomenological information such as the ions permeability ps and the reflection coefficient Ï related to the transport of the solute from the skk expression it can be noticed that if jv tends to be infinite then robs Ï additionally if the solutes are small enough to pass through the membrane pore the Ï is expected to be below 1 meaning that the convective solute transport takes place into the solute transport otherwise the membranes will have dense structure with extremely low porosity where solute transport takes place only by diffusion as is the case on ro membranes it is well known that the skk model was developed initially for uncharged membranes with dense structure such as ro membranes unlike ro membranes nf membranes are characterised by slightly charged surface 22 however in this study we have neglected the membranes charge because those membranes have been classified by the manufacturer as tightest nf membranes with similar characteristics and behaviour as ro membranes in this study we have restricted the effect of concentration polarization using high flow rates and small volumes monitoring any changes in fluxes during each experiment that can indicate concentration polarization effect in addition the permeability of the membranes was restored by chemical cleaning after each experiment to reduce the concentration polarization effect at maximum the skk model was applied in this study having in mind the following assumptions the only forces affecting the mass transfer are pressure and concentration gradient regardless of the solute charge solvent and membrane charge the model predicts the solute and solvent mass transfer through the membrane the concentration polarization is neglected due the high flow rates used and monitoring on fluxes changes during each experiment having minimized and neglecting phenomenon of polarization and surface charge Ï and ps parameters were calculate solving the eq 3 and eq 4 through the non lineal method of the least square which uses the minimum sum of the square deviations between robs and r calculated from the model for the different jv given form the experimental data 3 2 mass transport hydrodynamical approach for pressure driven systems like nanofiltration the solute flux and solute rejection are described by the convective and diffusive phenomena convection is the result of the solute transport due to the pressure gradient across the membrane and diffusion is the result of the concentration gradient on both sides of the membrane while separation in the ultrafiltration process is described phenomenologically by size repulsion and reverse osmosis is driven by diffusive transport nanofiltration is a complex transitionary process between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis in which the transfer of solute depends on a combination of size repulsion and gradient concentration the model of spiegler and kedem katchalsky assumes that the membrane does not have a charge to express the global mass transfer of a solute in a pressurised nanofiltration membrane system from which the solute transport is quantified as the sum of both phenomena convectional and diffusional allowing to determining the dominant mass transfer mechanism in the process 19 22 5 j s j v c diff j v c conv j v c p 6 j s j diff j v c conv c p j v 7 c p j diff j v c conv by plotting the concentration of ions in the permeate c p and the inverse of the flux trough each membrane jv it is possible to determine the solute flux due to diffusion by the slope jdiff and the solute concentration due to convection by the intercept cconv in addition to better understand the predominant ions transport in each membrane the peclet number was determined for each membrane at each operation pressure evaluated as follows 23 8 pe j v c conv j diff with a pe 1 convective mass transfer is dominant with a pe 1 diffusional mass transfer is dominant the hydraulic permeability lp of the nanofiltration membranes tested was determined from the slope of the fluxes jv obtained at different pressures and the critical pressure pc was determined from the x intercept 3 3 steric hindrance pore model shp nakao and kimura 24 used the theory of the spiegler and kedem katchalsky model to develop a model shp which consider the transport of spherical ions through cylindrical pores hindered by friction forces to determine and approximation of membrane structural parameters such as pore radius nair et al 25 in their study apply the shp model to determine an average pore radius when seawater was subject of different nanofiltration membranes through the ion permeability of each ion 9 Ï 1 s f g q 16 9 q 2 f q 10 s f 2 1 q 2 1 q 4 11 g q 1 2 3 q 2 0 20217 q 5 1 0 75857 q 5 12 f q 1

is the stokes radios of the ion and rp which is the pore radius through the eqs 9 to 13 using the transport parameters determined from the skk model it is possible to establish an average pore radius from the estimation of the pore radius for each membrane related to each ion table 3 3 4 molecular weight cut off mwco values the molecular weight cut off is widely used to express the ability of certain membranes to reject the solute c0 due to selectivity related to the pore diameter cconv and solute characteristics such as the diameter ds of the ion and the pore diameter of the membrane dp 14 c conv c 0 1 d s d p 2 as long as the ion rejections is 90 this expression can be written in terms of the molecular weight of ionic solutes m and the mwco of the membrane 19 15 c conv c 0 1 m mwco 1 3 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 nanofiltration performance and ion rejection the performance of the two membranes i e 4040a and nf90 4040 towards the rejection of calcium magnesium sodium sulphate and chloride ions was evaluated under various conditions table 4 the pattern of ion rejection is similar for the two membranes as the transmembrane pressure increases the ion rejection increase which agrees with results reported by other researchers 26 from fig 2 it can be noticed that while the recovery increases the membrane performance decreases this is because the concentration returns to the feed stream increasing the concentration of ions to be rejected growing the ion driving force and changing membrane surface characteristics affecting the rejection of ions table 4 shows the concentration of the ions achieved at different conditions of operation removal of problematic ions in mineral processing operations such as calcium magnesium and sulphate are removed at concentrations where their concentration has a negligible effect on the processes 50 mg l whit low pressures as 4 bar for processes such as flotation of monazite where the concentration of monovalent ions such as sodium and chloride are also important it is required to go for operational pressures over 16 bar to achieve concentrations 500 mg l where the process is not affected fig 3 shows the trend of ions rejection by the membranes which revealed that 4040a and nf90 4040 performed better overall the rejection mechanisms with these membranes seem to be strictly driven by the transmembrane pressure where rejection increase with the applied pressure achieving the maximum rejection over 12 bar of pressure on the other hand the nf90 4040 seems to have a high rejection of divalent ions when 8 bar of pressure was applied it can be further seen from fig 3 that the 4040a and the nf90 4040 membranes reject 95 of the divalent cations ca2 mg2 and 74 of na at a pressure higher than 12 bar and all recovery range evaluated in the case of the anions membranes 4040a and nf90 4040 could reject over 87 of sulphate and over 73 of chloride 4 2 estimation of reflection coefficient and ion permeability through the spiegler kedem katchalsky model table 5 shows the ps and the Ï for the different ions for the membranes evaluated the reflection coefficient of the nf90 for calcium ions was the highest of the two membranes as the divalent ion rejection of this membrane was superior to the other membrane on the other hand the Ï value for monovalent ions was greater for the 4040a which was the membrane that better performed on monovalent ions rejection from fig 4 it is acceptable to conclude that the skk model can be used to explain the retention obtained experimentally as the experimental data fits well with the theoretical data from the model 4 3 membrane properties 4 3 1 hydraulic permeability of the membranes as it has been reported in previous studies with similar membranes it was found that the flux through the membranes is proportional to the transmembrane pressure fig 5 27 28 obeying the homogenous solution diffusion through the polymeric membrane model that describes the proportionality of the water mass transfer flux and the pressure differential across the membrane the permeate flux with the membranes nf90 4040 starts at an applied pressure of 0 884 while with the membrane 4040a start at 2 45 bar on the other hand membrane 4040a could present a surface with the tightest pores and is more dependent on osmotic pressure requiring more force to mobilise the feed through the membrane additionally because of the differences in pore size between the membranes the permeability of the membranes differs from one to another as the pore size decrease the ions in the solution make the surface of the membrane more compact reducing the permeability of the membranes 4 3 2 calculated molecular weight cut off mwco values the mwco on this occasion was established by the cconv of each membrane determined for the main salt in the feed sodium chloride table 6 shows the mwco values calculated for the two membranes the mwco can be related to mass transport as bigger molecules will diffuse more slowly than smaller molecules in this order of ideas when the mwco is small the diffusion and the chemical interactions will increase for monovalent ions 19 29 it means that membrane 4040a is the one with the more diffusive transfer 4 3 3 estimation of membrane pore radius an average pore radius was determined using the data of the reflection coefficient determined by the skk model for each ion at each recovery table 7 shows that the nf90 and 4040a have similar pore radius the findings demonstrate that a pore size dispersion rather than a fixed pore size was more a distribution pore size with not geometrically define pores for these membranes it was expected to have a similar pattern to the one obtained with the mwco 4040a smallest pore radius than the other membrane however the ionic interactions the complex separation mechanism of nf membranes and ions present in the bore water that might not be accounted in the analysis are obstacles for the accuracy of any model implemented 4 4 mass transport through each membrane hydrodynamical approach by plotting the concentration of ions in the permeate c p and the flux trough each membrane jv it is possible to determine the solute flux due to diffusion by the slope jdiff and the solute transport due to convection by the intercept cconv in nanofiltration the transport of ions is not well defined it seems to be a complex mechanism that combines the sieving effect of the ultra and microfiltration and the diffusion transport by membrane ionic strength that is characterised in reverse osmosis processes fig 6 displays and hydrodynamical approach however it is limited due the assumption of non charged membranes table 8 shows the pe values for each membrane at different operating pressures the mass transport through the membranes is affected by the changes in pressure at low pressures the diffusional mass transfer is dominant for the nf90 4040 and 4040 a pe 1 this effect is due that convective mass transfer being governed by physical parameters such as pressure 35 additionally diffusive mass transfer is stronger than convective mass transfer which means that the solvation energies and the effect of ion concentration are more notorious at low operation pressures 36 as discussed previously 4 5 the effect of a second nanofiltration stage on water recovery recovery of high percentages of water is one of the main limitations of water treatment processes fig 7 shows the implementation of two stages of nanofiltration using the membrane 4040a membrane this experiment was evaluated at 12 bar of pressure and by recovering the concentrate from the first stage which is mixed in the same proportion with bore water this mix is fed into a second nanofiltration stage and filtration was conducted from these experiments it was determined that the final ion removal at 90 recovery of the permeate was 91 for ca2 and mg2 70 for na 63 for cl and 93 for so4 2 for mineral processing operations where the presence of divalent ions ca2 mg2 and so4 2 is critical such as the flotation of phosphate minerals the operation of a two stage system could be a promising option to maximize water resources utilization the removal of monovalent ions through the two stage system may not be adequate for operations such as the monazite flotation where the concentration of monovalent ions na cl over 500 ppm could slightly affect the recovery and grade of the concentrate these results indicate that nanofiltration systems could be tailor made according to the necessities of each operation as different minerals are susceptible to a different ion in solution 4 6 energy cost estimation for single stage and two stage processes in pressure driven processes energy cost is the main component in the operating cost of these systems representing the high consumption of energy in processes such as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are principally associated with the high pressure pumps used which could represents up to 60 of total water treatment cost 37 the specific energy requirements for a pressure driven process can be quantified by the correlation of the pressure and the recovery of permeate and generally the energy requirement increases linearly with increasing the pressure of the system 36 38 the specific energy consumption sec of membrane based water treatment can be given by 16 sec p 100 É³ r 36 where Î´p is the transmembrane pressure in bar É³ is the global pumping efficiency generally 85 and r is the water recovery of the system table 9 shows the comparison of specific energy consumption at different transmembrane pressures in this comparison an assumption of standard water consumption in mineral processing operations of 3 m3 per ton of ore processed and electricity prices of 0 123 kwh for industry reported by the australian energy council in 2022 were considered 1 39 in this study it was found that a single stage with 4040a membrane at 12 bar of transmembrane pressure resulted in conditions to produce water with sufficient quality for mineral separation processes representing an energy cost of 0 192 ton comparing a single stage with the two stage process it can be noticed that the increment on energy cost is 33 on the other hand the water recovery increases up to 90 comparing the result in table 9 with high pressure systems such as reverse osmosis that usually require around 20 bar to treat brackish water with similar quality as the one tested in this study is expected an estimated energy cost increase of up to a 67 rising the energy consumption from 0 871 to 0 523 kwh m3 and producing water with ultrahigh purity that in mineral processing operations sometimes is not required 37 40 even though comparing the two stage nanofiltration process will represent a 25 less energy consumption than process with high transmembrane pressure membrane replacement cost is another key operating cost this variable is associated with the permeability production rate of each membrane and its lifetime this parameter can be expressed through the following expression 41 17 rc 2 74 f r m c m p 1 m l 1 where rc is the unit replacement cost represented in aud per every m3 of water produced at different time of membrane lifetime mc is the cost of the membrane aud ft2 which was obtained from a local membrane provider fr is the water recovery mp is the membrane productivity and ml is the membrane fig 8 shows how the permeability of each membrane can modify the cost of replacement of a unit for each m3 of water produced therefore a membrane with low mwco will represent an increase in cost due to the low membrane production rate in that order ideas the cost of replacement of membranes that performed with low ion rejection but high permeate flow rate will be lower than membranes that have similar characteristics to a reverse osmosis membrane such as the 4040a or the nf90 4040 a factor to consider in the membrane replacement cost is the lifetime of the membrane as the ion rejection increases the lifetime of the membrane is reduced due to multiple factors such as fouling and concentration polarization resulting in increase of pressure to achieve the same results 42 43 hence comparing nanofiltration membranes with reverse osmosis membranes since in nanofiltration the ion rejection is lower than in ro it is expected to have a higher lifetime operating with nanofiltration membranes resulting in reasonable membrane replacement costs producing water with the quality required it is important to mention that cost optimization in pressure driven processes will depend mainly of the operation pressure of the system and the right selection of membrane to achieve the water quality required 5 conclusions mineral processing operations that require high water purity use methods such as reverse osmosis to remove impurities which usually is associated with high energy consumption and high operational costs therefore this study presents nanofiltration as an alternative method that under the right conditions of operation and the suitable membrane can be used as a potential method to treat bore water with high salinity as pressure is the main factor on pressure driven processes impacting up to 60 of operational costs it was demonstrated that using nanofiltration instead of reverse osmosis could be decreased the sec significatively the nanofiltration membranes nf90 4040 and 4040a were considered in a pilot scale rig to study their performance in producing water with concentrations under the threshold of 50 mg l of calcium and magnesium and 500 mg l of sodium the influence of pressure was evaluated and it was found that the ion rejection is proportional to the transmembrane pressure additionally it was determined that pressure is an important factor in the transfer mass mechanism in this case the rejection of ions by nanofiltration through the 4040a and the nf90 membranes at low pressures was driven by diffusional mass transfer however over 12 bars of transmembrane pressure the process is driven by convection or sieving effect through the pores from the hydraulic point of view it was demonstrated that the high permeate leads to a low ion rejection concluding that the highest permeate flux between leads to low rejection also it was found that both membranes nf90 4040 4040a reject 95 of calcium and magnesium and 74 of sodium at pressures over 12 bar and recovery of 65 the mwco determined in this study of 4040a ecotechnol was lower than the other membrane used mwco of nf90 4040 estimated agrees with the range reported in other studies that used this membrane in similar conditions the skk model was fitted to predict the ion removal of the two nanofiltration membranes used the solute permeability and reflection coefficient constants were obtained reflecting a satisfactory representation of the nanofiltration process of the bore water used in this study furthermore it was demonstrated that the permeability of divalent ions is lower than that of monovalent ions declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

12561,struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o electrochemical precipitation method is a compelling new way to recover phosphorus from wastewater in this study a suite of common magnesium materials on the market is tested to understand the effect of anode composition on the electrochemical performance of electrolysis reactors with single and batch modes the pure magnesium anode demonstrated the fast phosphorus removal efficiency and best mg2 releasing among three alloys but it cannot be sustained and must be replaced frequently large amounts of brucite were mixed into precipitates decreasing their purity during the pure mg anode electrolysis reaction the mg anode materials influenced the elemental composition of struvite produced from the electrolysis reactor which was not standard 1 1 1 mg p n al element is the most significant contaminant released from az31 and az91d among three impurities al mn zn the mg anode which had higher al content released more al3 into the electrolyte which was easy to be adsorbed by struvite precipitates with the cycle the al3 concentration in the effluents also decreased with the experiment prolonged results showed that az31 could support mg2 stable production in batch mode without as large impurity ions releasing as az91d in the electrolyte or the precipitated struvite keywords magnesium anode electrolysis struvite pure mg az31 alloy data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction agricultural and municipal wastewater streams are well known for their high content of nutrients such as phosphorus nitrogen and organic matter which should be recovered using the efficient and low energy method before discharging into the environment 1 2 excessive phosphorus discharging into water bodies and soil causes serious eutrophication problems at the same time phosphorus is an essential but non renewable element for organisms participating in biological activities such as building cell structures genetic materials and bones 3 4 it is worth noting that plants absorb phosphorus from the soil while humans and animals supplement phosphorus through diet 5 however phosphorus is widely deposited in minerals called phosphate rock or phosphorite and is never found as a free element in the environment due to its high reactivity 6 unfortunately the limited amount of phosphate rocks leads to phosphorus risk that may occur shortly 7 nowadays most of global phosphate rock production is used in agricultural production or applications especially fertilizers 8 the phosphorus consumption in the soil is mainly compensated for the phosphorus fertilizers whereas the increasing demand population growth and costs of fertilizers significantly limit the affordability of agricultural products 9 meanwhile produced and consumed phosphorus by human activities eventually enters into water bodies and accumulates as wastewater 10 therefore phosphorus recovery from wastewater is an environmentally friendly and effective way to alleviate the phosphorus dilemma various technologies have been developed to treat wastewater and recover phosphorus such as reverse osmosis evaporation and electrodialysis 11 12 chemical precipitation is one of the most widely applied methods by adding metal reagents to form insoluble phosphorus minerals 13 struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o or map precipitation has been shown as a promising technology to recover phosphorus from wastewater for high quality slow releasing fertilizer 14 related technologies with struvite are already under investigation such as struvite crystallization 15 16 biochar adsorption 17 18 air fuel cell 2 19 or electrochemical precipitation 1 14 20 it has become an economically and environmentally attractive alternative for resource recycling 21 meanwhile existing phosphorus removal and recovery technologies still have room for improvement in reducing chemical inputs minimizing sludge treatment simplifying operations and saving energy 17 the reactor with an mg based sacrificial anode to form struvite has been proposed as a practical and feasible way to recover phosphorus and ammonia from polluted water 22 23 the two electrochemical half reactions eq 1 2 and a precipitation reaction eq 3 constitute the main reactions that happened in the reactor 1 mg m g 2 2 e anodic reaction 2 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h cathodic reaction 3 m g 2 n h 4 h n p o 4 n 3 6 h 2 o mgn h 4 p o 4 6 h 2 o n h precipitation reaction however the mg based anode electrochemical behavior is complex and lacks much experience especially in anode corrosion and real wastewater treatment mg alloys have a negative standard reduction potential of 2 37 vs she 24 leading to poor corrosion resistance in aqueous solutions 25 when an mg based anode is polarized it produces mg2 and h2 bubbles typically involve hydrogen evolution he 26 meanwhile a normal cathodic hydrogen evolution che happens on the noble cathode such as pt the he rate has been found to increase with a rise of potential or current density called the negative difference effect nde at the same time there is a passivating crystalline oxide layer formation accompanied by he inhibiting the mg2 release from the mg based anode 27 the second phase inside the mg based anode also cause internal galvanic corrosion 28 the sacrificial mg alloys for anode greatly impact the electrolysis systems performance such as releasing impurity into the solution and poor sustainability 29 on the other hand impurity metal ions cu2 zn2 in the solution were certified to precipitate with struvite as amorphous cu phosphate cu po4 and zn phosphate zn po4 on the surface 30 this kind of mixing will affect the efficiency of struvite as slow release fertilizer to soil and plants 31 overall it is necessary to observe the ion release of different mg alloys anodes under polarization conditions and the elemental composition of struvite precipitates the objectives of this work were to assess the performances of sacrificial mg based anode treating synthetic wastewater in a single compartment electrolysis reactor and to compare the effect of three different types of anode materials pure mg vs az31 vs az91d mg alloy we also investigated the phosphorus removal efficiency magnesium releasing and impurity ions al mn zn released from polarized mg based anode the effect of impurity released from mg based alloys for electrolyte and precipitated struvite is also a key point of observation according to its elemental composition structure and impurity concentration by x ray diffraction xrd and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms to our knowledge previous researchers concerning sacrificial mg based anode electrolysis systems focused on single batch experiments and should have paid more attention to the continuous application we also investigated and compared the stability of electrolysis with these three mg materials respectively in consecutive

anodes was repeated three times where the results were expressed as mean standard deviation meanwhile the second part of the experiment subjected the three mg alloys to ten consecutive experiments to test their sustainability as anodes in other words the same mg anode was employed to treat ten consecutive batches of synthetic wastewater without replacing the anode and cleaning the reactor inside

results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical performance of materials to investigate anode corrosion processes divergences the raw pure mg and mg alloys are employed as the working electrode for electrochemical tests as a comparison lsvs of them were tested in configured aqueous solution it revealed that the corrosion processes of these three mg alloys were visibly different in the potential range of 3 0 v vs rhe and 2 5 v vs rhe fig 1 the current density j of pure mg increased more slowly at positive potentials than other mg alloys this phenomenon was caused by the quicker formation of precipitates double layer containing struvite and magnesium hydroxide on pure mg surface an insulating layer blocking electron 34 in contrast the layer formed more lowly on the exposed surface of az31 and az91d 35 the double precipitates layer had a significant physical shielding effect capturing corrosive anions such as cl which decreased the cl concentration near the mg anode surface inhibiting corrosion 36 the addition of al could increase the corrosion resistance of mg in part 37 guaranteeing the stable rate of the current density of az31 and az91d in a short period the current density in az31 suddenly declined at 1 4 v then returned to linear growth at 0 5 v as the potential increased this decline could be explained by a short lived precipitated layer formed but broken with gas bubbles 38 40 by contrast the lsvs of az91d was a straight line illustrating that few precipitates were deposited on its surface the internal galvanic corrosion by second phases or impurities in mg alloys made its surface layer complicated 28 the noise observed at high potentials for three anodes may be attributed to hydrogen gas bubbles produced on the surface as a significant energy barrier affecting electrical conductivity 41 it is observed that pure mg reveals severer corrosion than mg alloys signifying that the precipitates layer has a remarkable influence on conductivity other researchers also observed similar phenomenon 23 40 42 3 2 effect of anode materials on performance of electrolysis reactor the corrosion and electrolytic processes of mg alloys are complex and controversial due to their intricate components 40 43 accompanied by other metal ions released into the electrolyte such as zn2 mn2 al3 23 due to the lack of agreement regarding the performance of mg alloys during the constant current electrochemical struvite reaction pure mg az31 and az91d were individually hired as the anode the phosphate removal efficiency in electrolysis reactor with three anodes appeared to be different patterns it is obvious that pure mg anode had the highest and quickest efficiency reaching 98 within 30 min fig 2a the phosphate in the aqueous solution could be removed at 99 within 60 min in all electrolysis reactors except the az91d at 95 regarding the pure mg reactor the mass of existing mg2 slowly increased in 20 min then rapidly grew after 20 min the rate of mg2 increase was closer to the rate of mg2 produced by the polarized pure mg anode the initial growth rate of mg2 was less than that of the later period indicating that a massive mg consuming reaction occurred in the first 20 min consistent with phosphate removal as struvite fig 2b the ph of the electrolyte at that time was between 8 8 and 9 2 appendix fig s1 which was suitable for struvite formation within the first 20 min 86 phosphate was removed through reacting with mg2 and nh4 after that the precipitation reaction was limited by low phosphate while the mg consumption decreased therefore the mg2 production increased in the pure mg reactor after 20 min in contrast the mg consuming reaction significantly lasted longer in az31 and az91d with less existing mg2 in the electrolyte indicating that the pure mg anode produced mg2 the fastest and most of the three which means the best performance of phosphate removal in single batch experiment based on the existing mg2 and removed phosphate we assumed that all phosphate was removed by struvite formation so the total mg2 produced was the sum of existing and removed mg2 the mg2 production from three anode were all over the theoretical mass indicating that the hydrogen evolution reaction took place in three polarized mg alloys the mass of mg2 produced in pure mg anode outclassed that of others at the same time the az91d showed the worst mg2 production capacity fig 2c the hydrogen evolution reaction occurring on the surface of mg alloys was the principal factor affecting the mg2 releasing under the same current involving mg corrosion 44 a higher mg2 production represented more severe corrosion to some extent almg alloys contain grain boundary Î² phase mg17al12 which is more inert to corrosion than Î± phase 37 45 when the content of Î² phase is less than 10 Î² phase facilitates the formation of passivating mg oh 2 film and hinders its corrosion 46 az91d had a nearly continuous network of Î² phase which far outnumbered az31 28 on the other hand previous researchers showed that al and zn in mg alloys most likely inhibited the struvite grown and decreased their crystal size 47 48 in our previous research the surface film upon exposed mg anode to water containing n and p consisted of a compact inner mgo layer and a top of mg oh 2 mgnh4po4 mgco3 layer 49 this decrease in struvite crystal size and mixed materials in mg alloys might produce a more compact surface layer inhibiting the mg2 production 23 therefore pure mg was more accessible to corrosion and produced mg2 more than the other two as the anode in the electrolysis reactor the relationship between mg dissolution from three mg alloys and the phosphate removal efficiency was displayed in appendix fig s2 interestingly no matter what alloys were used for the mg anode the relationship was fixed in other words the phosphate removal achieved 95 as long as the mg2 dissolution from the anode reached 108 mg l otherwise the type of mg anode materials determined the rate of mg2 produced proving the importance of selecting the most suitable materials as for the pollution of impurity metal ions fig 2d f showed the concentrations of al3 mn2 and zn2 the struvite formed in the natural or industrial systems generally includes some other ions such as fe3 ca2 na k cl as well as organics ions 50 the element al mn and zn are the highest content and have an enormous change in mg alloys except for mg which we pay most attention to in the process of mg alloys anodizing al3 was the most impurity released into the electrolyte positively correlated with the al content in the mg alloys the al3 concentration in the az91d reactor arrived at the highest peak at 0 98 mg l at 40 min then declined to 0 76 mg l at 60 min suggesting that 40 min was the critical turning point for al3 in the electrolyte to enter the sediments the accumulation of al3 in the az91d electrolyte was more significant than the removal before 40 min and the reverse occurred the trend of al3 from the az31 anode was similar to az91d this decrease was most likely due to the adsorption on the plate surface or participation in the sediments the process of al removal was slow and slightly different in each experiment so there was a significant deviation at 40 min in the az91d reactor the al content of the az91d plate was nearly three times as much as the az31 plate but the al3 release of az91d was only twice as az31 therefore the higher the amount of al element in the mg alloys the more al3 was likely to dissolve into the electrolyte but the increase is not fixed on the other hand the mn2 release was different from al3 little mn2 was released from the polarized pure mg and az91d anode under 3 Î¼g l while the mn2 in az31 s electrolyte outclassed others and arrived at 0 023 mg l at 60 min meanwhile the content of mn in az91d alloys at 0 32 was higher than in az31 alloys at 0 263 but released less mn2 it demonstrated that the mn2 release was not only related to alloy s mn content but also affected by other factors such as al content interestingly unlike the very little al3 and mn2 detected in pure mg electrolyte a maximum of 6 Î¼g l zn2 was released from pure mg anode the az31 and az91d anodes released a similar amount of zn2 about 0 02 mg l although the zn content of az31 and az91d plates were distinct the zn2 release was not much different and needed further research in general az91d anode released the most impurities among the three mg alloys and al3 was the most influential impurity ion pure mg anode hardly produced al3 mn2 and zn2 in the electrolyte 3 3 characterization of anode the sem results revealed the presence of mg n and p on the three anodes surfaces after one hour electrolysis indicating the adsorption of struvite precipitates fig 3 previous studies investigated that an al rich layer could form at the oxide alloy substrate upon the mgal alloys and noble impurity elements could be entrapped in the mg oh 2 layer 51 the al element detected revealed evidence of the al rich layer in the mg corrosion oxide hydroxide film fig 3e f this al rich layer affected the morphology of corrosion on the mg surface it is apparent that the surface films on the three plates were all porous and irregular while the az31 layer rupture was denser and more complex than the other two under the same magnification in addition there were evident massive holes that appeared on the az91d surface which contains a high concentration of al metal impurities in the metal nevertheless the al element detected on the az31 surface was well above that of az91d previous researchers discovered that impurity was enriched in the passivating corrosion layer of mg anode more significantly under the film on the metal surface 52 the impurity enrichment might impact the deposition of magnesium oxide hydroxide or other magnesium compounds therefore the holes appeared because magnesium compounds had difficulty accumulating on al metal complexes at the same time sem eds detects the chemical composition on the 0 1 Î¼m depth surface therefore the precipitates layer on the az91d was inferred to be thicker than 0 1 Î¼m and contained less al element interestingly the ratio of mg p in pure mg plate was the highest among the three representing the highest adsorption of struvite 3 4 performance of consecutive experiments in addition to the single batch performance of mg anode in aqueous solution treatment the stability of p removal efficiency and mg2 releasing ability is crucial to be observed for the practical application of the electrolysis method with mg anode in this experiment az31 and az91d anodes were used to treat the aqueous solution 10 times in succession while pure mg was 7 times the pure mg plate appeared slightly bent after 6 times treatment unexpectedly it was severely distorted after 7 times treatment making it impossible to continue the experiment the photographs of bend pure mg plates are shown in appendix fig s3 significant white powder was absorbed on the pure mg surface accumulating like grains the composition of precipitates collected from az31 and az91d electrolysis reactors obtained after the 1st and the 10th experiments was almost the same exhibiting identical characteristic peaks attributed to the crystalline struvite pdf 15 0762 fig 4 it is demonstrated that consecutive batch experiments have insignificant effect on the composition of the crystalline products obtained from these two mg alloy electrolysis reactors however the situation was completely reversed in the pure mg reactor the xrd spectra peaks of precipitates from pure mg 1st experiment points to most struvite and a small amount of sodium hydroxide pdf 88 2129 differently large amount of magnesium hydroxide pdf 07 0239 mixed into the precipitates obtained from the pure mg 7th experiment this indicated that pure mg plates were not suitable for consecutive experiments that required product purity to be maintained without changing the anode and adjusting the ph of the electrolyte the stability of phosphate removal efficiency is an essential indicator in the ongoing nutrient recovery experiment shown in fig 5a it is worth noting that the phosphate removal efficiency of the pure mg reactor was stable and reached 99 every 60 min even though the production composition changed a lot this indicated that the pure mg anode has the best phosphorus removal performance among the three electrodes but with the introduction of large amounts of impurities into the precipitates and loss of the pure mg plates the phosphate removal efficiency of the other two mg alloys could reach 92 every 60 min despite fluctuations this shows that the efficiency of the mg anode electrolysis reactor has specific stability for the long term treatment of wastewater containing nitrogen and phosphorus however this stability is related to the material selection of the anode due to its brittle nature and soft quality the pure mg plate cannot afford a long time experiment leading to a cost rise therefore to pursue sustainable application in industry a more rigid magnesium alloy material should be selected as a magnesium anode which can achieve a similar effect on phosphorus removal ability however in the consecutive experiment there was a considerable variation in the production of mg2 from batch to batch fig 5b the mg2 mass produced by pure mg and az31 fluctuated up and down during the experimental time in other words the mg2 mass from these two anodes showed the same trend of first decreasing second increasing third decreasing and finally increasing otherwise the floating period of mg2 in the pure mg reactor was shorter than that of az31 it can be inferred that the precipitates layer on the anode surface inhibited the production of mg2 at the same time the hydrogen bubbles generated by magnesium anode polarization would also promote the rupture of this film and reduce the inhibition 25 41 for az91d the variation of mg2 production is not as significant as that of the other two mg anodes which may be related to the higher al and zn content az91d anode was also observed to produce fewer bubbles on the polarized surface than the other two anodes the next step is to investigate whether the impurities in mg alloys will affect the composition of precipitate products in continuous experiments it was shown in fig 5c that the molar ratio of three elements collected from the first cycle among three reactors was not far from 1 1 1 mg p n 1 1 1 in high grade purity struvite 23 even with a slight difference nevertheless the molar ratio gap began to widen as the cycles increased the mg p n molar ratio from the pure mg reactor was obviously different from the others where the mg content was far more than the other two elements according to the composition of the precipitates as indicated by the xrd results fig 4 the 7th precipitates contained more brucite mg oh 2 than the 1st crystalline brucite could clearly appear at ph 9 5 and form highly likely to form imperfect particles at ph 10 0 34 53 based on the high ph and mg2 content of electrolyte in pure mg reactor brucite was more likely to form and enhance the proportion of mg2 in precipitates the samples collected from these three reactors showed a general similarity where mg molar mass gradually exceeded the other two elements over time otherwise the results reveal that the samples collected had the average following p n molar ratios 1 1 pure mg 1 3 1 az31 and 1 1 az91d although the mg p n molar ratios of precipitates recovered from az31 and az91d reactors were slightly different the struvite was main composition in precipitates fig 4 results from the icp ms analysis performed on the solution collected from the reactor every cycle are illustrated in fig 6 as spots the results reveal that solutions conducted with az31 and az91d as anodes have much higher al concentrations remaining than pure mg where al3 reached 346 Î¼g l at az31 9th cycle and 879 Î¼g l at az91d 1st cycle the concentrations of mn and zn in az91d electrolyte were less than 10 Î¼g l much lower than that of al so they were not shown in fig 6c the presence of al mn and zn in small mass in the case of pure mg was the result of the industrial 99 4 pure mg composition interestingly the impurity detected in the pure mg electrolyte decreased over the cycle the same phenomenon happened with the al content in the az91d solution however the impurities of every cycle az31 solution do not show a significant variety trend this investigation illustrated that with the increase of the reaction cycles the fewer al from mg alloy remained in the az91d electrolyte the effluent quality would be better with the reaction cycles increase there were no strict drinking water standards for al mn and zn in some countries however al exposure seriously endangered human and animal health causing compromised kidney function and encephalopathy 54 therefore az31 was the best mg anode with perfect phosphate removal performance and the least introduced metal pollution the impurity composition of the precipitates formed in the solution is illustrated in fig 6 as a histogram as for pure mg the element mn becomes the most extensive impurity content in 50 mg precipitates over time reaching 0 017 mg but no more than 0 02 mg although al was the most containing impurity in pure mg solution no al was adsorbed in the recovered precipitates as for mg alloy reactors the element al was the most influential impurity with the cycle on an increase in the al content of precipitates was accompanied by a al decrease in solution in other words more al from the solution entered the precipitates over time especially in the az91d reactor the precipitates from az91d had the highest al impurity at 0 706 mg at the 10th cycle while zn was only 0 05 mg as for az31 the al could be up to 0 396 mg in total 50 mg precipitates whereas zn was only up to 0 133 mg in general in consecutive experiments the cycle index hurt the purity of recovered struvite from mg anode electrolysis reactors at the same time the element al was the most significant contaminant in the struvite precipitates from the electrolysis reactor even so trace amounts of al mn and zn are beneficial for plant growth as fertilizer 31 whose concentration should be controlled precisely in practice 3 5 economic analysis the mg based anode electrolysis system s running costs contained mg consumption and energy consumption costs as for the optimal az31 system 43 4 mg mg was dissolved from the anode to treat 96 phosphate in 40 min electrolysis experiment where 69 9 dissolved mg was reacted with phosphate and others remained in the electrolyte for reuse the retail price of az31 was 7 38 kg in china s local market therefore the mg consumption cost was 8 34 kg p the voltage in the 40 min 100 ma electrolysis experiment was between 1 8 v and 2 1 v the energy consumption cost was 0 26 kg p the total running cost was 8 6 kg p much cheaper than pure mg materials 33 the advantage was that other components such as the cell and cathode did not need to be replaced microbial desalination cells mdc were also emerging and inexpensive technologies which could be an environmentally sustainable alternative to wastewater treatment compared to previous literature merino jimenez 55 utilized sea salts to enhance the performance of microbial fuel cells mfcs for struvite recovery with an operating cost of 4 16 kg p however the mfcs anode needed four days for inoculation and was highly susceptible to bio pollution 56 in addition membrane replacement contributes a lot to the running cost of mfc at the same time mfcs efficiency was significantly affected by nutrient concentration and salinity of anolyte thus decreasing the microbial activity 57 by contrast the sacrificial mg anode electrolysis system was a low cost simple controllable and fast p recovery technology 4 conclusion to sum up the effect of mg anode materials on the synthetic wastewater treatment and struvite recovery was described by phosphate removal efficiency magnesium releasing and precipitates analysis in single batch experiments we found that pure mg anode had a better performance of phosphorus recovery and purity of struvite products than az31 and az91d however pure mg plates deform and bend so they could not support long time continuous application nevertheless large amounts of brucite were mixed into the recovered precipitates collected from the pure mg reactor over the cycle in addition the electrochemically precipitates from consecutive az31 and az91d reactors were comparable to the high grade purity struvite standard but with a small amount of al mn and zn adsorbed higher al content in mg alloys could release disproportionally more al3 into the electrolyte by contrast az31 with lower mn content released more mn2 than az91d on the other hand al3 from electrolytes was easy to mix into the struvite precipitates over the cycle overall the mg anode electrolysis reactor showed a stable and high phosphate removal efficiency and magnesium releasing rate with consecutive batch mode treating synthetic wastewater although some impurities were introduced into the products the az31 plates showed the best performance and stability among these three materials for electrochemical phosphate removal furthermore further explorations on optimizing the mg anode electrolysis setup should be conducted to improve the efficiency of full scale real wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

12561,struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o electrochemical precipitation method is a compelling new way to recover phosphorus from wastewater in this study a suite of common magnesium materials on the market is tested to understand the effect of anode composition on the electrochemical performance of electrolysis reactors with single and batch modes the pure magnesium anode demonstrated the fast phosphorus removal efficiency and best mg2 releasing among three alloys but it cannot be sustained and must be replaced frequently large amounts of brucite were mixed into precipitates decreasing their purity during the pure mg anode electrolysis reaction the mg anode materials influenced the elemental composition of struvite produced from the electrolysis reactor which was not standard 1 1 1 mg p n al element is the most significant contaminant released from az31 and az91d among three impurities al mn zn the mg anode which had higher al content released more al3 into the electrolyte which was easy to be adsorbed by struvite precipitates with the cycle the al3 concentration in the effluents also decreased with the experiment prolonged results showed that az31 could support mg2 stable production in batch mode without as large impurity ions releasing as az91d in the electrolyte or the precipitated struvite keywords magnesium anode electrolysis struvite pure mg az31 alloy data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction agricultural and municipal wastewater streams are well known for their high content of nutrients such as phosphorus nitrogen and organic matter which should be recovered using the efficient and low energy method before discharging into the environment 1 2 excessive phosphorus discharging into water bodies and soil causes serious eutrophication problems at the same time phosphorus is an essential but non renewable element for organisms participating in biological activities such as building cell structures genetic materials and bones 3 4 it is worth noting that plants absorb phosphorus from the soil while humans and animals supplement phosphorus through diet 5 however phosphorus is widely deposited in minerals called phosphate rock or phosphorite and is never found as a free element in the environment due to its high reactivity 6 unfortunately the limited amount of phosphate rocks leads to phosphorus risk that may occur shortly 7 nowadays most of global phosphate rock production is used in agricultural production or applications especially fertilizers 8 the phosphorus consumption in the soil is mainly compensated for the phosphorus fertilizers whereas the increasing demand population growth and costs of fertilizers significantly limit the affordability of agricultural products 9 meanwhile produced and consumed phosphorus by human activities eventually enters into water bodies and accumulates as wastewater 10 therefore phosphorus recovery from wastewater is an environmentally friendly and effective way to alleviate the phosphorus dilemma various technologies have been developed to treat wastewater and recover phosphorus such as reverse osmosis evaporation and electrodialysis 11 12 chemical precipitation is one of the most widely applied methods by adding metal reagents to form insoluble phosphorus minerals 13 struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o or map precipitation has been shown as a promising technology to recover phosphorus from wastewater for high quality slow releasing fertilizer 14 related technologies with struvite are already under investigation such as struvite crystallization 15 16 biochar adsorption 17 18 air fuel cell 2 19 or electrochemical precipitation 1 14 20 it has become an economically and environmentally attractive alternative for resource recycling 21 meanwhile existing phosphorus removal and recovery technologies still have room for improvement in reducing chemical inputs minimizing sludge treatment simplifying operations and saving energy 17 the reactor with an mg based sacrificial anode to form struvite has been proposed as a practical and feasible way to recover phosphorus and ammonia from polluted water 22 23 the two electrochemical half reactions eq 1 2 and a precipitation reaction eq 3 constitute the main reactions that happened in the reactor 1 mg m g 2 2 e anodic reaction 2 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h cathodic reaction 3 m g 2 n h 4 h n p o 4 n 3 6 h 2 o mgn h 4 p o 4 6 h 2 o n h precipitation reaction however the mg based anode electrochemical behavior is complex and lacks much experience especially in anode corrosion and real wastewater treatment mg alloys have a negative standard reduction potential of 2 37 vs she 24 leading to poor corrosion resistance in aqueous solutions 25 when an mg based anode is polarized it produces mg2 and h2 bubbles typically involve hydrogen evolution he 26 meanwhile a normal cathodic hydrogen evolution che happens on the noble cathode such as pt the he rate has been found to increase with a rise of potential or current density called the negative difference effect nde at the same time there is a passivating crystalline oxide layer formation accompanied by he inhibiting the mg2 release from the mg based anode 27 the second phase inside the mg based anode also cause internal galvanic corrosion 28 the sacrificial mg alloys for anode greatly impact the electrolysis systems performance such as releasing impurity into the solution and poor sustainability 29 on the other hand impurity metal ions cu2 zn2 in the solution were certified to precipitate with struvite as amorphous cu phosphate cu po4 and zn phosphate zn po4 on the surface 30 this kind of mixing will affect the efficiency of struvite as slow release fertilizer to soil and plants 31 overall it is necessary to observe the ion release of different mg alloys anodes under polarization conditions and the elemental composition of struvite precipitates the objectives of this work were to assess the performances of sacrificial mg based anode treating synthetic wastewater in a single compartment electrolysis reactor and to compare the effect of three different types of anode materials pure mg vs az31 vs az91d mg alloy we also investigated the phosphorus removal efficiency magnesium releasing and impurity ions al mn zn released from polarized mg based anode the effect of impurity released from mg based alloys for electrolyte and precipitated struvite is also a key point of observation according to its elemental composition structure and impurity concentration by x ray diffraction xrd and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms to our knowledge previous researchers concerning sacrificial mg based anode electrolysis systems focused on single batch experiments and should have paid more attention to the continuous application we also investigated and compared the stability of electrolysis with these three mg materials respectively in consecutive batch without anode change 2 experimental 2 1 materials the pure magnesium magnesium az31 alloys and magnesium az91d alloys were hired as test materials bought from china s local market listed in

approximately 500 r min experiments were conducted with a dc power supply ks 2 10 a shanghai mengxin automation equipment co ltd china before experiments an automatic polishing machine was employed to polish the mg plates surface preliminarily then polished magnesium plates were finely trimmed using different abrasive paper p500 2500 eagle brand korea to remove the oxide layer on the mg surface after polishing the magnesium plates were thoroughly washed with deionized water the first part of the experiment compared the efficiency and magnesium ion generation of pure mg az31 and az91d as anodes in the electrolysis system for aqueous solution treatment all tests were carried out under a constant current of 100 ma and lasted 60 min for reproducibility each experiment with different anodes was repeated three times where the results were expressed as mean standard deviation meanwhile the second part of the experiment subjected the three mg alloys to ten consecutive experiments to test their sustainability as anodes in other words the same mg anode was employed to treat ten consecutive batches of synthetic wastewater without replacing the anode and cleaning the reactor inside every batch experiment lasted 60 min under 100 ma current and the electrolyte was replaced with a new synthetic wastewater at the end of the batch experiment the second part of the experiments was not replicated where the results were expressed as collected data all experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 2 c 2 3 electrochemical measurements the performances of three mg alloys were

results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical performance of materials to investigate anode corrosion processes divergences the raw pure mg and mg alloys are employed as the working electrode for electrochemical tests as a comparison lsvs of them were tested in configured aqueous solution it revealed that the corrosion processes of these three mg alloys were visibly different in the potential range of 3 0 v vs rhe and 2 5 v vs rhe fig 1 the current density j of pure mg increased more slowly at positive potentials than other mg alloys this phenomenon was caused by the quicker formation of precipitates double layer containing struvite and magnesium hydroxide on pure mg surface an insulating layer blocking electron 34 in contrast the layer formed more lowly on the exposed surface of az31 and az91d 35 the double precipitates layer had a significant physical shielding effect capturing corrosive anions such as cl which decreased the cl concentration near the mg anode surface inhibiting corrosion 36 the addition of al could increase the corrosion resistance of mg in part 37 guaranteeing the stable rate of the current density of az31 and az91d in a short period the current density in az31 suddenly declined at 1 4 v then returned to linear growth at 0 5 v as the potential increased this decline could be explained by a short lived precipitated layer formed but broken with gas bubbles 38 40 by contrast the lsvs of az91d was a straight line illustrating that few precipitates were deposited on its surface the internal galvanic corrosion by second phases or impurities in mg alloys made its surface layer complicated 28 the noise observed at high potentials for three anodes may be attributed to hydrogen gas bubbles produced on the surface as a significant energy barrier affecting electrical conductivity 41 it is observed that pure mg reveals severer corrosion than mg alloys signifying that the precipitates layer has a remarkable influence on conductivity other researchers also observed similar phenomenon 23 40 42 3 2 effect of anode materials on performance of electrolysis reactor the corrosion and electrolytic processes of mg alloys are complex and controversial due to their intricate components 40 43 accompanied by other metal ions released into the electrolyte such as zn2 mn2 al3 23 due to the lack of agreement regarding the performance of mg alloys during the constant current electrochemical struvite reaction pure mg az31 and az91d were individually hired as the anode the phosphate removal efficiency in electrolysis reactor with three anodes appeared to be different patterns it is obvious that pure mg anode had the highest and quickest efficiency reaching 98 within 30 min fig 2a the phosphate in the aqueous solution could be removed at 99 within 60 min in all electrolysis reactors except the az91d at 95 regarding the pure mg reactor the mass of existing mg2 slowly increased in 20 min then rapidly grew after 20 min the rate of mg2 increase was closer to the rate of mg2 produced by the polarized pure mg anode the initial growth rate of mg2 was less than that of the later period indicating that a massive mg consuming reaction occurred in the first 20 min consistent with phosphate removal as struvite fig 2b the ph of the electrolyte at that time was between 8 8 and 9 2 appendix fig s1 which was suitable for struvite formation within the first 20 min 86 phosphate was removed through reacting with mg2 and nh4 after that the precipitation reaction was limited by low phosphate while the mg consumption decreased therefore the mg2 production increased in the pure mg reactor after 20 min in contrast the mg consuming reaction significantly lasted longer in az31 and az91d with less existing mg2 in the electrolyte indicating that the pure mg anode produced mg2 the fastest and most of the three which means the best performance of phosphate removal in single batch experiment based on the existing mg2 and removed phosphate we assumed that all phosphate was removed by struvite formation so the total mg2 produced was the sum of existing and removed mg2 the mg2 production from three anode were all over the theoretical mass indicating that the hydrogen evolution reaction took place in three polarized mg alloys the mass of mg2 produced in pure mg anode outclassed that of others at the same time the az91d showed the worst mg2 production capacity fig 2c the hydrogen evolution reaction occurring on the surface of mg alloys was the principal factor affecting the mg2 releasing under the same current involving mg corrosion 44 a higher mg2 production represented more severe corrosion to some extent almg alloys contain grain boundary Î² phase mg17al12 which is more inert to corrosion than Î± phase 37 45 when the content of Î² phase is less than 10 Î² phase facilitates the formation of passivating mg oh 2 film and hinders its corrosion 46 az91d had a nearly continuous network of Î² phase which far outnumbered az31 28 on the other hand previous researchers showed that al and zn in mg alloys most likely inhibited the struvite grown and decreased their crystal size 47 48 in our previous research the surface film upon exposed mg anode to water containing n and p consisted of a compact inner mgo layer and a top of mg oh 2 mgnh4po4 mgco3 layer 49 this decrease in struvite crystal size and mixed materials in mg alloys might produce a more compact surface layer inhibiting the mg2 production 23 therefore pure mg was more accessible to corrosion and produced mg2 more than the other two as the anode in the electrolysis reactor the relationship between mg dissolution from three mg alloys and the phosphate removal efficiency was displayed in appendix fig s2 interestingly no matter what alloys were used for the mg anode the relationship was fixed in other words the phosphate removal achieved 95 as long as the mg2 dissolution from the anode reached 108 mg l otherwise the type of mg anode materials determined the rate of mg2 produced proving the importance of selecting the most suitable materials as for the pollution of impurity metal ions fig 2d f showed the concentrations of al3 mn2 and zn2 the struvite formed in the natural or industrial systems generally includes some other ions such as fe3 ca2 na k cl as well as organics ions 50 the element al mn and zn are the highest content and have an enormous change in mg alloys except for mg which we pay most attention to in the process of mg alloys anodizing al3 was the most impurity released into the electrolyte positively correlated with the al content in the mg alloys the al3 concentration in the az91d reactor arrived at the highest peak at 0 98 mg l at 40 min then declined to 0 76 mg l at 60 min suggesting that 40 min was the critical turning point for al3 in the electrolyte to enter the sediments the accumulation of al3 in the az91d electrolyte was more significant than the removal before 40 min and the reverse occurred the trend of al3 from the az31 anode was similar to az91d this decrease was most likely due to the adsorption on the plate surface or participation in the sediments the process of al removal was slow and slightly different in each experiment so there was a significant deviation at 40 min in the az91d reactor the al content of the az91d plate was nearly three times as much as the az31 plate but the al3 release of az91d was only twice as az31 therefore the higher the amount of al element in the mg alloys the more al3 was likely to dissolve into the electrolyte but the increase is not fixed on the other hand the mn2 release was different from al3 little mn2 was released from the polarized pure mg and az91d anode under 3 Î¼g l while the mn2 in az31 s electrolyte outclassed others and arrived at 0 023 mg l at 60 min meanwhile the content of mn in az91d alloys at 0 32 was higher than in az31 alloys at 0 263 but released less mn2 it demonstrated that the mn2 release was not only related to alloy s mn content but also affected by other factors such as al content interestingly unlike the very little al3 and mn2 detected in pure mg electrolyte a maximum of 6 Î¼g l zn2 was released from pure mg anode the az31 and az91d anodes released a similar amount of zn2 about 0 02 mg l although the zn content of az31 and az91d plates were distinct the zn2 release was not much different and needed further research in general az91d anode released the most impurities among the three mg alloys and al3 was the most influential impurity ion pure mg anode hardly produced al3 mn2 and zn2 in the electrolyte 3 3 characterization of anode the sem results revealed the presence of mg n and p on the three anodes surfaces after one hour electrolysis indicating the adsorption of struvite precipitates fig 3 previous studies investigated that an al rich layer could form at the oxide alloy substrate upon the mgal alloys and noble impurity elements could be entrapped in the mg oh 2 layer 51 the al element detected revealed evidence of the al rich layer in the mg corrosion oxide hydroxide film fig 3e f this al rich layer affected the morphology of corrosion on the mg surface it is apparent that the surface films on the three plates were all porous and irregular while the az31 layer rupture was denser and more complex than the other two under the same magnification in addition there were evident massive holes that appeared on the az91d surface which contains a high concentration of al metal impurities in the metal nevertheless the al element detected on the az31 surface was well above that of az91d previous researchers discovered that impurity was enriched in the passivating corrosion layer of mg anode more significantly under the film on the metal surface 52 the impurity enrichment might impact the deposition of magnesium oxide hydroxide or other magnesium compounds therefore the holes appeared because magnesium compounds had difficulty accumulating on al metal complexes at the same time sem eds detects the chemical composition on the 0 1 Î¼m depth surface therefore the precipitates layer on the az91d was inferred to be thicker than 0 1 Î¼m and contained less al element interestingly the ratio of mg p in pure mg plate was the highest among the three representing the highest adsorption of struvite 3 4 performance of consecutive experiments in addition to the single batch performance of mg anode in aqueous solution treatment the stability of p removal efficiency and mg2 releasing ability is crucial to be observed for the practical application of the electrolysis method with mg anode in this experiment az31 and az91d anodes were used to treat the aqueous solution 10 times in succession while pure mg was 7 times the pure mg plate appeared slightly bent after 6 times treatment unexpectedly it was severely distorted after 7 times treatment making it impossible to continue the experiment the photographs of bend pure mg plates are shown in appendix fig s3 significant white powder was absorbed on the pure mg surface accumulating like grains the composition of precipitates collected from az31 and az91d electrolysis reactors obtained after the 1st and the 10th experiments was almost the same exhibiting identical characteristic peaks attributed to the crystalline struvite pdf 15 0762 fig 4 it is demonstrated that consecutive batch experiments have insignificant effect on the composition of the crystalline products obtained from these two mg alloy electrolysis reactors however the situation was completely reversed in the pure mg reactor the xrd spectra peaks of precipitates from pure mg 1st experiment points to most struvite and a small amount of sodium hydroxide pdf 88 2129 differently large amount of magnesium hydroxide pdf 07 0239 mixed into the precipitates obtained from the pure mg 7th experiment this indicated that pure mg plates were not suitable for consecutive experiments that required product purity to be maintained without changing the anode and adjusting the ph of the electrolyte the stability of phosphate removal efficiency is an essential indicator in the ongoing nutrient recovery experiment shown in fig 5a it is worth noting that the phosphate removal efficiency of the pure mg reactor was stable and reached 99 every 60 min even though the production composition changed a lot this indicated that the pure mg anode has the best phosphorus removal performance among the three electrodes but with the introduction of large amounts of impurities into the precipitates and loss of the pure mg plates the phosphate removal efficiency of the other two mg alloys could reach 92 every 60 min despite fluctuations this shows that the efficiency of the mg anode electrolysis reactor has specific stability for the long term treatment of wastewater containing nitrogen and phosphorus however this stability is related to the material selection of the anode due to its brittle nature and soft quality the pure mg plate cannot afford a long time experiment leading to a cost rise therefore to pursue sustainable application in industry a more rigid magnesium alloy material should be selected as a magnesium anode which can achieve a similar effect on phosphorus removal ability however in the consecutive experiment there was a considerable variation in the production of mg2 from batch to batch fig 5b the mg2 mass produced by pure mg and az31 fluctuated up and down during the experimental time in other words the mg2 mass from these two anodes showed the same trend of first decreasing second increasing third decreasing and finally increasing otherwise the floating period of mg2 in the pure mg reactor was shorter than that of az31 it can be inferred that the precipitates layer on the anode surface inhibited the production of mg2 at the same time the hydrogen bubbles generated by magnesium anode polarization would also promote the rupture of this film and reduce the inhibition 25 41 for az91d the variation of mg2 production is not as significant as that of the other two mg anodes which may be related to the higher al and zn content az91d anode was also observed to produce fewer bubbles on the polarized surface than the other two anodes the next step is to investigate whether the impurities in mg alloys will affect the composition of precipitate products in continuous experiments it was shown in fig 5c that the molar ratio of three elements collected from the first cycle among three reactors was not far from 1 1 1 mg p n 1 1 1 in high grade purity struvite 23 even with a slight difference nevertheless the molar ratio gap began to widen as the cycles increased the mg p n molar ratio from the pure mg reactor was obviously different from the others where the mg content was far more than the other two elements according to the composition of the precipitates as indicated by the xrd results fig 4 the 7th precipitates contained more brucite mg oh 2 than the 1st crystalline brucite could clearly appear at ph 9 5 and form highly likely to form imperfect particles at ph 10 0 34 53 based on the high ph and mg2 content of electrolyte in pure mg reactor brucite was more likely to form and enhance the proportion of mg2 in precipitates the samples collected from these three reactors showed a general similarity where mg molar mass gradually exceeded the other two elements over time otherwise the results reveal that the samples collected had the average following p n molar ratios 1 1 pure mg 1 3 1 az31 and 1 1 az91d although the mg p n molar ratios of precipitates recovered from az31 and az91d reactors were slightly different the struvite was main composition in precipitates fig 4 results from the icp ms analysis performed on the solution collected from the reactor every cycle are illustrated in fig 6 as spots the results reveal that solutions conducted with az31 and az91d as anodes have much higher al concentrations remaining than pure mg where al3 reached 346 Î¼g l at az31 9th cycle and 879 Î¼g l at az91d 1st cycle the concentrations of mn and zn in az91d electrolyte were less than 10 Î¼g l much lower than that of al so they were not shown in fig 6c the presence of al mn and zn in small mass in the case of pure mg was the result of the industrial 99 4 pure mg composition interestingly the impurity detected in the pure mg electrolyte decreased over the cycle the same phenomenon happened with the al content in the az91d solution however the impurities of every cycle az31 solution do not show a significant variety trend this investigation illustrated that with the increase of the reaction cycles the fewer al from mg alloy remained in the az91d electrolyte the effluent quality would be better with the reaction cycles increase there were no strict drinking water standards for al mn and zn in some countries however al exposure seriously endangered human and animal health causing compromised kidney function and encephalopathy 54 therefore az31 was the best mg anode with perfect phosphate removal performance and the least introduced metal pollution the impurity composition of the precipitates formed in the solution is illustrated in fig 6 as a histogram as for pure mg the element mn becomes the most extensive impurity content in 50 mg precipitates over time reaching 0 017 mg but no more than 0 02 mg although al was the most containing impurity in pure mg solution no al was adsorbed in the recovered precipitates as for mg alloy reactors the element al was the most influential impurity with the cycle on an increase in the al content of precipitates was accompanied by a al decrease in solution in other words more al from the solution entered the precipitates over time especially in the az91d reactor the precipitates from az91d had the highest al impurity at 0 706 mg at the 10th cycle while zn was only 0 05 mg as for az31 the al could be up to 0 396 mg in total 50 mg precipitates whereas zn was only up to 0 133 mg in general in consecutive experiments the cycle index hurt the purity of recovered struvite from mg anode electrolysis reactors at the same time the element al was the most significant contaminant in the struvite precipitates from the electrolysis reactor even so trace amounts of al mn and zn are beneficial for plant growth as fertilizer 31 whose concentration should be controlled precisely in practice 3 5 economic analysis the mg based anode electrolysis system s running costs contained mg consumption and energy consumption costs as for the optimal az31 system 43 4 mg mg was dissolved from the anode to treat 96 phosphate in 40 min electrolysis experiment where 69 9 dissolved mg was reacted with phosphate and others remained in the electrolyte for reuse the retail price of az31 was 7 38 kg in china s local market therefore the mg consumption cost was 8 34 kg p the voltage in the 40 min 100 ma electrolysis experiment was between 1 8 v and 2 1 v the energy consumption cost was 0 26 kg p the total running cost was 8 6 kg p much cheaper than pure mg materials 33 the advantage was that other components such as the cell and cathode did not need to be replaced microbial desalination cells mdc were also emerging and inexpensive technologies which could be an environmentally sustainable alternative to wastewater treatment compared to previous literature merino jimenez 55 utilized sea salts to enhance the performance of microbial fuel cells mfcs for struvite recovery with an operating cost of 4 16 kg p however the mfcs anode needed four days for inoculation and was highly susceptible to bio pollution 56 in addition membrane replacement contributes a lot to the running cost of mfc at the same time mfcs efficiency was significantly affected by nutrient concentration and salinity of anolyte thus decreasing the microbial activity 57 by contrast the sacrificial mg anode electrolysis system was a low cost simple controllable and fast p recovery technology 4 conclusion to sum up the effect of mg anode materials on the synthetic wastewater treatment and struvite recovery was described by phosphate removal efficiency magnesium releasing and precipitates analysis in single batch experiments we found that pure mg anode had a better performance of phosphorus recovery and purity of struvite products than az31 and az91d however pure mg plates deform and bend so they could not support long time continuous application nevertheless large amounts of brucite were mixed into the recovered precipitates collected from the pure mg reactor over the cycle in addition the electrochemically precipitates from consecutive az31 and az91d reactors were comparable to the high grade purity struvite standard but with a small amount of al mn and zn adsorbed higher al content in mg alloys could release disproportionally more al3 into the electrolyte by contrast az31 with lower mn content released more mn2 than az91d on the other hand al3 from electrolytes was easy to mix into the struvite precipitates over the cycle overall the mg anode electrolysis reactor showed a stable and high phosphate removal efficiency and magnesium releasing rate with consecutive batch mode treating synthetic wastewater although some impurities were introduced into the products the az31 plates showed the best performance and stability among these three materials for electrochemical phosphate removal furthermore further explorations on optimizing the mg anode electrolysis setup should be conducted to improve the efficiency of full scale real wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

12562,river water is a major water supply source and its quality is strongly affected by seasonal changes in dissolved organic matter dom and anthropogenic discharge this study uses unknown screening analysis with orbitrap mass spectrometry to investigate differences in molecular dom in upstream and downstream areas of phong river thailand in addition to changes caused by coagulation sedimentation disinfection byproducts dbps and formation by chlorine cl2 and chlorine dioxide clo2 in the dry season and after the first rainfall in the wet season among 2000 dom features in the river dom with carbon hydrogen and oxygen cho features was the most abundant class followed by cho features with other heteroatoms such as n ns and s cho features with a relatively higher degree of oxidation high carbon oxidation state cos and highly oxygenated high oxygen to carbon ratio o c characteristics decreased preferentially via coagulation and sedimentation by polyaluminium chloride approximately 130 cl containing chocl features increased or were newly formed after cl2 and clo2 disinfection respectively only 14 cl2 chocl and four clo2 chocl features were commonly formed in all water samples while many unique dbps were identified in each disinfection therefore reactions of unique dbp precursors in each water sample can produce unique dbps additionally around 100 cho dbps were also found after both cl2 and clo2 disinfection both cl2 and clo2 selectively reacted with cho features with a relatively higher degree of oxidation high cos cl2 disinfection produced more oxygenated high o c and oxidized cos dbps than clo2 disinfection several hundred dbp precursors of cl2 electrophilic substitution were found not only from natural sources but also from wastewater discharge or runoff graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords disinfection byproducts unknown screening orbitrap mass spectrometry chlorine and chlorine dioxide disinfection coagulation sedimentation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction natural organic matter nom contains a variety of heterogeneous mixtures of organic compounds from simple to complex structures and aromatic to aliphatic structures with various functional groups 1 although nom is not directly harmful to humans at low concentrations the presence of nom in water resources is often undesirable an increase in nom concentration in surface waters can cause a range of problems to water treatment operations such as increasing coagulant and disinfectant requirements 2 promoting biological growth in distribution systems 2 4 causing irreversible fouling in membranes 5 and reducing the porosity and adsorption efficiency of activated carbon 6 7 however nom with low molecular weight is difficult to remove using conventional water treatment methods i e coagulation and sedimentation 8 9 the reaction of the remaining nom after pre treatment with coagulation sedimentation during water disinfection results in the formation of disinfection by products dbps which have been widely demonstrated as toxic 10 in addition as rivers are widely contaminated with effluent organic matter efom dissolved organic matter dom removal in water treatment becomes less effective due to the refractory character of efom to coagulation 11 reactions of efom with disinfectants also result in the formation of dbps 12 our previous report showed that efom from wastewater discharge and runoff affects the overall molecular characteristics of dom and dbp formation 13 thus increasing the complexity of dom and dbp management in water treatment processes reactions of chlorine to nom and the corresponding formation of dbps were first reported by rook 14 with an increasing number of dbps subsequently reported 15 broadly the most common dbp types are trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas which constitute approximately 34 of total organic halides 15 16 and are widely regulated in addition to thms and haas other dbps with higher geno and cyto toxicities have been found at lower concentration in advanced water treatment plants including halonitromethanes haloacetamides and haloacetaldehydes 15 17 the remaining dbps representing over half of the total are still unknown 16 to avoid the formation of chlorinated dbps alternative disinfectants have been widely used including ozone chlorine dioxide clo2 and chloramines however these disinfectants still react with dom to form dbps clo2 has been reported to generate very low levels of thms and haas compared to chlorine however several organic halogens can be formed from reactions between clo2 and organic compounds 18 19 although researchers have studied changes in dom i e dbp precursors in conventional water treatment for several decades the existing studies to date lack insights into molecular dom changes that are affected by the seasons and increasing anthropogenic chemical usage therefore identifying dom characteristics and changes caused by conventional water treatment could help to provide better insights into the relationship between water treatment processes and dbp formation mechanisms dom characterization is a highly important task to understand dom changes and optimize water treatment mechanisms various methods have been applied to characterize and quantify dom such as total and dissolved organic carbon toc and doc measurement ultraviolet and visible uv vis absorption spectroscopy specific uv absorbance suva and fluorescence excitation emission 20 these methods highlighted the refractory character of low molecular weight dom to conventional water treatment and that it remained in the water disinfection process however due to the complexity of dom these methods do not provide sufficient information about the molecular characteristics of dom for this reason full characterization and separation of individual dom molecules from complex dom mixtures are difficult to achieve using a single analytical method new dbps with previously unreported attributes may be produced by reactions with clearly characterized dom dbp precursors however characterizing the formation of such new is challenging given the difficulties in separating dom mixtures hence understanding molecular dom removal mechanisms and the formation of dbp are crucial for applying conventional water treatments consequently not target or unknown screening analysis using high resolution and accurate mass spectrometry hrms is a promising method to characterize dom at the molecular level 21 24 given this method s high accuracy and mass resolution several thousand dom peaks can be obtained in a single analysis which can then be further converted into molecular formulae and characteristics orbitrap mass spectrometry orbitrap ms is an hrms technique now increasingly used in environmental sampling applications 23 several previous studies have applied unknown screening analysis using orbitrap ms to characterize dom in water sources 25 27 and to identify and quantify the presence of organic pollutants 23 28 30 additionally orbitrap ms has been used to detect several hundred previously unknown dbps formed by water chlorination and the behavior of organic precursors during water treatment 31 32 63 this method was applied in previous studies which demonstrated that dom characteristics were different for each water resource and changes in dom by coagulation and disinfection 33 36 according to these studies the coagulation preferentially removed dom with more aromatic compounds and oxygenated molecule however some dom remained in the disinfection to form several unknown dbps although common dom features were present in the raw water many of unknown dbp were found to form uniquely in each water source 34 36 in addition our previous study revealed that anthropogenic activities variably impact dom characteristics from upstream to downstream which promotes the formation of unique dbp forms when raw water is disinfected with cl2 or clo2 13 in this study molecular changes in dom in the dry season and after the first rainfall in the wet season as induced by coagulation sedimentation and disinfection with cl2 or clo2 were investigated using non targeted analysis by orbitrap ms the dom features obtained from the analysis were converted to molecular characteristics such as hydrogen to carbon h c and oxygen to carbon o c ratios the degree of unsaturation double bond equivalent dbe o c and carbon oxidation states cos changes in dom features by coagulation sedimentation and disinfection by cl2 or clo2 were discussed in the context of a semiquantitative approach chlorinated features that increased in intensity or newly formed features following disinfection were investigated in terms of their molecular characteristics potential molecular structures in databases and behaviors of assumed precursors along the river the contributions of this study are novel as no studies to date have reported tracking the source of organic precursors and their compositional change in along rivers 2 material and methods 2 1 water sampling water samples were collected from upstream s1 and downstream s11 areas of the lower phong river and tap water s12 was collected after treatment of s11 at the water treatment plant wtp in khon kaen thailand for comparison with lab scale treatment as shown in fig s1 and table s1 supplementary information si the samples were collected during the dry season in april and following the first rainfall in june wet season in 2019 the upstream samples were taken from water discharge from the ubon ratana dam while downstream received discharge types including agricultural runoff industrial discharge and municipal discharge fig s2 before reaching the downstream water treatment plants we previously reported changes in molecular dom matrices along this river due to effects of effluent 13 all samples were collected in pre combusted 550 c for 4 h glassware no preservatives were added to the samples to avoid changes in their composition the samples were immediately transferred within 4 h to a laboratory under cold conditions 4 c 2 2 laboratory scale coagulation sedimentation and disinfection upstream and downstream water sample which were collected before the wtp intake were used for water treatment experiments these experiments were conducted in a laboratory and consisted of coagulation using polyaluminium chloride pacl as a coagulant followed by flocculation for 20 min and sedimentation for 10 min a volume of 1000 ml of water was used for each pacl dosage 20 ppm for upstream samples and 10 ppm for downstream samples in a jar test these dosages were selected based on the optimum doses for turbidity removal 5 ntu following actual operation in wtp for each sample table 1 rapid sand filtration was simulated by filtering through a 0 7 Î¼m glass fiber filter gf f whatman after filtration the water samples were subjected to disinfection using 17 5 mgcl2 l for a high chlorine dose and 17 5 mgcl2 l for clo2 with both disinfectants widely used in local water treatment plants 37 the samples were then incubated at 20 c in dark conditions for 24 h the cl2 and clo2 dosages were selected as five times the actual amount used in wtps to allow the dom to react thoroughly with disinfectant in 24 h of contact time the cl2 solutions were prepared from sodium hypochlorite solutions with 4 6 active chlorine whereas the clo2 was prepared by mixing potassium peroxydisulfate k2s2o8 2 g in 50 ml water with sodium chlorite naclo2 4 g in 50 ml 38 during the water treatment experiments the ph was not controlled per the actual operations conditions used in water treatment plants no cl2 or clo2 quenching chemical was added

methanol the eluates were stored at 20 c before unknown screening analysis the di water controls were processed using the same spe method to evaluate doc recovery 1 ml of the extracted samples was purged with high purity nitrogen to evaporate the methanol and then redissolved in 10 ml of di water by sonication the doc recovery of each sample was calculated as the ratio of doc in the extract to the doc in the water sample 2 5 non target or unknown screening analysis the extracted samples and the di controls obtained from the spe were analyzed by orbitrap ms q exactive plus thermo scientific

peaks deviated within 30 3 results and discussion 3 1 elemental composition of dom the doc and suva levels of upstream and downstream water samples in april and june both before and after treatments are shown in table 1 after coagulation sedimentation the doc levels were reduced by 0 3 0 8 mg c l in upstream samples and 0 5 mg c l in downstream samples in addition the suva value decreased by 0 09 0 30 l mg m in both upstream and downstream samples in this step table 1 implying slight removal of doc with high suva values by coagulation sedimentation this relationship between suva and doc removal recorded in this study is consistent with previous findings 2 after 24 h disinfections the doc decreased by 0 5 0 6 mg c l in the upstream sample and 0 3 0 6 mg c l in the downstream sample for cl2 disinfection with corresponding values ranges of 0 2 0 6 mg c l and 0 3 0 4 mg c l for clo2 disinfection the residual cl2 and clo2 were lower than the initial dosages after incubation table s5 indicating the consumption of disinfectants and their reaction with organic matter variable doc removal in response to different treatments indicates differing levels of dom mineralization and variability in preferential oxidation table 1 the suva values decreased after cl2 disinfection table 1 indicating a decrease in hydrophobic molecules this finding implies that the reactions of cl2 with nucleophilic and unsaturated sites in dom result in ring cleavage 47 as clo2 is more selective for double bonds in rings 38 this would explain the slight suva decrease recorded for clo2 disinfection table 1 in the april samples conversely clo2 disinfection in the june samples increased the suva value this may be because clo2 oxidized hydroquinone containing compounds to quinone moieties which have a higher molar absorption coefficient at 254 nm potentially resulting in increased suva values 38 the doc recovery rate of raw water samples was approximately 55 73 similar to values reported in several previous studies 36 39 40 over half of the dom was analyzed in this study the dom mass spectra of both the upstream and downstream samples detected by the orbitrap ms comprised peak intensities that covered only 100 600 m z range fig s3 after molecular formula identification around 2000 molecular formulae were identified in the samples based on heteroatom classes consisting of cho only cho or containing n s or both chon chos and chons respectively as shown in fig s4 this study focused on the cho features as this class constituted almost half of the features in most of the samples furthermore numerous studies have shown that cho features predominate over other heteroatoms in natural water 36 48 49 in addition cho features with acid properties can rapidly lose protons and are easily ionized under negative ionization mode 41 in contrast n containing compounds can be efficiently ionized in positive mode due to their basic groups such as amine however sodium adduction in positive ionization mode results in highly complex mass spectra 50 in our study portions of the chon features with acidic functional groups would still be detected while some chon features with very basic characters would be absent over 700 cho features were found in all samples which constituted 90 of the overall features table s2 these features were common in samples from april and june this indicates the persistence of organic compounds from upstream to downstream areas however 10 of dom features were unique in april and june which is consistent with our previous report 13 as shown in the van krevelen diagram the top 50 cho features mostly plotted as lignin like compounds fig 1 and separate plots of each sample with rank abundances provided in fig s5 while some plotted as lipid like compounds similar observations for common compounds were identified in all the studied water samples in april unique cho features found in upstream or downstream samples plotted in all compound like areas fig 1a conversely many cho features in the upstream samples in june exhibited an increase in carbohydrate like and lipid like compounds while some unique cho features in the downstream samples plotted in areas where no compound like structures are reported i e o c above 0 7 and h c below 1 5 fig 1b as this sample was collected downstream after initial rainfall during the wet season the cho features present could be derived from surface run off given the unique characteristics of this dom these findings indicate that run off dom has less hydrogenated lower h c and more oxygenated higher o c characteristics than other dom types fig 1b these molecules also tended to be more highly oxidized i e positive cos fig s6b 3 2 overall changes in the water treatment processes the doc recovery rates of the water samples by spe for the samples after coagulation sedimentation and disinfection were approximately 56 69 table 1 with similar values recorded for the raw water samples to statistically evaluate the dissimilarity among the samples each of which contained almost 1000 cho features the peak intensities of the cho features of all samples were analyzed using two dimensional scaling as shown in fig 2 in this analysis the distances between the plotted samples indicate the degree of difference in their dom matrices the distances between the raw water samples indicate some differences in their dom features for both the april and june samples these differences can be attributed to differences in the intensity of the occurrence of both common and unique compounds in the van krevelen diagrams fig 1 the distances between the plotted raw water and coagulation sedimentation samples were greater for downstream samples than upstream samples indicating the effects of coagulation sedimentation on the downstream dom were more evident relative to the upstream dom this could be attributed to the unique dom types found only in the downstream raw water samples that were removed by coagulation sedimentation clo2 disinfection modified the upstream and downstream dom characteristics in different directions in fig 2 the upstream and downstream samples would have had different precursors which resulted in variable changes in dom content by clo2 disinfection in contrast almost the same sense of change occurred in response to cl2 disinfection indicating a similar modification of dom the cl2 treated samples generally exhibit much greater similarity between samples than the clo2 treated samples overall after water treatment there was an increase in molecules that plotted within the known compound fields especially lignin lipids and carbohydrate fields which remained in the resulting tap water fig s5e and f this result implies that these molecules had a relatively refractory character 3 3 effects of coagulation sedimentation on cho features after the coagulation sedimentation process 195 and 292 cho features in upstream samples from april and june fig s7 respectively semi quantitatively decreased while the equivalent values following this step in the downstream samples were 417 and 422 respectively in contrast doc removal from both upstream and downstream samples was relatively similar table 1 the downstream samples contained more cho features released from discharge along the river that could be removed by coagulation sedimentation for the upstream samples coagulation sedimentation selectively decreased cho features with high cos p 0 001 compared to refractory molecules fig 3b and e the decreased features were found to be those with high molecular weight mw p 0 001 and higher o c values p 0 03 in tables s3 and s4 additionally these features were found to be 1 lignin like 2 characterized by condensed aromatic structures and 3 molecules with high o c and low h c values on van krevelen diagrams fig s8a and c the cho features removed from the upstream samples were similarly removed by coagulation sedimentation of the downstream samples fig 3a and d in addition many cho features with relatively positive dbe o c and low cos values were decreased only by coagulation sedimentation of the downstream samples fig 3c and f these molecules were predominantly lipid like and lignin like compounds fig s8b and d as more oxidized positive cos and more oxygenated high o c features were found to decrease in most of the samples this observation indicates preferential removal of cho features with more oxygenated and more oxidized characteristics by the coagulation sedimentation process these observations were consistent with alum coagulation reported by gonsior et al and lavonen et al 34 35 and pacl coagulation reported by zhang et al 49 these compounds would tend to contain more acidic functional groups resulting in their coagulation with alum and ferric chloride and eventual decrease by sedimentation 51 as many cho features with relatively high dbe o c and low cos values decreased only in the downstream samples these features might be removed by hydrophobic forces adhesion to flocs or through formation of high molecular weight molecules in downstream samples as compounds with more carbon double bonds would tend to have more hydrophobicity to dom for cho features removed in both the upstream and downstream samples fig 3a e the coagulation process would be selective to remove more oxidized molecules due to electrostatic forces between the negative ions on cho features and al species in pacl oh o and al3 furthermore downstream dom removal would be driven by both electrostatic forces for more oxidized molecules and hydrophobic forces for hydrophobic molecules high dbe o c this may suggest that organic contaminants can be more readily removed from downstream samples than upstream samples through coagulation sedimentation 3 4 effects of cl2 and clo2 disinfection on cho features fig 4 shows the numbers of the cho features changed by disinfections in all the samples 600 cho features 70 were semi quantitatively decreased by cl2 disinfection fig 4a and approximately 120 cho features remained unchanged this suggests that the coagulation sedimentation process may be insufficient to decrease these compounds more than 300 cho features were decreased by clo2 in the upstream samples whereas approximately 150 cho features were decreased in the downstream samples fig 4a implying the selectivity of clo2 for certain cho features at the same application dosages clo2 was more selective of dom than cl2 the decreased cho features by cl2 had relatively higher average o c p 0 005 and cos p 0 001 than the unchanged cho features fig s9 and table 2 similarly the decreased cho features decreased by clo2 were associated with higher o c p 0 001 and cos p 0 001 than the unchanged cho features fig s10 and table 2 in all samples these results indicate that both cl2 and clo2 selectively oxidize cho features with high contents of oxygen containing functional groups this observation differs from previous studies that have reported low o c compounds as more reactive toward chlorine 34 36 these studies observed reactions within only a few hours for contact time in wtp indicating that chlorine selectively reacts with dom with low oxygen content in this study the reactions with oxidized dom high oxygen content took place within 24 h therefore the reaction of chlorine reaction with these dom types was potentially activated by electron donating moiety groups such as o oh and or on an aromatic ring when exposed to high chlorine concentrations this finding demonstrates that contact time and chlorine dosage are both important factors in reactions between chlorine and dom this result is consistent with previous studies on the effect of contact time on the level of dbp formations 52 53 3 5 the formation of dbps during cl2 disinfection after chlorination approximately 100 cho features were either newly formed or increased in all samples fig 4a these features are termed non chlorinated dbps cho cl2 dbps the cho cl2 dbps had relatively higher dbe o c p 0 001 values and cos p 0 001 values and lower mw p 0 001 values relative to those of decreased cho features table 2 and fig s9 this finding indicates that cho cl2 dbps consist of low mw features with more oxidized and unsaturated characters similar to our previous findings 13 during cl2 disinfection the reaction of chlorine with dom often occurs by electrophilic substitution and addition reactions with these reactions reported to usually occur at limited sites namely reducing nucleophilic and unsaturated sites 47 the electrophilic substitution process substitutes hydrogen atoms by the electrophilic attack of chlorine atoms which leads to the formation of carbon bound chlorine on the aromatic rings of organic compounds whereas the addition reaction adds hocl to carbon double bonds to form intermediate chlorinated molecules chocl in addition these reactions can continue to react via hocl with the intermediate chocl to form lower mw chlorinated and non chlorinated cho dbps through aromatic ring or double bond cleaving 38 47 these observations relationship between the numbers of increased and decreased cho and chocl features after chlorination fig 4 additionally we detected around 100 cl containing chocl features that were either newly formed or increased by cl2 disinfection as shown in fig 4b these compounds were classified as chlorinated dbps chocl cl2 dbps in this study the increased chocl cl2 dbps are dom features detected in raw water these may be naturally chlorinated compounds or originate from external sources such as wastewater 34 the chlorinated compounds could also originate from household wastewater or agricultural pesticides newly formed chocl cl2 dbps after disinfection were found more commonly than increased forms as shown by the venn diagram in fig s11a 14 chocl cl2 dbps were commonly formed in all water samples while many chocl cl2 dbps were unique to each sample the formation of unique dbps in each sample implies the reactions of unique dbp precursors irrespective of the degree of similarity water matrices the potential structures of chocl cl2 dbps were further analyzed in this study in the chemspider database using fish scoring table s7 shows plausible structures for selected chocl cl2 dbps matched with compounds previously reported on the chemspider database the data show only chocl cl2 dbps with molecular weight 250 da as higher molecular weight values increase the number of potential structures as examples we found c5h3o3cl c6h7o3cl and c3h3o3cl3 corresponded to 5 chloro 2 furoic acid 3 acetyl 3 chlorodihydro 2 3h furanone and 3 3 3 trichloro 2 hydroxypropionic acid respectively some chocl dbp features detected in this study share their chemical formulae with dbps from previous studies table s8 however their molecular structures have not been reported as only a few dbps were matched this may imply that the molecular structures that were not matched in the database were of low intensity or that their structures have not been reported several chocl cl2 dbp formulae were the same as dbp formulae found after disinfection in previous studies table s8 for example c3h3o3cl3 no 111 in si table s8 was reported as 3 3 3 trichloro 2 hydroxypropionic acid 57 c2h2o2cl2 no 67 in si table s8 could be dichloroacetic acid which is likely an analog of either bromochloroacetic acid c2h2o2brcl no 22 in table s9 or dibromoacetic acid c2h2o2br2 no 23 in table s9 as reported by krasner et al 55 these compounds have been detected in several previous studies 52 56 58 moreover they were also reported in sewage effluent by yang and zhang 59 the c3h4o2cl2 analog no 68 in table s8 is likely to be bromochloromethyl acetate c3h4o2brcl no 25 in table s9 that has been proposed as a dbp 36 55 furthermore several chocl cl2 dbp analogs in this study were also reported in electrochemically disinfected seawater table s9 by gonsior et al 60 in our study a total of 44 chocl cl2 dbps were missing from the chemspider database table s8 these are considered to be unknown dbps notably some of the unknown chocl cl2 dbps have the same formulae as unknown the chlorinated dbps from previous studies on the chlorination of nom as shown in table s8 34 36 generally electrophilic substitution reactions represent the principal chlorination mechanism thus this study was conducted to track putative organic precursors formed via electrophilic substitution only table s12 shows the putative precursors of chocl cl2 dbps formed by electrophilic substitution and their changes in intensity along the river some of the putative precursors substantially increased in intensity at some points along the river indicating influences from water usage these precursors were mostly found as lignin like compounds with o c above 0 7 and h c below 1 5 fig s12 these precursors had low intensity in the upstream samples but their observed increases at other points along the river may indicate wastewater discharge table s12 the precursors with low intensity were likely degraded biologically or photochemically conversely the precursors detected only in downstream samples from june were likely derived from runoff these precursors were found to plot as lignin and lipid like compounds fig s12 however as only a small number of putative precursors were found dbps may be formed via the breakdown of higher molecular weight dom to lower molecular weight dbps 3 6 the formation of dbps during clo2 disinfection after clo2 disinfection approximately 100 increased cho clo2 dbp features were detected in the upstream samples fig 4a whereas relatively more cho clo2 dbp features were detected in the downstream samples from both april and june the cho clo2 dbps had relatively smaller mw p 0 001 values and were less oxidized cos p 0 001 compared to decreased cho features in all samples table 2 clo2 selectively reacts with phenolic or hydroquinone moiety compounds via one electron transfer to form quinone moieties or non phenolic coupling products in the form of cho clo2 dbps 38 furthermore the clo2 reaction can produce in situ formation of hocl as a chlorine impurity 61 these pathways are consistent with our results which indicated that clo2 not only formed intermediate quinone moieties but also caused ring cleavage to form non phenolic products which promoted the formation of cho clo2 dbps with mw values lower than those of the decreased cho features this observation is similar to our previous study 13 on direct clo2 disinfection of raw water without coagulation sedimentation hence although the coagulation sedimentation step may remove some dom cho clo2 dbps with similar characteristics are still produced additionally some chocl clo2 dbps were also found after disinfection fig 4b as clo2 reactions were reported without the addition of chlorine to precursor molecules 38 the chocl clo2 dbps may have been formed by reactions of clo2 with naturally existing chocl or due to chlorine impurity 61 we found only four common chocl clo2 dbps in all the water samples fig s11b whereas most of the chocl clo2 dbps were unique to each sample this observation reinforces the importance of the long term study of dbp formation by clo2 disinfection to establish a database of the chocl clo2 dbps found in water treatment in upstream and downstream areas in both april and june chocl clo2 dbps were found to be relatively less oxygenated low o c in table 2 p 0 001 and less oxidized low cos in table 2 p 0 001 than chocl cl2 dbps these findings indicate that cl2 and clo2 produce different dbp characters this result differs from a previous study that reported chocl dbps formed by clo2 with more oxygenated high o c and oxidized high cos characters 34 these differences may result from the clo2 dosages used in wtp setting in this study we used high clo2 doses in which there is a possibility of preferential oxidation of clo2 to more oxidized chocl features as those more highly oxidized chocl features are decreased by clo2 disinfection the reactions of clo2 are selective to other compounds however the formation of dbps by clo2 disinfection requires further evidence in terms of its reaction pathway several chocl clo2 dbp structures are listed in table s7 as examples c5h8o2cl2 c9h10o2cl2 and c9h9o5cl corresponded to 3 chloro 2 chloromethyl 2 methylpropanoic acid and 2 chloro 1 chloromethyl 3 4 dimethoxybenzene and 2 chloro 4 hydroxy 3 and 5 dimethoxybenzoic acid respectively several hundred isomers of the other chocl clo2 dbps were reported in the chemspider database as shown in table s10 for example c7h9o4cl no 20 in table s10 has been proposed as a dbp by phungsai et al 38 and c4h5o3cl3 no 110 in table s10 corresponds to 4 4 4 trichloro 3 hydroxybutanoic acid as reported in previous studies 38 57 these clo2 dbps were found after both cl2 disinfection and clo2 disinfection in this study this result shows that these dbps might be formed by chlorine impurities in the clo2 solution consistent with previous reports 61 furthermore several chocl clo2 dbps analogs have been found in brominated disinfection byproducts in several studies as shown in table s11 the clo2 dbp precursors were not tracked in this study as their reaction mechanisms are not well known this study demonstrated that unknown screening analysis using orbitrap ms can effectively characterize low molecular weight dom especially cl2 and clo2 dbps the matching chemical structures using a combination of ms ms fragmentation analysis with chromatographic column separation was useful to both estimate the structures of known dbps and to indicate the existence of unknown dbps future research on the disinfectant dosage conditions and contact times on dbp formation and disinfection efficiency would allow us to not only understand dbp formation mechanisms but also perform disinfection with appropriate dosages and contact times to minimize dbp formation in addition routine monitoring using unknown screening would provide more insights into dom matrices and their changes induced by water treatment processes in different seasons 4 conclusions molecular changes in dom between the dry season and after the first rainfall in the wet season were investigated in this study by coagulation sedimentation and disinfection with chlorine or chlorine dioxide through non targeted analysis using orbitrap mass spectrometry over 2000 features were identified in the raw water from upstream and downstream in samples from april and june cho features were the most abundant class followed by chon chos and chons respectively more than 700 cho features were common in upstream and downstream samples after coagulation the cho features were more changed in the downstream samples than in the upstream samples the cl2 modified cho features are much more similar between samples than in clo2 modified samples the cho features with high molecular weights high mw and highly oxidized high cos value and highly oxygenated high o c value characters were preferentially decreased during coagulation by pacl similarly both cl2 and clo2 disinfections decreased cho features with high cos and o c values which were detected after a contact time of 24 h however clo2 disinfection more selectively decreased cho features than cl2 disinfection when similar dosages were applied after cl2 and clo2 disinfection approximately 130 cl containing dbps were detected in the upstream and downstream sample from both april and june furthermore almost half of the total identified dbps in this study were not reported in the chemspider database the chocl cl2 dbps were relatively more oxygenated high o c and oxidized cos than the chocl clo2 dbps the dbp precursors tracked via electrophilic substitution reactions for cl2 dbps were likely not only from natural sources but also from domestic and industrial wastewater discharges or run off as the coagulation sedimentation process results in the removal of different dom features in water with different characteristics various unique unknown dbps were found as a result of cl2 or clo2 disinfection routine monitoring by unknown screening would provide more insights into changes in dbp precursors and unknown dbps formation as well as allow their toxicity to be analyzed this information would allow further update to the list of dbps to be controlled and could also be used to minimize dbps and their precursors through advanced water treatment processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

12562,river water is a major water supply source and its quality is strongly affected by seasonal changes in dissolved organic matter dom and anthropogenic discharge this study uses unknown screening analysis with orbitrap mass spectrometry to investigate differences in molecular dom in upstream and downstream areas of phong river thailand in addition to changes caused by coagulation sedimentation disinfection byproducts dbps and formation by chlorine cl2 and chlorine dioxide clo2 in the dry season and after the first rainfall in the wet season among 2000 dom features in the river dom with carbon hydrogen and oxygen cho features was the most abundant class followed by cho features with other heteroatoms such as n ns and s cho features with a relatively higher degree of oxidation high carbon oxidation state cos and highly oxygenated high oxygen to carbon ratio o c characteristics decreased preferentially via coagulation and sedimentation by polyaluminium chloride approximately 130 cl containing chocl features increased or were newly formed after cl2 and clo2 disinfection respectively only 14 cl2 chocl and four clo2 chocl features were commonly formed in all water samples while many unique dbps were identified in each disinfection therefore reactions of unique dbp precursors in each water sample can produce unique dbps additionally around 100 cho dbps were also found after both cl2 and clo2 disinfection both cl2 and clo2 selectively reacted with cho features with a relatively higher degree of oxidation high cos cl2 disinfection produced more oxygenated high o c and oxidized cos dbps than clo2 disinfection several hundred dbp precursors of cl2 electrophilic substitution were found not only from natural sources but also from wastewater discharge or runoff graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords disinfection byproducts unknown screening orbitrap mass spectrometry chlorine and chlorine dioxide disinfection coagulation sedimentation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction natural organic matter nom contains a variety of heterogeneous mixtures of organic compounds from simple to complex structures and aromatic to aliphatic structures with various functional groups 1 although nom is not directly harmful to humans at low concentrations the presence of nom in water resources is often undesirable an increase in nom concentration in surface waters can cause a range of problems to water treatment operations such as increasing coagulant and disinfectant requirements 2 promoting biological growth in distribution systems 2 4 causing irreversible fouling in membranes 5 and reducing the porosity and adsorption efficiency of activated carbon 6 7 however nom with low molecular weight is difficult to remove using conventional water treatment methods i e coagulation and sedimentation 8 9 the reaction of the remaining nom after pre treatment with coagulation sedimentation during water disinfection results in the formation of disinfection by products dbps which have been widely demonstrated as toxic 10 in addition as rivers are widely contaminated with effluent organic matter efom dissolved organic matter dom removal in water treatment becomes less effective due to the refractory character of efom to coagulation 11 reactions of efom with disinfectants also result in the formation of dbps 12 our previous report showed that efom from wastewater discharge and runoff affects the overall molecular characteristics of dom and dbp formation 13 thus increasing the complexity of dom and dbp management in water treatment processes reactions of chlorine to nom and the corresponding formation of dbps were first reported by rook 14 with an increasing number of dbps subsequently reported 15 broadly the most common dbp types are trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas which constitute approximately 34 of total organic halides 15 16 and are widely regulated in addition to thms and haas other dbps with higher geno and cyto toxicities have been found at lower concentration in advanced water treatment plants including halonitromethanes haloacetamides and haloacetaldehydes 15 17 the remaining dbps representing over half of the total are still unknown 16 to avoid the formation of chlorinated dbps alternative disinfectants have been widely used including ozone chlorine dioxide clo2 and chloramines however these disinfectants still react with dom to form dbps clo2 has been reported to generate very low levels of thms and haas compared to chlorine however several organic halogens can be formed from reactions between clo2 and organic compounds 18 19 although researchers have studied changes in dom i e dbp precursors in conventional water treatment for several decades the existing studies to date lack insights into molecular dom changes that are affected by the seasons and increasing anthropogenic chemical usage therefore identifying dom characteristics and changes caused by conventional water treatment could help to provide better insights into the relationship between water treatment processes and dbp formation mechanisms dom characterization is a highly important task to understand dom changes and optimize water treatment mechanisms various methods have been applied to characterize and quantify dom such as total and dissolved organic carbon toc and doc measurement ultraviolet and visible uv vis absorption spectroscopy specific uv absorbance suva and fluorescence excitation emission 20 these methods highlighted the refractory character of low molecular weight dom to conventional water treatment and that it remained in the water disinfection process however due to the complexity of dom these methods do not provide sufficient information about the molecular characteristics of dom for this reason full characterization and separation of individual dom molecules from complex dom mixtures are difficult to achieve using a single analytical method new dbps with previously unreported attributes may be produced by reactions with clearly characterized dom dbp precursors however characterizing the formation of such new is challenging given the difficulties in separating dom mixtures hence understanding molecular dom removal mechanisms and the formation of dbp are crucial for applying conventional water treatments consequently not target or unknown screening analysis using high resolution and accurate mass spectrometry hrms is a promising method to characterize dom at the molecular level 21 24 given this method s high accuracy and mass resolution several thousand dom peaks can be obtained in a single analysis which can then be further converted into molecular formulae and characteristics orbitrap mass spectrometry orbitrap ms is an hrms technique now increasingly used in environmental sampling applications 23 several previous studies have applied unknown screening analysis using orbitrap ms to characterize dom in water sources 25 27 and to identify and quantify the presence of organic pollutants 23 28 30 additionally orbitrap ms has been used to detect several hundred previously unknown dbps formed by water chlorination and the behavior of organic precursors during water treatment 31 32 63 this method was applied in previous studies which demonstrated that dom characteristics were different for each water resource and changes in dom by coagulation and disinfection 33 36 according to these studies the coagulation preferentially removed dom with more aromatic compounds and oxygenated molecule however some dom remained in the disinfection to form several unknown dbps although common dom features were present in the raw water many of unknown dbp were found to form uniquely in each water source 34 36 in addition our previous study revealed that anthropogenic activities variably impact dom characteristics from upstream to downstream which promotes the formation of unique dbp forms when raw water is disinfected with cl2 or clo2 13 in this study molecular changes in dom in the dry season and after the first rainfall in the wet season as induced by coagulation sedimentation and disinfection with cl2 or clo2 were investigated using non targeted analysis by orbitrap ms the dom features obtained from the analysis were converted to molecular characteristics such as hydrogen to carbon h c and oxygen to carbon o c ratios the degree of unsaturation double bond equivalent dbe o c and carbon oxidation states cos changes in dom features by coagulation sedimentation and disinfection by cl2 or clo2 were discussed in the context of a semiquantitative approach chlorinated features that increased in intensity or newly formed features following disinfection were investigated in terms of their molecular characteristics potential molecular structures in databases and behaviors of assumed precursors along the river the contributions of this study are novel as no studies to date have reported tracking the source of organic precursors and their compositional change in along rivers 2 material and methods 2 1 water sampling water samples were collected from upstream s1 and downstream s11 areas of the lower phong river and tap water s12 was collected after treatment of s11 at the water treatment plant wtp in khon kaen thailand for comparison with lab scale treatment as shown in fig s1 and table s1 supplementary information si the samples were collected during the dry season in april and following the first rainfall in june wet season in 2019 the upstream samples were taken from water discharge from the ubon ratana dam while downstream received discharge types including agricultural runoff industrial discharge and municipal discharge fig s2 before reaching the downstream water treatment plants we previously reported changes in molecular dom matrices along this river due to effects of effluent 13 all samples were collected in pre combusted 550 c for 4 h glassware no preservatives were added to the samples to avoid changes in their composition the samples were immediately transferred within 4 h to a laboratory under cold conditions 4 c 2 2 laboratory scale coagulation sedimentation and disinfection upstream and downstream water sample which were collected before the wtp intake were used for water treatment experiments these experiments were conducted in a laboratory and consisted of coagulation using polyaluminium chloride pacl as a coagulant followed by flocculation for 20 min and sedimentation for 10 min a volume of 1000 ml of water was used for each pacl dosage 20 ppm for upstream samples and 10 ppm for downstream samples in a jar test these dosages were selected based on the optimum doses for turbidity removal 5 ntu following actual operation in wtp for each sample table 1 rapid sand filtration was simulated by filtering through a 0 7 Î¼m glass fiber filter gf f whatman after filtration the water samples were subjected to disinfection using 17 5 mgcl2 l for a high chlorine dose and 17 5 mgcl2 l for clo2 with both disinfectants widely used in local water treatment plants 37 the samples were then incubated at 20 c in dark conditions for 24 h the cl2 and clo2 dosages were selected as five times the actual amount used in wtps to allow the dom to react thoroughly with disinfectant in 24 h of contact time the cl2 solutions were prepared from sodium hypochlorite solutions with 4 6 active chlorine whereas the clo2 was prepared by mixing potassium peroxydisulfate k2s2o8 2 g in 50 ml water with sodium chlorite naclo2 4 g in 50 ml 38 during the water treatment experiments the ph was not controlled per the actual operations conditions used in water treatment plants no cl2 or clo2 quenching chemical was added to the samples to avoid dom composition changes deionized water di water was also subjected to the same conditions and used as a control 2 3 general water quality analysis to analyze water quality ph dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec and temperature were measured on site using a multimeter hq40d hach company colorado usa and the turbidity was measured using a turbidimeter 2100p hach

addition of a glycine reagent followed by free dpd chemicals dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was measured by multi n c 2100s analytikjena germany after filtering samples with a 0 45 Î¼m nylon filter the uv absorbance was examined at 254 nm uv254 using a dr6000 spectrophotometer hach company colorado usa the specific uv absorbance suva was calculated from the absorbance of uv254 divided by the doc concentration 2 4 samples pre treatment by solid phase extraction spe the dom in the samples was concentrated using 1 g of bond elute ppl cartridge agilent technologies santa clara ca usa this cartridge was chosen for its strong ability to recover doc it has been widely used for environmental samples 39 40 the cartridge was rinsed and equilibrated with 20 ml of methanol meoh lc ms grade merck and 20 ml of acidified di water 0 01 n hydrochloric acid hcl respectively before extraction 1000 ml of each sample was filtered with 0 7 Î¼m pre combusted 550 c for 4 h glass fiber filters gf f whatman the samples were acidified to a ph of 2 using 5 and 1 n hcl to increase dom extraction efficiency the acidified samples were then passed through the cartridge with a vacuum pump at 70 kpa with a flow rate of approximately 250 ml h next the cartridge was rinsed with 10 ml of acidified di water for the complete removal of salt the adsorbed dom was then eluted with 10 ml of methanol the eluates were stored at 20 c before unknown screening analysis the di water controls were processed using the same spe method to evaluate doc recovery 1 ml of the extracted samples was purged with high purity nitrogen to evaporate the methanol and then redissolved in 10 ml of di water by sonication the doc recovery of each sample was calculated as the ratio of doc in the extract to the doc in the water sample 2 5 non target or unknown screening analysis the extracted samples and the di controls obtained from the spe were analyzed by orbitrap ms q exactive plus thermo scientific usa in combination with negative electrospray ionization ni esi at the synchrotron light research institute slri thailand the extracts were injected in triplicate using flow injection mode without an lc column at 200 Î¼l min in the methanol mobile phase under negative full scan mode with an m z range of 100 1000 the analytical conditions have been described in detail in a previous study 26 the mass spectra were assessed using compound discoverer 2 1 thermo scientific which was used to combine peaks into components i e list of dom peaks m z and intensities screen background from noise peaks and remove singlets by isotope validation the mass tolerance was set at 2 ppm for peak combination only peak intensities that were significantly higher than the extraction blank p 0 05 with signal to noise ratio s n values exceeding 3 were selected for molecular formula identification the molecular formulae were identified by compound identification algorithms 22 41 with some modifications 31 additionally peaks identified as chlorinated molecules were further validated by the existence of an isotopic peak 37cl1 35cln 1 at m z 1 99704 above the 35cln peak the disinfected samples were further analyzed in ms all ion fragmentation aif mode to obtain structural information the samples were injected into the orbitrap ms via a hypersil gold c18 column 100 mm 2 1 mm 1 9 Î¼m thermo scientific with a column temperature at 40 c at a rate of 0 3 ml min analyses were also conducted with a hypersil gold pei hilic column 100 mm 2 1 mm 1 9 Î¼m thermo scientific however fewer peaks were detected compared to the hypersil gold c18 column the mobile phases consisted of methanol solvent a and water solvent b the gradient conditions were as follows 5 methanol and 95 water constant for 0 5

collision energy was 45 ev the mass spectra were analyzed using compound discoverer any potential molecular structures were matched with compounds reported on the chemspider database applying fish scoring using 1 full spectrum tree ms and ms aif 2 general fragmentation rules 3 fragmentation libraries 4 aromatic cleavage 5 mass tolerance within 2 ppm and 6 an s n threshold at 3 the unknown features detected in this study would only be the dom molecules detected above the method detection limit mdl the corresponding mdl of the orbitrap ms is reported to range from 0 1 to 1 ng l 42 43 the identified molecular formulae features of the dom were converted to molecular characteristics the h c and o c ratio were plotted in van krevelen diagrams to categorize compound like characteristics 44 the dbe o c 36 and cos 45 values were calculated to indicate the degrees of unsaturation and oxidation respectively theses parameters were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 in which c h o and cl denote the numbers of carbon hydrogen oxygen and chlorine atoms respectively 1 dbe o c 1 0 5 2 c h cl o c 2 c os h 2o cl c to assess the statistical differences in the mean characteristics among the samples and groups of features analysis of variance anova analyses with post hoc tests with the least significant difference lsd approach were performed in statplus software analystsoft usa to analyze dissimilarities between the water samples multidimensional scaling mds using the euclidean distance was applied considering the peak intensities of the features in each sample using spss software ibm armonk usa changes in dom features during water treatments were analyzed by semi quantitatively comparing the peak intensity values before and after treatment we followed the criterion proposed by phungsai et al 36 46 with intensity changes before and after treatment of over 30 considered as semi quantitative changes this indicator is based on the instrument s measurement deviation 95 of dom peaks deviated within 30 3 results and discussion 3 1 elemental composition of dom the doc and suva levels of upstream and downstream water samples in april and june both before and after treatments are shown in table 1 after coagulation sedimentation the doc levels were reduced by 0 3 0 8 mg c l in upstream samples and 0 5 mg c l in downstream samples in addition the suva value decreased by 0 09 0 30 l mg m in both upstream and downstream samples in this step table 1 implying slight removal of doc with high suva values by coagulation sedimentation this relationship between suva and doc removal recorded in this study is consistent with previous findings 2 after 24 h disinfections the doc decreased by 0 5 0 6 mg c l in the upstream sample and 0 3 0 6 mg c l in the downstream sample for cl2 disinfection with corresponding values ranges of 0 2 0 6 mg c l and 0 3 0 4 mg c l for clo2 disinfection the residual cl2 and clo2 were lower than the initial dosages after incubation table s5 indicating the consumption of disinfectants and their reaction with organic matter variable doc removal in response to different treatments indicates differing levels of dom mineralization and variability in preferential oxidation table 1 the suva values decreased after cl2 disinfection table 1 indicating a decrease in hydrophobic molecules this finding implies that the reactions of cl2 with nucleophilic and unsaturated sites in dom result in ring cleavage 47 as clo2 is more selective for double bonds in rings 38 this would explain the slight suva decrease recorded for clo2 disinfection table 1 in the april samples conversely clo2 disinfection in the june samples increased the suva value this may be because clo2 oxidized hydroquinone containing compounds to quinone moieties which have a higher molar absorption coefficient at 254 nm potentially resulting in increased suva values 38 the doc recovery rate of raw water samples was approximately 55 73 similar to values reported in several previous studies 36 39 40 over half of the dom was analyzed in this study the dom mass spectra of both the upstream and downstream samples detected by the orbitrap ms comprised peak intensities that covered only 100 600 m z range fig s3 after molecular formula identification around 2000 molecular formulae were identified in the samples based on heteroatom classes consisting of cho only cho or containing n s or both chon chos and chons respectively as shown in fig s4 this study focused on the cho features as this class constituted almost half of the features in most of the samples furthermore numerous studies have shown that cho features predominate over other heteroatoms in natural water 36 48 49 in addition cho features with acid properties can rapidly lose protons and are easily ionized under negative ionization mode 41 in contrast n containing compounds can be efficiently ionized in positive mode due to their basic groups such as amine however sodium adduction in positive ionization mode results in highly complex mass spectra 50 in our study portions of the chon features with acidic functional groups would still be detected while some chon features with very basic characters would be absent over 700 cho features were found in all samples which constituted 90 of the overall features table s2 these features were common in samples from april and june this indicates the persistence of organic compounds from upstream to downstream areas however 10 of dom features were unique in april and june which is consistent with our previous report 13 as shown in the van krevelen diagram the top 50 cho features mostly plotted as lignin like compounds fig 1 and separate plots of each sample with rank abundances provided in fig s5 while some plotted as lipid like compounds similar observations for common compounds were identified in all the studied water samples in april unique cho features found in upstream or downstream samples plotted in all compound like areas fig 1a conversely many cho features in the upstream samples in june exhibited an increase in carbohydrate like and lipid like compounds while some unique cho features in the downstream samples plotted in areas where no compound like structures are reported i e o c above 0 7 and h c below 1 5 fig 1b as this sample was collected downstream after initial rainfall during the wet season the cho features present could be derived from surface run off given the unique characteristics of this dom these findings indicate that run off dom has less hydrogenated lower h c and more oxygenated higher o c characteristics than other dom types fig 1b these molecules also tended to be more highly oxidized i e positive cos fig s6b 3 2 overall changes in the water treatment processes the doc recovery rates of the water samples by spe for the samples after coagulation sedimentation and disinfection were approximately 56 69 table 1 with similar values recorded for the raw water samples to statistically evaluate the dissimilarity among the samples each of which contained almost 1000 cho features the peak intensities of the cho features of all samples were analyzed using two dimensional scaling as shown in fig 2 in this analysis the distances between the plotted samples indicate the degree of difference in their dom matrices the distances between the raw water samples indicate some differences in their dom features for both the april and june samples these differences can be attributed to differences in the intensity of the occurrence of both common and unique compounds in the van krevelen diagrams fig 1 the distances between the plotted raw water and coagulation sedimentation samples were greater for downstream samples than upstream samples indicating the effects of coagulation sedimentation on the downstream dom were more evident relative to the upstream dom this could be attributed to the unique dom types found only in the downstream raw water samples that were removed by coagulation sedimentation clo2 disinfection modified the upstream and downstream dom characteristics in different directions in fig 2 the upstream and downstream samples would have had different precursors which resulted in variable changes in dom content by clo2 disinfection in contrast almost the same sense of change occurred in response to cl2 disinfection indicating a similar modification of dom the cl2 treated samples generally exhibit much greater similarity between samples than the clo2 treated samples overall after water treatment there was an increase in molecules that plotted within the known compound fields especially lignin lipids and carbohydrate fields which remained in the resulting tap water fig s5e and f this result implies that these molecules had a relatively refractory character 3 3 effects of coagulation sedimentation on cho features after the coagulation sedimentation process 195 and 292 cho features in upstream samples from april and june fig s7 respectively semi quantitatively decreased while the equivalent values following this step in the downstream samples were 417 and 422 respectively in contrast doc removal from both upstream and downstream samples was relatively similar table 1 the downstream samples contained more cho features released from discharge along the river that could be removed by coagulation sedimentation for the upstream samples coagulation sedimentation selectively decreased cho features with high cos p 0 001 compared to refractory molecules fig 3b and e the decreased features were found to be those with high molecular weight mw p 0 001 and higher o c values p 0 03 in tables s3 and s4 additionally these features were found to be 1 lignin like 2 characterized by condensed aromatic structures and 3 molecules with high o c and low h c values on van krevelen diagrams fig s8a and c the cho features removed from the upstream samples were similarly removed by coagulation sedimentation of the downstream samples fig 3a and d in addition many cho features with relatively positive dbe o c and low cos values were decreased only by coagulation sedimentation of the downstream samples fig 3c and f these molecules were predominantly lipid like and lignin like compounds fig s8b and d as more oxidized positive cos and more oxygenated high o c features were found to decrease in most of the samples this observation indicates preferential removal of cho features with more oxygenated and more oxidized characteristics by the coagulation sedimentation process these observations were consistent with alum coagulation reported by gonsior et al and lavonen et al 34 35 and pacl coagulation reported by zhang et al 49 these compounds would tend to contain more acidic functional groups resulting in their coagulation with alum and ferric chloride and eventual decrease by sedimentation 51 as many cho features with relatively high dbe o c and low cos values decreased only in the downstream samples these features might be removed by hydrophobic forces adhesion to flocs or through formation of high molecular weight molecules in downstream samples as compounds with more carbon double bonds would tend to have more hydrophobicity to dom for cho features removed in both the upstream and downstream samples fig 3a e the coagulation process would be selective to remove more oxidized molecules due to electrostatic forces between the negative ions on cho features and al species in pacl oh o and al3 furthermore downstream dom removal would be driven by both electrostatic forces for more oxidized molecules and hydrophobic forces for hydrophobic molecules high dbe o c this may suggest that organic contaminants can be more readily removed from downstream samples than upstream samples through coagulation sedimentation 3 4 effects of cl2 and clo2 disinfection on cho features fig 4 shows the numbers of the cho features changed by disinfections in all the samples 600 cho features 70 were semi quantitatively decreased by cl2 disinfection fig 4a and approximately 120 cho features remained unchanged this suggests that the coagulation sedimentation process may be insufficient to decrease these compounds more than 300 cho features were decreased by clo2 in the upstream samples whereas approximately 150 cho features were decreased in the downstream samples fig 4a implying the selectivity of clo2 for certain cho features at the same application dosages clo2 was more selective of dom than cl2 the decreased cho features by cl2 had relatively higher average o c p 0 005 and cos p 0 001 than the unchanged cho features fig s9 and table 2 similarly the decreased cho features decreased by clo2 were associated with higher o c p 0 001 and cos p 0 001 than the unchanged cho features fig s10 and table 2 in all samples these results indicate that both cl2 and clo2 selectively oxidize cho features with high contents of oxygen containing functional groups this observation differs from previous studies that have reported low o c compounds as more reactive toward chlorine 34 36 these studies observed reactions within only a few hours for contact time in wtp indicating that chlorine selectively reacts with dom with low oxygen content in this study the reactions with oxidized dom high oxygen content took place within 24 h therefore the reaction of chlorine reaction with these dom types was potentially activated by electron donating moiety groups such as o oh and or on an aromatic ring when exposed to high chlorine concentrations this finding demonstrates that contact time and chlorine dosage are both important factors in reactions between chlorine and dom this result is consistent with previous studies on the effect of contact time on the level of dbp formations 52 53 3 5 the formation of dbps during cl2 disinfection after chlorination approximately 100 cho features were either newly formed or increased in all samples fig 4a these features are termed non chlorinated dbps cho cl2 dbps the cho cl2 dbps had relatively higher dbe o c p 0 001 values and cos p 0 001 values and lower mw p 0 001 values relative to those of decreased cho features table 2 and fig s9 this finding indicates that cho cl2 dbps consist of low mw features with more oxidized and unsaturated characters similar to our previous findings 13 during cl2 disinfection the reaction of chlorine with dom often occurs by electrophilic substitution and addition reactions with these reactions reported to usually occur at limited sites namely reducing nucleophilic and unsaturated sites 47 the electrophilic substitution process substitutes hydrogen atoms by the electrophilic attack of chlorine atoms which leads to the formation of carbon bound chlorine on the aromatic rings of organic compounds whereas the addition reaction adds hocl to carbon double bonds to form intermediate chlorinated molecules chocl in addition these reactions can continue to react via hocl with the intermediate chocl to form lower mw chlorinated and non chlorinated cho dbps through aromatic ring or double bond cleaving 38 47 these observations relationship between the numbers of increased and decreased cho and chocl features after chlorination fig 4 additionally we detected around 100 cl containing chocl features that were either newly formed or increased by cl2 disinfection as shown in fig 4b these compounds were classified as chlorinated dbps chocl cl2 dbps in this study the increased chocl cl2 dbps are dom features detected in raw water these may be naturally chlorinated compounds or originate from external sources such as wastewater 34 the chlorinated compounds could also originate from household wastewater or agricultural pesticides newly formed chocl cl2 dbps after disinfection were found more commonly than increased forms as shown by the venn diagram in fig s11a 14 chocl cl2 dbps were commonly formed in all water samples while many chocl cl2 dbps were unique to each sample the formation of unique dbps in each sample implies the reactions of unique dbp precursors irrespective of the degree of similarity water matrices the potential structures of chocl cl2 dbps were further analyzed in this study in the chemspider database using fish scoring table s7 shows plausible structures for selected chocl cl2 dbps matched with compounds previously reported on the chemspider database the data show only chocl cl2 dbps with molecular weight 250 da as higher molecular weight values increase the number of potential structures as examples we found c5h3o3cl c6h7o3cl and c3h3o3cl3 corresponded to 5 chloro 2 furoic acid 3 acetyl 3 chlorodihydro 2 3h furanone and 3 3 3 trichloro 2 hydroxypropionic acid respectively some chocl dbp features detected in this study share their chemical formulae with dbps from previous studies table s8 however their molecular structures have not been reported as only a few dbps were matched this may imply that the molecular structures that were not matched in the database were of low intensity or that their structures have not been reported several chocl cl2 dbp formulae were the same as dbp formulae found after disinfection in previous studies table s8 for example c3h3o3cl3 no 111 in si table s8 was reported as 3 3 3 trichloro 2 hydroxypropionic acid 57 c2h2o2cl2 no 67 in si table s8 could be dichloroacetic acid which is likely an analog of either bromochloroacetic acid c2h2o2brcl no 22 in table s9 or dibromoacetic acid c2h2o2br2 no 23 in table s9 as reported by krasner et al 55 these compounds have been detected in several previous studies 52 56 58 moreover they were also reported in sewage effluent by yang and zhang 59 the c3h4o2cl2 analog no 68 in table s8 is likely to be bromochloromethyl acetate c3h4o2brcl no 25 in table s9 that has been proposed as a dbp 36 55 furthermore several chocl cl2 dbp analogs in this study were also reported in electrochemically disinfected seawater table s9 by gonsior et al 60 in our study a total of 44 chocl cl2 dbps were missing from the chemspider database table s8 these are considered to be unknown dbps notably some of the unknown chocl cl2 dbps have the same formulae as unknown the chlorinated dbps from previous studies on the chlorination of nom as shown in table s8 34 36 generally electrophilic substitution reactions represent the principal chlorination mechanism thus this study was conducted to track putative organic precursors formed via electrophilic substitution only table s12 shows the putative precursors of chocl cl2 dbps formed by electrophilic substitution and their changes in intensity along the river some of the putative precursors substantially increased in intensity at some points along the river indicating influences from water usage these precursors were mostly found as lignin like compounds with o c above 0 7 and h c below 1 5 fig s12 these precursors had low intensity in the upstream samples but their observed increases at other points along the river may indicate wastewater discharge table s12 the precursors with low intensity were likely degraded biologically or photochemically conversely the precursors detected only in downstream samples from june were likely derived from runoff these precursors were found to plot as lignin and lipid like compounds fig s12 however as only a small number of putative precursors were found dbps may be formed via the breakdown of higher molecular weight dom to lower molecular weight dbps 3 6 the formation of dbps during clo2 disinfection after clo2 disinfection approximately 100 increased cho clo2 dbp features were detected in the upstream samples fig 4a whereas relatively more cho clo2 dbp features were detected in the downstream samples from both april and june the cho clo2 dbps had relatively smaller mw p 0 001 values and were less oxidized cos p 0 001 compared to decreased cho features in all samples table 2 clo2 selectively reacts with phenolic or hydroquinone moiety compounds via one electron transfer to form quinone moieties or non phenolic coupling products in the form of cho clo2 dbps 38 furthermore the clo2 reaction can produce in situ formation of hocl as a chlorine impurity 61 these pathways are consistent with our results which indicated that clo2 not only formed intermediate quinone moieties but also caused ring cleavage to form non phenolic products which promoted the formation of cho clo2 dbps with mw values lower than those of the decreased cho features this observation is similar to our previous study 13 on direct clo2 disinfection of raw water without coagulation sedimentation hence although the coagulation sedimentation step may remove some dom cho clo2 dbps with similar characteristics are still produced additionally some chocl clo2 dbps were also found after disinfection fig 4b as clo2 reactions were reported without the addition of chlorine to precursor molecules 38 the chocl clo2 dbps may have been formed by reactions of clo2 with naturally existing chocl or due to chlorine impurity 61 we found only four common chocl clo2 dbps in all the water samples fig s11b whereas most of the chocl clo2 dbps were unique to each sample this observation reinforces the importance of the long term study of dbp formation by clo2 disinfection to establish a database of the chocl clo2 dbps found in water treatment in upstream and downstream areas in both april and june chocl clo2 dbps were found to be relatively less oxygenated low o c in table 2 p 0 001 and less oxidized low cos in table 2 p 0 001 than chocl cl2 dbps these findings indicate that cl2 and clo2 produce different dbp characters this result differs from a previous study that reported chocl dbps formed by clo2 with more oxygenated high o c and oxidized high cos characters 34 these differences may result from the clo2 dosages used in wtp setting in this study we used high clo2 doses in which there is a possibility of preferential oxidation of clo2 to more oxidized chocl features as those more highly oxidized chocl features are decreased by clo2 disinfection the reactions of clo2 are selective to other compounds however the formation of dbps by clo2 disinfection requires further evidence in terms of its reaction pathway several chocl clo2 dbp structures are listed in table s7 as examples c5h8o2cl2 c9h10o2cl2 and c9h9o5cl corresponded to 3 chloro 2 chloromethyl 2 methylpropanoic acid and 2 chloro 1 chloromethyl 3 4 dimethoxybenzene and 2 chloro 4 hydroxy 3 and 5 dimethoxybenzoic acid respectively several hundred isomers of the other chocl clo2 dbps were reported in the chemspider database as shown in table s10 for example c7h9o4cl no 20 in table s10 has been proposed as a dbp by phungsai et al 38 and c4h5o3cl3 no 110 in table s10 corresponds to 4 4 4 trichloro 3 hydroxybutanoic acid as reported in previous studies 38 57 these clo2 dbps were found after both cl2 disinfection and clo2 disinfection in this study this result shows that these dbps might be formed by chlorine impurities in the clo2 solution consistent with previous reports 61 furthermore several chocl clo2 dbps analogs have been found in brominated disinfection byproducts in several studies as shown in table s11 the clo2 dbp precursors were not tracked in this study as their reaction mechanisms are not well known this study demonstrated that unknown screening analysis using orbitrap ms can effectively characterize low molecular weight dom especially cl2 and clo2 dbps the matching chemical structures using a combination of ms ms fragmentation analysis with chromatographic column separation was useful to both estimate the structures of known dbps and to indicate the existence of unknown dbps future research on the disinfectant dosage conditions and contact times on dbp formation and disinfection efficiency would allow us to not only understand dbp formation mechanisms but also perform disinfection with appropriate dosages and contact times to minimize dbp formation in addition routine monitoring using unknown screening would provide more insights into dom matrices and their changes induced by water treatment processes in different seasons 4 conclusions molecular changes in dom between the dry season and after the first rainfall in the wet season were investigated in this study by coagulation sedimentation and disinfection with chlorine or chlorine dioxide through non targeted analysis using orbitrap mass spectrometry over 2000 features were identified in the raw water from upstream and downstream in samples from april and june cho features were the most abundant class followed by chon chos and chons respectively more than 700 cho features were common in upstream and downstream samples after coagulation the cho features were more changed in the downstream samples than in the upstream samples the cl2 modified cho features are much more similar between samples than in clo2 modified samples the cho features with high molecular weights high mw and highly oxidized high cos value and highly oxygenated high o c value characters were preferentially decreased during coagulation by pacl similarly both cl2 and clo2 disinfections decreased cho features with high cos and o c values which were detected after a contact time of 24 h however clo2 disinfection more selectively decreased cho features than cl2 disinfection when similar dosages were applied after cl2 and clo2 disinfection approximately 130 cl containing dbps were detected in the upstream and downstream sample from both april and june furthermore almost half of the total identified dbps in this study were not reported in the chemspider database the chocl cl2 dbps were relatively more oxygenated high o c and oxidized cos than the chocl clo2 dbps the dbp precursors tracked via electrophilic substitution reactions for cl2 dbps were likely not only from natural sources but also from domestic and industrial wastewater discharges or run off as the coagulation sedimentation process results in the removal of different dom features in water with different characteristics various unique unknown dbps were found as a result of cl2 or clo2 disinfection routine monitoring by unknown screening would provide more insights into changes in dbp precursors and unknown dbps formation as well as allow their toxicity to be analyzed this information would allow further update to the list of dbps to be controlled and could also be used to minimize dbps and their precursors through advanced water treatment processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

12563,optimal operating systems have been widely employed to improve the economic and environmental performance of wastewater treatment plants wwtps for efficiently treating discharged water pollutants however the multi optimization approach applied to wwtps has been inadequate resulting in a low optimization performance owing to varying influent conditions and inherent complex interactions between manipulated variables therefore this study developed a digital multi solution for optimal operation of a wwtp based on multi agent reinforcement learning dynamic influent conditions with low normal and high influent chemical oxygen demands and total nitrogen composition ratios were generated using a k means clustering algorithm to accurately reflect operating conditions a game abstraction method based on a two stage attention network g2anet algorithm was employed to simultaneously search for three operational setpoints dissolved oxygen external sludge recycling and external carbon dose the adaptability of the g2anet based digital multi solution for determining setpoints was evaluated by employing newly measured one year influent data the results demonstrated the ability of an intelligent g2anet based digital multi solution in identifying optimal setpoints to improve the performance of wwtps and outperform manual operating systems under varying influent conditions it reduced aeration energy by 25 and improved effluent quality by 7 while maintaining a similar pumping energy the g2anet based digital multi solution can innovatively

performances of operation systems r t reward value Ï weighting factors for each performance index 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps are complex and energy intensive systems that reduce anthropogenic water pollution 1 effluent discharge standards and regulations have become stricter worldwide to protect the environment 2 thus recent advances in the field of wastewater treatment aim to provide operational energy cost effectiveness and desired effluent quality 3 from the perspective of energy reduction and environmental protection process optimization of wwtps is an appealing strategy that has recently received attention process optimization suggests the two main objectives of wwtps satisfying the effluent discharge limit and minimizing the operating cost 4 however determining the optimal solutions for wwtps is a challenging task optimization should simultaneously achieve all wwtp objectives that are decisive for process operation and management the primary goal of wwtps is environmental treatment however energy consumption is significant for economic performance 5 therefore environmental and economic performance should be considered as dual or multi objective functions in the optimal solution for wwtps and their interconnection mechanisms should be considered in optimization approaches for tradeoff problems another fundamental issue with process optimization is the complex system of wwtps that exhibits nonlinear characteristics with respect to biological chemical physical mechanisms dynamic and nonlinear influent conditions could hinder the stable operation of wwtps 6 7 influent components such as chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tn exhibit distinct nonlinearity because the concentrations of components have a wide range of standard deviations and skewed distributions 8 therefore a robust optimization solution should be thoroughly considered for the nonlinear and complex properties of wwtps 9 table 1 summarizes the process optimization systems for wwtps the systems are used for dual and multi objective optimization using mathematical model based stochastic and heuristic approaches the optimization systems are employed and evaluated for each target system which is described by wwtp models activated sludge model asm 5 9 12 and benchmark simulation model bsm 13 16 mathematical models 17 or experiments 18 19 asm series and their extended models are useful tools for identifying real wwtps and bsm is the standard model to validate optimization and control strategy under the formal criteria 13 although mathematical algorithms show noteworthy optimization performances for environmental or economic improvements they require nonlinear differential and algebraic equations thus they can be limited in considering the uncertainties while solving optimization problems 9 hence artificial intelligence ai based optimization systems have garnered increased attention because of their robustness flexibility and high performance however recent studies have reported that ai solves only one or two variables without considering multi agent assignment problems it is difficult for ai agents to compute their contribution toward solving a problem in a collaborative environment 20 consequently multi agent reinforcement learning marl is necessary to solve multi objective optimization problems of wwtp operations while maximizing task completion based on self learning and effective coordination multi objective optimizations have been conducted for environmental and economic improvements operational setpoints such as effluent pollutant concentration and dissolved oxygen do concentration were decided for controllers 2 21 however the abrupt influent change could deteriorate the fixed setpoints performances there are some successful efforts to optimize wwtps by proposing influent varying setpoints 22 23 despite their performances mathematical and heuristic based optimization algorithm could be limited to solving highly uncertain optimization problems consequently multi objective optimizations that consider solving the high dimensional and nonlinear problems of wwtps have not been conducted thus far owing to the inherent interaction between operating variables under dynamic nonlinear influent conditions this study developed a new digitalized solution for the operation systems by using marl for sustainable operation of wwtps this study proposes a collaborative smart decision with a high tech ai algorithm to address multiple optimizations of operating systems as shown in fig 1 the ai algorithm considered the interactions of multiple operating variables under dynamic influent conditions for optimum operation of the wwtp this was accomplished using a digital system involving data analysis a digital twin and multi agent optimization steps the digital twin reflected the dynamic and complex wwtp mechanisms to include key features of a real wwtp system depending on the purpose of the multi objective optimization 24 the core technique of the digital system and its solution was marl which incorporates ai agents to suggest optimized collaborative actions for wwtps with their smart decisions the environmental and economic improvements i e effluent quality and operating costs were evaluated and compared to the manual operation system the methodology incorporates digitalized approaches to system improvement under a variety of influent conditions the present system would be well suited for low normal and high influent concentrations by employing the stable and adaptable structure of marl 2 material and methods fig 2 graphically depicts the proposed framework used to search for a digital solution that can implement the multi objective optimization of wwtp operations big data including influent effluent and operating conditions were collected by telemonitoring systems from a full scale wwtp over eight years as shown in fig 2 a as shown in fig 2 b a data analysis was conducted to extract the diurnal and seasonal trends of the collected influent data to determine the dynamic characteristics fig 2 c shows the generation of an influent scenario involving high normal and low influent loadings for cod and tn concentration based on the data analysis diurnal variations of the collected influent datasets were utilized to generate influent datasets the diurnal influent datasets provided diverse influent scenarios which were applied to marl algorithms fig 2 d shows the structure of the marls utilized to design a digital multi solution for the operation system of the wwtp while considering the influent conditions this study used two marl algorithms qmix and a game abstraction method based on a two stage attention network g2anet to suggest collaborative solutions 25 26 fig 2 e shows the training of marl for multi objective optimization of the wwtp operation based on the influent scenarios and the determined structures of the marls the training of the marls was iteratively conducted until conditions such as sufficient training epochs and training completion were satisfied the training stage shows the converged reward values of marls to certain maximum values by considering the effluent quality index eqi and consumed energy the trained marl was employed to search for a digital multi solution for the wwtp operation as depicted in fig 2 f the marl algorithm automatically searched for setpoints including external carbon dosage external recycle flow rates and dissolved oxygen do concentration finally the marl based digital multi solution was evaluated on a daily basis for effluent quality energy and operating costs and compared with the manual operation system of the target wwtp and heuristic optimization system 2 1 current operation system of the target wastewater treatment plant fig 3 shows the configuration and operational characteristics of the target wwtp the treatment process included biological treatment and sludge filtration using the five sequential reactors the plant reduced footprints and waste sludge by replacing the clarifier with a membrane reactor mbr fig 3 shows the influent conditions in the target wwtp over eight years according to the configuration operating condition and influent digital twin of the target wwtp was modeled as described in supplementary materials a in addition uncertainty analysis was conducted to ensure the precision of the digital twin details of uncertainty analysis and its results are provided in supplementary materials a the measured influent components were positively skewed the tails of influent pollutant distribution diverged from normality thus representing nonlinearity 8 this indicated that the influent was nonstationary making it harder to optimize the treatment process under dynamic conditions the main problem of the wwtp was the use of fixed setpoints without considering the dynamic influent characteristics and interconnections between the setpoints which can require excessive energy and costs and result in insufficient effluent quality therefore a digital multi solution to simultaneously determine multiple setpoints was required to save energy and maintain effluent quality 2 2 influent scenario generation for a multi agent optimization algorithm carbon and nitrogen loadings are crucial influencing factors in wastewater treatment processes variations in the influents can affect the pollutant removal efficiency and operational energy of wastewater treatment 27 in addition optimization of wastewater treatment without considering dynamic influents cannot ensure sufficient accuracy or improve the wwtp performance 28 29 this study generated influent datasets from the measured influent data to manage the dynamic and nonstationary influent conditions for feasible process optimization and reflect the inherent natural variability of pollutant concentrations as shown in fig 2 c three influent scenarios were defined according to the c n ratio by using k means clustering k means clustering can distinguish one cluster from the other clusters regarding influent similarity 30 31 based on the measured datasets and their characteristics influent scenario data sets were generated by considering the influent similarity of the c n ratio which was represented by cluster s centroids of three influent scenarios then hourly influent datasets were generated using cluster centroids of the c n ratio and diurnal trends of influent pollutants gaussian noise was added to the generated hourly datasets to include uncertainty over the time series influent data 32 providing all operating setpoints for each type of influent condition is unrealistic and increases the dimensions of optimization problems and computation time 22 therefore influent scenarios based on varying cod and tn were suggested to optimize the target plant based on complex influent conditions detailed descriptions of influent scenario generation and its algorithms are provided in supplementary materials b 2 3 a digital multi solution for process optimization using a marl algorithm the marl based digital multi solution was designed to determine optimal setpoints for the adjustable operational variables of the target wwtp as shown in fig 4 the major contribution of the digital multi solution was the environment friendly and cost effective maintenance of the plant with diverse influent conditions thus the suggested optimal system which incorporates influent scenario clustering using the k means algorithm reflects various realistic influent conditions the marl algorithm agents suggest each optimal setpoint and interact with each other to share the process information of the target plant three agents were assigned to search for the optimal setpoints of do concentration in the aerobic reactor the amount of sludge recycled from the membrane reactor to the stabilization reactor before the anaerobic reactor and the amount of external carbon dosage to the influent flow three operating variables manipulated by the marl algorithm were selected to guarantee the performance of the nitrification and denitrification processes four performance indices were evaluated for diurnal operation based on the suggested optimal setpoints the indices consisted of eqi aeration energy ae pumping energy pe and external carbon ec and were additionally considered as reward functions of the marl algorithms the procedure for training and application of the marls on the wwtp operation system is depicted as a pseudocode in fig 4 detailed descriptions of the marl structure and abbreviations in fig 4 are provided in supplementary materials c finally the marl based digital multi solution was evaluated by comparing with the manual operation system of the target wwtp and harmony search hs based operation system the details of the hs system are described in supplementary materials d the joint goals of marl include stability of the learning dynamics of the agents and their interconnection and adaption to the dynamic behavior of agents corresponding to new events in the environment 33 these two advantages of marl facilitate its application in wastewater treatment research because wwtps are complex to optimize owing to their high nonstationarity and variability it is necessary to employ a stable and adaptable optimization algorithm to optimize wastewater treatment processes 9 two marl algorithms qmix and g2anet have been employed to solve multi objective problems qmix is a value based marl algorithm that trains decentralized policies of agents in a centralized end to end fashion 25 g2anet interprets the relationship between agents based on game theory which uses hard and soft attention 26 both the algorithms showed superior performance in solving multi agent problems such as starcraft ii traffic junction and predator prey 25 26 detailed algorithms of qmix and g2anet are described in supplementary materials c and 25 26 2 3 1 manipulated operating variables and performance indices the digital multi solution manipulated three variables do concentration sludge recycling and external carbon dosage the importance of the manipulated variables in the context of effluent quality and operating energy efficiency is described below 2 16 34 36 do concentration is important for nutrient removal efficiency that relates to nitrification of ammonia nh4 to nitrate no3 in addition do is an indicator of energy consumption for the wastewater treatment process which consumes the most energy during the aeration process 34 thus adequate do setpoints should be optimized to maintain sufficient nitrification and prevent excessive aeration energy consumption 16 sludge recycling enhances denitrification by returning the formed nitrate under aerobic conditions to an anoxic zone 35 36 the nitrogen removal efficiency is determined by the amount of sludge recycling and if recycling is low or high the denitrification potential would decrease 27 35 the addition of an external carbon source is an effective method for enhancing denitrification of nitrate no3 in the flow to nitrogen gas n2 2 however excessive external carbon source dosage leads to an increase in the operational cost and requires subsequent removal 37 in this study the multiple operation system suggested diurnal setpoints for do concentration amount of sludge recycling and external carbon dosage for pairing the most influential manipulated variable with the improvement in pollutant removal efficiency and operational costs the details of the four indices are provided in supplementary materials e 2 3 2 structure of the marl algorithms the marl algorithms interfacing with the modeled wwtp were decided to maximize the reward values by improving environmental and economic efficiencies the interaction interface between marl with three agents and the wwtp was determined by considering the vectors of state observations actions and rewards the following are the descriptions of the detailed structure of marl algorithms 2 3 2 1 state and observations joint state s is utilized during centralized learning progresses and includes influent conditions such as time cod tn no3 nh4 total suspended solids tss and flow rates at the current and previous hours h and h 1 the influent conditions observed at h and h 1 reflect dynamic influent conditions the joint state vector facilitates agents to coordinate with each other and diminishes the complexity of the multi agent problem 38 in addition the three agents receive a vector of local observations depending on the target of the manipulated variables the first agent suggesting operational do setpoint concentration for the aerobic reactor received the vector including time time influent cod cod in influent tn tn in influent flow rates q in and ammonia concentration in the aerobic reactor nh aerobic because the agent considered the nitrification process occurring in the aerobic reactor based on dynamic influent conditions in addition ammonia removal depends on the do concentration during nitrification 2 therefore nh aerobic was also included the second agent suggested the optimal amount of external sludge recycled from the aerobic membrane reactor to the stabilizing reactor the do nitrate and ammonia concentrations in the anoxic reactor do anoxic no anoxic and nh anoxic respectively and the nitrate and ammonia concentrations in the membrane reactor no mem and nh mem respectively were included in the observation vector a low do anoxic is required in the anoxic reactor for denitrification no mem and nh mem are essential in the recycling processes because if a low nitrate concentration is recycled to the anoxic reactor it will decrease the denitrification performance in addition both no anoxic and nh anoxic are indicators of dentification performance 27 the third agent searching the amount of external carbon dosage used the observation vector including time cod in tn in q in and influent cod tn ratio c n in low carbon to nitrogen c n in conditions may require an external carbon source for fast and efficient denitrification compared to tn in lower cod in causes incomplete denitrification whereas a high dosage of external carbon increases the costs and requires subsequent removal 27 2 3 2 2 actions a discrete action set was computed for each agent the action set of the agent suggesting the do setpoints was 1 0 5 0 0 5 and 1 mg l for the do concentration the second agent s action set for the external sludge recycling determination was change of 0 2 0 1 0 0 1 and 0 2 when the external sludge recycling was 400 of the influent flow rate the external carbon dosage was determined by the third agent using the following action set for carbon flow rates change of 1 0 5 0 0 5 1 m3 d 2 3 2 3 rewards the reward function was defined based on the operational goal of the wwtp and rewarded to the marl algorithm for each action taken multi agents always attempt to maximize their rewards and produce an optimal policy over time however the improvement of environmental and economic operations led to a decrease in effluent pollutants and operating energy of the wwtp hence this study assigned a reward function that compared the extent of improvement of the suggested operational strategies with those of the manual operation system the performance of the operational systems j t was calculated using eq 1 and the reward value r t was computed using eq 2 1 j t Ï eqi eqi t Ï ae ae t Ï pe pe t Ï ec ec t 2 r t 5 j marl t j manual t 5 if r t 1 r t 1 where Ï denotes the weighting factor for each performance index Ï eqi 200 Ï ae 40 Ï pe 3 and Ï ec 1 determined by considering the unit s scale of each index a linear reward function was employed by selecting well known performance features of wastewater treatment operation processes 39 the linear combination of performance indices helps increase rl performance by reflecting the expert s policy 40 additionally a negative reward value was given when the suggested setpoints could not improve the operational performance compared with the manual operation system the negative reward value helps to avoid possible non optimal actions through marl algorithms 41 the structures of the marl based digital multi solution used to search for the optimal operational setpoints for the diurnal operation of the wwtp are summarized in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 clustering of influent condition scenarios adequate clustering of influent conditions is necessary to suggest optimal setpoints for the sustainable operation of wwtps under various influent conditions influent conditions were generated by the measured influent datasets which had composition ratios of 0 85 1 12 for influent cod and 0 84 1 07 for influent tn concentration fig 5 shows the results of the generated influent data and data clustered into three influent scenarios using the k means clustering algorithm first influent data were generated based on the measured composition ratios of influent cod and tn concentration the direct use of the digital multi solution approach on highly scattered data could increase the complexity of multi agent systems thus k means clustering was employed the cluster regions were automatically determined using the k means clustering algorithm which initially placed centroids randomly as shown in fig 5 a after some iterations of the calculation the cluster centroids were representatively selected for each cluster at appropriate distances from the datasets included in the clusters the k means clustering computed three clusters using the cod and tn composition ratios the three clusters represented high normal and low influent scenarios the centroid positions of the high normal and low influent scenarios were 1 12 1 16 1 01 0 90 and 0 8 0 92 respectively fig 5 b shows samples of the generated influent datasets for the diurnal duration the results of the generated cod concentrations were depicted in this study according to the influent scenario clusters each generated data point showed a different magnitude of pollutant concentration as well as a typical trend of variation that correspond to the timing of household activities additionally the noise incorporated into the influent data produced large variations in the generated data over time consequently the influent datasets generated based on the influent scenarios could reflect the diverse influent conditions and be employed to develop an optimal setpoint searching system under various influent conditions 3 2 comparisons of the training procedures of the marl algorithms fig 6 shows the average reward values of the two marls according to the training epochs the average reward values for every epoch are shown instead of reward values to compare the trends of increasing rewards in both marl algorithms to update and acquire the best policy to optimize the operating conditions of the wwtp 10 000 training epochs were used the generated influent scenarios i e high normal and low influent conditions were utilized in every training epoch for sustainable wastewater treatment operations both algorithms exhibited a converged reward value with respect to the number of epochs as shown in fig 6 a however qmix had some structural constraints fig 6 b which limited the accurate learning of action value functions for the non monotonic environment of wastewater treatment processes 42 this algorithm converged to the locally optimal point using an incorrect policy with epsilon decay exploration thus qmix only learned a suboptimal policy in which rewards were highly unstable despite their higher value the detailed reward values for g2anet are shown in fig 6 c the convergence stability of the g2anet algorithm was noticeably different this implies that g2anet was capable of handling the non monotonic and non stationary nature of the environment more accurately and searching for an optimal policy by well expressed action value functions although the acquired reward values for g2anet were lower than those for qmix g2anet achieved more stable reward trends despite the randomly provided influent conditions in every training procedure therefore it can be inferred that g2anet agents cooperate well to optimize and improve the wwtp operating system in terms of achieving environmental and economic goals under different influent circumstances moreover in qmix the agents learned to work together with limited coordination thus they did not actively try to optimize the process together and instead attempted to maximize the reward without coordination compared to the reward values from each training procedure shown in fig 6 b and c the g2anet algorithm was adequate for wastewater treatment processes consequently by factoring the tradeoff between highly efficient but unstable qmix and stable but less efficient g2anet this study selected g2anet to optimize the multi operational setpoints of the wwtp 3 3 multiple setpoints searching under influent condition scenarios the optimal setpoints of the three manipulated variables should maintain a qualitative performance under diverse influent conditions to identify optimal setpoints for process operation the performance of the proposed system was assessed under varying influent conditions according to the operational time fig 7 depicts the suggested operational setpoints by the g2anet algorithm under three influent conditions low normal and high influent scenarios based on cod and tn composition ratios the 20 simulation results under the three influent scenarios were plotted as representatives of the trend of the entire operational setpoint of the simulations influent scenarios which had three centroids 1 12 1 16 1 01 0 90 and 0 8 0 92 were provided to the g2anet algorithm and the trained g2anet searched for the operational setpoints on an hourly basis fig 7 a shows the digital multi solution using the g2anet algorithm under low influent conditions the optimal setpoints of do concentration in the aerobic reactor were notably lower than the manual do setpoint which was 4 mg l in this case 92 08 of do concentration values proposed by g2anet were lower than the manual do setpoint these results imply that less aeration energy would be consumed through the decreased operational setpoints compared to the manual aeration system additionally the optimal operational do setpoints had an explicit varying trend similar to the influent trends shown in fig 5 the searched do setpoints mainly increased around 10 am and 8 pm while decreasing at other times coinciding with the influent pollutant variations 43 the operating trajectories of the external recycle ratio and external carbon flow rates under the low influent scenario are shown in fig 7 a the setpoints of the external recycle ratio under low influent conditions did not differ from those of the normal and high influent conditions however the suggested external carbon flow rates under the low influent scenario were slightly lower than those in the other scenarios these results suggest that the g2anet based system focuses on decreasing excessive aeration energy rather pump energy or carbon dosage costs because aeration energy accounted for 50 of energy use in the wwtp operation processes of 44 fig 7 b shows the results of the operating setpoints under normal influent scenario under which 91 45 of optimal do setpoints were lower than the manual ones on the one hand external recycle ratios varied four times the influent flow rates on the other hand external carbon flow rates increased according to the trend of influent loads compared to the results of the low influent scenario the g2anet algorithm searched for higher operational trajectories of the do concentration and external carbon flow rates higher setpoints would strengthen both nitrification and denitrification to remove nutrients and increase the tn removal efficiency the optimal operational setpoints under the high influent scenario are shown in fig 7 c the g2anet algorithm suggested the highest setpoints for the high influent scenario compared with the other scenarios thus 88 33 of the suggested do values thus were lower than the manual do setpoint 4 mg l additionally do concentrations close to 6 mg l have been suggested for effective nitrification in aerobic reactors relatively higher values were suggested for the setpoints of external carbon flow rates while the external recycle ratios were similar to the low and normal influent scenarios it can be inferred that a higher do concentration in the recycle flow would diminish the effects of denitrification in the anoxic reactor thus the external recycle ratios did not increase significantly the g2anet algorithm suggested wider boundaries of the three operational setpoints corresponding to highly varied influent conditions see fig 5 the narrow width of operating trajectories could be a pitfall in operating wwtps because of the risk of instability in response to dramatically changed influent conditions and lead to unfavorable outcomes under abnormal events therefore the proposed system could be a solution for the economic and environmental operation of wwtps by searching global optimal points under various influent conditions 3 4 digital multi solution based operation for one day at a full scale wwtp fig 8 shows the optimal operational setpoints for a one day operation based on the proposed digital multi solution the g2anet based operation system computed a stable optimal do setpoint during the operational time all the do setpoints of the g2anet based system were lower than the manual setpoint which was 4 mg l as shown in fig 8 b in addition the optimal setpoints had an explicit varying trend that coincided with the variation in influent pollutants see fig 8 a and the suggested do setpoints increased during the daytime and decreased at other times on the one hand the setpoints of recycle ratio were maintained at 400 of influent flowrates with relatively low variations on the other hand g2anet increased the external carbon dose setpoints mainly with respect to variations in influent tn concentration it was inferred that the do setpoints were correlated to all influents to increase the nutrient removal efficiency and the external recycle ratio setpoints were related to tn to improve denitrification fig 8 c depicts the values of the pearson correlation coefficient between the influent concentrations and the g2anet based optimal setpoints the correlation values indicate that the digital multi solution determined the optimal method to operate the wwtp based on the dynamic influent conditions the performance of the g2anet based digital multi solution for one day operation in a full scale wwtp is depicted in fig 9 both environmental and economic objectives were targeted to operate the target wwtp g2anet based system reduced eqi by 15 86 compared with the manual operation system in particular the effluent tn concentration was significantly decreased by the improved nitrification and denitrification processes through the multiple setpoints including do recycle ratio and external carbon dose as depicted in fig 9 b since eqi is mainly formed by kjeldahl nitrogen and nitrate with the higher weighting factors as expressed in supplementary materials e the higher factors indicate that they significantly impact receiving water quality 45 additionally from an economic aspect fig 9 a aeration energy was improved by 22 55 when the optimal do setpoints were applied to the aeration system the pumping energy was slightly improved by 0 63 thus the proposed system could be helpful for operations that consider operating expenditures these results indicate that the developed g2anet based digital multi solution system not only decreases the operating energy but also improves the main objective of the wwtp to treat wastewater effectively hence the g2anet based system could be a digital and informatics system for the multi operation process of a full scale wwtp 3 5 application of the digital multi solution during long term operation the performance of the g2anet algorithm for searching optimal multi setpoints was additionally evaluated by applying the influent conditions in february and july when the influent had the highest and the lowest conditions respectively it was observed that february had the highest influent composition ratio for cod and tn as 1 13 1 04 and july was the lowest influent condition month when the cod and tn composition ratio was 0 76 0 89 this showed clear seasonal fluctuations that influent concentration was increased during winter and relatively low during summer because of the dilution effect of heavy rainfall 46 therefore this study employed the influent conditions in february and july that respectively represented the worst and the best influent condition scenario fig 10 depicts the optimized performance of the g2anet based operation strategy in february the influent conditions in february had a cod of over 600 mg l and tn exceeding the average concentration of 46 mg l as shown in fig 10 a in addition the concentrations of both influent pollutants changed over time therefore it was necessary to determine the optimal operating conditions corresponding to the various influent conditions fig 10 b shows the optimal setpoints for february the do concentration external recycle ratio and external carbon flow rates the average suggested do concentration was 2 30 mg l which was 42 5 less than that of the manual do setpoint 4 mg l on the one hand the external recycle ratios were searched according to the fluctuating influent conditions the average value was 4 04 which was close to the manual operation system setpoint of 4 however the doses of external carbon were increased to 1 53 m3 d on average to strengthen denitrification in the wwtp the influent cod tn ratio was 8 48 which could be due to the deterioration of nitrogen removal performance 47 48 although the manual operation system did not add external carbon the g2anet agents optimized the dosage within a certain range to improve nitrogen removal the performance indices including eqi ae pe and ec are presented in fig 10 c the performance indices were computed using the suggested digital multi solution depicted in fig 10 b and compared with the manual operation system the three agents optimized operational setpoints to decrease eqi under various influent conditions thus the values of eqi were reduced by 5 61 compared to the manual system these results suggest that the decreased do setpoints reduced effluent nitrate by preventing excessive nitrification and the suggested recycle ratio and external carbon dosage maintained an effective denitrification process aeration energy was effectively diminished by 28 44 owing to the decreased do setpoints whereas pumping energy was slightly increased by 1 01 the environmental benefits of g2anet based solutions are shown in fig 10 d the dashed lines indicate the effluent quality limits set by the korean ministry of environment the effluent limits for codcr and tn are 52 and 20 mg l respectively with three hour average values 23 49 both the effluent cod concentrations by the manual and digital multi solution methods sufficiently satisfied the effluent quality standards however the manual system could be limited in satisfying the effluent standard of tn because 18 values of effluent tn concentrations exceeded the standard 20 mg l from 40 to 50 days and 52 to 58 days although the effluent limits were invoked with three hour average values the manual system discharged effluents exceeding 20 mg l tn four times as shown by the red circle in fig 10 d the manual system requires additional biological or chemical treatments to decrease effluent tn concentrations and a real time robust monitoring system additional treatments can increase operating costs in contrast the proposed g2anet based system effectively decreased the effluent tn concentration and satisfied the limit the three interconnected agents of g2anet cooperated to render the wwtp environmentally and economically viable despite the extremely high influent conditions a quantitative evaluation of the proposed system is presented in table 2 the influent concentrations in july were similar to or lower than the average influent concentrations of 396 mg l for cod and 46 mg l for tn as shown in fig 11 a thus an adaptable solution can be suggested by trading off economic and environmental benefits the optimized setpoints of the g2anet based autonomous system in july are shown in fig 11 b the setpoints of do concentration in the aerobic reactor were effectively decreased by 49 3 with an average do concentration of 2 03 mg l compared with the do setpoints in february the proposed system further diminished the do concentration by 6 8 in july there are two reasons for the lower setpoints in july 1 lower inflow conditions and 2 better growth of microbial communities at higher temperatures therefore the g2anet based autonomous system suggested lower do setpoints during the warmer season the average external recycle ratio was 4 02 which was similar to the setpoint of the manual operation system compared with the results in february the external recycle ratios decreased slightly this means that the nutrient removal efficiencies could be satisfied with the lower operational setpoints in july for the aforementioned reasons the average external carbon dosage increased to 1 54 m3 d which was slightly higher than that in february the influent cod tn ratio in july was 8 42 which was smaller than that in february thus higher amount of external carbon is required to increase the nitrogen removal performance the performance of the g2anet based autonomous system in july is shown in fig 11 c the eqi values were decreased by 11 11 compared with the manual system through the optimized operational setpoints by the g2anet the improvement in effluent quality was higher in july because of improved nitrogen removal during the warmer season temperature is critical for microbial growth and affects nitrification denitrification therefore effluent quality could be improved with fewer setpoints of manipulated values 27 the optimized do setpoints reduced the aeration energy by 30 84 and increased the pumping energy by 0 43 the environmental improvements in the autonomous system are shown in fig 11 d the effluent cod complied with the legal discharge limit and was maintained at below 52 mg l the manual operation system discharged an effluent tn concentration exceeding the limits by four times on 187 202 and 205 days the manual system could satisfy the effluent limits by considering three hour average values however it would be risky to operate under varying influent conditions in the future from the perspective of environmental operation the suggested g2anet based autonomous system could be a solution to meet the effluent quality limits safely as shown by the red circle in fig 11 d g2anet effectively improved the wwtp operation system by achieving economic and environmental benefits a comprehensive summary of the performance improvement is presented in table 2 the g2anet based digital multi solution improved the effluent quality under both high and low influent conditions by comparing with the manual and hs based system as shown in fig 12 table 3 summarizes the quantitative performance improvements achieved by the g2anet based operation system in february july and the entire year the suggested system had the ability to satisfy the effluent quality limits and improve the effluent quality by 6 97 under various influent conditions during the one year operation in addition the overall aeration energy for the entire year was significantly decreased by 24 80 while pumping energy was slightly increased by 1 06 on the other hand the hs based system improved the effluent quality by 6 43 and aeration energy was decreased by 9 63 by its heuristic algorithm however it could not ensure effluent quality at the high influent conditions in february as summarized in table 3 it is interpreted that the hs algorithm was limited to suggest multi solution by searching hidden interactions between the manipulated variables therefore the hs based system provided the biased solution to improve aeration energy while deteriorating effluent quality compared to the hs based system the g2anet based digital multi solution provided stable and adaptable solutions under various influent conditions as shown in fig 12 and table 3 the suggested autonomous operation strategy system using g2anet could save 4 805 105 kwh over one year of operation at a price of 0 075 kwh supplied by the korea electric power corporation the g2anet based autonomous system can save 36 039 annually the costs of external carbon dosage were not included in the performance evaluation because of the irregular use of external carbon at the target plant this study estimated the external carbon source to be a readily biodegradable substrate based on the findings of 39 the present study can be extended to an optimization system while regulating other variables such as methanol based external carbon and do concentrations in the membrane reactor for energy and fouling mitigation consequently the g2anet based autonomous system can contribute to safely maintaining water quality and energy conservation under dynamic and varying influent conditions in addition this study showed the potential to be extended to a more complex operation system by considering centralized learning decentralized execution agents to optimize the manipulating variables under various influent conditions 3 6 total analysis considering environmental economic social aspects of the digital multi solution the g2anet based operation system digital multi solution the hs based system and the manual operation system were analyzed from the nexus of environmental economic and social perspectives the detailed descriptions of analyzing the environmental economic and social nexus are presented in supplementary materials f table 4 summarizes the performance of the digital multi solution the values of improvements in table 4 were computed based on table f 1 which summarized environmental economic social nexus indicator values as described in section 3 5 the g2anet based operation system improved the environmental economic social performance whereas the manual system consumed high energy and discharged high effluent pollutants the digital multi solution effectively decreased the effluent concentration by 6 97 and robustly provided sustainable and safe wwtp operation under various influent conditions while satisfying the effluent discharge limits therefore the digital multi solution improved social indicators including pollutant discharge and risk occurrence ratios by 10 07 additionally the optimization of the wwtp process should fulfill its operational objectives while consuming the least resources possible in this context decreasing aeration energy is an effective solution to save operating costs thus the digital multi solution would be an environmental economi social solution to maintain treatment efficiency and strengthen energy saving potential in addition the suggested optimal operation system uses the marl structure with a digital twin of the full scale wwtp which would make reliable predictions of the future state of the physical wwtp system 24 therefore this study can be implemented to other treatment plants that require operational decisions the results demonstrate that the g2anet based digital multi solution has the potential to effectively contribute to the development of smart operation systems for wwtps that reduce energy consumption while protecting the environment 4 conclusions and future work a digital multi solution was proposed to implement cost effectiveness energy reduction and optimize the environmental operation of wwtps one of the main contributions of this study is that the optimal operational setpoints were provided by the g2anet algorithm under various influent conditions to develop a stable and adaptable operational strategy influent conditions considering low normal and high cod and tn composition ratios were generated and clustered into three scenarios based on the k means clustering algorithm high tech g2anet reinforcement learning was employed to suggest the optimal setpoints for do external sludge recycling and external carbon dose through its three cooperative agents the results of the g2anet based digital multi solution showed that the setpoints were suitable for improving the performance of the target wwtp and outperformed under various influent conditions the augmented newly measured one year influent case showed that the g2anet based autonomous system can adaptively deal with new influent conditions by improving the aeration energy by 24 80 and the effluent quality by 6 97 while maintaining similar pumping energy under various cod tn composition ratios of the dynamic influent consequently the g2anet based digital multi solution represents an innovative contribution to the smart operation of wwtp operation systems owing to its stability and adaptability in a digitalized hydraulic study area this research can be extended to a digital multi solution to improve the economic environmental and social operation of real wwtps while treating other water pollutants such as phosphorus toxic organic compounds and nanoparticles because of open source data this study has limitations on the other water pollutants despite using the digital twin however this study optimized multiple operation variables by considering crucial effluent loads nonstationary and varying influent conditions and inherent complex interactions between manipulated variables therefore it is expected that access to complete influent and effluent data sets would be granted then future research would serve as an operational guideline for real plant operators by suggesting reliable and stable multi solutions in dynamic and complex wastewater environments declaration of competing

12563,optimal operating systems have been widely employed to improve the economic and environmental performance of wastewater treatment plants wwtps for efficiently treating discharged water pollutants however the multi optimization approach applied to wwtps has been inadequate resulting in a low optimization performance owing to varying influent conditions and inherent complex interactions between manipulated variables therefore this study developed a digital multi solution for optimal operation of a wwtp based on multi agent reinforcement learning dynamic influent conditions with low normal and high influent chemical oxygen demands and total nitrogen composition ratios were generated using a k means clustering algorithm to accurately reflect operating conditions a game abstraction method based on a two stage attention network g2anet algorithm was employed to simultaneously search for three operational setpoints dissolved oxygen external sludge recycling and external carbon dose the adaptability of the g2anet based digital multi solution for determining setpoints was evaluated by employing newly measured one year influent data the results demonstrated the ability of an intelligent g2anet based digital multi solution in identifying optimal setpoints to improve the performance of wwtps and outperform manual operating systems under varying influent conditions it reduced aeration energy by 25 and improved effluent quality by 7 while maintaining a similar pumping energy the g2anet based digital multi solution can innovatively

anthropogenic water pollution 1 effluent discharge standards and regulations have become stricter worldwide to protect the environment 2 thus recent advances in the field of wastewater treatment aim to provide operational energy cost effectiveness and desired effluent quality 3 from the perspective of energy reduction and environmental protection process optimization of wwtps is an appealing strategy that has recently received attention process optimization suggests the two main objectives of wwtps satisfying the effluent discharge limit and minimizing the operating cost 4 however determining the optimal solutions for wwtps is a challenging task optimization should simultaneously achieve all wwtp objectives that are decisive for process operation and management the primary goal of wwtps is environmental treatment however energy consumption is significant for economic performance 5 therefore environmental and economic performance should be considered as dual or multi objective functions in the optimal solution for wwtps and their interconnection mechanisms should be considered in optimization approaches for tradeoff problems another fundamental issue with process optimization is the complex system of wwtps that exhibits nonlinear characteristics with respect to biological chemical physical mechanisms dynamic and nonlinear influent conditions could hinder the stable operation of wwtps 6 7 influent components such as chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tn exhibit distinct nonlinearity because the concentrations of components have a wide range of standard deviations and skewed distributions 8 therefore a robust optimization solution should be thoroughly considered for the nonlinear and complex properties of wwtps 9 table 1 summarizes the process optimization systems for wwtps the systems are used for dual and multi objective optimization using mathematical model based stochastic and heuristic approaches the optimization systems are employed and evaluated for each target system which is described by wwtp models activated sludge model asm 5 9 12 and benchmark simulation model bsm 13 16 mathematical models 17 or experiments 18 19 asm series and their extended models are useful tools for identifying real wwtps and bsm is the standard model to validate optimization and control strategy under the formal criteria 13 although mathematical algorithms show noteworthy optimization performances for environmental or economic improvements they require nonlinear differential and algebraic equations thus they can be limited in considering the uncertainties while solving optimization problems 9 hence artificial intelligence ai based optimization systems have garnered increased attention because of their robustness flexibility and high performance however recent studies have reported that ai solves only one or two variables without considering multi agent assignment problems it is difficult for ai agents to compute their contribution toward solving a problem in a collaborative environment 20 consequently multi agent reinforcement learning marl is necessary to solve multi objective optimization problems of wwtp operations while maximizing task completion based on self learning and effective coordination multi objective optimizations have been conducted for environmental and economic improvements operational setpoints such as effluent pollutant concentration and dissolved oxygen do concentration were decided for controllers 2 21 however the abrupt influent change could deteriorate the fixed setpoints performances there are some successful efforts to optimize wwtps by proposing influent varying setpoints 22 23 despite their performances mathematical and heuristic based optimization algorithm could be limited to solving highly uncertain optimization problems consequently multi objective optimizations that consider solving the high dimensional and nonlinear problems of wwtps have not been conducted thus far owing to the inherent interaction between operating variables under dynamic nonlinear influent conditions this study developed a new digitalized solution for the operation systems by using marl for sustainable operation of wwtps this study proposes a collaborative smart decision with a high tech ai algorithm to address multiple optimizations of operating systems as shown in fig 1 the ai algorithm considered the interactions of multiple operating variables under dynamic influent conditions for optimum operation of the wwtp this was accomplished using a digital system involving data analysis a digital twin and multi agent optimization steps the digital twin reflected the dynamic and complex wwtp mechanisms to include key features of a real wwtp system depending on the purpose of the multi objective optimization 24 the core technique of the digital system and its solution was marl which incorporates ai agents to suggest optimized collaborative actions for wwtps with their smart decisions the environmental and economic improvements i e effluent quality and operating costs were evaluated and compared to the manual operation system the methodology incorporates digitalized approaches to system improvement under a variety of influent conditions the present system would be well suited for low normal and high influent concentrations by employing the stable and adaptable structure of marl 2 material and methods fig 2 graphically depicts the proposed framework used to search for a digital solution that can implement the multi objective optimization of wwtp operations big data including influent effluent and operating conditions were collected by telemonitoring systems from a full scale wwtp over eight years as shown in fig 2 a as shown in fig 2 b a data analysis was conducted to extract the diurnal and seasonal trends of the collected influent data to determine the dynamic characteristics fig 2 c shows the generation of an influent scenario involving high normal and low influent loadings for cod and tn concentration based on the data analysis diurnal variations of the collected influent datasets were utilized to generate influent datasets the diurnal influent datasets provided diverse influent scenarios which were applied to marl algorithms fig 2 d shows the structure of the marls utilized to design a digital multi solution for the operation system of the wwtp while considering the influent conditions this study used two marl algorithms qmix and a game abstraction method based on a two stage attention network g2anet to suggest collaborative solutions 25 26 fig 2 e shows the training of marl for multi objective optimization of the wwtp operation based on the influent scenarios and the determined structures of the marls the training of the marls was iteratively conducted until conditions such as sufficient training epochs and training completion were satisfied the training stage shows the converged reward values of marls to certain maximum values by considering the effluent quality index eqi and consumed energy the trained marl was employed to search for a digital multi solution for the wwtp operation as depicted in fig 2 f the marl algorithm automatically searched for setpoints including external carbon dosage external recycle flow rates and dissolved oxygen do concentration finally the marl based digital multi solution was evaluated on a daily basis for effluent quality energy and operating costs and compared with the manual operation system of the target wwtp and heuristic optimization system 2 1 current operation system of the target wastewater treatment plant fig 3 shows the configuration and operational characteristics of the target wwtp the treatment process included biological treatment and sludge filtration using the five sequential reactors the plant reduced footprints and waste sludge by replacing the clarifier with a membrane reactor mbr fig 3 shows the influent conditions in the target wwtp over eight years according to the configuration operating condition and influent digital twin of the target wwtp was modeled as described in supplementary materials a in addition uncertainty analysis was conducted to ensure the precision of the digital twin details of uncertainty analysis and its results are provided in supplementary materials a the measured influent components were positively skewed the tails of influent pollutant distribution diverged from normality thus representing nonlinearity 8 this indicated that the influent was nonstationary making it harder to optimize the treatment process under dynamic conditions the main problem of the wwtp was the use of fixed setpoints without considering the dynamic influent characteristics and interconnections between the setpoints which can require excessive energy and costs and result in insufficient effluent quality therefore a digital multi solution to simultaneously determine multiple setpoints was required to save energy and maintain effluent quality 2 2 influent scenario generation for a multi agent optimization algorithm carbon and nitrogen loadings are crucial influencing factors in wastewater treatment processes variations in the influents can affect the pollutant removal efficiency and operational energy of wastewater treatment 27 in addition optimization of wastewater treatment without considering dynamic influents cannot ensure sufficient accuracy or improve the wwtp performance 28 29 this study generated influent datasets from the measured influent data to manage the dynamic and nonstationary influent conditions for feasible process optimization and reflect the inherent natural variability of pollutant concentrations as shown in fig 2 c three influent scenarios were defined according to the c n ratio by using k means clustering k means clustering can distinguish one cluster from the other clusters regarding influent similarity 30 31 based on the measured datasets and their characteristics influent scenario data sets were generated by considering the influent similarity of the c n ratio which was represented by cluster s centroids of three influent scenarios then hourly influent datasets were generated using cluster centroids of the c n ratio and diurnal trends of influent pollutants gaussian noise was added to the generated hourly datasets to include uncertainty over the time series influent data 32 providing all operating setpoints for each type of influent condition is unrealistic and increases the dimensions of optimization problems and computation time 22 therefore influent scenarios based on varying cod and tn were suggested to optimize the target plant based on complex influent conditions detailed descriptions of influent scenario generation and its algorithms are provided in supplementary materials b 2 3 a digital multi solution for process optimization using a marl algorithm the marl based digital multi solution was designed to determine optimal setpoints for the adjustable operational variables of the target wwtp as shown in fig 4 the major contribution of the digital multi solution was the environment friendly and cost effective maintenance of the plant with diverse influent conditions thus the suggested optimal system which incorporates influent scenario clustering using the k means algorithm reflects various realistic influent conditions the marl algorithm agents suggest each optimal setpoint and interact with each other to share the process information of the target plant three agents were assigned to search for the optimal setpoints of do concentration in the aerobic reactor the amount of sludge recycled from the membrane reactor to the stabilization reactor before the anaerobic reactor and the amount of external carbon dosage to the influent flow three operating variables manipulated by the marl algorithm were selected to guarantee the performance of the nitrification and denitrification processes four performance indices were evaluated for diurnal operation based on the suggested optimal setpoints the indices consisted of eqi aeration energy ae pumping energy pe and external carbon ec and were additionally considered as reward functions of the marl algorithms the procedure for training and application of the marls on the wwtp operation system is depicted as a pseudocode in fig 4 detailed descriptions of the marl structure and abbreviations in fig 4 are provided in supplementary materials c finally the marl based digital multi solution was evaluated by comparing with the manual operation system of the target wwtp and harmony search hs based operation system the details of the hs system are described in supplementary materials d the joint goals of marl include stability of the learning dynamics of the agents and their interconnection and adaption to the dynamic behavior of agents corresponding to new events in the environment 33 these two advantages of marl facilitate its application in wastewater treatment research because wwtps are complex to optimize owing to their high nonstationarity and variability it is necessary to employ a stable and adaptable optimization algorithm to optimize wastewater treatment processes 9 two marl algorithms qmix and g2anet have been employed to solve multi objective problems qmix is a value based marl algorithm that trains decentralized policies of agents in a centralized end to end fashion 25 g2anet interprets the relationship between agents based on game theory which uses hard and soft attention 26 both the algorithms showed superior performance in solving multi agent problems such as starcraft ii traffic junction and predator prey 25 26 detailed algorithms of qmix and g2anet are described in supplementary materials c and 25 26 2 3 1 manipulated operating variables and performance indices the digital multi solution manipulated three variables do concentration sludge recycling and external carbon dosage the importance of the manipulated variables in the context of effluent quality and operating energy efficiency is described below 2 16 34 36 do concentration is important for nutrient removal efficiency that relates to nitrification of ammonia nh4 to nitrate no3 in addition do is an indicator of energy consumption for the wastewater treatment process which consumes the most energy during the aeration process 34 thus adequate do setpoints should be optimized to maintain sufficient nitrification and prevent excessive aeration energy consumption 16 sludge recycling enhances denitrification by returning the formed nitrate under aerobic conditions to an anoxic zone 35 36 the nitrogen removal efficiency is determined by the amount of sludge recycling and if recycling is low or high the denitrification potential would decrease 27 35 the addition of an external carbon source is an effective method for enhancing denitrification of nitrate no3 in the flow to nitrogen gas n2 2 however excessive external carbon source dosage leads to an increase in the operational cost and requires subsequent removal 37 in this study the multiple operation system suggested diurnal setpoints for do concentration amount of sludge recycling and external carbon dosage for pairing the most influential manipulated variable with the improvement in pollutant removal efficiency and operational costs the details of the four indices are provided in supplementary materials e 2 3 2 structure of the marl algorithms the marl algorithms interfacing with the modeled wwtp were decided to maximize the reward values by improving environmental and economic efficiencies the interaction interface between marl with three agents and the wwtp was determined by considering the vectors of state observations actions and rewards the following are the descriptions of the detailed structure of marl algorithms 2 3 2 1 state and observations joint state s is utilized during centralized learning progresses and includes influent conditions such as time cod tn no3 nh4 total suspended solids tss and flow rates at the current and previous hours h and h 1 the influent conditions observed at h and h 1 reflect dynamic influent conditions the joint state vector facilitates agents to coordinate with each other and diminishes the complexity of the multi agent problem 38 in addition the three agents receive a vector of local observations depending on the target of the manipulated variables the first agent suggesting operational do setpoint concentration for the aerobic reactor received the vector including time time influent cod cod in influent tn tn in influent flow rates q in and ammonia concentration in the aerobic reactor nh aerobic because the agent considered the nitrification process occurring in the aerobic reactor based on dynamic influent conditions in addition ammonia removal depends on the do concentration during nitrification 2 therefore nh aerobic was also included the second agent suggested the optimal amount of external sludge recycled from the aerobic membrane reactor to the stabilizing reactor the do nitrate and ammonia concentrations in the anoxic reactor do anoxic no anoxic and nh anoxic respectively and the nitrate and ammonia concentrations in the membrane reactor no mem and nh mem respectively were included in the observation vector a low do anoxic is required in the anoxic reactor for denitrification no mem and nh mem are essential in the recycling processes because if a low nitrate concentration is recycled to the anoxic reactor it will decrease the denitrification performance in addition both no anoxic and nh anoxic are indicators of dentification performance 27 the third agent searching the amount of external carbon dosage used the observation vector including time cod in tn in q in and influent cod tn ratio c n in low carbon to nitrogen c n in conditions may require an external carbon source for fast and efficient denitrification compared to tn in lower cod in causes incomplete denitrification whereas a high dosage of external carbon increases the costs and requires subsequent removal 27 2 3 2 2 actions a discrete action set was computed for each agent the action set of the agent suggesting the do setpoints was 1 0 5 0 0 5 and 1 mg l for the do concentration the second agent s action set for the external sludge recycling determination was change of 0 2 0 1 0 0 1 and 0 2 when the external sludge recycling was 400 of the influent flow rate the external carbon dosage was determined by the third agent using the following action set for carbon flow rates change of 1 0 5 0 0 5 1 m3 d 2 3 2 3 rewards the reward function was defined based on the operational goal of the wwtp and rewarded to the marl algorithm for each action taken multi agents always attempt to maximize their rewards and produce an optimal policy over time however the improvement of environmental and economic operations led to a decrease in effluent pollutants and operating energy of the wwtp hence this study assigned a reward function that compared the extent of improvement of the suggested operational strategies with those of the manual operation system the performance of the operational systems j t was calculated using eq 1 and the reward value r t was computed using eq 2 1 j t Ï eqi eqi t Ï ae ae t Ï pe pe t Ï ec ec t 2 r t 5 j marl t j manual t 5 if r t 1 r t 1 where Ï denotes the weighting factor for each performance index Ï eqi 200 Ï ae 40 Ï pe 3 and Ï ec 1 determined by considering the unit s scale of each index a linear reward function was employed by selecting well known performance features of wastewater treatment operation processes 39 the linear combination of performance indices helps increase rl performance by reflecting the expert s policy 40 additionally a negative reward value was given when the suggested setpoints could not improve the operational performance compared with the manual operation system the negative reward value helps to avoid possible non optimal actions through marl algorithms 41 the structures of the marl based digital multi solution used to search for the optimal operational setpoints for the diurnal operation of the wwtp are summarized in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 clustering of influent condition scenarios adequate clustering of influent conditions is necessary to suggest optimal setpoints for the sustainable operation of wwtps under various influent conditions influent conditions were generated by the measured influent datasets which had composition ratios of 0 85 1 12 for influent cod and 0 84 1 07 for influent tn concentration fig 5 shows the results of the generated influent data and data clustered into three influent scenarios using the k means clustering algorithm first influent data were generated based on the measured composition ratios of influent cod and tn concentration the direct use of the digital multi solution approach on highly scattered data could increase the complexity of multi agent systems thus k means clustering was employed the cluster regions were automatically determined using the k means clustering algorithm which initially placed centroids randomly as shown in fig 5 a after some iterations of the calculation the cluster centroids were representatively selected for each cluster at appropriate distances from the datasets included in the clusters the k means clustering computed three clusters using the cod and tn composition ratios the three clusters represented high normal and low influent scenarios the centroid positions of the high normal and low influent scenarios were 1 12 1 16 1 01 0 90 and 0 8 0 92 respectively fig 5 b shows samples of the generated influent datasets for the diurnal duration the results of the generated cod concentrations were depicted in this study according to the influent scenario clusters each generated data point showed a different magnitude of pollutant concentration as well as a typical trend of variation that correspond to the timing of household activities additionally the noise incorporated into the influent data produced large variations in the generated data over time consequently the influent datasets generated based on the influent scenarios could reflect the diverse influent conditions and be employed to develop an optimal setpoint searching system under various influent conditions 3 2 comparisons of the training procedures of the marl algorithms fig 6 shows the average reward values of the two marls according to the training epochs the average reward values for every epoch are shown instead of reward values to compare the trends of increasing rewards in both marl algorithms to update and acquire the best policy to optimize the operating conditions of the wwtp 10 000 training epochs were used the generated influent scenarios i e high normal and low influent conditions were utilized in every training epoch for sustainable wastewater treatment operations both algorithms exhibited a converged reward value with respect to the number of epochs as shown in fig 6 a however qmix had some structural constraints fig 6 b which limited the accurate learning of action value functions for the non monotonic environment of wastewater treatment processes 42 this algorithm converged to the locally optimal point using an incorrect policy with epsilon decay exploration thus qmix only learned a suboptimal policy in which rewards were highly unstable despite their higher value the detailed reward values for g2anet are shown in fig 6 c the convergence stability of the g2anet algorithm was noticeably different this implies that g2anet was capable of handling the non monotonic and non stationary nature of the environment more accurately and searching for an optimal policy by well expressed action value functions although the acquired reward values for g2anet were lower than those for qmix g2anet achieved more stable reward trends despite the randomly provided influent conditions in every training procedure therefore it can be inferred that g2anet agents cooperate well to optimize and improve the wwtp operating system in terms of achieving environmental and economic goals under different influent circumstances moreover in qmix the agents learned to work together with limited coordination thus they did not actively try to optimize the process together and instead attempted to maximize the reward without coordination compared to the reward values from each training procedure shown in fig 6 b and c the g2anet algorithm was adequate for wastewater treatment processes consequently by factoring the tradeoff between highly efficient but unstable qmix and stable but less efficient g2anet this study selected g2anet to optimize the multi operational setpoints of the wwtp 3 3 multiple setpoints searching under influent condition scenarios the optimal setpoints of the three manipulated variables should maintain a qualitative performance under diverse influent conditions to identify optimal setpoints for process operation the performance of the proposed system was assessed under varying influent conditions according to the operational time fig 7 depicts the suggested operational setpoints by the g2anet algorithm under three influent conditions low normal and high influent scenarios based on cod and tn composition ratios the 20 simulation results under the three influent scenarios were plotted as representatives of the trend of the entire operational setpoint of the simulations influent scenarios which had three centroids 1 12 1 16 1 01 0 90 and 0 8 0 92 were provided to the g2anet algorithm and the trained g2anet searched for the operational setpoints on an hourly basis fig 7 a shows the digital multi solution using the g2anet algorithm under low influent conditions the optimal setpoints of do concentration in the aerobic reactor were notably lower than the manual do setpoint which was 4 mg l in this case 92 08 of do concentration values proposed by g2anet were lower than the manual do setpoint these results imply that less aeration energy would be consumed through the decreased operational setpoints compared to the manual aeration system additionally the optimal operational do setpoints had an explicit varying trend similar to the influent trends shown in fig 5 the searched do setpoints mainly increased around 10 am and 8 pm while decreasing at other times coinciding with the influent pollutant variations 43 the operating trajectories of the external recycle ratio and external carbon flow rates under the low influent scenario are shown in fig 7 a the setpoints of the external recycle ratio under low influent conditions did not differ from those of the normal and high influent conditions however the suggested external carbon flow rates under the low influent scenario were slightly lower than those in the other scenarios these results suggest that the g2anet based system focuses on decreasing excessive aeration energy rather pump energy or carbon dosage costs because aeration energy accounted for 50 of energy use in the wwtp operation processes of 44 fig 7 b shows the results of the operating setpoints under normal influent scenario under which 91 45 of optimal do setpoints were lower than the manual ones on the one hand external recycle ratios varied four times the influent flow rates on the other hand external carbon flow rates increased according to the trend of influent loads compared to the results of the low influent scenario the g2anet algorithm searched for higher operational trajectories of the do concentration and external carbon flow rates higher setpoints would strengthen both nitrification and denitrification to remove nutrients and increase the tn removal efficiency the optimal operational setpoints under the high influent scenario are shown in fig 7 c the g2anet algorithm suggested the highest setpoints for the high influent scenario compared with the other scenarios thus 88 33 of the suggested do values thus were lower than the manual do setpoint 4 mg l additionally do concentrations close to 6 mg l have been suggested for effective nitrification in aerobic reactors relatively higher values were suggested for the setpoints of external carbon flow rates while the external recycle ratios were similar to the low and normal influent scenarios it can be inferred that a higher do concentration in the recycle flow would diminish the effects of denitrification in the anoxic reactor thus the external recycle ratios did not increase significantly the g2anet algorithm suggested wider boundaries of the three operational setpoints corresponding to highly varied influent conditions see fig 5 the narrow width of operating trajectories could be a pitfall in operating wwtps because of the risk of instability in response to dramatically changed influent conditions and lead to unfavorable outcomes under abnormal events therefore the proposed system could be a solution for the economic and environmental operation of wwtps by searching global optimal points under various influent conditions 3 4 digital multi solution based operation for one day at a full scale wwtp fig 8 shows the optimal operational setpoints for a one day operation based on the proposed digital multi solution the g2anet based operation system computed a stable optimal do setpoint during the operational time all the do setpoints of the g2anet based system were lower than the manual setpoint which was 4 mg l as shown in fig 8 b in addition the optimal setpoints had an explicit varying trend that coincided with the variation in influent pollutants see fig 8 a and the suggested do setpoints increased during the daytime and decreased at other times on the one hand the setpoints of recycle ratio were maintained at 400 of influent flowrates with relatively low variations on the other hand g2anet increased the external carbon dose setpoints mainly with respect to variations in influent tn concentration it was inferred that the do setpoints were correlated to all influents to increase the nutrient removal efficiency and the external recycle ratio setpoints were related to tn to improve denitrification fig 8 c depicts the values of the pearson correlation coefficient between the influent concentrations and the g2anet based optimal setpoints the correlation values indicate that the digital multi solution determined the optimal method to operate the wwtp based on the dynamic influent conditions the performance of the g2anet based digital multi solution for one day operation in a full scale wwtp is depicted in fig 9 both environmental and economic objectives were targeted to operate the target wwtp g2anet based system reduced eqi by 15 86 compared with the manual operation system in particular the effluent tn concentration was significantly decreased by the improved nitrification and denitrification processes through the multiple setpoints including do recycle ratio and external carbon dose as depicted in fig 9 b since eqi is mainly formed by kjeldahl nitrogen and nitrate with the higher weighting factors as expressed in supplementary materials e the higher factors indicate that they significantly impact receiving water quality 45 additionally from an economic aspect fig 9 a aeration energy was improved by 22 55 when the optimal do setpoints were applied to the aeration system the pumping energy was slightly improved by 0 63 thus the proposed system could be helpful for operations that consider operating expenditures these results indicate that the developed g2anet based digital multi solution system not only decreases the operating energy but also improves the main objective of the wwtp to treat wastewater effectively hence the g2anet based system could be a digital and informatics system for the multi operation process of a full scale wwtp 3 5 application of the digital multi solution during long term operation the performance of the g2anet algorithm for searching optimal multi setpoints was additionally evaluated by applying the influent conditions in february and july when the influent had the highest and the lowest conditions respectively it was observed that february had the highest influent composition ratio for cod and tn as 1 13 1 04 and july was the lowest influent condition month when the cod and tn composition ratio was 0 76 0 89 this showed clear seasonal fluctuations that influent concentration was increased during winter and relatively low during summer because of the dilution effect of heavy rainfall 46 therefore this study employed the influent conditions in february and july that respectively represented the worst and the best influent condition scenario fig 10 depicts the optimized performance of the g2anet based operation strategy in february the influent conditions in february had a cod of over 600 mg l and tn exceeding the average concentration of 46 mg l as shown in fig 10 a in addition the concentrations of both influent pollutants changed over time therefore it was necessary to determine the optimal operating conditions corresponding to the various influent conditions fig 10 b shows the optimal setpoints for february the do concentration external recycle ratio and external carbon flow rates the average suggested do concentration was 2 30 mg l which was 42 5 less than that of the manual do setpoint 4 mg l on the one hand the external recycle ratios were searched according to the fluctuating influent conditions the average value was 4 04 which was close to the manual operation system setpoint of 4 however the doses of external carbon were increased to 1 53 m3 d on average to strengthen denitrification in the wwtp the influent cod tn ratio was 8 48 which could be due to the deterioration of nitrogen removal performance 47 48 although the manual operation system did not add external carbon the g2anet agents optimized the dosage within a certain range to improve nitrogen removal the performance indices including eqi ae pe and ec are presented in fig 10 c the performance indices were computed using the suggested digital multi solution depicted in fig 10 b and compared with the manual operation system the three agents optimized operational setpoints to decrease eqi under various influent conditions thus the values of eqi were reduced by 5 61 compared to the manual system these results suggest that the decreased do setpoints reduced effluent nitrate by preventing excessive nitrification and the suggested recycle ratio and external carbon dosage maintained an effective denitrification process aeration energy was effectively diminished by 28 44 owing to the decreased do setpoints whereas pumping energy was slightly increased by 1 01 the environmental benefits of g2anet based solutions are shown in fig 10 d the dashed lines indicate the effluent quality limits set by the korean ministry of environment the effluent limits for codcr and tn are 52 and 20 mg l respectively with three hour average values 23 49 both the effluent cod concentrations by the manual and digital multi solution methods sufficiently satisfied the effluent quality standards however the manual system could be limited in satisfying the effluent standard of tn because 18 values of effluent tn concentrations exceeded the standard 20 mg l from 40 to 50 days and 52 to 58 days although the effluent limits were invoked with three hour average values the manual system discharged effluents exceeding 20 mg l tn four times as shown by the red circle in fig 10 d the manual system requires additional biological or chemical treatments to decrease effluent tn concentrations and a real time robust monitoring system additional treatments can increase operating costs in contrast the proposed g2anet based system effectively decreased the effluent tn concentration and satisfied the limit the three interconnected agents of g2anet cooperated to render the wwtp environmentally and economically viable despite the extremely high influent conditions a quantitative evaluation of the proposed system is presented in table 2 the influent concentrations in july were similar to or lower than the average influent concentrations of 396 mg l for cod and 46 mg l for tn as shown in fig 11 a thus an adaptable solution can be suggested by trading off economic and environmental benefits the optimized setpoints of the g2anet based autonomous system in july are shown in fig 11 b the setpoints of do concentration in the aerobic reactor were effectively decreased by 49 3 with an average do concentration of 2 03 mg l compared with the do setpoints in february the proposed system further diminished the do concentration by 6 8 in july there are two reasons for the lower setpoints in july 1 lower inflow conditions and 2 better growth of microbial communities at higher temperatures therefore the g2anet based autonomous system suggested lower do setpoints during the warmer season the average external recycle ratio was 4 02 which was similar to the setpoint of the manual operation system compared with the results in february the external recycle ratios decreased slightly this means that the nutrient removal efficiencies could be satisfied with the lower operational setpoints in july for the aforementioned reasons the average external carbon dosage increased to 1 54 m3 d which was slightly higher than that in february the influent cod tn ratio in july was 8 42 which was smaller than that in february thus higher amount of external carbon is required to increase the nitrogen removal performance the performance of the g2anet based autonomous system in july is shown in fig 11 c the eqi values were decreased by 11 11 compared with the manual system through the optimized operational setpoints by the g2anet the improvement in effluent quality was higher in july because of improved nitrogen removal during the warmer season temperature is critical for microbial growth and affects nitrification denitrification therefore effluent quality could be improved with fewer setpoints of manipulated values 27 the optimized do setpoints reduced the aeration energy by 30 84 and increased the pumping energy by 0 43 the environmental improvements in the autonomous system are shown in fig 11 d the effluent cod complied with the legal discharge limit and was maintained at below 52 mg l the manual operation system discharged an effluent tn concentration exceeding the limits by four times on 187 202 and 205 days the manual system could satisfy the effluent limits by considering three hour average values however it would be risky to operate under varying influent conditions in the future from the perspective of environmental operation the suggested g2anet based autonomous system could be a solution to meet the effluent quality limits safely as shown by the red circle in fig 11 d g2anet effectively improved the wwtp operation system by achieving economic and environmental benefits a comprehensive summary of the performance improvement is presented in table 2 the g2anet based digital multi solution improved the effluent quality under both high and low influent conditions by comparing with the manual and hs based system as shown in fig 12 table 3 summarizes the quantitative performance improvements achieved by the g2anet based operation system in february july and the entire year the suggested system had the ability to satisfy the effluent quality limits and improve the effluent quality by 6 97 under various influent conditions during the one year operation in addition the overall aeration energy for the entire year was significantly decreased by 24 80 while pumping energy was slightly increased by 1 06 on the other hand the hs based system improved the effluent quality by 6 43 and aeration energy was decreased by 9 63 by its heuristic algorithm however it could not ensure effluent quality at the high influent conditions in february as summarized in table 3 it is interpreted that the hs algorithm was limited to suggest multi solution by searching hidden interactions between the manipulated variables therefore the hs based system provided the biased solution to improve aeration energy while deteriorating effluent quality compared to the hs based system the g2anet based digital multi solution provided stable and adaptable solutions under various influent conditions as shown in fig 12 and table 3 the suggested autonomous operation strategy system using g2anet could save 4 805 105 kwh over one year of operation at a price of 0 075 kwh supplied by the korea electric power corporation the g2anet based autonomous system can save 36 039 annually the costs of external carbon dosage were not included in the performance evaluation because of the irregular use of external carbon at the target plant this study estimated the external carbon source to be a readily biodegradable substrate based on the findings of 39 the present study can be extended to an optimization system while regulating other variables such as methanol based external carbon and do concentrations in the membrane reactor for energy and fouling mitigation consequently the g2anet based autonomous system can contribute to safely maintaining water quality and energy conservation under dynamic and varying influent conditions in addition this study showed the potential to be extended to a more complex operation system by considering centralized learning decentralized execution agents to optimize the manipulating variables under various influent conditions 3 6 total analysis considering environmental economic social aspects of the digital multi solution the g2anet based operation system digital multi solution the hs based system and the manual operation system were analyzed from the nexus of environmental economic and social perspectives the detailed descriptions of analyzing the environmental economic and social nexus are presented in supplementary materials f table 4 summarizes the performance of the digital multi solution the values of improvements in table 4 were computed based on table f 1 which summarized environmental economic social nexus indicator values as described in section 3 5 the g2anet based operation system improved the environmental economic social performance whereas the manual system consumed high energy and discharged high effluent pollutants the digital multi solution effectively decreased the effluent concentration by 6 97 and robustly provided sustainable and safe wwtp operation under various influent conditions while satisfying the effluent discharge limits therefore the digital multi solution improved social indicators including pollutant discharge and risk occurrence ratios by 10 07 additionally the optimization of the wwtp process should fulfill its operational objectives while consuming the least resources possible in this context decreasing aeration energy is an effective solution to save operating costs thus the digital multi solution would be an environmental economi social solution to maintain treatment efficiency and strengthen energy saving potential in addition the suggested optimal operation system uses the marl structure with a digital twin of the full scale wwtp which would make reliable predictions of the future state of the physical wwtp system 24 therefore this study can be implemented to other treatment plants that require operational decisions the results demonstrate that the g2anet based digital multi solution has the potential to effectively contribute to the development of smart operation systems for wwtps that reduce energy consumption while protecting the environment 4 conclusions and future work a digital multi solution was proposed to implement cost effectiveness energy reduction and optimize the environmental operation of wwtps one of the main contributions of this study is that the optimal operational setpoints were provided by the g2anet algorithm under various influent conditions to develop a stable and adaptable operational strategy influent conditions considering low normal and high cod and tn composition ratios were generated and clustered into three scenarios based on the k means clustering algorithm high tech g2anet reinforcement learning was employed to suggest the optimal setpoints for do external sludge recycling and external carbon dose through its three cooperative agents the results of the g2anet based digital multi solution showed that the setpoints were suitable for improving the performance of the target wwtp and outperformed under various influent conditions the augmented newly measured one year influent case showed that the g2anet based autonomous system can adaptively deal with new influent conditions by improving the aeration energy by 24 80 and the effluent quality by 6 97 while maintaining similar pumping energy under various cod tn composition ratios of the dynamic influent consequently the g2anet based digital multi solution represents an innovative contribution to the smart operation of wwtp operation systems owing to its stability and adaptability in a digitalized hydraulic study area this research can be extended to a digital multi solution to improve the economic environmental and social operation of real wwtps while treating other water pollutants such as phosphorus toxic organic compounds and nanoparticles because of open source data this study has limitations on the other water pollutants despite using the digital twin however this study optimized multiple operation variables by considering crucial effluent loads nonstationary and varying influent conditions and inherent complex interactions between manipulated variables therefore it is expected that access to complete influent and effluent data sets would be granted then future research would serve as an operational guideline for real plant operators by suggesting reliable and stable multi solutions in dynamic and complex wastewater environments declaration of competing

12564,in this paper development of a portable bottle cork is discussed which filters grey water in passive mode with gravity driven feed the treatment process involves inertia based microfluidic filtration antimicrobial activated carbon ac treatment and ultra violet uv disinfection stages to ensure the quality of water safe for drinking purposes eighteen water samples 12 lab made 3 field and 3 flood are considered for testing the filtration performance of the device microfluidic filtration is employed for size based exclusion of particulates and bypassing with optimal bypass port opening the filtration stage has consistently shown 99 turbidity reduction a water stable hybrid activated carbon ac coating developed by crosslinking of organic binder with in silver doped ac is employed for its excellent adsorption performance and anti bacterial activity 4 log reduction lrv in 20 min additionally a uv chamber housing is integrated to destroy the chemical resistant bacteria 6 lrv in 65 s resulting in adequately safe drinking water thirty six individual filtration units are arranged in parallel to filter and treat nearly 50 l of raw water in 4 days of continuous operation the final

the data that supports the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author das for reasonable request 1 introduction water quality has already been at an alarming state around the world while its problem is more severe in developing nations in fast developing countries like india the demand for clean water is expected to increase by 74 by 2050 1 shortage of safe drinking water can lead to an outbreak of diarrhea and other deadly illnesses the thirst for safe drinking water will be even more severe during natural calamities like floods the major concern in these scenarios is the presence of viable bacterial and viruses in flood water possibly leading to an epidemic outbreak this highlights the need for the development of filtration devices for island applications due to these reasons the treatment of water through particle screening chemical dosing and disinfection has become a widely investigated area 2 4 centralized water treatment plants are effective in this context but treated water can potentially get contaminated through distribution lines and at end stage collection points moreover such centralized facilities are not a viable solution during natural calamities in this regard pou water filtration systems can become a practical and sustainable solution it is estimated that on site treatment of water bodies with pou kits has shown 35 40 reduction in diarrheal outbreaks 5 6 than that observed even after using improved dosing in central treatment plants inspired by such facts many technologies were proposed based on the concept of low cost pou technology among these sachet based pou water treatment solutions are proven to be the most practical option for rural communities 7 these sachets contain coagulant and disinfectant chemical mixtures with different mixture ratios suitable to treat different water bodies despite being the simple and effective water treatment solution they were unable to meet the drinking water standards consistently where the water samples are polluted from medium to high concentration 8 9 moreover the addition of coagulants mainly alum will increase the amount of dissolved solids in water and chlorine based disinfectant produces harmful by products 10 demanding additional treatment stages for obtaining safe drinking water further these sachets are for one time use with high treatment time and increase the cost in long run hence the sachet based pou water treatment practices are difficult to be used in standalone mode but should be coupled with other processes like physical filtration to meet the drinking water standards slow sand filtration ssf and bio sand filtration bsf are widely used in rural communities for water treatment although such systems can be easily built with locally sourced raw materials their functionality is limited to removing particulates from water hence along with the filtration an additional stage of disinfection is needed further these are far from being practical solutions during flood like situations on the contrary membrane filters are more mature and highly effective in treating greywater samples these are also effective in removing microbes from the water thus people started to employ successful membrane filtration technologies in pou devices 11 despite being very effective membrane filters demand high pumping power via external electricity for their effective operation this makes these technologies difficult to be used as a water dispensing solution during natural calamities and in low resource settings further the materials nylon polypropylene polysulfone cellulose nitrate cellulose acetate etc used for making membrane filters are not bio degradable raising serious environmental concerns regarding their disposal 12 also depending on the variation in size selectivity they were unable to provide complete protection from the entire range of bacteria and viruses 13 which again needs an additional disinfection treatment conventional disinfection systems for water treatment majorly use chlorine and its derivatives e g sodium hypochlorite chloramine and chlorine dioxide due to easy availability and low cost but liquid chlorine is highly corrosive and its handling requires stringent protocols as exposure to it causes serious health effects like acute respiratory distress hemoptysis and pulmonary edema 14 ozone treatment is another popular disinfection method however both chlorination and ozone disinfection produce toxic by products dbps when organic anthropogenic contaminants are present in the water in contrast uv treatment offers better disinfection over a wider range of bacteria and viruses with negligible formation of dbps 15 making it a more sustainable alternative to conventional systems also it is independent of influent water ph and can effectively inactivate the pathogens that developed resistance towards traditional disinfection systems e g giardia and cysts of cryptosporidium are highly resistant to chlorination 16 due to cytotoxic and mutagenic effects on living beings organic pollutants in water bodies are considered to be extremely hazardous pollutants 17 despite the existence of several techniques for removing organic contaminants adsorption based removal is considered to be the most efficient and cost effective 18 but pou solutions having adsorption based removal are not observed as a practice this stress the need for the development of a new class of pou devices that can couple filtration treatment and disinfection processes in an effective way and houses them into a single portable system to address this in the current study we aim to develop a portable pou device having dedicated filtration treatment and disinfection units operating under gravity driven feed for low resource settings optimize the inertia based microfiltration system for achieving 99 removal of suspended impurities analyze the surface modifications after plasma treatment and crosslinking reaction of the developed hybrid carbon coating and test its water stability adsorption and long term disinfection characteristics determine the efficiency of the uv disinfection system in deactivating the disease causing organisms implement the hybrid parallelization scheme for throughput augmentation assess the long term performance of the developed device with synthetic field and flood water samples we believe that the current development can be a viable solution in addressing the problem of supplying safe drinking water during floods and cyclones and the methodology discussed here can encourage future research in developing self sustained pou water treatment solutions 2 materials and methods the schematic representation of the proposed bottle cap system is shown in fig 1 to use the device one has to fill an empty bottle with any available water source then attach the bottle cap system and invert it as shown in fig 1 a i fig 1 a ii shows the exploded view of individual filtration cork components it consists of an inlet pipe with a u shape intake design connected to a microfluidic filtration stage the filtration stage comprises of a microfilter with a circular micropillar array to screen out suspended impurities schematic view of the header based microfilter is illustrated in fig 1 a iii depicting the filtration mechanism and the forces acting on a suspended particle during its motion inside the header at the end of the filtration stage two outputs main and bypass are provided for the continuous collection of permeate and retentate respectively the retentate will be rejected out whereas the permeate initially flows through anti bacterial carbon composite coated channels fig 1 a iv b iv and then enters into a mini chamber which is constantly illuminated with high intensity short wavelength uv c light for disinfecting pathogens the corresponding parts of the product developed are shown in fig 1 b i to iv 2 1 water samples in the current study eighteen water samples twelve water samples are prepared in the laboratory from three different types of particle samples with four different loading ratios and the rest are collected form natural water bodies and real floods are considered for testing the effectiveness of the proposed filtration unit for laboratory synthetic samples three different types of dust particles collected from the country a1 river bank a2 and industry a3 respectively are used the sem images supp fig a1 of three dust samples are analyzed to obtain the particle size distribution psd these samples mimic the naturally occurring black brown and grey water bodies the preparation of synthetic greywater samples involves mixing of fixed mass of dust particles in a given volume of water the samples are then agitated in the ultra sonic machine fb15046 fisherbrand for even dispersion of particles in the continuous phase before experimentation hence synthetic grey water samples offer excellent control over initial particle concentration turbidity owing to this the initial experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the filtration stages in removing the cloudiness of the sample are designed with synthetic grey water of different concentrations in the later stages we have considered real grey water samples from naturally contaminated sources to test the overall performance of bottle cap filtration unit three field samples s1 s2 s3 are collected from the stagnant locations of rivers and ponds with at least two duplicates from same location located in northern and southern part of india similarly three flood samples f1 f2 f3 each from five sampling points and two duplicates from each point are collected from the frequent flood prone zones with dense population guwahati hyderabad and bombay in india during the heavy rains in the monsoon season of 2022 the details of all the water samples used in the present study are summarised in table 1 the samples s1 and s2 are near the experimental facility transportation time 1 h while the other samples are far from the experimental facility transportation time 24 to 48 h for the sampling points that are located nearby field testing has been performed otherwise samples are transported and tested in the lab standard procedure has been followed in collecting and transporting these samples 19 a 5 l sterilized water cans opaque are used to collect both field and flood water samples the collected water cans are completely sealed and transported to the experimental facility and used without further treatment 2 2 fabrication of microfilters an industrial class 3d printer projet mjp 3600 is used to fabricate microfluidic molds this printer can produce microstructures with good dimensional accuracy 20 microfilter is then prepared by pouring pdms into the mould and heating at 80 c standard soft lithography technique 21 in the final step the fabricated microchannel surfaces are treated with high energy oxygen plasma harrick plasma pdc 002 ce and bonded to either glass or plane pdms layer after punching inlet outlet and bypass ports similarly multiplexed parallelized cluster can be developed by bonding one microfilter over the other after ensuring proper alignment 2 3 microscopy experimental setup the experimental setup consists of a support stand with height and angle adjustment a circular clamp attached to a straight bracket extending from the adjuster is used to hold the bottles in an inverted style securely supp fig a2 a the performance of the developed product is evaluated

nano shell pvt ltd india is used for its excellent antimicrobial activity as the ag ions can cause structural changes in the cell membrane of the microbes that can eventually lead to cell death 22 23 wet impregnation method is used for seeding silver nanoparticles onto the carbon surface initially a stable dispersion of agnp is prepared by mixing them in 100 ml di water milli q to stabilize and prevent the agglomeration of the nanoparticles in the aqueous media tween 20 sigma aldrich a food grade surfactant is added at 0 1 w vol and the resulting solution is sonicated thermo fisher scientific for 30 mins in order to enhance the selective surface impregnation of agnp on the ac surface the carbon powder is treated with oxygen plasma harrick plasma for 20 mins at a pressure 0 5

mixture was slowly mixed at 250 rpm for about 10 to 12 h at room temperature for impregnation after the solution was filtered through whatman filter paper to extract silver impregnated activated carbon later it was dried at 100 c for about 2 h to remove the excessive moisture to obtain a thin layer of water stable hybrid carbon coating on the microchannels an appropriate binder binding technique is required there are several binders bentonite clay poly vinyl alcohol carboxymethylcellulose phenolic resin etc 24 and popular binding technologies high pressure compaction high temperature calcination etc 25 available to make shaped carbon bodies despite being the important characteristic of structured carbon bodies in water treatment majority of the previous studies 25 26 were not able to achieve water stability which limits their application to air purification only on the other hand few studies reported that a high percentage of binding material and high temperature thermal treatment step 27 are required to achieve water stability out of these two the former can potentially reduce the specific surface area of the ac and the later requires costly equipment to address this the present study reveals an alternative way to achieve water stable binding by crosslinking the organic binders polymeric cellulose within carbon powders the cellulose derivative used is nacmc or simply cmc due to cytotoxic nature of previous crosslinking agents 28 in the present study ca is used to crosslink cmc with in pac agnp aqueous mixture both cmc and ca used are food grade and

table 2 the levels of turbidity and bacterial activity are measured in a repetitive manner using standard methods 2 6 numerical modeling a 3d finite element based cfd solver is used to resolve the simulated motion of greywater in the filter the suspended impurities are modeled as lagrange point particles bi directionally coupled with a continuous water phase using the commercial numerical platform comsol multiphysics comsol 6 0 india the workflow involves developing a 3d model of a microfilter fig 1 a iii defining the initial and boundary conditions followed by meshing and solving the mass and momentum conservation equations the properties of the water at room temperature 20 c are assigned to the continuous phase the suspended impurities are defined by their density Ï 1 1 to 2 0

suspended impurities coarse fine depending on the surfaces and mud beds it disturbs and carries along with it to limit the coarse particle entry into filter an extended pipe attachment at the device s inlet is tested for its performance in reducing the turbidity of raw water as shown in fig 3 the pipe attachments are press fitted to a polymer layer pdms with a small circular hole d 6 mm that acts as a restricted outlet three configurations namely regular no pipe attachment straight pipe and u pipe are investigated in terms of output flowrate and percentage reduction in turbidity n t u i n n t u f n t u i n 100 the pipes have an internal diameter dpi 5 0 1 mm and external diameter dpe 6 0 1 mm and the distance between the top and bottom openings are 4 6 0 1 mm the experiments are conducted at constant head conditions by inverting the bottles containing a fixed volume of grey water samples out of three configurations the one with a u pipe attachment has shown a significant reduction in the turbidity of the sample this is because suspended particles with medium to bigger size starts to settle under the influence of gravity during the settling process it will be difficult for these particles to enter through constricted intake piping particle entry through the u pipe inlet becomes the most difficult which the reduction in flow rate can verify moreover the pipe attachments with inlets being placed at a certain height allow a good number of particles large sized impurities to settle without blocking the inlet 3 2 microfluidic filtration it is important to produce a particle free effluent during filtration stages to ensure the effectiveness of the subsequent treatment and disinfection processes a microfiltration system is used to remove the suspended solids the functional microfilter mf design with its dimensional nomenclature is shown in fig 4 it consists of a fivefold circular pillar array with an increasing diameter growth 30 from center to periphery and housed in a header design to facilitate uniform flow distribution of influent the height of the micro pillars is 75 0 5 Î¼m the gap l c between the pillars is 10 1 Î¼m two microfilter configurations distinguished by the presence of a bypass port were tested based on three performance parameters i e filtration efficacy throughput and service life under gravity feed the experimental results of simple mf without bypass port are shown in fig 5 a i a ii which indicate a visible improvement in water cloudiness 74 to 86 of turbidity reduction for the entire range of feed water concentrations 0 1 to 0 4 w vol tested here the factors responsible for the filtration mechanism are size exclusion generation of fouling layer its subsequent growth gravitational settling and inertial impaction to a small extent the initial deposits are observed to allow the fluid flow with minimal pressure drops which enhances the filtration efficacy si video s1 on the other hand filtration performance associated with gravitational settling can be estimated from the force balance analysis the relative strength of gravity force f g to inertial drag acting f d on a particles scale as 3 f g f d Ï Ï 1 a p g u 2 where a p is the diameter of an equivalent spherical particle Ï Ï p Ï density ratio of particles to carrier fluid g is the gravitational acceleration and u is the maximum flow velocity in the header section for a constant a p and Ï the relative magnitude of f g is inversely proportional to the square of the feed velocity therefore if the u is decreased by 10 times the relative magnitude of f g increases by 100 times resulting in high probability of particle settling this was confirmed from the experimental observations where the settling of particles increased with fouling at the pillar interface due to a decrease in the average flow velocity as shown in fig 5 a iii for the applied filtration heads the average flowrate of the effluent from a fresh channel without bypass is ranging between 37 5 2 to 74 64 2 ml h however due to fouling filtration flux ff is observed to reduce following an exponential trend with an approximate decay constant of 0 085 0 198 corresponding to samples with 0 1 and 0 4 w vol particle concentrations the filter is assumed to be completely blocked when ff reaches 10 of initial value accordingly the results for service life of the channel are estimated as shown in the inset of fig 5 a ii the temporal blockage phenomenon follows an incremental trend of compact fouling from outer d11 d22 d33 to inner pillar array d44 as shown in fig 5 a iii it consists of a fivefold circular pillar array with an increasing diameter growth 30 from center to periphery and housed in a header design to facilitate uniform flow distribution of influent the height

follows an incremental trend of compact fouling from outer d11 d22 d33 to inner pillar array d44 as shown in fig 5 a iii despite having uniform flow distribution with particle accumulator header the results conclude that the mf has poor service life and inadequate filtration performance to address this the design was improvised by incorporating a secondary opening bypass port at the opposite end of the inlet port as shown in fig 4 a here the function of the bypass port is to provide an alternate path with controlled resistance to divert the particulate flow and continuously remove the accumulated impurities in the header the initial results of the modified design showed a noticeable improvement in filtration efficacy and service life however with the introduction of bypass port a large amount of feed water is escaping through it reducing the filtration flux ff at the outlet hence b p needs to be optimized for complete particle separation with acceptable ff for this five values of b p expressed in normalized scale as l c b p 0 04 0 05 0 067 0 1 0 134 are investigated with synthetic water samples for the entire range of particle concentrations the results are summarised in fig 5 b ii for max and min concentrations as a representative the filtration efficiency has increased with b p and reached 99 for l c b p 0 067 this can be seen from the microscopic analysis fig 5 b i and high resolution optical images fig 5 b iii displaying the particle concentrations in the samples collected from the bypass and outlet ports the results are consistent for all the particle concentrations and the flowrates 1 2 l head tested in this effort in contrast the flow rate ratio output bypass showed an exponential decay with an increase in the b p since achieving a particulate free sample is of prime interest we selected the minimum value of b p which produces 99 particulate free sample i e l c b p 0 067 for this bypass port size the flowrate ratio is approximately equal to 0 1 0 02 which still falls in the acceptable range of ff for the application targeted in the present work the absolute turbidity values of corresponding raw feed water and retentate collected at the bypass port are given in supp fig a6 to understand the filtration phenomenon particularly the dynamic motion of the particles inside the filter with optimized b p high speed image analysis 700 900 fps

of interest the images reveal that supp fig a7 a b at any given instant the zone with bypass port is always occupied with high particle concentration whereas particle free frames are observed

supplementary material supp fig a8 because of the high velocity flow in the header section the particles major fraction away from the pillar surface are observed to be driven by the bulk fluid motion towards the bypass this can be seen from the high speed video supp video s3 showing the particle bypass mechanism inside a microfilter l c b p 0 067 besides as the particles a small fraction approach the pillar s surface they experience a wall repulsive force due to the lubrication effect that pushes them away and a wall retardation effect that slows down the motion the magnitude of the retardation effect increases as the particle moves close to the surface on the other hand the wall repulsive force is linearly dependent on particle velocity and its effect diminishes with a decrease in particle velocity which may cause particles to enter the pillar array hence from the experimental observations it is difficult to identify the governing condition that decides the course of particles that are close to the pillar s surface because of the high velocity flow in the header section the particles major fraction away from the pillar surface are observed to be driven by the bulk fluid motion towards the bypass which can be seen from the high speed video supp video s3 showing the particle bypass mechanism inside a microfilter l c b p 0 067 besides as the particles a small fraction approach the pillar s surface they experience a wall repulsive force due to the lubrication effect that pushes them away and a wall retardation effect that slows down the motion the magnitude

decrease in particle velocity which may cause particles to enter the pillar array hence from the experimental observations it is difficult to identify the governing condition that decides the course of particles that are close to the pillar s surface 3 2 1 numerical analysis for this a full scale three dimensional mathematical model is developed to represent the motion of feed water inside the micro filter for the entire range of b p the outcomes from the numerical investigations are summarised in fig 6 a typical velocity flow field flowrate 18 ml h inside the microfilter is shown in fig 6 a with the high velocity flow in the header and low velocity flow in the pillar array hence a fully developed flow inside the filter will have two components the main flow in the header directed towards the bypass and the cross flow through the pillar array directed towards the outlet the no slip condition at the walls further divides the flow field in the header into two zones i e high velocity hv core zone and low velocity lv near wall zone separated by a single valued velocity contour white color line corresponding to 4 of the maximum velocity fig 6 a unlike the hv zone the particles that are located in the lv zone experience both main f d1 and cross flow f d2 components and the balance of forces from these two components decides the particle movement the inertial force balance f d2 f d1 as a function of particle location from the pillar s surface t s is shown in fig 6 b the results are reported for a specific case of particle size a p 10 Î¼m density Ï 1 3 and an average inflow rate of 18 ml h since the drag forces acting on the particles vary continuously the average value is considered over its course of motion across a single interface between two pillars points a to b from the results for a constant b p the drag force ratio f d2 f d1 is observed to increase above unity as the particle moves close to the pillar s surface decrease of t s if the drag force ratio is above unity it indicates that the cross flow drag is dominant directing the particles into the pillar array whereas in other cases the particles just bypass the interface an intriguing phenomenon is observed by examining the force balance analysis closely suggesting a limiting factor in terms of streamline thickness deciding the particle movement at the pillar interface based on its location this is referred to as critical streamline thickness t cr outside of which the particles are observed to always bypass the pillar interface but others inside t cr have entered the pillar array the value of t cr is found to linearly decrease with the b p as shown in fig 6 c due to the movement of high velocity fluid over the pillar s surface a low pressure zone is created that generates a localized micro vortex as shown in supp fig a9 these vortices prevent the direct entry of bigger particles into the pillars enhancing the filtration effect as expected the size of the micro vortex is increasing with b p additionally as the pillars are clustered circularly the feed water has to take a curved path imparting an additional force in the form of net centripetal centrifugal force on the particles directed away from the pillar array and contributing to filtration performance the magnitude of net centripetal centrifugal force acting on a particle is 4 f c Ï p Ï Ï v p t 2 a p 3 6 r it depends on the particle size a p density Ï p tangential velocity v p t and radius of curvature r numerical analysis shows that due to the combined effect of bypass mechanism size exclusion and recirculation the number of particles entering the pillar array is becoming very less thus increasing the filtration performance of the unit with the optimized bypass port opening l c b p 0 067 the ff at the outlet of a single filter under different head conditions 1 l and 2 l gravitational head is given in fig 7 after 3 h the amount of filtrate collected at the outlet is found to be 58 45 ml and 107 68 ml from 1 l and 2 l heads respectively the results of a single filtration unit show that the output flow rate is too low to be considered for any practical drinking water applications to commercialize such a promising technology augmentation of throughput is warranted parallelization is a promising technique to increase the sample processing rate from the miniaturized devices accordingly a hybrid parallelization scheme is adapted to augment the throughput which is discussed in section 3 5 3 3 anti bacterial hybrid carbon coating for adsorption and disinfection inlet distributaries of the microchannel are coated with hybrid carbon material to adsorb organic impurities and disinfect the greywater from bacteria the developed anti bacterial hybrid carbon coating is analyzed using standard characterization techniques to verify the surface modifications and crosslinking reaction also the change in the adsorption properties after crosslinking is tested using n2 adsorption desorption isotherms 3 3 1 xrd analysis powder xrd analysis is done to characterize the crystallinity of the final sample nacmc ca pac agnp used for surface coating the xrd patterns of pac agnp pac agnp and cmc ca pac agnp are shown in fig 8 the diffraction peak at 25 2 indicates the amorphous form of the carbon graphite structure further the coexistence of pac and agnp in pac agnp is confirmed from the broad peaks at 24 9 the peaks observed at 37 9 44 1 and 64 8 can be indexed to 111 200 and 220 lattice planes of face centered cubic metallic silver jcpdf no 04 0783 respectively the observations are similar to the previously reported data by altintig and others 29 park jang 30 further similar peaks are also observed in cmc ca pac agnp surface coating indicating the presence of agnp on the surface films in addition the new peaks at 21 2 32 5 46 9 and 57 5 can be attributed to the crosslinking of cmc with ca within pac 3 3 2 ftir analysis and surface characterization high energy oxygen plasma treatment has modified the surface functional groups of ac as investigated using ftir analysis the resulting ftir spectra of untreated ac and pac are shown in the supplemental material supp fig a10 ftir spectra clearly show that plasma treatment has increased the polar functional groups oxygen containing groups on the ac i e the intensity of the peaks corresponding to oh cooh and co has increased in the plasma treated sample the morphology of pac pac agnp and cmc ca pac agnp are studied using sem analysis the fe sem images of the pac sample before and after agnp impregnation are shown in fig 9 a b the images clearly depict the pac s porous structure with pore sizes ranging from micro to medium scale further it is observed that the nanoparticles are majorly attached to the external surface of pac rather than the inner zones this selective impregnation is achieved by the surface modification of ac by treating it with plasma ftir spectroscopy is performed to evaluate the extent of crosslinking between cmc and ca within pac agnp micro granules the ftir spectra of cmc ca and cmc ca pac agnp crosslinked carbon composite are shown in fig 9 c the absorbance peaks at 3821 cm 1 and 3725 cm 1 are due to stretching vibrations coming from oh bonds the cmc contains carboxymethyl functional groups ch2 cooh attached to hydroxyl groups of the glucopyranose monomer ftir spectra of pure cmc compared to crosslinked composite show a characteristic peak near 1587 cm 1 which is attributed to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylate o c o bonds group 31 that is widely grafted on crosslinked composite the peaks near 1412 1321 cm 1 are also absorption peaks of carboxylates coo the broad and strong adsorption band near 3200 3600 cm 1 is due to the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl oh group slight changes in the oh stretching peaks are observed in ftir spectra from pure form ac cmc ca to crosslinked derivative the intensity of the oh absorption band has reduced with a slight shift towards the lower wavenumber this is due to the combined effect of ester bond formation 32 as a result of crosslinking and the presence of agnp on the carbon surface 17 pure citric acid shows a strong absorbance peak near 1721 cm 1 due to the carboxylic acid cooh group which is absent in cmc a similar peak also appeared at 1721 cm 1 in crosslinked carbon composite confirming the crosslinking reaction due to stretching vibrations of already formed ester bond c o on a typical carboxylic acid group 32 the appearance of peaks near 2910 and 2860 cm 1 represents the ch stretching that indicates the carbon presence strong absorption peaks between 1100 and 1000 cm 1 are due to the co stretching vibrations of primary and secondary alcohols the peaks at 631 770 cm 1 originated from agnp present on the crosslinked polymeric composite one of the key surface modifications due to plasma treatment is the change in surface wettability which is characterized by contact angle measurement here the contact angle of the pdms surface is measured before and after coating with cmc ca pac agnp as shown in fig 9 f g at least five drops of di water are deposited at different locations for contact angle analysis the value of the contact angle was found to be 104 for uncoated pdms revealing its hydrophobic nature after carbon coating the surface becomes highly hydrophilic with a contact angle approaching zero the spatial distribution of silver and carbon on pac agnp is obtained using elemental mapping in fe sem fig 9 d e which shows an even distribution of agnp attached to the external surface of the carbon further fig 9 h shows the elemental composition expressed in atomic wt of carbon silver and oxygen present in ac pac pac agnp and cmc ca pac agnp which are determined using edx the silver content present in the pac agnp sample is found to be 1 01 wt when measured using edx whereas the slightly reduced content i e 0 906 wt is shown with mp aes measurement the elemental composition shows an increase in oxygen content from 8 14 to 11 05 for the plasma treated sample and further increased to 14 55 in cmc ca pac agnp this again confirms the increase in the oxygenated functional groups after both plasma treatment and crosslinking surface properties like pore structure pore volume and specific surface area are analyzed using bet surface area analysis chemisorb 2720 the bet specific surface area total pore volume and micropore volume were obtained at equilibrium conditions for untreated ac pac pac agnp and cmc ca pac agnp and are listed in table 3 similarly the adsorption characteristics and pore size distribution of the crosslinked carbon composite cmc ca pac agnp are analyzed and compared with untreated ac and pac using n2 adsorption desorption isotherms supp fig a11 a b the results show that surface modification of ac with plasma has slightly improved its porosity parameters and adsorption performance further the process of cmc binding has shown very limited effect in its surface properties with a minor decrease in specific surface area pore volume and n2 adsorption performance in the crosslinked sample the area of the hysteresis loop and the slope of n2 isotherm has slightly decreased at both low and high relative pressures indicating a decrease in micro and mesopore volumes this can be due to the blockage of pores during the binding process however the process parameters followed in the present study for binding have limited this phenomenon which is clear from the adsorption desorption isotherms and the change in the porosity parameters data shown in table 3 and supp fig a11 a b 3 3 3 water stability analysis the developed coating in the current study is tested for its water stability by weight reduction technique after subjecting it to still water at room temperature t 25 c boiling conditions t 100 c and running water at a constant flowrate t 25 c first the coated distributary is immersed in the beaker containing 200 ml of di water for prolonged periods the measurements for weight loss are recorded for 144 h at an interval of 24 h only after the surface was fully dried visible inspection shows that the surface coating remains intact supp fig a4 a with no weight loss indicating exceptional water stability under still water conditions similar observations are made when subjected to boiling water and running water tests with surface coating remains visibly intact but having a minor weight loss of 5 wt supp fig a4 b and 2 wt supp table a2 respectively this confirms that the water soluble cmc has become water insoluble after crosslinking making the coating highly water stable 3 3 4 antibacterial study the anti bacterial activity of the pac agnp composite coating is assessed by plate assay test and channel flow test with e coli as the model organism dh5Î± due to its common presence and survival rate in diverse environments e coli is the most widely studied model organism for water disinfection studies for the plate assay test molten lurai broth lb agar himedia agar was prepared and 15 ml of the agar was poured into sterile petri dishes then 1 ml of diluted microbial culture e coli grown overnight is added to it followed by gentle mixing the addition of a fixed volume of diluted e coli results in an initial concentration of 104 cfu ml of agar then the agar was allowed to solidify followed by incubating at 37 c for 24 h to study the anti bacterial activity 75 mg of pac with and without agnp is added to the petri dishes before incubation the results show e coli growth in case of pac with no agnp seeding fig 10 a whereas no growth is observed in the culture treated with pac agnp fig 10 b however few cfus are found to be grown outside the treated zone due to lack of contact with agnp thus pac agnp hybrid is found to be very effective in inhibiting cell growth the anti bacterial assay is further extended to test the carbon composite coating on the pdms distributary for this continuous flow tests are performed on a double spiral channel w h l 1 0 5 1680 mm coated with hybrid carbon material water samples with initial e coli concentration maintained at 104 cfu ml are pumped at constant flow rate through the channels the number of viable cells present in the treated water at the outlet is measured using the plate count method different contact times are obtained for the given channel length by varying the flow rates 12 to 125 ml h the reduction in the e coli concentration after treated with pac and pac agnp coating for different contact times is shown in fig 10 c there was a slight reduction in the e coli concentration in the samples when treated with only pac coating which can be attributed to adsorption phenomenon of the carbon material whereas in case of agnp impregnated surface coatings a steep decrease of bacterial concentration in the treated water is observed complete disinfection of e coli is realized for a minimum contact time of 25 min this was further confirmed from the log reduction test performed on a multiplexed channel connected in series under gravity feed five individual setups with multi layered carbon coating having 2 3 4 5 6 layers connected in series are used for the experiment the results show that about 4 log reduction in the bacterial concentration is achieved for six pass configuration fig 10 d however the length of the channel corresponding to 6 passes is 10 mt which adds significant hydraulic resistance to the flow although the complete removal of microbes from the drinking water is desirable it is not the primary objective of the carbon treatment stage hence in the current study the number of passes is limited to two which results in 2 log reduction of e coli in the outlet water further the long term working capability of the hybrid carbon coating is tested in terms of both performance and safety by continuous flow experiments carried out for six days the bacterially contaminated water initial concentration of 105 cfu ml is directed to flow through the treatment unit two stage carbon coated channels connected in series under gravity 2 l head continuously the results show a 2 log reduction in bacterial concentration consistently even at the end of the 6th day fig 11 a besides by the end of 6th day the reduction in the silver content is limited to only 2 5 wt fig 11 a indicating a large amount of silver is still available on the coated surface for disinfecting the incoming water samples hence similar anti bacterial performance is expected to show beyond the tested period since the mechanism behind the cell death is mainly due to the adsorption of ag ions onto the cell surface and the reaction between the ag ions and the dna of the cell it is important to measure the amount of silver released into the treated water sample during this disinfection process hence the concentration of silver is measured for all the treated samples to ensure that it is within acceptable limits for this continuous flow experiments are performed with varying flow rates with clean water milli q grade pumped through the treatment unit flowrates are varied from 100 to 2000 ml h at an interval of 500 ml h and tested for a period of 6 days the results are reported for two flowrates one is the experimental value from a six unit parallelized setup 100 3 ml h and other is the maximum flowrate 2000 ml h the reason for considering such a high flow rate is to check the stability of binding and the possibility of erosion at higher flowrates in long term operating conditions outlet sampling is done after every 12 h and the ag concentration is measured using mp aes the results are summarised in fig 11 b the amount of silver in the water is found to increase with time initially and reaches a constant value after a few days the saturation value of ag concentration in the treated water is found to be 0 03 0 002 mg l which is well within the acceptable limit of 0 05 mg l who 2014b minimal variations are observed in the silver concentrations with change in flowrates the results suggest low mobility and a controlled release of silver into the water due to excellent crosslinked binding moreover due to the thin surface coating on the microchannel distributary walls the effective surface area available for contact treatment is very high resulting in a strong anti bacterial activity 3 4 uv c disinfection stage post carbon treatment the device has uvc micro chamber to completely sterilize the influent water samples one of the crucial parameters that affect the efficacy of the uv based disinfection system is uv fluence which majorly depends on the type of surrounding media liquid or gas working distance wd and reflectivity of the chamber walls for both air and water media the uv fluence starts to decrease exponentially and almost reaches an ineffective state at 50 mm depth approximately while water reports a maximum difference of 15 compared to air supp fig a12 this is due to the low absorption coefficient of uv light by water at 275 nm 2 10 1 m 1 another important aspect is the degree of reflectivity offered by the inner walls of the chamber for this two uv chambers depth h1 12 mm are tested one with a reflective film polished aluminium foil and the other with no reflective lining the results show improved disinfection performance supp fig a13 with reflective inner lining as it significantly improves the uniformity of uv irradiation dose received in all directions to sterilize the water samples 3 4 1 mechanism of cell killing when exposed to uvc the uv light spectra irradiating at a particular wavelength ranging from 220 to 300 nm is known to have an extremely effective germicidal effect at this particular wavelength spectrum the building blocks of the cells like nucleic acid exhibit maximum absorption as a result more uv radiation penetrates into the intracellular components e g dna rna and cell proteins and causes critical damage to them this is done by the formation of pyrimidine dimers between two adenines due to the collapse of the adenine thymine bond leading to an inability of cell multiplication this damage potentially stops the cells from replicating and blocks the transcription that eventually leads to complete inactivation of the cell if not self repaired within the recovery time 3 4 2 uvc disinfection experiments the degree of uv fluence that a microorganism got exposed to mainly depends on the residence time of the water inside the uv chamber here the residence time is governed by the influent flow rate and volume of the uv chamber since the water is driven by a constant gravitational head the flow rate of the water from the previous stages is almost constant so to increase the residence time the volume of uv chamber should be increased by varying its height h1 identifying the optimal value of h1 for the current operating parameters to achieve complete inactivation of microbes is warranted for this five different configurations characterized by the height h1 8 10 12 20 and 30 mm of the uv chamber is considered for the disinfection experiments two influent water flowrates corresponding to 1 l and 2 l gravitational heads after filtration and carbon treatment stage are obtained from repeated experiments whose values are approximately 4 89 0 16 and 8 98 0 21 ml min respectively discussed in section 3 5 the approximate residence times for both influent flow rates for the entire range of uv chamber depths are theoretically evaluated and provided in the supplemental material supp table a4 it is clear that the residence time decreases with the increase in the flow rate hence in the present study we have considered the highest possible flow rate 9 ml min to ensure the configuration is well engineered for other operating conditions the influent water contaminated with e coli cells initial concentration of 106 cfu ml is processed through the entire range of uv chamber configurations the concentration of e coli in the irradiated water samples is measured by the plate count method and the values are summarised in fig 12 it is found that the reduction in cell concentration follows an exponentially decreasing trend in response to the exposure time for all the configurations further configuration with lower chamber depth h1 8 mm showed better performance in e coli inactivation 6 lrv with lower exposure time 75 s on the other hand the inactivation of e coli for the chamber of 30 mm depth is limited to 4 2 lrv even for an exposure time of 240 s this is due to the diffusive nature of uvc led and the absorbance and reflectance of uv light by water with increase in depth these factors amplify to reduce the uv fluence at the farthest point demanding higher exposure times this can be verified from supp fig a12 so increasing the depth of uv chamber in order to increase the uv exposure time will be effective only up to a certain level after which the effect diminishes this limit depends on the irradiated power of uv led illumination angle and absorption coefficient of surrounding media water corresponding to the given wavelength the experimental data of reduction in cell concentration among uv chambers of with h1 8 mm 10 mm and 12 mm depth is nearly identical considering the residence time and minimum exposure required to achieve 6 log reduction the uv chamber with 12 mm depth is found to satisfy the desired limits for the current operating conditions with this configuration complete inactivation requires a minimum exposure time of 80 s whereas the residence time corresponding to the highest flow rate is 95 s the images showing the e coli growth in the agar from the untreated sample to the sample irradiated for different exposure times is given in supplemental material supp fig a14 for the 12 mm configuration 3 5 augmentation of throughput and testing with field flood samples despite excellent filtration efficiency 99 the filtration flux of the single filter is too low for the practical solutions owing to this we have developed hybrid parallelization scheme in the planar and vertical directions as shown in the inset schematic of fig 13 a first planar parallelization is done by designing six units into a circular array on a single pdms layer fig 1 b iii three such layers are connected in perfect alignment to form a parallelized cluster further two such clusters are parallelized in a vertical fashion a through hole at the center of 1st cluster distributes the water to the 2nd cluster an inlet distributary is used to input the water samples to all the units similarly to collect the outgoing streams both outlet and bypass outlet bypass distributary is attached to bottom filtration layer the distributaries are carefully designed based on position and orientation of the individual units which ensures uniform delivery and collection of the influent and effluent from all the units without overlapping or leaking into the pillar array the resulting filtration module has 36 individual filters 2 6 3 working in parallel with the new parallelized module pm substantial improvement in the filtration flux 30 is observed fig 13 a for both 1 l and 2 l gravitational heads respectively this emphasizes the ability of the present parallelization scheme for uniform distribution of the water sample so that 85 of parallelized throughput can be achieved any developed prototype needs to be tested for its life in the long run to get an estimate on the period of replacements warranted for different stages and possible problems that can limit the product s functionality accordingly pm is tested for its filtration efficacy and life under continuous operation for 4 days for this a highly turbid 0 4 w vol synthetic water sample a1 is used at 2 l gravitational head the results of the long run filtration performance of pm are shown in fig 13 b where the reduction in the turbidity of the water sample is depicted in the inset plot showing consistent filtration performance 99 4 filtration efficacy under extended operating conditions the high resolution images of filtered water samples show clean water throughout the testing period supp fig a15 next the sample processing ability of the pm is evaluated in terms of reduction in ff at the outlet and total filtrate volume collected at the outlet fig 13 b the decrease in ff continues to increase non linearly with time at the end of 4th day the reduction in the filtration flux reaches approximately 34 of the initial value on the other hand the total processed filtrate has shown a linear increase with time filtering close to 50 l of water in four days the slope of the cumulative filtrate volume curve flattens after 2 5 days indicating the effect of reduction in the ff this can be due to possible deposition and gradual clogging of micro impurities at the pillar gap the results suggest that the pm can continue to filter maintaining similar filtration performance but with reduced ff even after four days of continuous operation later all the filtration components are connected together i e pm is connected to two layers of activated carbon channels and secured inside a 3d printed housing that has a uvc disinfection chamber the ability of the resulting prototype in handling real world samples to deliver clean water is investigated for this three field s1 s2 s3 and three floods f1 f2 f3 samples are used the raw water samples are fed into the water treatment setup under gravity with 2 l head the results show that the developed prototype has effectively bypassed the particulate impurities and delivered clean water the particle removal efficiency is consistently maintained for the entire range of samples tested with 99 4 reduction in the turbidity fig 13 c the optical images of the filtered and the bypass water streams corresponding to field and flood water samples are shown in fig 13 d further the filtration performance of the device for all the samples tested is summarised in table 4 no significant p 0 05 statistical differences were found in the filtration efficacy for the entire range of samples tested but filtration flux was found to be significantly varying p 0 05 with change in concentration of the particulates in all the lab made samples on the other hand no significant differences were found in the values of filtration flux for both field and flood samples later testing of microbial activity is performed using point of use bacterial slides bactaslyde ind by dipping the slide directly into the water sample the slide is then screwed back into the plastic container and incubated at 37 c for 48 h the degree of bacterial growth on the slide is observed at every 12 h interval up to 48 h the results of microbe concentration in the raw water samples and their corresponding lrv after treatment are given in fig 13 e further the culture images from the pou slide for the entire range of field s1 s2 and s3 and flood f1 f2 and f3 water samples are shown in fig 13 f the anti bacterial performance for the entire range of samples tested is summarised in table 5 the results show consistent inactivation of e coli and tbc in the raw water samples with no significant difference p 0 05 in the inactivation performance after processing through the developed prototype equipped with an anti bacterial carbon coating and uv disinfection chamber this confirms the efficacy and robust nature of in house disinfection systems equipped in the present prototype to produce pathogenic free water the uvc led in the developed setup is powered using li ion coin cells the nominal voltage and capacity of the cell are 3 v and 220 ma h respectively the battery pack consists of two cells connected in series providing an effective output voltage of 6 v the led consumes approximately 1 ma of forward current to produce uv light with an optical intensity of 6 mw with this loading the battery pack can supply power to the uv led for a period of 220 h since the unit is developed to be flexible the batteries can be replaced at any time by simply screwing and unscrewing the top cap the life span of uvc led is rated to be 2 to 2 5 years hence the disinfection system can effectively work for a very long time with timely replacement of batteries 3 6 comparison with previous work the antibacterial activity of the developed hybrid carbon coating is compared with the recent studies in the literature table 6 the critical parameters affecting the anti bacterial performance can be realized as i microbial concentration ii agnp loading and iii residence contact time the response time of the antibacterial medium in limiting the microbial concentration is quantified in terms of the death rate constant the decrease in the cell concentration lrv and the death rate constant are used to compare the anti bacterial performance despite having higher silver loading 1 4 and 0 97 wt previous studies 34 35 have shown lower anti bacterial performance 0 0425 10 2 0 0322 10 2 this can be due to the selective impregnation of agnp on the external surface by surface modifications in the present study whereas in the previous studies silver particles are aggravated and loaded majorly on the internal pores rather external surface limiting their access to the microbes the study by biswas et al 36 has reported comparable anti bacterial performance with base modified carbon pellets similarly the inactivation performance of the uvc led reactor in the present work is compared with the previous studies in the literature table 7 the comparison is made with the critical input parameters such as depth of the water medium cell concentration and uv fluence per ml of water media and corresponding lrv is considered as the output response variable further the comparison is confined to the uv led s with monochromatic irradiation at 275 nm despite the lower value of fluence ml 1 26 the lrv in the present study is higher than the previous works this is mainly due to the adaption of reflective coating on the walls of uv chamber in the present study that minimizes the irradiation losses due to adsorption and transmittance when compared with the previously reported gravity based pou devices the present device has shown comparable or even better performance in removing the particulate impurities and disinfecting the water sample table 8 but the filtration flux of some of the previously reported pou devices is higher 13 43 45 it is due to the fact that the form factor and the effective filtration area of these devices are much higher than the present prototype also these devices mostly operate at filtration heads 5 l volume which effectively increases the filtration flux values similarly the average filtration flux of the present device can also be augmented by a further increase in the degree of parallelization in the module level and its corresponding filtration heads 4 conclusion a handheld microfluidic bottle cap setup capable of producing potable water from dirty grey water is developed and tested with performance parameters acceptable for drinking water standards the major achievements are as follows the filter comprises of circular micropillar array with a bypass port which achieves 99 filtration efficacy for a wide range of lab made field and flood samples through experimental and numerical investigations bypass port size l c b p 0 067 is optimized a water stable anti bacterial activated carbon composite coating cmc ca pac agnp is developed and applied to the walls of distributaries for effective adsorption and disinfection 2 lrv in e coli concentration using 2 stage coating of the influent water samples further to completely remove the disease causing pathogens from water high energy short wavelength uv c disinfection chamber h1 12 mm is attached to the filtration module a significant performance improvement in uvc disinfection with a minimum exposure time of 80 s 6 lrv vs 4 lrv in e coli concentration is observed by applying reflective aluminium film on the inner walls of the uv chamber a hybrid parallelization scheme is developed by combining vertical 6 units and planar level 6 units parallelization to achieve approximately 50 l of filtered 99 turbidity reduction 6 lrv water in 4 days the handheld filtration setup developed in the current effort can be lifesaving in emergencies like floods where a huge

world while its problem is more severe in developing nations in fast developing countries like india the demand for clean water is expected to increase by 74 by 2050 1 shortage of safe drinking water can lead to an outbreak of diarrhea and other deadly illnesses the thirst for safe drinking water will be even more severe during natural calamities like floods the major concern in these scenarios is the presence of viable bacterial and viruses in flood water possibly leading to an epidemic outbreak this highlights the need for the development of filtration devices for island applications due to these reasons the treatment of water through particle screening chemical dosing and disinfection has become a widely investigated area 2 4 centralized water treatment plants are effective in this context but treated water can potentially get contaminated through distribution lines and at end stage collection points moreover such centralized facilities are not a viable solution during natural calamities in this regard pou water filtration systems can become a practical and sustainable solution it is estimated that on site treatment of water bodies with pou kits has shown 35 40 reduction in diarrheal outbreaks 5 6 than that observed even after using improved dosing in central treatment plants inspired by such facts many technologies were proposed based on the concept of low cost pou technology among these sachet based pou water treatment solutions are proven to be the most practical option for rural communities 7 these sachets contain coagulant and disinfectant chemical mixtures with different mixture ratios suitable to treat different water bodies despite being the simple and effective water treatment solution they were unable to meet the drinking water standards consistently where the water samples are polluted from medium to high concentration 8 9 moreover the addition of coagulants mainly alum will increase the amount of dissolved solids in water and chlorine based disinfectant produces harmful by products 10 demanding additional treatment stages for obtaining safe drinking water further these sachets are for one time use with high treatment time and increase the cost in long run hence the sachet based pou water treatment practices are difficult to be used in standalone mode but should be coupled with other processes like physical filtration to meet the drinking water standards slow sand filtration ssf and bio sand filtration bsf are widely used in rural communities for water treatment although such systems can be easily built with locally sourced raw materials their functionality is limited to removing particulates from water hence along with the filtration an additional stage of disinfection is needed further these are far from being practical solutions during flood like situations on the contrary membrane filters are more mature and highly effective in treating greywater samples these are also effective in removing microbes from the water thus people started to employ successful membrane filtration technologies in pou devices 11 despite being very effective membrane filters demand high pumping power via external electricity for their effective operation this makes these technologies difficult to be used as a water dispensing solution during natural calamities and in low resource settings further the materials nylon polypropylene polysulfone cellulose nitrate cellulose acetate etc used for making membrane filters are not bio degradable raising serious environmental concerns regarding their disposal 12 also depending on the variation in size selectivity they were unable to provide complete protection from the entire range of bacteria and viruses 13 which again needs an additional disinfection treatment conventional disinfection systems for water treatment majorly use chlorine and its derivatives e g sodium hypochlorite chloramine and chlorine dioxide due to easy availability and low cost but liquid chlorine is highly corrosive and its handling requires stringent protocols as exposure to it causes serious health effects like acute respiratory distress hemoptysis and pulmonary edema 14 ozone treatment is another popular disinfection method however both chlorination and ozone disinfection produce toxic by products dbps when organic anthropogenic contaminants are present in the water in contrast uv treatment offers better disinfection over a wider range of bacteria and viruses with negligible formation of dbps 15 making it a more sustainable alternative to conventional systems also it is independent of influent water ph and can effectively inactivate the pathogens that developed resistance towards traditional disinfection systems e g giardia and cysts of cryptosporidium are highly resistant to chlorination 16 due to cytotoxic and mutagenic effects on living beings organic pollutants in water bodies are considered to be extremely hazardous pollutants 17 despite the existence of several techniques for removing organic contaminants adsorption based removal is considered to be the most efficient and cost effective 18 but pou solutions having adsorption based removal are not observed as a practice this stress the need for the development of a new class of pou devices that can couple filtration treatment and disinfection processes in an effective way and houses them into a single portable system to address this in the current study we aim to develop a portable pou device having dedicated filtration treatment and disinfection units operating under gravity driven feed for low resource settings optimize the inertia based microfiltration system for achieving 99 removal of suspended impurities analyze the surface modifications after plasma treatment and crosslinking reaction of the developed hybrid carbon coating and test its water stability adsorption and long term disinfection characteristics determine the efficiency of the uv disinfection system in deactivating the disease causing organisms implement the hybrid parallelization scheme for throughput augmentation assess the long term performance of the developed device with synthetic field and flood water samples we believe that the current development can be a viable solution in addressing the problem of supplying safe drinking water during floods and cyclones and the methodology discussed here can encourage future research in developing self sustained pou water treatment solutions 2 materials and methods the schematic representation of the proposed bottle cap system is shown in fig 1 to use the device one has to fill an empty bottle with any available water source then attach the bottle cap system and invert it as shown in fig 1 a i fig 1 a ii shows the exploded view of individual filtration cork components it consists of an inlet pipe with a u shape intake design connected to a microfluidic filtration stage the filtration stage comprises of a microfilter with a circular micropillar array to screen out suspended impurities schematic view of the header based microfilter is illustrated in fig 1 a iii depicting the filtration mechanism and the forces acting on a suspended particle during its motion inside the header at the end of the filtration stage two outputs main and bypass are provided for the continuous collection of permeate and retentate respectively the retentate will be rejected out whereas the permeate initially flows through anti bacterial carbon composite coated channels fig 1 a iv b iv and then enters into a mini chamber which is constantly illuminated with high intensity short wavelength uv c light for disinfecting pathogens the corresponding parts of the product developed are shown in fig 1 b i to iv 2 1 water samples in the current study eighteen water samples twelve water samples are prepared in the laboratory from three different types of particle samples with four different loading ratios and the rest are collected form natural water bodies and real floods are considered for testing the effectiveness of the proposed filtration unit for laboratory synthetic samples three different types of dust particles collected from the country a1 river bank a2 and industry a3 respectively are used the sem images supp fig a1 of three dust samples are analyzed to obtain the particle size distribution psd these samples mimic the naturally occurring black brown and grey water bodies the preparation of synthetic greywater samples involves mixing of fixed mass of dust particles in a given volume of water the samples are then agitated in the ultra sonic machine fb15046 fisherbrand for even dispersion of particles in the continuous phase before experimentation hence synthetic grey water samples offer excellent control over initial particle concentration turbidity owing to this the initial experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the filtration stages in removing the cloudiness of the sample are designed with synthetic grey water of different concentrations in the later stages we have considered real grey water samples from naturally contaminated sources to test the overall performance of bottle cap filtration unit three field samples s1 s2 s3 are collected from the stagnant locations of rivers and ponds with at least two duplicates from same location located in northern and southern part of india similarly three flood samples f1 f2 f3 each from five sampling points and two duplicates from each point are collected from the frequent flood prone zones with dense population guwahati hyderabad and bombay in india during the heavy rains in the monsoon season of 2022 the details of all the water samples used in the present study are summarised in table 1 the samples s1 and s2 are near the experimental facility transportation time 1 h while the other samples are far from the experimental facility transportation time 24 to 48 h for the sampling points that are located nearby field testing has been performed otherwise samples are transported and tested in the lab standard procedure has been followed in collecting and transporting these samples 19 a 5 l sterilized water cans opaque are used to collect both field and flood water samples the collected water cans are completely sealed and transported to the experimental facility and used without further treatment 2 2 fabrication of microfilters an industrial class 3d printer projet mjp 3600 is used to fabricate microfluidic molds this printer can produce microstructures with good dimensional accuracy 20 microfilter is then prepared by pouring pdms into the mould and heating at 80 c standard soft lithography technique 21 in the final step the fabricated microchannel surfaces are treated with high energy oxygen plasma harrick plasma pdc 002 ce and bonded to either glass or plane pdms layer after punching inlet outlet and bypass ports similarly multiplexed parallelized cluster can be developed by bonding one microfilter over the other after ensuring proper alignment 2 3 microscopy experimental setup the experimental setup consists of a support stand with height and angle adjustment a circular clamp attached to a straight bracket extending from the adjuster is used to hold the bottles in an inverted style securely supp fig a2 a the performance of the developed product is evaluated

onto its surface ac is prepared by thermal activation of pine wood and made into a fine powder mesh size 270 325 using a ball milling machine silver nano powder with an average particle size of 20 nm nano shell pvt ltd india is used for its excellent antimicrobial activity as the ag ions can cause structural changes in the cell membrane of the microbes that can eventually lead to cell death 22 23 wet impregnation method is used for seeding silver nanoparticles onto the carbon surface initially a stable dispersion of agnp is prepared by mixing them in 100 ml di water milli q to stabilize and prevent the agglomeration of the nanoparticles in the aqueous media tween 20 sigma aldrich a food grade surfactant is added at 0 1 w vol and the resulting solution is sonicated thermo fisher scientific for 30 mins in order to enhance the selective surface impregnation of agnp on the ac surface the carbon powder is treated with oxygen plasma harrick plasma for 20 mins at a pressure 0 5 torr after treating it with plasma the ac is referred to as pac in the wet impregnation method 10 g of pac micro granules mesh size 270 are added to 100 ml of stabilized agnp suspension the resulting mixture was slowly mixed at 250 rpm for about 10 to 12 h at room temperature for impregnation after the solution was filtered through whatman filter paper to extract silver impregnated activated carbon later it was dried at 100 c for about 2 h to remove the excessive moisture to obtain a thin layer of water stable hybrid carbon coating on the microchannels an appropriate binder binding technique is required there are several binders bentonite clay poly vinyl alcohol carboxymethylcellulose phenolic resin etc 24 and popular binding technologies high pressure compaction high temperature calcination etc 25 available to make shaped carbon bodies despite being the important characteristic of structured carbon bodies in water treatment majority of the previous studies 25 26 were not able to achieve water stability which limits their application to air purification only on the other hand few studies reported that a high percentage of binding material and high temperature thermal treatment step 27 are required to achieve water stability out of these two the former can potentially reduce the specific surface area of the ac and the later requires costly equipment to address this the present study reveals an alternative way to achieve water stable binding by crosslinking the organic binders polymeric cellulose within carbon powders the cellulose derivative used is nacmc or simply cmc due to cytotoxic nature of previous crosslinking agents 28 in the present study ca is used to crosslink cmc with in pac agnp aqueous mixture both cmc and ca used are food grade and

solution was continuously stirred for another 24 h to obtain a thick paste of cmc ca pac agnp composite prior to coating the microchannel is treated with high energy plasma 2 min to change its surface wettability characteristics for effective surface adherence a thin film is coated on to the walls of the outlet distributary and the coating is allowed to dry at room temperature for 12 h finally the coated microchannels undergo heat treatment step inside the oven at 140 c for 2 4 h to assist the crosslinking reaction the thickness of the coated film is measured using digital vernier calipers

considered to be statistically significant the performance of various stages of the device is evaluated both individually and as a coupled unit with series of experimental investigations as shown in table 2 the levels of turbidity and bacterial activity are measured in a repetitive manner using standard methods 2 6 numerical modeling a 3d finite element based cfd solver is used to resolve the simulated motion of greywater in the filter the suspended impurities are modeled as lagrange point particles bi directionally coupled with a continuous water phase using the commercial numerical platform comsol multiphysics comsol 6 0 india the workflow involves developing a 3d model of a microfilter fig 1 a iii defining the initial and boundary conditions followed by meshing and solving the mass and momentum conservation equations the properties of the water at room temperature 20 c are assigned to the continuous phase the suspended impurities are defined by their density Ï 1 1 to 2 0

centrifugal force has been considered while modeling the particle motion meshes are refined to an optimum level for obtaining a grid independent setup for all the simulations the final mesh count is 67 55 448 with a skewness factor of 0 67 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of coarse particles from water samples raw water samples such as flood waters will have medium to high loading of suspended impurities coarse fine depending on the surfaces and mud beds it disturbs and carries along with it to limit the coarse particle entry into filter an extended pipe attachment at the device s inlet is tested for its performance in reducing the turbidity of raw water as shown in fig 3 the pipe attachments are press fitted to a polymer layer pdms with a small circular hole d 6 mm that acts as a restricted outlet three configurations namely regular no pipe attachment straight pipe and u pipe are investigated in terms of output flowrate and percentage reduction in turbidity n t u i n n t u f n t u i n 100 the pipes have an internal diameter dpi 5 0 1 mm and external diameter dpe 6 0 1 mm and the distance between the top and bottom openings are 4 6 0 1 mm the experiments are conducted at constant head conditions by inverting the bottles containing a fixed volume of grey water samples out of three configurations the one with a u pipe attachment has shown a significant reduction in the turbidity of the sample this is because suspended particles with medium to bigger size starts to settle under the influence of gravity during the settling process it will be difficult for these particles to enter through constricted intake piping particle entry through the u pipe inlet becomes the most difficult which the reduction in flow rate can verify moreover the pipe attachments with inlets being placed at a certain height allow a good number of particles large sized impurities to settle without blocking the inlet 3 2 microfluidic filtration it is important to produce a particle free effluent during filtration stages to ensure the effectiveness of the subsequent treatment and disinfection processes a microfiltration system is used to remove the suspended solids the functional microfilter mf design with its dimensional nomenclature is shown in fig 4 it consists of a fivefold circular pillar array with an increasing diameter growth 30 from center to periphery and housed in a header design to facilitate uniform flow distribution of influent the height of the micro pillars is 75 0 5 Î¼m the gap l c between the pillars is 10 1 Î¼m two microfilter configurations distinguished by the presence of a bypass port were tested based on three performance parameters i e filtration efficacy throughput and service life under gravity feed the experimental results of simple mf without bypass port are shown in fig 5 a i a ii which indicate a visible improvement in water cloudiness 74 to 86 of turbidity reduction for the entire range of feed water concentrations 0 1 to 0 4 w vol tested here the factors responsible for the filtration mechanism are size exclusion generation of fouling layer its subsequent growth gravitational settling and inertial impaction to a small extent the initial deposits are observed to allow the fluid flow with minimal pressure drops which enhances the filtration efficacy si video s1 on the other hand filtration performance associated with gravitational settling can be estimated from the force balance analysis the relative strength of gravity force f g to inertial drag acting f d on a particles scale as 3 f g f d Ï Ï 1 a p g u 2 where a p is the diameter of an equivalent spherical particle Ï Ï p Ï density ratio of particles to carrier fluid g is the gravitational acceleration and u is the maximum flow velocity in the header section for a constant a p and Ï the relative magnitude of f g is inversely proportional to the square of the feed velocity therefore if the u is decreased by 10 times the relative magnitude of f g increases by 100 times resulting in high probability of particle settling this was confirmed from the experimental observations where the settling of particles increased with fouling at the pillar interface due to a decrease in the average flow velocity as shown in fig 5 a iii for the applied filtration heads the average flowrate of the effluent from a fresh channel without bypass is ranging between 37 5 2 to 74 64 2 ml h however due to fouling filtration flux ff is observed to reduce following an exponential trend with an approximate decay constant of 0 085 0 198 corresponding to samples with 0 1 and 0 4 w vol particle concentrations the filter is assumed to be completely blocked when ff reaches 10 of initial value accordingly the results for service life of the channel are estimated as shown in the inset of fig 5 a ii the temporal blockage phenomenon follows an incremental trend of compact fouling from outer d11 d22 d33 to inner pillar array d44 as shown in fig 5 a iii it

follows an incremental trend of compact fouling from outer d11 d22 d33 to inner pillar array d44 as shown in fig 5 a iii despite having uniform flow distribution with particle accumulator header the results conclude that the mf has poor service life and inadequate filtration performance to address this the design was improvised by incorporating a secondary opening bypass port at the opposite end of the inlet port as shown in fig 4 a here the function of the bypass port is to provide an alternate path with controlled resistance to divert the particulate flow and continuously remove the accumulated impurities in the header the initial results of the modified design showed a noticeable improvement in filtration efficacy and service life however with the introduction of bypass port a large amount of feed water is escaping through it reducing the filtration flux ff at the outlet hence b p needs to be optimized for complete particle separation with acceptable ff for this five values of b p expressed in normalized scale as l c b p 0 04 0 05 0 067 0 1 0 134 are investigated with synthetic water samples for the entire range of particle concentrations the results are summarised in fig 5 b ii for max and min concentrations as a representative the filtration efficiency has increased with b p and reached 99 for l c b p 0 067 this can be seen from the microscopic analysis fig 5 b i and high resolution optical images fig 5 b iii displaying the particle concentrations in the samples collected from the bypass and outlet ports the results are consistent for all the particle concentrations and the flowrates 1 2 l head tested in this effort in contrast the flow rate ratio output bypass showed an exponential decay with an increase in the b p since achieving a particulate free sample is of prime interest we selected the minimum value of b p which produces 99 particulate free sample i e l c b p 0 067 for this bypass port size the flowrate ratio is approximately equal to 0 1 0 02 which still falls in the acceptable range of ff for the application targeted in the present work the absolute turbidity values of corresponding raw feed water and retentate collected at the bypass port are given in supp fig a6 to understand the filtration phenomenon particularly the dynamic motion of the particles inside the filter with optimized b p high speed image analysis 700 900 fps

of interest the images reveal that supp fig a7 a b at any given instant the zone with bypass port is always occupied with high particle concentration whereas particle free frames are observed consistently at the outlet also see supp video s2 this is potentially attributed to the particle bypass mechanism which can be seen from the high speed image analysis of particle tracking given in

supplementary material supp fig a8 because of the high velocity flow in the header section the particles major fraction away from the pillar surface are observed to be driven by the bulk fluid motion towards the bypass this can be seen from the high speed video supp video s3 showing the particle bypass mechanism inside a microfilter l c b p 0 067 besides as the particles a small fraction approach the pillar s surface they experience a wall repulsive force due to the lubrication effect that pushes them away and a wall retardation effect that slows down the motion the magnitude of the retardation effect increases as the particle moves close to the surface on the other hand the wall repulsive force is linearly dependent on particle velocity and its effect diminishes with a decrease in particle velocity which may cause particles to enter the pillar array hence from the experimental observations it is difficult to identify the governing condition that decides the course of particles that are close to the pillar s surface because of the high velocity flow in the header section the particles major fraction away from the pillar surface are observed to be driven by the bulk

micro filter for the entire range of b p the outcomes from the numerical investigations are summarised in fig 6 a typical velocity flow field flowrate 18 ml h inside the microfilter is shown in fig 6 a with the high velocity flow in the header and low velocity flow in the pillar array hence a fully developed flow inside the filter will have two components the main flow in the header directed towards the bypass and the cross flow through the pillar array directed towards the outlet the no slip condition at the walls further divides the flow field in the header into two zones i e high velocity hv core zone and low velocity lv near wall zone separated by a single valued velocity contour white color line corresponding to 4 of the maximum velocity fig 6 a unlike the hv zone the particles that are located in the lv zone experience both main f d1 and cross flow f d2 components and the balance of forces from these two components decides the particle movement the inertial force balance f d2 f d1 as a function of particle location from the pillar s surface t s is shown in fig 6 b the results are reported for a specific case of particle size a p 10 Î¼m density Ï 1 3 and an average inflow rate of 18 ml h since the drag forces acting on the particles vary continuously the average value is considered over its course of motion across a single interface between two pillars points a to b from the results for a constant b p the drag force ratio f d2 f d1 is observed to increase above unity as the particle moves close to the pillar s surface decrease of t s if the drag force ratio is above unity it indicates that the cross flow drag is dominant directing the particles into the pillar array whereas in other cases the particles just bypass the interface an intriguing phenomenon is observed by examining the force balance analysis closely suggesting a limiting factor in terms of streamline thickness deciding the particle movement at the pillar interface based on its location this is referred to as critical streamline thickness t cr outside of which the particles are observed to always bypass the pillar interface but others inside t cr have entered the pillar array the value of t cr is found to linearly decrease with the b p as shown in fig 6 c due to the movement of high velocity fluid over the pillar s surface a low pressure zone is created that generates a localized micro vortex as shown in supp fig a9 these vortices prevent the direct entry of bigger particles into the pillars enhancing the filtration effect as expected the size of the micro vortex is increasing with b p additionally as the pillars are clustered circularly the feed water has to take a curved path imparting an additional force in the form of net centripetal centrifugal force on the particles directed away from the pillar array and contributing to filtration performance the magnitude of net centripetal centrifugal force acting on a particle is 4 f c Ï p Ï Ï v p t 2 a p 3 6 r it depends on the particle size a p density Ï p tangential velocity v p t and radius of curvature r numerical analysis shows that due to the combined effect of bypass mechanism size exclusion and recirculation the number of particles entering the pillar array is becoming very less thus increasing the filtration performance of the unit with the optimized bypass port opening l c b p 0 067 the ff at the outlet of a single filter under different head conditions 1 l and 2 l gravitational head is given in fig 7 after 3 h the amount of filtrate collected at the outlet is found to be 58 45 ml and 107 68 ml from 1 l and 2 l heads respectively the results of a single filtration unit show that the output flow rate is too low to be considered for any practical drinking water applications to commercialize such a promising technology augmentation of throughput is warranted parallelization is a promising technique to increase the sample processing rate from the miniaturized devices accordingly a hybrid parallelization scheme is adapted to augment the throughput which is discussed in section 3 5 3 3 anti bacterial hybrid carbon coating for adsorption and

patterns of pac agnp pac agnp and cmc ca pac agnp are shown in fig 8 the diffraction peak at 25 2 indicates the amorphous form of the carbon graphite structure further the coexistence of pac and agnp in pac agnp is confirmed from the broad peaks at 24 9 the peaks observed at 37 9 44 1 and 64 8 can be indexed to 111 200 and 220 lattice planes of face centered cubic metallic silver jcpdf no 04 0783 respectively the observations are similar to the previously reported data by altintig and others 29 park jang 30 further similar peaks are also observed in cmc ca pac agnp surface coating indicating the presence of agnp on the surface films in addition the new peaks at 21 2 32 5 46 9 and 57 5 can be attributed to the crosslinking of cmc with ca within pac 3 3 2 ftir analysis and surface characterization high energy oxygen plasma treatment has modified the surface functional groups of ac as investigated using ftir analysis the resulting ftir spectra of untreated ac and pac are shown in the supplemental material supp fig a10 ftir spectra clearly show that plasma treatment has increased the polar functional groups oxygen containing groups on the ac i e the intensity of the peaks corresponding to oh cooh and co has increased in the plasma treated sample the morphology of pac pac agnp and cmc ca pac agnp are studied using sem analysis the fe sem images of the pac sample before and after agnp impregnation are shown in fig 9 a b the images clearly depict the pac s porous structure with pore sizes ranging from micro to medium scale further it is observed that the nanoparticles are majorly attached to the external surface of pac rather than the inner zones this selective impregnation is achieved by the surface modification of ac by treating it with plasma ftir spectroscopy is performed to evaluate the extent of crosslinking between cmc and ca within pac agnp micro granules the ftir spectra of cmc ca and cmc ca pac agnp crosslinked carbon composite are shown in fig 9 c the absorbance peaks at 3821 cm 1 and 3725 cm 1 are due to stretching vibrations coming from oh bonds the cmc contains carboxymethyl functional groups ch2 cooh attached to hydroxyl groups of the glucopyranose monomer ftir spectra of pure cmc compared to crosslinked composite show a characteristic peak near 1587 cm 1 which is attributed to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylate o c o bonds group 31 that is widely grafted on crosslinked composite the peaks near 1412 1321 cm 1 are also absorption peaks of carboxylates coo the broad and strong adsorption band near 3200 3600 cm 1 is due to the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl oh group slight changes in the oh stretching peaks are observed in ftir spectra from pure form ac cmc ca to crosslinked derivative the intensity of the oh absorption band has reduced with a slight shift towards the lower wavenumber this is due to the combined effect of ester bond formation 32 as a result of crosslinking and the presence of agnp on the carbon surface 17 pure citric acid shows a strong absorbance peak near 1721 cm 1 due to the carboxylic acid cooh group which is absent in cmc a similar peak also appeared at 1721 cm 1 in crosslinked carbon composite confirming the crosslinking reaction due to stretching vibrations of already formed ester bond c o on a typical carboxylic acid group 32 the appearance of peaks near 2910 and 2860 cm 1 represents the ch stretching that indicates the carbon presence strong absorption peaks between 1100 and 1000 cm 1 are due to the co stretching vibrations of primary and secondary alcohols the peaks at 631 770 cm 1 originated from agnp present on the crosslinked polymeric composite one of the key surface modifications due to plasma treatment is the change in surface wettability which is characterized by contact angle measurement here the contact angle of the pdms surface is measured before and after coating with cmc ca pac agnp as shown in fig 9 f g at least five drops of di water are deposited at different locations for contact angle analysis the value of the contact angle was found to be 104 for uncoated pdms revealing its hydrophobic nature after carbon coating the surface becomes highly hydrophilic with a contact angle approaching zero the spatial distribution of silver and carbon on pac agnp is obtained using elemental mapping in fe sem fig 9 d e which shows an even distribution of agnp attached to the external surface of the carbon further fig 9 h shows the elemental composition expressed in atomic wt of carbon silver and oxygen present in ac pac pac agnp and cmc ca pac agnp which are determined using edx the silver content present in the pac agnp sample is found to be 1 01 wt when measured using edx whereas the slightly reduced content i e 0 906 wt is shown with mp aes measurement the elemental composition shows an increase in oxygen content from 8 14 to 11 05 for the plasma treated sample and further increased to 14 55 in cmc ca pac agnp this again confirms the increase in the oxygenated functional groups after both plasma treatment and crosslinking surface properties like pore structure pore volume and specific surface area are analyzed using bet surface area analysis chemisorb 2720 the bet specific surface area total pore volume and micropore volume were obtained at equilibrium conditions for untreated ac pac pac agnp and cmc ca pac agnp and are listed in table 3 similarly the adsorption characteristics and pore size distribution of the crosslinked carbon composite cmc ca pac agnp are analyzed and compared with untreated ac and pac using n2 adsorption desorption isotherms supp fig a11 a b the results show that surface modification of ac with plasma has slightly improved its porosity parameters and adsorption performance further the process of cmc binding has shown very limited effect in its surface properties with a minor decrease in specific surface area pore volume and n2 adsorption performance in the crosslinked sample the area of the hysteresis loop and the slope of n2 isotherm has slightly decreased at both low and high relative pressures indicating a decrease in micro and mesopore volumes this can be due to the blockage of pores during the binding process however the process parameters followed in the present study for binding have limited this phenomenon which is clear from the adsorption desorption isotherms and the change in the porosity parameters data shown in table 3 and supp fig a11 a b 3 3 3 water stability analysis the developed coating in the current study is tested for its water stability by weight reduction technique after subjecting it to still water at room temperature t 25 c boiling conditions t 100 c and running water at a constant flowrate t 25 c first the coated distributary is immersed in the beaker containing 200 ml of di water for prolonged periods the measurements for weight loss are recorded for 144 h at an interval of 24 h only after the surface was fully dried visible inspection shows that the surface coating remains intact supp fig a4 a with no weight loss indicating exceptional water stability under still water conditions similar observations are made when subjected to boiling water and running water tests with surface coating remains visibly intact but having a minor weight loss of 5 wt supp fig a4 b and 2 wt supp table a2 respectively this confirms that the water soluble cmc has become water insoluble after crosslinking making the coating highly water stable 3 3 4 antibacterial study the anti bacterial activity of the pac agnp composite coating is assessed by plate assay test and channel flow test with e coli as the model organism dh5Î± due to its common presence and survival rate in diverse environments e coli is the most widely studied model organism for water disinfection studies for the plate assay test molten lurai broth lb agar himedia agar was prepared and 15 ml of the agar was poured into sterile petri dishes then 1 ml of diluted microbial culture e coli grown overnight is added to it followed by gentle mixing the addition of a fixed volume of diluted e coli results in an initial concentration of 104 cfu ml of agar then the agar was allowed to solidify followed by incubating at 37 c for 24 h to study the anti bacterial activity 75 mg of pac with and without agnp is added to the petri dishes before incubation the results show e coli growth in case of pac with no agnp seeding fig 10 a whereas no growth is observed in the culture treated with pac agnp fig 10 b however few cfus are found to be grown outside the treated zone due to lack of contact with agnp thus pac agnp hybrid is found to be very effective in inhibiting cell growth the anti bacterial assay is further extended to test the carbon composite coating on the pdms distributary for this continuous flow tests are performed on a double spiral channel w h l 1 0 5 1680 mm coated with hybrid carbon material water samples with initial e coli concentration maintained at 104 cfu ml are pumped at constant flow rate through the channels the number of viable cells present in the treated water at the outlet is measured using the plate count method different contact times are obtained for the given channel length by varying the flow rates 12 to 125 ml h the reduction in the e coli concentration after treated with pac and pac agnp coating for different contact times is shown in fig 10 c there was a slight reduction in the e coli concentration in the samples when treated with only pac coating which can be attributed to adsorption phenomenon of the carbon material whereas in case of agnp impregnated surface coatings a steep decrease of bacterial concentration in the treated water is observed complete disinfection of e coli is realized for a minimum contact time of 25 min this was further confirmed from the log reduction test performed on a multiplexed channel connected in series under gravity feed five individual setups with multi layered carbon coating having 2 3 4 5 6 layers connected in series are used for the experiment the results show that about 4 log reduction in the bacterial concentration is achieved for six pass configuration fig 10 d however the length of the channel corresponding to 6 passes is 10 mt which adds significant hydraulic resistance to the flow although the complete removal of microbes from the drinking water is desirable it is not the primary objective of the carbon treatment stage hence in the current study the number of passes is limited to two which results in 2 log reduction of e coli in the outlet water further the long term working capability of the hybrid carbon coating is tested in terms of both performance and safety by continuous flow experiments carried out for six days the bacterially contaminated water initial concentration of 105 cfu ml is directed to flow through the treatment unit two stage carbon coated channels connected in series under gravity 2 l head continuously the results show a 2 log reduction in bacterial concentration consistently even at the end of the 6th day fig 11 a besides by the end of 6th day the reduction in the silver content is limited to only 2 5 wt fig 11 a indicating a large amount of silver is still available on the coated surface for disinfecting the incoming water samples hence similar anti bacterial performance is expected to show beyond the tested period since the mechanism behind the cell death is mainly due to the adsorption of ag ions onto the cell surface and the reaction between the ag ions and the dna of the cell it is important to measure the amount of silver released into the treated water sample during this disinfection process hence the concentration of silver is measured for all the treated samples to ensure that it is within acceptable limits for this continuous flow experiments are performed with varying flow rates with clean water milli q grade pumped through the treatment unit flowrates are varied from 100 to 2000 ml h at an interval of 500 ml h and tested for a period of 6 days the results are reported for two flowrates one is the experimental value from a six unit parallelized setup 100 3 ml h and other is the maximum flowrate 2000 ml h the reason for considering such a high flow rate is to check the stability of binding and the possibility of erosion at higher flowrates in long term operating conditions outlet sampling is done after every 12 h and the ag concentration is measured using mp aes the results are summarised in fig 11 b the amount of silver in the water is found to increase with time initially and reaches a constant value after a few days the saturation value of ag concentration in the treated water is found to be 0 03 0 002 mg l which is well within the acceptable limit of 0 05 mg l who 2014b minimal variations are observed in the silver concentrations with change in flowrates the results suggest low mobility and a controlled release of silver into the water due to excellent crosslinked binding moreover due to the thin surface coating on the microchannel distributary walls the effective surface area available for contact treatment is very high resulting in a strong anti bacterial activity 3 4 uv c disinfection stage post carbon treatment the device has uvc micro chamber to completely sterilize the influent water samples one of the crucial parameters that affect the efficacy of the uv based disinfection system is uv fluence which majorly depends on the type of surrounding media liquid or gas working distance wd and reflectivity of the chamber walls for both air and water media the uv fluence starts to decrease exponentially and almost reaches an ineffective state at 50 mm depth approximately while water reports a maximum difference of 15 compared to air supp fig a12 this is due to the low absorption coefficient of uv light by water at 275 nm 2 10 1 m 1 another important aspect is the degree of reflectivity offered by the inner walls of the chamber for this two uv chambers depth h1 12 mm are tested one with a reflective film polished aluminium foil and the other with no reflective lining the results show improved disinfection performance supp fig a13 with reflective inner lining as it significantly improves the uniformity of uv irradiation dose received in all directions to sterilize the water samples 3 4 1 mechanism of cell killing when exposed to uvc the uv light spectra irradiating at a particular wavelength ranging from 220 to 300 nm is known to have an extremely effective germicidal effect at this particular wavelength spectrum the building blocks of the cells like nucleic acid exhibit maximum absorption as a result more uv radiation penetrates into the intracellular components e g dna rna and cell proteins and causes critical damage to them this is done by the formation of pyrimidine dimers between two adenines due to the collapse of the adenine thymine bond leading to an inability of cell multiplication this damage potentially stops the cells from replicating and blocks the transcription that eventually leads to complete inactivation of the cell if not self repaired within the recovery time 3 4 2 uvc disinfection experiments the degree of uv fluence that a microorganism got exposed to mainly depends on the residence time of the water inside the uv chamber here the residence time is governed by the influent flow rate and volume of the uv chamber since the water is driven by a constant gravitational head the flow rate of the water from the previous stages is almost constant so to increase the residence time the volume of uv chamber should be increased by varying its height h1 identifying the optimal value of h1 for the current operating parameters to achieve complete inactivation of microbes is warranted for this five different configurations characterized by the height h1 8 10 12 20 and 30 mm of the uv chamber is considered for the disinfection experiments two influent water flowrates corresponding to 1 l and 2 l gravitational heads after filtration and carbon treatment stage are obtained from repeated experiments whose values are approximately 4 89 0 16 and 8 98 0 21 ml min respectively discussed in section 3 5 the approximate residence times for both influent flow rates for the entire range of uv chamber depths are theoretically evaluated and provided in the supplemental material supp table a4 it is clear that the residence time decreases with the increase in the flow rate hence in the present study we have considered the highest possible flow rate 9 ml min to ensure the configuration is well engineered for other operating conditions the influent water contaminated with e coli cells initial concentration of 106 cfu ml is processed through the entire range of uv chamber configurations the concentration of e coli in the irradiated water samples is measured by the plate count method and the values are summarised in fig 12 it is found that the reduction in cell concentration follows an exponentially decreasing trend in response to the exposure time for all the configurations further configuration with lower chamber depth h1 8 mm showed better performance in e coli inactivation 6 lrv with lower exposure time 75 s on the other hand the inactivation of e coli for the chamber of 30 mm depth is limited to 4 2 lrv even for an exposure time of 240 s this is due to the diffusive nature of uvc led and the absorbance and reflectance of uv light by water with increase in depth these factors amplify to reduce the uv fluence at the farthest point demanding higher exposure times this can be verified from supp fig a12 so increasing the depth of uv chamber in order to increase the uv exposure time will be effective only up to a certain level after which the effect diminishes this limit depends on the irradiated power of uv led illumination angle and absorption coefficient of surrounding media water corresponding to the given wavelength the experimental data of reduction in cell concentration among uv chambers of with h1 8 mm 10 mm and 12 mm depth is nearly identical considering the residence time and minimum exposure required to achieve 6 log reduction the uv chamber with 12 mm depth is found to satisfy the desired limits for the current operating conditions with this configuration complete inactivation requires a minimum exposure time of 80 s whereas the residence time corresponding to the highest flow rate is 95 s the images showing the e coli growth in the agar from the untreated sample to the sample irradiated for different exposure times is given in supplemental material supp fig a14 for the 12 mm configuration 3 5 augmentation of throughput and testing with field flood samples despite excellent filtration efficiency 99 the filtration flux of the single filter is too low for the practical solutions owing to this we have developed hybrid parallelization scheme in the planar and vertical directions as shown in the inset schematic of fig 13 a first planar parallelization is done by designing six units into a circular array on a single pdms layer fig 1 b iii three such layers are connected in perfect alignment to form a parallelized cluster further two such clusters are parallelized in a vertical fashion a through hole at the center of 1st cluster distributes the water to the 2nd cluster an inlet distributary is used to input the water samples to all the units similarly to collect the outgoing streams both outlet and bypass outlet bypass distributary is attached to bottom filtration layer the distributaries are carefully designed based on position and orientation of the individual units which ensures uniform delivery and collection of the influent and effluent from all the units without overlapping or leaking into the pillar array the resulting filtration module has 36 individual filters 2 6 3 working in parallel with the new parallelized module pm substantial improvement in the filtration flux 30 is observed fig 13 a for both 1 l and 2 l gravitational heads respectively this emphasizes the ability of the present parallelization scheme for uniform distribution of the water sample so that 85 of parallelized throughput can be achieved any developed prototype needs to be tested for its life in the long run to get an estimate on the period of replacements warranted for different stages and possible problems that can limit the product s functionality accordingly pm is tested for its filtration efficacy and life under continuous operation for 4 days for this a highly turbid 0 4 w vol synthetic water sample a1 is used at 2 l gravitational head the results of the long run filtration performance of pm are shown in fig 13 b where the reduction in the turbidity of the water sample is depicted in the inset plot showing consistent filtration performance 99 4 filtration efficacy under extended operating conditions the high resolution images of filtered water samples show clean water throughout the testing period supp fig a15 next the sample processing ability of the pm is evaluated in terms of reduction in ff at the outlet and total filtrate volume collected at the outlet fig 13 b the decrease in ff continues to increase non linearly with time at the end of 4th day the reduction in the filtration flux reaches approximately 34 of the initial value on the other hand the total processed filtrate has shown a linear increase with time filtering close to 50 l of water in four days the slope of the cumulative filtrate volume curve flattens after 2 5 days indicating the effect of reduction in the ff this can be due to possible deposition and gradual clogging of micro impurities at the pillar gap the results suggest that the pm can continue to filter maintaining similar filtration performance but with reduced ff even after four days of continuous operation later all the filtration components are connected together i e pm is connected to two layers of activated carbon channels and secured inside a 3d printed housing that has a uvc disinfection chamber the ability of the resulting prototype in handling real world samples to deliver clean water is investigated for this three field s1 s2 s3 and three floods f1 f2 f3 samples are used the raw water samples are fed into the water treatment setup under gravity with 2 l head the results show that the developed prototype has effectively bypassed the particulate impurities and delivered clean water the particle removal efficiency is consistently maintained for the entire range of samples tested with 99 4 reduction in the turbidity fig 13 c the optical images of the filtered and the bypass water streams corresponding to field and flood water samples are shown in fig 13 d further the filtration performance of the device for all the samples tested is summarised in table 4 no significant p 0 05 statistical differences were found in the filtration efficacy for the entire range of samples tested but filtration flux was found to be significantly varying p 0 05 with change in concentration of the particulates in all the lab made samples on the other hand no significant differences were found in the values of filtration flux for both field and flood samples later testing of microbial activity is performed using point of use bacterial slides bactaslyde ind by dipping the slide directly into the water sample the slide is then screwed back into the plastic container and incubated at 37 c for 48 h the degree of bacterial growth on the slide is observed at every 12 h interval up to 48 h the results of microbe concentration in the raw water samples and their corresponding lrv after treatment are given in fig 13 e further the culture images from the pou slide for the entire range of field s1 s2 and s3 and flood f1 f2 and f3 water samples are shown in fig 13 f the anti bacterial performance for the entire range of samples tested is summarised in table 5 the results show consistent inactivation of e coli and tbc in the raw water samples with no significant difference p 0 05 in the inactivation performance after processing through the developed prototype equipped with an anti bacterial carbon coating and uv disinfection chamber this confirms the efficacy and robust nature of in house disinfection systems equipped in the present prototype to produce pathogenic free water the uvc led in the developed setup is powered using li ion coin cells the nominal voltage and capacity of the cell are 3 v and 220 ma h respectively the battery pack consists of two cells connected in series providing an effective output voltage of 6 v the led consumes approximately 1 ma of forward current to produce uv light with an optical intensity of 6 mw with this loading the battery pack can supply power to the uv led for a period of 220 h since the unit is developed to be flexible the batteries can be replaced at any time by simply screwing and unscrewing the top cap the life span of uvc led is rated to be 2 to 2 5 years hence the disinfection system can effectively work for a very long time with timely replacement of batteries 3 6 comparison with previous work the antibacterial activity of the developed hybrid carbon coating is compared with the recent studies in the literature table 6 the critical parameters affecting the anti bacterial performance can be realized as i microbial concentration ii agnp loading and iii residence contact time the response time of the antibacterial medium in limiting the microbial concentration is quantified in terms of the death rate constant the decrease in the cell concentration lrv and the death rate constant are used to compare the anti bacterial performance despite having higher silver loading 1 4 and 0 97 wt previous studies 34 35 have shown lower anti bacterial performance 0 0425 10 2 0 0322 10 2 this can be due to the selective impregnation of agnp on the external surface by surface modifications in the present study whereas in the previous studies silver particles are aggravated and loaded majorly on the internal pores rather external surface limiting their access to the microbes the study by biswas et al 36 has reported comparable anti bacterial performance with base modified carbon pellets similarly the inactivation performance of the uvc led reactor in the present work is compared with the previous studies in the literature table 7 the comparison is made with the critical input parameters such as depth of the water medium cell concentration and uv fluence per ml of water media and corresponding lrv is considered as the output response variable further the comparison is confined to the uv led s with monochromatic irradiation at 275 nm despite the lower value of fluence ml 1 26 the lrv in the present study is higher than the previous works this is mainly due to the adaption of reflective coating on the walls of uv chamber in the present study that minimizes the irradiation losses due to adsorption and transmittance when compared with the previously reported gravity based pou devices the present device has shown comparable or even better performance in removing the particulate impurities and disinfecting the water sample table 8 but the filtration flux of some of the previously reported pou devices is higher 13 43 45 it is due to the fact that the form factor and the effective filtration area of these devices are much higher than the present prototype also these devices mostly operate at filtration heads 5 l volume which effectively increases the filtration flux values similarly the average filtration flux of the present device can also be augmented by a further increase in the degree of parallelization in the module level and its corresponding filtration heads 4 conclusion a handheld microfluidic bottle cap setup capable of producing potable water from dirty grey water is developed and tested with performance parameters acceptable for drinking water standards the major achievements are as follows the filter comprises of circular micropillar array with a bypass port which achieves 99 filtration efficacy for a wide range of lab made field and flood samples through experimental and numerical investigations bypass port size l c b p 0 067 is optimized a water stable anti bacterial activated carbon composite coating cmc ca pac agnp is developed and applied to the walls of distributaries for effective adsorption and disinfection 2 lrv in e coli concentration using 2 stage coating of the influent water samples further to completely remove the disease causing pathogens from water high energy short wavelength uv c disinfection chamber h1 12 mm is attached to the filtration module a significant performance improvement in uvc disinfection with a minimum exposure time of 80 s 6 lrv vs 4 lrv in e coli concentration is observed by applying reflective aluminium film on the inner walls of the uv chamber a hybrid parallelization scheme is developed by combining vertical 6 units and planar level 6 units parallelization to achieve approximately 50 l of filtered 99 turbidity reduction 6 lrv water in 4 days the handheld filtration setup developed in the current effort can be lifesaving in emergencies like floods where a huge
