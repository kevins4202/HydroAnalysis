11430,phosphorus is a critical water quality indicator of farm drainage systems in south florida rice oryza sativa l cultivation has the potential to reduce phosphorus concentration in drainage water through crop uptake under varying flooding systems a two year study was conducted to assess drainage water quality under four different flooding systems conventionally used for rice production 15 cm continuous flood 5 cm continuous flood 15 cm with midseason drawdown and 5 cm with midseason drawdown in the first growing season 15 cm continuous flood treatment had the highest reduction of total phosphorus and particulate phosphorus concentrations in drainage water however in the second growing season we did not observe significant differences among water treatments which was likely due to the release of phosphorus from other sources like soil and rice straw to the water column which masked treatment effects on average in both years all flood treatments reduced total phosphorus concentrations by 42 8 between inflow and outflow water no phosphorus fertilizer was added and with each harvest rice grain potentially removed 15 7 3 kg phosphorus ha 1 the results indicate that rice cultivation in fertile soils can successfully reduce phosphorus concentrations in drainage water under well managed water flow conditions keywords drainage water flood phosphorus rice water quality 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is one of the most widely grown cereals in the world and a staple food for more than 1 6 billion people in the everglades agricultural area eaa of south florida rice is produced together with sugarcane saccharum spp sod stenotaphrum secundatum walt kuntze and vegetables on 280 000 ha of organic soils rice in the eaa is often grown commercially in rotations with sugarcane and vegetables and from 2008 to 2015 rice production has increased more than 80 bhadha et al 2016 conventional rice production in the region does not include any nitrogen n phosphorus p or potassium k fertilization two most important requirements of the everglades forever act efa are to restore and protect the everglades ecological system and reduce excessive levels of p nearly 1110 million m3 of water discharges annually through the eaa soil and leaves the area in the south and southeast part bhadha et al 2017 therefore a major concern in the eaa is improving drainage water quality by reducing p concentrations in drainage water the long term water quality objective for the everglades is to implement the optimal combination of source controls stormwater treatment areas stas advanced treatment technologies and regulatory programs to ensure that all waters discharged to the everglades protection area achieve water quality standards consistent with the efa therefore as a major component of the efa stas were constructed and operated in south florida in addition to a mandatory best management practices bmp program in the eaa to remove p from upstream waters flowing into the downstream everglades protection area chimney and goforth 2001 daroub et al 2009 stormwater treatment areas retain p in different ways such as plant and microbial nutrient uptake particulate settling chemical sorption and ultimately accretion of plant and microbial biomass in the sediments andreotta et al 2015 planting rice as a cover crop is one of the bmps eaa farmers can implement to reduce drainage in the wet season and reduce oxidation of the organic soils the soils of this region are predominately histosols underlain by marl and limestone historically these wetland soils have been flooded for a long time therefore accumulation of organic matter under anaerobic condition and slow decomposition provided an extremely fertile soil with 50 90 organic matter content schueneman et al 2008 the study site was in the pahokee series euic hyperthermic lithic haplosaprist which consists of very poorly drained rapidly permeable soils formed in organic deposits of freshwater marshes janardhanan and daroub 2010 the soil series has 91 130 cm thick o horizon with less than 35 mineral material and a bulk density of about 0 47 g cm 3 with an underlying limestone layer the ph of the soils is neutral ranging between 6 8 7 1 it is suggested that the depth of the soil and proximity to the limestone bedrock may have a direct implication on drainage and quality of drainage water leaving these soils daroub et al 2011 rice can possibly accumulate nutrients during the summer season and immobilize the nutrients when the potential for nutrient rich water runoff is the greatest jones et al 1994 rice cultivation has the potential to alleviate short term nutrient loadings to the canals and has been identified as a bmp for nutrient removal in drainage water from surrounding fields izuno and bottcher 1991 south florida water management district 1997 however no local research has been conducted on flooded rice systems to quantify net p reductions although p exists in several chemical forms dodds 2003 earlier initiatives often adopted total p tp to support rehabilitation initiatives such as the total maximum daily load analysis process prestigiacomo et al 2016 partitioning p into different forms such as particulate p pp total dissolved p tdp and soluble reactive p srp provides valuable information for tracing p in environmental and agricultural systems in flooded rice cultivation when o2 becomes less available and soil redox potential becomes more reduced slow organic matter decomposition may result in accumulation of dissolved organic carbon doc moorberg et al 2015 and affect drainage water quality high concentrations of organic matter in the form of decomposed vegetation can drastically increase the availability of p because organic anions formed by decomposing organic matter can compete with p for the same adsorption sites such as clays and fe al minerals bhadha et al 2014 de groot and van wijck 1993 showed that when anoxic wetland soils were exposed to air the ferrous sulfide previously present was rapidly oxidized to amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide these ferric oxy hydroxides have both a large surface area and high affinity for srp however extended periods of desiccation lead to a significant reduction of the srp binding capacity of ferric hydroxides in both flooded and drained soils bhadha et al 2010 some growers apply a 2 4 week drainage period in the middle of growing season to reduce pumping costs which not only could alter p and carbon c status but also may release p into interstitial water at the time of harvest rice grain along with the husk is severed from the plant and only the roots and a portion of the stem is cultivated back into the soil in the eaa different water management scenarios need to be studied in order to select the most appropriate flooding system for rice fields reducing pumping costs and water conservation are also important concerns in increasing the production efficiency different flood depths and short term field drainage in the middle of growing season intermittent flood might have the potential to affect drainage water quality and rice yield therefore in this study we investigated the effects of four different flooding treatments on the quality of drainage water at a flooded rice field we compared p concentration in water samples collected from inflows and outflows of each treatment in two growing seasons to establish a p budget associated with the experimental rice field p content was evaluated in the harvested grain rice aboveground biomass aquatic vegetation and soil samples collected before and after each growing season the objectives of this study were to 1 assess effects of two different flood depths 15 cm and 5 cm flood and a single midseason drawdown on outflow drainage water p concentrations in the summer growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 2 estimate a p budget associated with the rice production system in the eaa 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design this study was conducted during summers of 2014 and 2015 in 16 individual plots 84 m 18 m in a 2 4 ha field at the university of florida everglades research and education center erec each water treatment 5 cm continuous flood cf5 5 cm intermittent flood if5 15 cm continuous flood cf15 and 15 cm intermittent flood if15 had 4 replications and common rice varieties in the eaa cheniere and taggart were planted within each plot as a conventional method both varieties were planted dry seeding on 1 1 ratio using disk cultivator and fertilized with iron sulfate 112 kg ha 1 in both years no fertilizer with n p and k or other chemicals except iron sulfate were applied to the experimental field 2 2 water management irrigation water was pumped from a nearby canal an electric pump distributed the water through 16 individual irrigation lines to the plots each plot had a separate inflow valve to control irrigation flow rate into the plot and an outflow box to control the water depth within the plot fig 1 all individual plots were separated by a 6 m levee bund in each growing season 16 weeks flooding started 3 weeks after planting with initial flooding depth of 2 cm in all plots and gradually increased to proposed depths within 2 weeks the water table was maintained by controlling the flow of water into each individual plot daily measurements of water height in individual plots were recorded to ensure steady stage height by adding riser boards to the outflow box the level of water in the plots was raised the high discharge rates were necessary because evapotranspiration et and seepage are high in this region evapotranspiration accounts for about 2 cm of water daily during the hot summer months a portion of the discharge water is circulated back into the fields via the main canal and not all of it is discharged off site in order to maintain a steady stage after the rains the raiser boards had to be removed and excess water allowed to drain off hydrologic inputs to the system include irrigation inflow and rainfall whereas the outputs include discharge outflow seepage and et depending on planting date of commercial rice in the eaa a midseason drawdown is done between mid may and end of july for our study in 2014 the drawdown was initiated on june 13th 60 days after planting and in 2015 it was initiated on june 15th 68 days after planting table 1 2 3 sampling collection and analysis water samples were collected 6 times in each growing season biweekly from inflow pipes and outflow boxes of all 16 plots n 192 fig 1 all water samples from inflow pipes and outflow boxes were collected within 15 min into polyethylene bottles and immediately transported to laboratory unfiltered water samples were used for tp analysis while filtered water samples 0 45 μm filters were used for tdp and srp analyses total p and tdp were manually digested with persulfate digestion method apha 1998 sm4500 p and analyzed using ascorbic acid colorimetric method epa 1983a method 365 1 on an aa3 automated segmented flow analyzer seal analytical mequon wi particulate p was calculated by subtracting tp and tdp results pp tp tdp

kyoto japan soil samples were collected in both years before planting and after harvest from 8 random locations within each of the 16 plots total 128 samples up to soil depth of 0 15 cm available p in soil was measured using both water extractable p pw and mehlich 3 extraction pm for pw extraction 4 ml of air dried soil was added to 50 ml distilled water and allowed to stand overnight samples were shaken for 50 min and after filtering through whatman 5 filter paper ascorbic acid and murphy riley solution were added for colorimetric analysis extraction for pm was done by adding 25 ml of mehlich 3 extractant to 2 5 cm3 of air dried soil mehlich 1984 samples were shaken for 5 min on a reciprocal shaker at low speed and filtered through whatman 42 filter paper extracted samples were mixed with ascorbic acid and boric acid for color development then both pw and pm extracted samples were analyzed for p by the colorimetric procedure pc 910 brinkmann colorimetric probe at 880 nm filter total p analysis was done by digesting ashed soil samples epa 1983c method 365 4 and measuring tp on alpkem auto analyzer o i analytical glattburgg zurich aquatic vegetation growing within the plots such as filamentous algae lyngbya wolie chara chara aspera and duckweed lemnoideae were sampled in both years late in the growing season 2 weeks before harvest using a 20 3 cm diameter core sampler from three random locations in each plot 0 097 m2 per plot to estimate their coverage and p content aquatic vegetation samples were gently rinsed with deionized water and dried for 1 2 week at 60 c before grinding ground samples were ashed at 500 c and then digested with 6 m hcl mylavarapu and moon 2002 samples were filtered through whatman 42 filter paper and analyzed for p using inductively coupled argon plasma icp optima 5300 dv 2 4 phosphorus and hydrological budget a phosphorus budget was estimated by calculating the amount of p that entered or existed from each experimental plot and reported per 1 ha unit for 84 d of flooding in each growing season phosphorus sources were inflow water soil tp and atmospheric deposition while outflow water aquatic vegetation and rice grain were considered as p sinks calculations of inflow water pumped from canals and outflow water drained out of plots were based on average rates of inflow pipes and drainage flows captured in the outflow box in each plot the calculated amount of water was then multiplied by average tp concentration in inflow and outflow water to quantify p distribution within each plot aquatic vegetation p removal was calculated based on tissue p concentration and their coverage within each plot whole grain rice grain with husk p content was multiplied by mean of harvested grain yield to estimate phosphorus removal via rice plants rainfall data was acquired from the erec weather station average rainfall in both growing seasons 2014 and 2015 was multiplied by wet and dry p deposition concentrations measured near erec experiment station by ahn and james 2001 to estimate overall atmospheric p deposition 2 5 statistical analyses water quality measurements and calculations were done based on six water samples collected and analyzed in each year 2014 and 2015 analyses of variance for water quality parameters aquatic vegetation weight soil nutrient analysis and aquatic vegetation nutrient analysis were performed in a split plot design using a mixed model in jmp 12 0 1 sas institute inc 2015 to determine statistically significant differences between treatments analysis of water quality parameters was done based on percent reductions of each parameter for each individual plot per treatment in comparison with inflow and outflow concentrations using standard least squares regression percent reduction for each of the four replications is estimated separately and the mean was used to represent the p reduction between inflow and outflow for that particular treatment data were analyzed for each year separately when results between years were significantly different analyses were also conducted with the combined data of both years for all measurements when differences between two growing seasons were not significant in analyses of separate years the four replications per treatment were classified as random effects for analyses combined across years the replications and year were classified as random effects water treatment parameters sample or week and interactions were treated as fixed effects differences between treatments were considered significant at p 0 05 tukey adjustment was used to determine significant differences among multiple comparisons between treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 water analysis measured tp concentrations at the experimental field in both 2014 and 2015 growing seasons were significantly higher in inflow compared to outflow water fig 2 in the 2014 growing season tp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 034 to 0 064 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 006 to 0 064 mg l 1 in the 2015 growing season tp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 033 to 0 066 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 009 to 0 048 mg l 1 mean differences between inflow and outflow water tp concentrations are shown in table 2 as percent reduction total p concentration reductions in 2014 were the highest in cf15 and lowest in if5 with 59 0 and 38 7 reductions respectively however tp reductions were not statistically different in 2015 among treatments and all treatments reduced tp concentration by an average of 36 8 the significant difference between tp concentration reductions among treatments in the 2014 growing season were due to reductions in pp and not tdp concentrations while in the 2015 neither pp nor tdp were significantly affected by treatments in order to explain the reductions in tp concentrations we took a closer look at tdp and pp concentrations and discussed them in detail in the 2014 growing season pp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 015 to 0 044 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 005 to 0 044 mg l 1 in the 2015 growing season pp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 017 to 0 043 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 006 to 0 030 mg l 1 all treatments reduced pp concentration in outflow water compared to inflow in the 2014 highest pp reduction was in cf15 with 53 6 while if5 and if15 had the lowest pp reduction with 24 2 and 39 6 respectively this might have been due to high rainfall during the drawdown period of if5 and if15 prior to week 10 in 2014 and just before the scheduled drawdown the plots received nearly 15 cm of rainfall in a 48 h period which would have exposed and disturbed the soils intermittent flood treatments if5 and if15 were not flooded during the drawdown period and at higher risk of soil disturbance the higher pp concentrations observed at week 10 in 2014 growing season supports this theory fig 3 a fraser et al 1999 were able to evaluate the effect of rainfall intensity on soil erosion and pp transfer from arable soils they estimated losses of over 300 g pp ha 1 h 1 induced by intense rainfall 9 0 mm ha 1 there was no major rainfall during the drawdown period in the 2015 growing season and water treatments did not show any significant differences related to pp reduction fig 3 it has been reported that in the eaa 20 70 of total p exported from agricultural fields is in particulate form diaz et al 2015 due to surface runoff soil erosion and canal sediment erosion which is highly dependent on management factors sedimentation or particulate settling is a major process in the removal of pp during surface runoff overland flow and floodplain inundation and hence can provide at least short term p reduction from surface waters hoffmann et al 2009 braskerud et al 2005 dorioz et al 2006 kim et al 2006 compared ponded and non ponded fields in korea and reported higher tp concentrations in non ponded fields as a result of p transport in particulate form after rainfall and storm events measured tdp concentrations showed a significant reduction when inflow water was compared to outflow in both years by 38 on average fig 4 in the 2014 growing season tdp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 018 to 0 042 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 008 to 0 021 mg l 1 in the 2015 growing season tdp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 011 to 0 028 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 003 to 0 020 mg l 1 other scientists have observed increased levels of tdp concentrations as a result of flooding organic soils snyder et al 1978 which might be due to solubilizing and mineralization of organic p reddy 1983 and solubilization of fe al and calcium phosphate mahapatra and patrick 1969 moreover turner and haygarth 2001 found evidence that p availability may increase by wetting and drying soil intermittent flood due to the release of p from dead microbes in our experiment highest tdp reduction in 2014 was observed in cf15 and lowest in if15 and cf5 with 55 7 43 3 and 35 4 reductions respectively however in 2015 the differences among treatments were not significant and all treatments reduced tdp concentrations by 32 0 on average table 2 dissolution of p under anaerobic condition is confirmed by other researchers while the precise location of dissolved p released in the soil matrix vs rhizosphere is not well known moorberg et al 2015 phosphorus is an important nutrient needed for rice plant growth and grain filling julia et al 2016 measured p uptake partitioning and redistribution in rice plant grown in p deficient and p sufficient fields they demonstrated that rice is always taking up p from soil and water even at late stages of growth for example only 20 of p at flowering was remobilized from vegetative tissues and p uptake from soil during grain filling was a critical contributor to the p content in grains decreased tdp concentrations in the experimental rice field drainage water might be a result of rice plant and aquatic vegetation uptake which is dependent on plants growth stage and aquatic vegetation coverage based on our observations around week 8 both aquatic vegetation and rice plants were well established in the fields and this may be the reason for observed low tdp values after week 8 these values for tdp are classified as the readily available p form srp and the relatively unavailable form dop in the 2014 growing season srp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 008 to 0 038 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 005 to 0 013 mg l 1 in the 2015 growing season srp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 015 to 0 033 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 010 to 0 030 mg l 1 on average srp concentration was reduced in 2014 and 2015 growing seasons by 44 8 and 12 2 respectively table 2 however water samples collected at week 14 in 2015 show an increase of 4 18 in srp concentrations fig 5 similar results were found by comín et al 2001 where at several rice paddies studied in spain srp concentrations in the outlet were even higher than the inlet and the efficiency for p removal ranged from negative to positive 254 to 98 several sources could have released p to the water column and contributed to higher srp in outflow water samples in the 2015 growing season phosphorus was probably released from straw as well as aquatic vegetation into the water column and contributed to higher srp in outflow water samples in the 2015 growing season gupta and ladha 2010 reported a continuous release of p from the decomposing straw left from pervious growing season a common practice after rice harvest in our experiment rice straw and aquatic vegetation detritus from the previous season were incorporated into the soil which probably released p in the 2015 growing season yan et al 2016 wu et al 2016 soils release p into the water column via biological and geochemical transformations such as microbial breakdown of organic matter and desorption of p from iron oxides gardner et al 2002 hoffmann et al 2009 bhadha et al 2010 verheyen et al 2015 in the 2014 growing season doc concentrations in inflow water ranged from 27 1 to 37 2 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 20 8 to 39 2 mg l 1 in the 2015 growing season doc concentrations in inflow water ranged from 15 5 to 44 6 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 21 3 to 43 7 mg l 1 moorberg et al 2015 stated that both doc molecules and phosphate compounds are negatively charged and may compete for cation bridges however no correlation was observed when different forms of p and doc concentrations from inflow and outflow water samples were plotted together and hence other factors might have influenced doc concentrations nevertheless organic soils have the potential to release doc into the soil pore water in response to flooding d angelo and reddy 1994 estimated concentrations for dop in the present study did not show any specific trends in the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons table 2 3 2 soil analysis soil tp concentrations in all plots were similar and averaged 926 mg kg 1 790 kg p ha 1 in 15 cm top soil available soil p concentrations extracted by deionized water pw and mehlich 3 pm show significantly higher levels of pm before planting compared to soil levels after the growing season in both years table 3 shows that pm content decreased from 36 4 mg kg 1 and 24 3 mg kg 1 to 17 2 mg kg 1 and 16 1 mg kg 1 after the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons respectively lower soil test p levels may be due to solubilization and release of p under flooded condition van dijk et al 2004 aldous et al 2007 ardón et al 2010 vepraskas 2010 and consequently higher plant and aquatic vegetation p uptake in 2014 pw decreased significantly in all treatments p 0 05 and in 2015 all soil samples had almost similar pw concentrations before planting and after harvest in general soil available p concentrations were similar among all treatments throughout both growing seasons table 3 3 3 hydrologic and phosphorus budget the hydrologic budget associated with the experimental rice field was established based on inflow outflow rainfall and et measurements fig 6 a inflow rates at all plots were very similar 445 66 m3 d 1 however outflow rates showed a large variation 161 88 m3 d 1 mainly because of highly varied porosity of bedrock at the experimental site which caused varied seepage and hence highly affected the hydrologic model the seepage and saturated hydraulic conductivity vertical of soils in this area vary widely harvey et al 2004 measured the mean hydraulic conductivity of the everglades at 6 59 cm day 1 and snyder in the soils of the eaa reports hydraulic conductivity of these soils at different depths ranging from 365 to 4649 cm day 1 bottcher 1994 although the saturated hydraulic conductivity of everglades soils is fairly high there is no place to which water can rapidly flow by gravity snyder 1994 the hydrologic budget presented in fig 6a represents all four water treatments ahn and james 2001 reported that atmospheric deposition could be a substantial source of p to the eaa to construct the p budget fig 6b we estimated p deposition at the experimental field based on wet and dry p deposition concentrations reported for erec experiment station and the average rainfall during both growing seasons and found negligible atmospheric p deposition 0 06 kg ha 1 phosphorus analysis done on the aquatic vegetation tissue showed very similar p concentrations in all the tissue samples collected from different treatments 1558 mg kg 1 p however significantly high amount of aquatic vegetation were observed in cf5 treatment in both years compared to other treatments therefore highest p removal was observed in cf5 with 2 64 kg p ha 1 per 84 d of flooding in both growing seasons overall short growing season and drawdown in the middle of growing season for half of the treatments if5 and if15 limited the growth of aquatic vegetation in our experimental field and hence average p removal via aquatic vegetation uptake was as low as 1 6 kg ha 1 based on average tp concentrations recorded from inflow and outflow water samples and amount of water pumped into each plot in both growing seasons each year 11 5 kg p ha 1 was pumped into the field and 2 9 kg p ha 1 exited the farm through outflow drainage system seepage was not measured in this study it was estimated as the net difference as part of the budget while the p concentration in the seepage is not known we used surface water concentrations for calculations as mentioned before there were variations in outflow rates which means that the amount of water in each plot could have been different leading to lower drainage water p concentrations in some plots based on these estimates more than 8 6 kg ha 1 of p was held inside each plot via sedimentation taken up by plant and aquatic vegetation or exited through seepage similarly sharpley et al 1994 found out that crop uptake and vegetative cover are able to reduce p from agricultural runoff therefore it is evident that aquatic vegetation and rice plant were temporary sinks for p and potentially sequester 1 6 kg p ha 1 and 15 7 kg p ha 1 by uptake respectively fig 6b reddy et al 2011 investigated p cycling in the eaa and showed that approximately 35 of tp in eaa soils is nonreactive and remaining 65 may be available for release at different time scales days to years measured tp concentration in soil at the experimental field was on average 926 mg kg 1 790 kg p ha 1 in 15 cm top soil and atmospheric deposition was 0 06 kg p ha 1 per growing season with no added p fertilization soil tp seems to be the dominant source of p in addition to the p in the inflow water capable of supplying essential p necessary for growing rice in the eaa 4 conclusions the goal of this two year was to evaluate the impacts of flooded rice production system on the everglades agricultural area water quality and identify an effective water management plan among all conventional methods used by local rice growers in both years of our study total phosphorus p concentrations were significantly reduced in the outflow drainage water compared to the inflow due to particulate settling seepage plant and aquatic vegetation uptake all flooding regimes reduced total p concentrations by 42 on average in both years of the study however in the first year 15 cm continuous flood treatment showed significantly higher reduction in total p and particulate p concentrations among all other treatments the p budget established for the rice fields suggests that inflow water and soil total p are the most important p sources and both years of results showed that soil available p concentrations were reduced when soil samples were compared before and after the growing season this suggests that flooding may impact soil by solubilizing p and make p more available for plant and aquatic vegetation uptake the studied rice production system can potentially reduce p in soil and water through net export from the farm because with each harvest rice grain containing 15 7 kg p ha 1 is removed from the system 
11430,phosphorus is a critical water quality indicator of farm drainage systems in south florida rice oryza sativa l cultivation has the potential to reduce phosphorus concentration in drainage water through crop uptake under varying flooding systems a two year study was conducted to assess drainage water quality under four different flooding systems conventionally used for rice production 15 cm continuous flood 5 cm continuous flood 15 cm with midseason drawdown and 5 cm with midseason drawdown in the first growing season 15 cm continuous flood treatment had the highest reduction of total phosphorus and particulate phosphorus concentrations in drainage water however in the second growing season we did not observe significant differences among water treatments which was likely due to the release of phosphorus from other sources like soil and rice straw to the water column which masked treatment effects on average in both years all flood treatments reduced total phosphorus concentrations by 42 8 between inflow and outflow water no phosphorus fertilizer was added and with each harvest rice grain potentially removed 15 7 3 kg phosphorus ha 1 the results indicate that rice cultivation in fertile soils can successfully reduce phosphorus concentrations in drainage water under well managed water flow conditions keywords drainage water flood phosphorus rice water quality 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is one of the most widely grown cereals in the world and a staple food for more than 1 6 billion people in the everglades agricultural area eaa of south florida rice is produced together with sugarcane saccharum spp sod stenotaphrum secundatum walt kuntze and vegetables on 280 000 ha of organic soils rice in the eaa is often grown commercially in rotations with

reduce drainage in the wet season and reduce oxidation of the organic soils the soils of this region are predominately histosols underlain by marl and limestone historically these wetland soils have been flooded for a long time therefore accumulation of organic matter under anaerobic condition and slow decomposition provided an extremely fertile soil with 50 90 organic matter content schueneman

soils is neutral ranging between 6 8 7 1 it is suggested that the depth of the soil and proximity to the limestone bedrock may have a direct implication on drainage and quality of drainage water

partitioning p into different forms such as particulate p pp total dissolved p tdp and soluble reactive p srp provides valuable information for tracing p in environmental and agricultural systems in flooded rice cultivation when o2 becomes less available and soil redox potential becomes more reduced slow organic matter decomposition may result in accumulation of dissolved organic carbon doc moorberg et al 2015 and affect drainage water quality high concentrations of organic matter in the form of decomposed vegetation can drastically increase the availability of p because organic anions formed by decomposing organic matter can compete with p for the same adsorption sites such as clays and fe al minerals bhadha et al 2014 de groot and van wijck 1993 showed that when anoxic wetland soils were exposed to air the ferrous sulfide previously present was rapidly oxidized to amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide these ferric oxy hydroxides have both a large surface area and high affinity for srp however extended periods of desiccation lead to a significant reduction of the srp binding capacity of ferric hydroxides in both flooded and drained soils bhadha et al 2010 some growers apply a 2 4 week drainage period in the middle of growing season to reduce pumping costs which not only could alter p and carbon c status but also may release p into interstitial water at the time of harvest rice grain along with the husk is severed from the plant and only the roots and a portion of the stem is cultivated back into the soil in the eaa different water management scenarios need to be studied in order to select the most appropriate flooding system for rice fields reducing pumping costs and water conservation are also important concerns in increasing the production efficiency different flood depths and short term field drainage in the middle of growing season intermittent flood might have the potential to affect drainage water quality and rice yield therefore in this study we investigated the effects of four different flooding treatments on the quality of drainage water at a flooded rice field we compared p concentration in water samples collected from inflows and outflows of each treatment in two growing seasons to establish a p budget associated with the experimental rice field p content was evaluated in the harvested grain rice aboveground biomass aquatic vegetation and soil samples collected before and after each growing season the objectives of this study were to 1 assess effects of two different flood depths 15 cm and 5 cm flood and a single midseason drawdown on outflow drainage water p concentrations in the summer growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 2 estimate a p budget associated with the rice production system in the eaa 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design this study was conducted during summers of 2014 and 2015 in 16 individual plots 84 m 18 m in a 2 4 ha field at the university of florida everglades research and education center erec each water treatment 5 cm continuous flood cf5 5 cm intermittent flood if5 15 cm continuous flood cf15 and 15 cm intermittent flood if15 had 4 replications and common rice varieties in the eaa cheniere and taggart were planted within each plot as a conventional method both varieties were planted dry seeding on 1 1 ratio using disk cultivator and fertilized with iron sulfate 112 kg ha 1 in both years no fertilizer with n p and k or other chemicals except iron sulfate were applied to the experimental field 2 2 water management irrigation water was pumped from a nearby canal an electric pump distributed the water through 16 individual irrigation lines to the plots each plot had a separate inflow valve to control irrigation flow rate into the plot and an outflow box to control the water depth within the plot fig 1 all individual plots were separated by a 6 m levee bund in each growing season 16 weeks flooding started 3 weeks after planting with initial flooding depth of 2 cm in all plots and gradually increased to proposed depths within 2 weeks the water table was maintained by controlling the flow of water into each individual plot daily measurements of water height in individual plots were recorded to ensure steady stage height by adding riser boards to the outflow box the level of water in the plots was raised the high discharge rates were necessary because evapotranspiration et and seepage are high in this region evapotranspiration accounts for about 2 cm of water daily during the hot summer months a portion of the discharge water is circulated back into the fields via the main canal and not all of it is discharged off site in order to maintain a steady stage after the rains the raiser boards had to be removed and excess water allowed to drain off hydrologic inputs to the system include irrigation inflow and rainfall whereas the outputs include discharge outflow seepage and et depending on planting date of commercial rice in the eaa a midseason drawdown is done between mid may and end of july for our study in 2014 the drawdown was initiated on june 13th 60 days after planting and in 2015 it was initiated on june 15th 68 days after planting table 1 2 3 sampling collection and analysis water samples were collected 6 times in each growing season biweekly from inflow pipes and outflow boxes of all 16 plots n 192

filamentous algae lyngbya wolie chara chara aspera and duckweed lemnoideae were sampled in both years late in the growing season 2 weeks before harvest using a 20 3 cm diameter core sampler from three random locations in each plot 0 097 m2 per plot to estimate their coverage and p content aquatic vegetation samples were gently rinsed with deionized water and dried for 1 2 week at 60 c before grinding ground samples were ashed at 500 c and then digested with 6 m hcl mylavarapu and moon 2002 samples were filtered through whatman 42 filter paper and analyzed for p using inductively coupled argon plasma icp optima 5300 dv 2 4 phosphorus and hydrological budget a phosphorus budget was estimated by calculating the amount of p that entered or existed from each experimental plot and reported per 1 ha unit for 84 d of flooding in each growing season phosphorus sources were inflow water soil tp and atmospheric deposition while outflow water aquatic vegetation and rice grain were considered as p sinks calculations of inflow water pumped from canals and outflow water drained out of plots were based on average rates of inflow pipes and drainage flows captured in the outflow box in each plot the calculated amount of water was then multiplied by average tp concentration in inflow and outflow water to quantify p distribution within each plot aquatic vegetation p removal was calculated based on tissue p concentration and their coverage within each plot whole grain rice grain with husk p content was multiplied by mean of harvested grain yield to estimate phosphorus removal via rice plants rainfall data was acquired from the erec weather station average rainfall in both growing seasons 2014 and 2015 was multiplied by wet and dry p deposition concentrations measured near erec experiment station by ahn and james 2001 to estimate overall atmospheric p deposition 2 5 statistical analyses water quality measurements and calculations were done based on six water samples collected and analyzed in each year 2014 and 2015 analyses of variance for water quality parameters aquatic vegetation weight soil nutrient analysis and aquatic vegetation nutrient analysis were performed in a split plot design using a mixed model in jmp 12 0 1 sas institute inc 2015 to determine statistically significant differences between treatments analysis of water quality parameters was done based on percent reductions of each parameter for each individual plot per treatment in comparison with inflow and outflow concentrations using standard least squares regression percent reduction for each of the four replications is estimated separately and the mean was used to represent the p reduction between inflow and outflow for that particular treatment data were analyzed for each year separately when results between years were significantly different analyses were also conducted with the combined data of both years for all measurements when differences between two growing seasons were not significant in analyses of separate years the four replications per treatment were classified as random effects for analyses combined across years the replications and year were classified as random effects water treatment parameters sample or week and interactions were treated as fixed effects differences between treatments were considered significant at p 0 05 tukey adjustment was used to determine significant differences among multiple comparisons between treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 water analysis measured tp concentrations at the experimental field in both 2014 and 2015 growing seasons were significantly higher in inflow compared to outflow water fig 2 in the 2014 growing season tp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 034 to 0 064 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 006 to 0 064 mg l 1 in the 2015 growing season tp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 033 to 0 066 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 009 to 0 048 mg l 1 mean differences between inflow and outflow water tp concentrations are shown in table 2 as percent reduction total p concentration reductions in 2014 were the highest in cf15 and lowest in if5 with 59 0 and 38 7 reductions respectively however tp reductions were not statistically different in 2015 among treatments and all treatments reduced tp concentration by an average of 36 8 the significant difference between tp concentration reductions among treatments in the 2014 growing season were due to reductions in pp and not tdp concentrations while in the 2015 neither pp nor tdp were significantly affected by treatments in order to explain the reductions in tp concentrations we took a closer look at tdp and pp concentrations and discussed them in detail in the 2014 growing season pp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 015 to 0 044 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 005 to 0 044 mg l 1 in the 2015 growing season pp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 017 to 0 043 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 006 to 0 030 mg l 1 all treatments reduced pp concentration in outflow water compared to inflow in the 2014 highest pp reduction was in cf15 with 53 6 while if5 and if15 had the lowest pp reduction with 24 2 and 39 6 respectively this might have been due to high rainfall during the drawdown period of if5 and if15 prior to week 10 in 2014 and just before the scheduled drawdown the plots received nearly 15 cm of rainfall in a 48 h period which would have exposed and disturbed the soils intermittent flood treatments if5 and if15 were not flooded during the drawdown period and at higher risk of soil disturbance the higher pp concentrations observed at week 10 in 2014 growing season supports this theory fig 3 a fraser et al 1999 were able to evaluate the effect of rainfall intensity on soil erosion and pp transfer from arable soils they estimated losses of over 300 g pp ha 1 h 1 induced by intense rainfall 9 0 mm ha 1 there was no major rainfall during the drawdown period in the 2015 growing season and water treatments did not show any significant differences related to pp reduction fig 3 it has been reported that in the eaa 20 70 of total p exported from agricultural fields is in particulate form diaz et al 2015 due to surface runoff soil erosion and canal sediment erosion which is highly dependent on management factors sedimentation or particulate settling is a major process in the removal of pp during surface runoff overland flow and floodplain inundation and hence can provide at least short term p reduction from surface waters hoffmann et al 2009 braskerud et al 2005 dorioz et al 2006 kim et al 2006 compared ponded and non ponded fields in korea and reported higher tp concentrations in non ponded fields as a result of p transport in particulate form after rainfall and storm events measured tdp concentrations showed a significant reduction when inflow water was compared to outflow in both years by 38 on average fig 4 in the 2014 growing season tdp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 018 to 0 042 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 008 to 0 021 mg l 1 in the 2015 growing season tdp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 011 to 0 028 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 003 to 0 020 mg l 1 other scientists have observed increased levels of tdp concentrations as a result of flooding organic soils snyder et al 1978 which might be due to solubilizing and mineralization of organic p reddy 1983 and solubilization of fe al and calcium phosphate mahapatra and patrick 1969 moreover turner and haygarth 2001 found evidence that p availability may increase by wetting and drying soil intermittent flood due to the release of p from dead microbes in our experiment highest tdp reduction in 2014 was observed in cf15 and lowest in if15 and cf5 with 55 7 43 3 and 35 4 reductions respectively however in 2015 the differences among treatments were not significant and all treatments reduced tdp concentrations by 32 0 on average table 2 dissolution of p under anaerobic condition is confirmed by other researchers while the precise location of dissolved p released in the soil matrix vs rhizosphere is not well known moorberg et al 2015 phosphorus is an important nutrient needed for rice plant growth and grain filling julia et al 2016 measured p uptake partitioning and redistribution in rice plant grown in p deficient and p sufficient fields they demonstrated that rice is always taking up p from soil and water even at late stages of growth for example only 20 of p at flowering was remobilized from vegetative tissues and p uptake from soil during grain filling was a critical contributor to the p content in grains decreased tdp concentrations in the experimental rice field drainage water might be a result of rice plant and aquatic vegetation uptake which is dependent on plants growth stage and aquatic vegetation coverage based on our observations around week 8 both aquatic vegetation and rice plants were well established in the fields and this may be the reason for observed low tdp values after week 8 these values for tdp are classified as the readily available p form srp and the relatively unavailable form dop in the 2014 growing season srp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 008 to 0 038 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 005 to 0 013 mg l 1 in the 2015 growing season srp concentrations in inflow water ranged from 0 015 to 0 033 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 0 010 to 0 030 mg l 1 on average srp concentration was reduced in 2014 and 2015 growing seasons by 44 8 and 12 2 respectively table 2 however water samples collected at week 14 in 2015 show an increase of 4 18 in srp concentrations fig 5 similar results were found by comín et al 2001 where at several rice paddies studied in spain srp concentrations in the outlet were even higher than the inlet and the efficiency for p removal ranged from negative to positive 254 to 98 several sources could have released p to the water column and contributed to higher srp in outflow water samples in the 2015 growing season phosphorus was probably released from straw as well as aquatic vegetation into the water column and contributed to higher srp in outflow water samples in the 2015 growing season gupta and ladha 2010 reported a continuous release of p from the decomposing straw left from pervious growing season a common practice after rice harvest in our experiment rice straw and aquatic vegetation detritus from the previous season were incorporated into the soil which probably released p in the 2015 growing season yan et al 2016 wu et al 2016 soils release p into the water column via biological and geochemical transformations such as microbial breakdown of organic matter and desorption of p from iron oxides gardner et al 2002 hoffmann et al 2009 bhadha et al 2010 verheyen et al 2015 in the 2014 growing season doc concentrations in inflow water ranged from 27 1 to 37 2 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 20 8 to 39 2 mg l 1 in the 2015 growing season doc concentrations in inflow water ranged from 15 5 to 44 6 mg l 1 and outflow water ranged from 21 3 to 43 7 mg l 1 moorberg et al 2015 stated that both doc molecules and phosphate compounds are negatively charged and may compete for cation bridges however no correlation was observed when different forms of p and doc concentrations from inflow and outflow water samples were plotted together and hence other factors might have influenced doc concentrations nevertheless organic soils have the potential to release doc into the soil pore water in response to flooding d angelo and reddy 1994 estimated concentrations for dop in the present study did not show any specific trends in the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons table 2 3 2 soil analysis soil tp concentrations in all plots were similar and averaged 926 mg kg 1 790 kg p ha 1 in 15 cm top soil available soil p concentrations extracted by deionized water pw and mehlich 3 pm show significantly higher levels of pm before planting compared to soil levels after the growing season in both years table 3 shows that pm content decreased from 36 4 mg kg 1 and 24 3 mg kg 1 to 17 2 mg kg 1 and 16 1 mg kg 1 after the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons respectively lower soil test p levels may be due to solubilization and release of p under flooded condition van dijk et al 2004 aldous et al 2007 ardón et al 2010 vepraskas 2010 and consequently higher plant and aquatic vegetation p uptake in 2014 pw decreased significantly in all treatments p 0 05 and in 2015 all soil samples had almost similar pw concentrations before planting and after harvest in general soil available p concentrations were similar among all treatments throughout both growing seasons table 3 3 3 hydrologic and phosphorus budget the hydrologic budget associated with the experimental rice field was established based on inflow outflow rainfall and et measurements fig 6 a inflow rates at all plots were very similar 445 66 m3 d 1 however outflow rates showed a large variation 161 88 m3 d 1 mainly because of highly varied porosity of bedrock at the experimental site which caused varied seepage and hence highly affected the hydrologic model the seepage and saturated hydraulic conductivity vertical of soils in this area vary widely harvey et al 2004 measured the mean hydraulic conductivity of the everglades at 6 59 cm day 1 and snyder in the soils of the eaa reports hydraulic conductivity of these soils at different depths ranging from 365 to 4649 cm day 1 bottcher 1994 although the saturated hydraulic conductivity of everglades soils is fairly high there is no place to which water can rapidly flow by gravity snyder 1994 the hydrologic budget presented in fig 6a represents all four water treatments ahn and james 2001 reported that atmospheric deposition could be a substantial source of p to the eaa to construct the p budget fig 6b we estimated p deposition at the experimental field based on wet and dry p deposition concentrations reported for erec experiment station and the average rainfall during both growing seasons and found negligible atmospheric p deposition 0 06 kg ha 1 phosphorus analysis done on the aquatic vegetation tissue showed very similar p concentrations in all the tissue samples collected from different treatments 1558 mg kg 1 p however significantly high amount of aquatic vegetation were observed in cf5 treatment in both years compared to other treatments therefore highest p removal was observed in cf5 with 2 64 kg p ha 1 per 84 d of flooding in both growing seasons overall short growing season and drawdown in the middle of growing season for half of the treatments if5 and if15 limited the growth of aquatic vegetation in our experimental field and hence average p removal via aquatic vegetation uptake was as low as 1 6 kg ha 1 based on average tp concentrations recorded from inflow and outflow water samples and amount of water pumped into each plot in both growing seasons each year 11 5 kg p ha 1 was pumped into the field and 2 9 kg p ha 1 exited the farm through outflow drainage system seepage was not measured in this study it was estimated as the net difference as part of the budget while the p concentration in the seepage is not known we used surface water concentrations for calculations as mentioned before there were variations in outflow rates which means that the amount of water in each plot could have been different leading to lower drainage water p concentrations in some plots based on these estimates more than 8 6 kg ha 1 of p was held inside each plot via sedimentation taken up by plant and aquatic vegetation or exited through seepage similarly sharpley et al 1994 found out that crop uptake and vegetative cover are able to reduce p from agricultural runoff therefore it is evident that aquatic vegetation and rice plant were temporary sinks for p and potentially sequester 1 6 kg p ha 1 and 15 7 kg p ha 1 by uptake respectively fig 6b reddy et al 2011 investigated p cycling in the eaa and showed that approximately 35 of tp in eaa soils is nonreactive and remaining 65 may be available for release at different time scales days to years measured tp concentration in soil at the experimental field was on average 926 mg kg 1 790 kg p ha 1 in 15 cm top soil and atmospheric deposition was 0 06 kg p ha 1 per growing season with no added p fertilization soil tp seems to be the dominant source of p in addition to the p in the inflow water capable of supplying essential p necessary for growing rice in the eaa 4 conclusions the goal of this two year was to evaluate the impacts of flooded rice production system on the everglades agricultural area water quality and identify an effective water management plan among all conventional methods used by local rice growers in both years of our study total phosphorus p concentrations were significantly reduced in the outflow drainage water compared to the inflow due to particulate settling seepage plant and aquatic vegetation uptake all flooding regimes reduced total p concentrations by 42 on average in both years of the study however in the first year 15 cm continuous flood treatment showed significantly higher reduction in total p and particulate p concentrations among all other treatments the p budget established for the rice fields suggests that inflow water and soil total p are the most important p sources and both years of results showed that soil available p concentrations were reduced when soil samples were compared before and after the growing season this suggests that flooding may impact soil by solubilizing p and make p more available for plant and aquatic vegetation uptake the studied rice production system can potentially reduce p in soil and water through net export from the farm because with each harvest rice grain containing 15 7 kg p ha 1 is removed from the system 
11431,irrigation performance assessment is particularly important in the water users associations wuas operating in calabria southern italy where collective irrigation service suffers from poor performances both from an operative and economic point of view for many years data envelopment analysis dea has been proposed for the diagnosis of water users association performance however the number and type of related performance indicators must be selected with caution to avoid misleading and unrealistic results in this paper we propose to apply dea to a limited but significant set of performance indicators and to couple it to multiple regression analysis by principal component regression pcr the proposed methods were applied to evaluating the system operation and financial performances of ten of the eleven wuas operating in calabria southern italy to indicate potential improvements the analysis of the current performance indicators collected throughout five years 2011 2015 showed that in calabrian wuas the irrigation service is underutilised and water delivered to crops is always in excess the cost recovery of wuas is very low because of staff costs and low fee collection dea identified five inefficient wuas and took the remaining five organisations as reference for performance improvement the input oriented dea coupled to pcr has suggested reducing water usage management and personnel costs and water fees by increasing the irrigated area and the irrigation service coverage the output output oriented dea coupled to pcr predicted a high increase of the cost recovery capacity of the inefficient wuas but in this case the improved scenario required an abnormal increase 10 fold of the irrigated area which may be basically unfeasible overall the integration of dea with multi regression models and their implementation in the case study using a limited set of easy to survey performance indicators appears to be a powerful and easy tool for

parts of the world as for instance in southern italy and spain irrigation water is usually supplied from sources and delivered to farms by water users associations wuas the evaluation of performances in these collective irrigation systems is often neglected also because it is considered a time consuming and costly activity whose results are appreciable only in the long term malano et al 2004 the need for such assessment activities is particularly important in the wuas operating in calabria southern italy here the collective irrigation service suffers from poor performances both from an operative and economic point of view in a region where agriculture is by far the most important economic sector zema et al 2015 farmers use large volumes of water to irrigate crops with low requirements or pump groundwater when water supplied from surface water sources is sufficient in such contexts the evaluation of wua performance is an important management tool to aid in providing a sound irrigation service because it may support the system management in the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of an organisation and in the improvement of the organisation s performance and productivity taking into account its objectives alcón et al 2017 one of the most widely used tools for irrigation performance assessment is benchmarking a set of techniques able to identify the gaps between current and achievable performance and making changes to realise a higher standard of performance malano et al 2004 benchmarking techniques are often applied to water users associations by calculating and processing the so called performance indicators these techniques consider different performance indicators summarising the main management traits to describe and compare the management of the analysed wuas soto garcía et al 2013 benchmarking of collective agencies managing irrigation services is relatively recent and some mathematical statistical techniques such as principal component analysis pca agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc quality index qi calculation have been applied and validated in different areas worldwide for benchmarking as regards the mediterranean basin which shares similar climatic and structural conditions with italian agriculture the following studies of can be cited zema et al 2015 and rodrìguez dìaz et al 2008 used pca ahc and qi in calabria italy and andalusia spain respectively córcoles et al 2010 2012 applied ahc in wuas of castilla la mancha spain uysal and atış 2010 and koç and bayazit 2015 processed the performance indicators however if applied to collective irrigation just as a comparative assessment of performance indicators benchmarking may provide an incomplete picture and such assessment may be difficult to interpret malano et al 2004 therefore other tools are required incorporating diagnostic analysis to identify those factors which majorly contribute to improving the levels of irrigation service performance data envelopment analysis dea is a non parametric linear programming method that works with input output ratios to calculate relative efficiencies of organisations this method has been proposed for benchmarking performance in service sectors such as irrigation and drainage because it has a number of advantages firstly dea has the ability to analyse several inputs and outputs simultaneously and derive an efficiency rating within a set of analysed units secondly dea does not require the development of standards against which efficiency is measured thirdly it does not require predetermined production functions to relate inputs and outputs malano et al 2004 however dea has so far found little application in irrigation except for few literature studies rodrìguez dìaz et al 2008 borgia et al 2013 frija et al 2009 to summarise in irrigation districts of andalusia spain rodrìguez dìaz et al 2008 found by dea great differences in terms of performance between districts with open channel and pressure water delivery systems water use was more efficient in districts where users were charged per unit of irrigation water consumed dea and ahc applied by borgia et al 2013 in irrigation schemes of mauritania demonstrated that on a technical basis large schemes performed similarly to small scale schemes while these latter showed greater variability of crop yield and technical efficiency which may indicate a larger margin for improvement the dea by borgia et al 2013 also helped to identify the specific reference schemes for each low performing scheme the use of dea and a tobit model in wuas of tunisia highlighted that management and maintenance are important tasks in determining the overall performance and efficiency frija et al 2009 moreover when applying dea for benchmarking of irrigation performance a degree of caution must be exercised in the number and selection of variables to be analysed and processed as a matter of fact the selection of variables must be closely related to the objectives of the study and the productive process being evaluated in addition there is the risk that the adoption of too many performance indicators would allow dea to consider all or the majority of the analysed wuas efficient and thus it would not provide any information about deviations of current situation from optimal management malana and malano 2006 alcón et al 2017 according to soto garcía et al 2013 the performance indicators should be i easy to obtain from data routinely collected in the wuas ii mostly oriented towards aspects related to wua management and iii suitable for the purpose of each specific study therefore a limited set of non redundant performance indicators but representative of as many as possible of the productive factors of wuas must be chosen for dea application at the irrigation sector in order to determine the relative efficiency of a wua and its position in relation to the optimal situation other non parametric techniques such as multi regression models can be integrated to dea and applied to the performance indicators not considered by dea itself this paper proposes a novel approach to optimise wua performance by benchmarking applying dea to a limited but significant set of performance indicators and coupling it to multiple regression analysis by principal component regression pcr in order to improve the performance of ten wuas operating in calabria the combination of these techniques is targeted to fully delineate the performances of the inefficient wuas under an optimised management scenario taking as reference a sample of efficient wuas and using the values of a set of operation and financial performance indicators collected throughout five years this aggregated diagnosis of current status and the prediction of future performance may be useful to the decision makers to give them a concrete idea about the overall performance of an irrigation scheme vis à vis other irrigation schemes phadnis and kuhlshrestha 2013 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the region of calabria is located in the extreme southern part of italian peninsula its climate can be classified as csa mild temperate dry and hot summer in coastal zones and csb mild temperate dry and warm summer in internal areas according the koppen geiger classification kottek et al 2006 agriculture in calabria is practised both on the few plains and in the hills the majority of the cultivated areas are irrigated farmers commonly use collective irrigation systems managed by 11 wuas called in italian consorzi di irrigazione e bonifica operating in the territory of calabria fig 1 many of these wuas are also involved in land reclamation dealing with soil conservation and watershed management but with a role limited to ordinary maintenance each wua manages a part of the calabrian territory administrated area and controls all the irrigation systems within its own part command area irrigation water is delivered only to the areas covered by crops irrigated area the ten investigated wuas together cover over 86 of the irrigated territory of calabria olive and citrus groves and vineyards are the dominant tree crops beside vegetables corn and forage as herbaceous crops table 1 water is supplied from small rivers and natural or artificial reservoirs except for wuas bscs airc and birc exploiting also groundwater and is distributed to farmers mainly by rotational systems except tcz some wuas have recently begun to turn to on demand system e g icz network conduits are mainly pressurised pipelines but open canals still exist in many wuas from wua bulletins water for irrigation is usually sufficient for the entire season even though occasionally some periods of shortage are recorded farmers use mainly surface and sprinkler irrigation systems with a low percentage making use of micro irrigation mainly in wua bics water is charged to farmers on the basis of the irrigated area often differentiating by crop only in the wua icz farmers pay irrigation volumes effectively consumed thanks to the adoption of automated measuring devices table 1 2 2 performance indicators for the quantitative analysis of wua performance malano and burton 2001 have proposed a set of performance indicators service delivery productive efficiency and environmental performance the performance indicators used in this study were selected based on both the availability of input data at the investigated wuas and findings of some authors in more detail the indicators of agricultural productivity and economics were not considered since data of agricultural production and gross net margins are not easily available for each farm or irrigation district but are aggregated only at provincial or regional scales the calculation of the indicators related to the environmental performance was not possible because the analysed wuas do not evaluate the irrigation water quality parameters and use of fertilizers however córcoles et al 2010 stated that it is possible to reduce the set of indicators by omitting just the production efficiency and environmental indicators without loosing too much information therefore in this study the attention was mainly paid to the indicators of service delivery performance which include a the adequacy with which the organization manages the operation of the irrigation delivery system to satisfy the water required by users system operation and b the efficiency with which the organization uses resources to provide this service financial performance more specifically service delivery indicators include aspects such as water distribution and irrigation areas while financial indicators are related to distribution of the total management operation and maintenance mom cost of the irrigation district corcoles et al 2016 ghazalli 2004 most of these indicators have strong interrelations for example the main differences among some indicators lie in considering different types of unit areas command or irrigated and volume of irrigation water supplied delivered consumed required córcoles et al 2010 therefore the service delivery indicators were properly selected considering those related to the size of the system water usage and financial and organisation aspects these data concerned as regards the size of the system administrative area aa ha command area ca ha and irrigated area ia ha understood as the total area under the administration of each wua the area equipped with irrigation infrastructure and actual irrigated area during the five years covered respectively number of users nu the number of farmers who are members of each wua and serviced by the collective irrigation system for this service water fees are invoiced and collected by the wuas average irrigated area per farm aia ha concerning the water usage annual volume of irrigation water delivery viwd m3 yr 1 calculated as the product of discharge measured by weir by distribution times in open canals or directly by counters in pipelines annual volume of irrigation water required viwr m3 yr 1 this latter parameter was calculated for each wuas as a weighted mean of covered areas by the net irrigation requirement of each crop that is the quantity of water exclusive of precipitation required for normal crop production the net irrigation requirement was estimated using the software cropwat 8 0 clarke et al 1998 fao 2009 and performing the daily water balance for each crop over the five years the daily meteorological data required by cropwat maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation relative humidity wind speed and daylight were measured selecting for each wua a barycentric meteorological station in relation to the crop data the root depth and crop coefficients for calculating evapo transpiration estimated by penman monteith model were derived from fao guidelines doorenbos and kassam 1986 the farm cultivation practices i e dates and operations were identified by interviewing the wuas managers soil hydrological parameters in the absence of direct measurements were estimated using the pedo transfer function of saxton et al 1986 on the basis of the soil texture reported by the soil map of the calabria region arssa 2003 the total irrigation requirement of each crop was calculated from the net irrigation requirement considering farm irrigation efficiency according to the methods commonly used in each cropped area for sprinklers the value of 0 70 was assumed while the values of 0 85 sprayers and 0 95 drippers were considered for micro irrigation in accordance with the cropwat guidelines clarke et al 1998 fao 2009 finally daily data of total irrigation requirement were aggregated at an annual scale the following financial and organisation variables gross revenue invoiced and gross revenue collected gri and grc yr 1 that is the annual revenues due from water users for provision of irrigation services and collected fee actually paid annual management operation and maintenance costs momc yr 1 providing the service staff maintenance energy management and other costs excluding capital expenditure and depreciation renewals number of personnel employed in the provision of the irrigation service npi these input data allowed the computation of the following indicators regarding service delivery performance and wuas financial performance beside each indicator its meaning is explained irrigated area command area ratio icr equal to ia ca which is an indicator of the coverage of the irrigation service over each wua command area it is also known as cropping intensity since it represents the actual intensity of land utilisation during the year corcoles et al 2016 annual irrigation water delivery per unit of irrigated area wdia m3 ha 1 yr 1 the most important service delivery performance indicator malano et al 2004 frija et al 2009 annual relative irrigation supplied ris calculated as the ratio between wdia and viwr this latter divided by the irrigated area ia thus ris 100 indicates that the water supply is insufficient to satisfy full irrigation demand while ris 100 indicates that an excess of water is applied therefore ris is a measure of the degree of irrigation requirement fulfilment annual management operation and maintenance cost per unit area moma ha 1 yr 1 ratio between momc and ia which standardizes the management costs on the irrigated area moma can be calculated either including or not including the cost of personnel in mom however given that this cost is generally proportional to the staff size the differences of salaries among employees being very low regardless of their jobs already included in npi and suia parameters we have excluded the staff cost in calculating moma henceforth indicated as moma cost recovery ratio crr calculated as the ratio between grc and momc which represents an index of the degree of financial self sufficiency of the wua hereafter crr will be indicated as crr the superscript indicating that the cost of personnel was included in momc required by crr revenue collection performance rcp calculated as the ratio between grc and gri indicating the wua s capacity of due fee collecting koç 2007 staffing number per unit irrigated area suia persons 100 ha 1 the ratio between npi and ia this indicator is also called personnel intensity by yercan et al 2009 cost of the irrigation service per unit of irrigated area cis ha 1 yr 1 which is the unit fee paid by users to the wuas for the irrigation service note that cis and moma measure different variables while moma is the cost of the irrigation service incurred by a wua cis is the price of the irrigation service provided by a wua to the farmers alone this latter does not cover the mom costs since an important share of the wuas revenues is usually covered by regional funds for some of the indicators used in this study literature e g bekisoglu 1994 vermillion 2000 nelson 2002 yercan et al 2009 reports the following acceptance limits to which the values detected in this study were compared rcp and crr poor if 40 acceptable if in the range 40 60 satisfactory if between 60 and 75 and good if 75 icr poor if 30 acceptable if in the range 30 40 satisfactory if between 40 and 50 and good if 50 suia poor if 0 3 persons per 100 ha satisfactory if 0 3 persons per 100 ha 2 3 data collection the methodology was applied to ten of the eleven wuas in calabria one of the wuas did not provide data a questionnaire was given to the managers and technicians in order to collect the input parameters needed to calculate the performance indicators the questionnaire complemented the information contained in the annual reports produced by the wuas the collected data covered five years 2011 2015 2 4 statistical analysis in order to identify possible mathematical structures between performance indicators and the related correlation coefficients the spearman correlation matrix was computed based on the current values of indicators surveyed in the analysed wuas preliminarily the indicators were standardised by converting data to zero mean and unit variance the benchmarking process of irrigation performance in the ten wuas of calabria was carried out by coupling dea and pcr as explained below in order to reduce the number of the analysed variable these techniques were applied only to the performance indicators icr wdia ris crr moma rcp suia and cis besides two other input parameters measuring the wua size that is ia and un and not to all the variables including the other input parameters surveyed at the wuas this choice derives from findings of some authors who state that most of the indicators usually utilised in benchmarking the irrigation performance have strong interrelations with each other 2 4 1 data envelopment analysis dea developed by charnes cooper and rhodes in 1978 was previously applied in the irrigation sector e g rodrìguez dìaz et al 2004a b 2008 borgia et al 2013 frija et al 2009 to evaluate the efficiency of a given wua compared to a group of representative wuas considered efficient and thus assumed as reference and identify the optimal management scenario on a quantitative approach dea belongs to the set of efficient frontier techniques allowing the comparison of less efficient to more efficient organisations these latter falling on the frontier malano et al 2004 in dea the frontier function is constructed using virtual units that are weighted combinations of observed most efficient decision making units dmus coelli et al 2005 in this study dea was implemented by an input oriented i o and an output oriented o o model the i o model measures the ability of a dmu in our case a wua to maintain the same capacity of production using a minimum of inputs cooper et al 2004 irrigated agriculture relies on finite and scarce water resources and in its current situation agriculture in europe does not need increased production but rather a more efficient use of inputs rodrìguez dìaz et al 2004a frija et al 2009 therefore in our study the use of i o dea was considered more appropriate to reduce inputs consumed in the production process malana and malano 2006 ia is the constant output for the efficient wuas for the inefficient wuas all the performance indicators related to wua management efficiency included ia are optimised the o o model refers to the capacity of a dmu to achieve the maximum volume of production output with the available inputs in our study since we want to maximize the financial performance of some inefficient wuas we adopted also an o o dea using as input factors the same parameters as the i o dea but we adopted crr as output the o o dea predicts to what extent managers can increase the financial self sufficiency measured by crr of the inefficient wuas by modifying the performance levels one of the analysis options in dea is a choice between constant returns to scale and variable returns to scale frija et al 2009 since the scale of activity that is the size of the wuas has an important effect on its efficiency umetsu et al 2005 we decided to adopt the variable return to scale increasing returns to scale indicate that an increase in the input resources produces more than proportionate increase in outputs similarly decreasing returns to scale suggest a less than proportionate increase in the outputs in response to an increase in inputs malana and malano 2006 2 4 2 multiple regression analysis by principal component regression pcr considering that dea was applied to a limited set of performance indicators it is necessary to estimate the values of the remaining indicators in the target scenarios for the inefficient wuas to this aim predictive models were built between the five performance indicators used by deas independent variables and the remaining five indicators dependent variables to be predicted principal component regression pcr massy 1965 was used as predictive model pcr is a combination of principal component analysis pca and multiple linear regression mlr often an ordinary least squares ols regression where the principal component pc scores are used as predictor variables and linear combinations are constructed between predictor and response variables pcr is advised when the factors are many and highly collinear wold 1975 as a matter of fact many pairs of performance indicators adopted in our study were strongly correlated as shown by the spearman s correlation matrix and therefore collinear since principal components pc are orthogonal the multicollinearity problems of the original variables are removed carrascal et al 2009 pcr was implemented in the efficient wuas as follows i a pca was applied to the five independent variables used by dea ii an ols regression was run on the first two pcs iii the dependent variables were calculated as a linear combination of the pcs explaining most of the variance of the original independent variables iv in these linear equations the scores of pcs were replaced by the scores calculated referring to the original independent variables that is those used by deas pcr was calibrated for the efficient wuas using the values of the five dea performance indicators for the current scenario the derived linear equations were applied to the inefficient wuas in order to predict the target values of the remaining indicators based on the target values of performance indicators provided by dea fig 2 reports the conceptual scheme of coupling deas and pcr to summarise pcr provides a linear function f x which receives as input the five performance indicators x used by dea and predicts the remaining indicators y this funcion is calibrated on the efficient wuas the function f x is applied to the inefficient wuas and provides the future values of the remaining indicators receiving as input the values of the performance indicators optimised by dea in fig 2 indicated as g x function pcr was performed using xlstat software while dea was performed using the free software deap 2 1 coelli 1996 3 results 3 1 main characteristics of wuas the wua bics has the largest command area 18685 ha and irrigates 5335 farms while the smallest wua is tvv ca of 676 ha and 150 associated farmers the area effectively irrigated ia varies between 262 birc and 10007 bics ha with an average value of 2609 ha and a low annual variability see cv in table 2 throughout the survey period the average farm size aia is 1 23 ha table 2 as regards the water usage the volume of irrigation water delivery viwd varies from 2 7 tvv to 105 3 bics mm3 yr 1 on the average 24 3 mm3 yr 1 the annual volume of irrigation water required viwr is in the range 0 46 birc 32 49 bics mm3 yr 1 with an average value of 7 72 mm3 yr 1 concerning the financial aspects of the analysed wuas the gross revenue amount collected from the users grc on average 341660 yr 1 is much lower than the amount invoiced gri mean value equal to 528070 yr 1 both revenues show a high variability among wuas table 2 the momc including the staff cost is much higher compared to the revenues paid by users for the irrigation service from 3 fold bics to about 13 fold birc the grc table 2 the size of the irrigation staff npi is practically constant in time as shown by the very low inter annual cv but is strongly variable among the wuas from 22 tvv to 120 bics persons with different roles and jobs ranging from field workers to directive charges are employed in the irrigation service table 2 3 2 analysis of performance indicators in the current status this investigation reveals large differences in performance indicators and in technical efficiency among irrigation schemes icr shows a mean value of 27 9 and thus the cropping intensity is in general poor in accordance with the literature limits reported above this indicator varies widely among the wuas from poor values 8 0 in trc to good levels 54 7 recorded in tvv table 3 wdia is in the range 6500 tcz 14900 trc m3 ha 1 yr 1 on average 9500 m3 ha 1 yr 1 table 3 based on the water volumes delivered

trc is able to fully collect the invoiced fees while in some other wuas for example airc payment evasion is very high up to 60 table 3 moma which excludes staff costs is on average equal to 1445 ha 1 yr 1 and highly variable among wuas table 3 this variability is expected considering that mom costs vary according to different factors the physical condition of a network whether routine maintenance repair works are carried out or not organisation structure of the wuas collected irrigation fee revenue size of irrigated area and rate of irrigated to command area whether water is supplied by gravity or pumping etc koç 2007 zema et al 2015 crr considering personnel beside mom varies from 7 9 birc to 34 5 bics with an average value of 17 5 table 3 suia is on average 5 2 persons per 100 ha

wuas from 118 ha 1 yr 1 tcz to even 611 ha 1 yr 1 birc but it is constant throughout the monitoring period cv 0 table 3 3 3 correlations between performance indicators the analysis of the spearman matrix highlighted interesting correlations among pairs of performance indicators measured by the coefficient of correlation r in more detail the processing of performance indicators showed that table 4 i crr directly r 0 758 as well as suia and cis inversely r 0 988 and 0 733 respectively are fairly correlated with ia ii furthermore crr is inversely influenced by suia r 0 745 iii moma is directly dependent on wdia r 0 758 and inversely on icr r 0 721 iv finally high correlations between cis and ia inverse r 0 733 as well suia r 0 745 are found 3 4 analysis of wua efficiency and performance improvement 3 4 1 data envelopment analysis initially we applied dea to all the input performance indicators considered as productive factors except those indicators used as dea output ia for i o and crr for o o these deas showed that all wuas were unrealistically efficient in this way dea did not provide any information about wuas performance and efficiency level to avoid this we ran deas both i i and o o with several combinations of a progressively reduced number of input parameters finally only a selection of four indicators was used as input for dea i a parameter related to water delivery service wdia ii the most important indicator of the financial aspects of management operation and maintenance activities moma excluding personnel costs iii the staff cost per unit area suia iv the direct impact of collective service on users shown by cis if possible leave a blank line between the previous and the current paragraph 3 4 1 1 input oriented dea i o dea considered five wuas bics ikr icz tcz and tvv as efficient and thus took them as reference keeping constant all the performance indicators used for the remaining wuas bscs bmcs trc airc and birc that is the inefficient organisations a mean level of efficiency equal to 65 9 was found the most inefficient wua was trc mean efficiency of 46 3 table 5 a mean efficiency of about 45 implies that the same level of output could be produced with about 55 of the resources if these units were performing on the frontier in other words 45 of overall resources could be saved by raising the performance of these wuas to the highest level in order to limit such inefficiency dea showed that ia would triple 202 9 by decreasing on the average the productive factors as follows i wdia by 35 0 ii moma by 59 0 iii suia by 47 1 and iv cis by 53 1 fig 3 a if possible leave a blank line between the previous and the current paragraph 3 4 1 2 output oriented dea o o dea considered the same wuas to be efficient and inefficient as i o dea the inefficient wuas showed a mean efficiency equal to 49 7 the most inefficient wua was birc mean efficiency of 23 0 table 5 for the five inefficient wuas dea provided an increase of crr on average of 135 0 if the following average decreases of the input performance indicators were achieved i wdia of 10 8 ii moma of 35 9 iii suia of 65 5 and iv cis of 45 0 fig 3b 3 4 2 multiple

scenarios for the previously inefficient five wuas compared to the current values of the corresponding performance indicators the multiple regression models showed that fig 5 a and b i for the i o dea rcp ris icr nu and crr would increase on average by 3 6 21 0 55 3 1 2 and 35 7 respectively ii for the o o dea on average a reduction of rcp is expected of 0 1 as well as an increase of ris icr nu and ia of 1 6 284 235 and 1358 respectively 4 discussions the collective irrigation networks in calabria were strongly underutilised with few exceptions as shown by the value of the cropping intensity indicator icr although many of the nu numbers of users could potentially irrigate crops using the collective network of the ca in reality a large proportion of nu get irrigation water from different sources as confirmed by the low icr table 3 water usage varied noticeably among the monitored wuas and this did not reflect the type of irrigated crop in general in some wuas e g tvv and tcz where the main crops had higher irrigation requirements e g vegetables and fruit trees the water delivered to farms was on average lower compared to other wuas in which wheat maize and or olives requiring relatively little water were mainly produced e g bscs and bmcs wdia in calabria wuas 9500 m3 ha 1 yr 1 is much higher than the values between 1500 and 4300 m3 ha 1 yr 1 reported by córcoles et al 2010 for maize barley alfalfa onions carrots olive trees vineyards and almond trees rodrìguez dìaz et al 2004a for olive trees wheat sunflowers maize and citrus fruits garcía vila et al 2008 for winter cereals sunflower cotton garlic olive trees sugar beet maize beans asparagus onions pepper and potatoes camacho 2006 for olive trees wheat maize and citrus fruits and alcón et al 2017 for citrus fruits vegetables and cereals in spain wdia in collective irrigation of calabria is more similar to the values measured in other agricultural contexts cakmak et al 2004 turkey 9800 15000 m3 ha 1 yr 1 for cotton cereals tobacco and vegetables uysal and atış 2010 turkey about 8000 m3 ha 1 yr 1 irrigated crops not specified ghazalli 2004 malaysia 9400 34000 m3 ha 1 yr 1 for rice in the analysed wuas water delivered to crops was always in excess as shown by the very high ris compared to the theoretical irrigation requirement a ris near 100 would be more desirable than a higher value molden et al 1998 the mean ris 417 table 3 is i close to the maximum values reported by córcoles et al 2012 370 in spain and mateos et al 2010 213 in mauritania ii higher than the range estimated by lozano and mateos 2008 78 280 in an irrigation scheme in andalusia spain and iii much higher than the value estimated by rodríguez dìaz et al 2011 24 in andalusia spain soto garcía et al 2013 reported a ris ranging from 17 to 80 in the irrigated agriculture of region de murcia spain concerning the financial performance of the studied wuas moma on average 1445 ha 1 yr 1 table 3 is much higher compared to other studies reporting moma in the range 21 7 yavuz et al 2004 turkey 1014 alcón et al spain ha 1 yr 1 a key consideration with regard to the financial viability of the irrigation service in wuas of calabria is the relationship between the revenue received from farmers and the costs of operation and maintenance total revenue should be equal to or greater than the costs of operation and maintenance koç 2007 in our study none of the analysed wuas achieved a complete cost recovery indicated by crr and fee collection capacity explained by rcp which are both parts of financial self sufficiency yercan et al 2009 therefore their financial survival depended on external funds mainly from calabria region the very low self sufficiency of the wuas in calabria was mainly due to the high incidence of staff costs in fact the cost recovery ratio was on average equal to 200 if staff cost was not included in the analysis table 3 this means that wuas should be able to fully cover mom costs with water fees it is imperative to devise water fees for irrigation in such a manner to meet at least the annual mom costs to make the system self sustainable water fees should be such that minimum mom costs are recuperated by revenue recovered phadnis and kulshrestha 2012 moreover wuas may provide additional revenues selling electrical energy produced by small hydro power plants integrated in the irrigation networks zema et al 2016 2017 conversely if personnel salaries are considered in crr the cost recovery see crr values table 3 decreased to about 20 and became in general poor for the majority of the analysed wuas for crr literature shows values between 28 molden et al 1998 sri lanka and 170 cakmak et al 2009 turkey as regards the personnel requirement the values of suia detected in calabrian wuas on average 5 2 persons per 100 ha of ia table 3 appears very high compared to the extreme values reported in literature studies from 0 04 ijir and burton 1998 usa to 3 7 persons per 100 ha cornish 2005 china and however far from the acceptance limits reported in literature below 0 3 persons per 100 ha from the surveys in the calabrian wuas it has been noticed i a large variability of staff in the investigated wuas due to the normal variations of labour productivity service intensity and technology involved as also observed by koç 2007 ii a practically constant number of employees devoted to management and financial activities and iii a number of the field workers directly utilised for irrigation service maintenance not proportional to the irrigated area in literature all the studies have shown that the personnel cost in mom expenditure is much higher compared to other mom expenditures koc and bayazit 2015 as also noticed in the calabrian wuas here the reduced income was mostly used to cover fixed operational costs like salaries while funding for maintenance and minor works was reduced and this was also observed by marre et al 1997 another factor contributing to the poor financial performances was the limited capacity to collect the fees due from the associated farmers despite the average rcp being quite satisfactory in some wuas the fee evasion was high 45 60 of gross revenue invoiced it is not to be excluded that the values of this indicator could be affected by the economic condition of the users and the degree to which the users feel the system is worth supporting yercan et al 2009 this could confirm that in general in some wuas of calabria the satisfaction of farmers towards the irrigation service was low since the capacity to collect due fees is a significant indicator of the level of acceptance of irrigation water delivery as a service to the associated users bos 1997 marre et al 1997 the irregular spatial distribution of the cost of the irrigation service was due both to problems in the water delivery system and the low financial performance of some wuas as a matter of fact there was a large number of wuas with a high incidence of maintenance works mostly where there is widespread presence of free surface canals and energy costs for groundwater pumping to the associated farms required a higher cis also alcón et al 2017 stated that the use of groundwater increases the mom costs of the irrigation service the correlations among pairs of performance indicators shown by the spearman matrix table 4 are interesting and somewhat expected córcoles et al 2010 first of all the fair direct or inverse correlations of the cost recovery ratio crr of the wua personnel requirement per unit serviced area suia and the irrigation service cost cis on one hand and the irrigated area ia on the other hand showed an evident scale effect of the extension of the irrigation service in accordance with alcón et al 2017 who reported that the adoption of size growing policies allows obtaining economies of scale this confirms the better financial and organisation performances as well as the lower costs of the irrigation service for the larger wuas the capacity to collect due fees rcp was not correlated with the irrigated area conversely an increase of this capacity with decreasing wua size could be expected considering that presumably the lower the number of associated users or the area is the higher the control of the due fees is koç 2007 another interesting inverse correlation was found between the cost recovery ratio crr and the personnel intensity suia which can be explained by the fact that the lower the personnel cost the higher the financial self sufficiency of the wuas the mathematical dependencies between the mom costs per unit irrigated area moma on one hand and the water usage wdia positive correlation and cropping intensity icr negative correlation means that high volumes of delivered water per unit irrigated area involve high mom costs which in their turn increase with low service coverage icr moreover a weak correlation was detected between moma and ia differently from findings of rodrìguez dìaz et al 2008 who stated that in irrigation districts of higher size general expenses are divided among larger areas and then the unit values weigh less no correlation was found however between moma and crr as opposed to what was detected by phadnis and kulshrestha 2012 who found that the greater the mom costs the lower the cost recovery ratio finally the high regression coefficient between the cost of the irrigation service cis and ia evidenced that the water fees increase with decreasing serviced areas this means that the farmers in smaller sized associations pay considerably more than those in large units accordingly to findings of marre et al 1997 i o dea suggested that in order to improve the performances of the five inefficient wuas using more efficiently the productive factors the managers should reduce water usage mom cost personnel requirement and irrigation cost fig 3a to get this greater efficiency according to pcr the collective organisations should enlarge the irrigated area in order to benefit from the scale effect keeping nu and ca constant therefore without infrastructural works in none of the wuas the ia increase predicted by i o dea would exceed the ca which means that this goal is practically achievable this enlargement would lead to an increase of intensity of the irrigation service icr for instance this could be achieved by irrigating larger areas within the command area thus ia and icr would increase but ca and nu would remain constant furthermore irrigation of larger areas would lead to a decrease of the excessive water delivery to users detected in the inefficient wuas keeping constant the total irrigation water supplied by the system also the financial performance would noticeably improve and this is confirmed by the increased capacity to collect fees rcp and as a consequence of the financial self sufficiency crr of the organisations however negative changes of the performance indicators may be possible in some wuas such as the slight worsening of the financial self sufficiency e g crr in trc and the reduction of the capacity to collect fees e g rcp in bmcs trc and birc fig 5a moreover dea coupled with pcr models may predict for some performance indicator an unrealistic increase as for instance of the already extremely high degree of irrigation requirement fulfilment explained by ris presumably this may be due to the moderate explanatory capacity provided by the regression models as also noticed for o o dea of ris which could make its prediction not always realistic the o o dea was implemented to optimise the cost recovery capacity of the inefficient wuas this goal could be in general achieved for all the inefficient wuas o o dea predicted even a doubling of the cost recovery performance this would lead to a significant decrease of water usage personnel requirement mom costs and water fees fig 3b however pcr indicated that this improved scenario would require excessive changes of other performances which is basically unrealistic in the current situation for the five wuas both associated farms and cropping intensity would need to increase three fold and the irrigated area would need to increase ten fold in four of the five analysed wuas this latter would exceed the command area thus this resizing of the irrigation schemes may be unfeasible for the wuas fig 5b therefore the results of the o o dea must be interpreted with care and at the very least the feasibility of the predicted scenario must be checked by other prediction models 5 conclusions from the analysis of current performances of calabrian wuas it emerged that the irrigation service is underutilised and water delivered to crops is always in excess compared to the theoretical irrigation requirement from the financial point of view the cost recovery of the wuas is very low with revenues from the water fees covering only mom costs this is mainly due to both the incidence of staff costs and the low fee collection capability deas allowed firstly the identification of the inefficient wuas and the performance of the remaining collective organisations considered as efficient to be assumed as a reference for the inefficient wuas an input oriented dea coupled with pcr showed that water usage mom and personnel costs could be reduced significantly with a consequent decrease of water fees and a significant increase 3 fold of the irrigated area under this improved scenario the multi regression analysis predicted an enlarged irrigation service together with a high improvement in financial performance an output output dea coupled with pcr suggested a high increase of the cost recovery capacity of the inefficient wuas but this scenario would require major improvement actions for instance a 10 fold increase of the irrigated area which may be basically unsustainable for the collective organisations in the current situation and may also be unrealistic this means that o o dea must be applied with care and in any case its results should be properly controlled before any implementation on the whole the case study clearly demonstrated that irrigation is a complex process where every factor is important the combination of dea with multi regression and their implementation in the case study using a limited set of easy to survey performance indicators may be a powerful and easy to use tool in irrigation sector management by the implementation of these benchmarking techniques the diagnosis of the crucial factors affecting the collective irrigation service and the simulation of improved scenarios may be carried out for strategic purposes and support the identification of the countermeasures for weak point removal in the collective irrigation sector in this way it is possible to determine which practices lead to better performance in a district and subsequently adapt these practices to irrigation districts that perform less efficiently similarly wuas that perform more poorly will be able to determine which aspects are in need of improvement and take the necessary steps to achieve better performance 
11431,irrigation performance assessment is particularly important in the water users associations wuas operating in calabria southern italy where collective irrigation service suffers from poor performances both from an operative and economic point of view for many years data envelopment analysis dea has been proposed for the diagnosis of water users association performance however the number and type of related performance indicators must be selected with caution to avoid misleading and unrealistic results in this paper we propose to apply dea to a limited but significant set of performance indicators and to couple it to multiple regression analysis by principal component regression pcr the proposed methods were applied to evaluating the system operation and financial performances of ten of the eleven wuas operating in calabria southern italy to indicate potential improvements the analysis of the current performance indicators collected throughout five years 2011 2015 showed that in calabrian wuas the irrigation service is underutilised and water delivered to crops is always in excess the cost recovery of wuas is very low because of staff costs and low fee collection dea identified five inefficient wuas and took the remaining five organisations as reference for performance improvement the input oriented dea coupled to pcr has suggested reducing water usage management and personnel costs and water fees by increasing the irrigated area and the irrigation service coverage the output output oriented dea coupled to pcr predicted a high increase of the cost recovery capacity of the inefficient wuas but in this case the improved scenario required an abnormal increase 10 fold of the irrigated area which may be basically unfeasible overall the integration of dea with multi regression models and their implementation in the case study using a limited set of easy to survey performance indicators appears to be a powerful and easy tool for

parts of the world as for instance in southern italy and spain irrigation water is usually supplied from sources and delivered to farms by water users associations wuas the evaluation of performances in these collective irrigation systems is often neglected also because it is considered a time consuming and costly activity whose results are appreciable only in the long term malano et al 2004 the need for such assessment activities is particularly important in the wuas operating in calabria southern italy here the collective irrigation service suffers from poor performances both from an operative and economic point of view in a region where agriculture is by far the most important economic sector zema et al 2015 farmers use large volumes of water to irrigate crops with low requirements or pump groundwater when water supplied from surface water sources is sufficient in such contexts the evaluation of wua performance is an important management tool to aid in providing a sound irrigation service because it may support the system management in the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of an organisation and in the improvement of the organisation s performance and productivity taking into account its objectives alcón et al 2017 one of the most widely used tools for irrigation performance assessment is benchmarking a set of techniques able to identify the gaps between current and achievable performance and making changes to realise a higher standard of performance malano et al 2004 benchmarking techniques are often applied to water users associations by calculating and processing the so called performance indicators these techniques consider different performance indicators summarising the main management traits to describe and compare the management of the analysed wuas soto garcía et al 2013 benchmarking of collective agencies managing irrigation services is relatively recent and some mathematical statistical techniques such as principal component analysis pca agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc quality index qi calculation have been applied and validated in different areas worldwide for benchmarking as regards the mediterranean basin which shares similar climatic and structural conditions with italian agriculture the following studies of can be cited zema et al 2015 and rodrìguez dìaz et al 2008 used pca ahc and qi in calabria italy and andalusia spain respectively córcoles et al 2010 2012 applied ahc in wuas of castilla la mancha spain uysal and atış 2010 and koç and bayazit 2015 processed the performance indicators however if applied to collective irrigation just as a comparative assessment of performance indicators benchmarking may provide an incomplete picture and such assessment may be difficult to interpret malano et al 2004 therefore other tools are required incorporating diagnostic analysis to identify those factors which majorly contribute to improving the levels of irrigation service performance data envelopment analysis dea is a non parametric linear programming method that works with input output ratios to calculate relative efficiencies of organisations this method has been proposed for benchmarking performance in service sectors such as irrigation and drainage because it has a number of advantages firstly dea has the ability to analyse several inputs and outputs simultaneously and derive an efficiency rating within a set of analysed units secondly dea does not require the development of standards against which efficiency is measured thirdly it does not require predetermined production functions to relate inputs and outputs malano et al 2004 however dea has so far found little application in irrigation except for few literature studies rodrìguez dìaz et al 2008 borgia et al 2013 frija et al 2009 to summarise in irrigation districts of andalusia spain rodrìguez dìaz et al 2008 found by dea great differences in terms of performance between districts with open channel and pressure water delivery systems water use was more efficient in districts where users were charged per unit of irrigation water consumed dea and ahc applied by borgia et al 2013 in irrigation schemes of mauritania demonstrated that on a technical basis large schemes performed similarly to small scale schemes while these latter showed greater variability of crop yield and technical efficiency which may indicate a larger margin for improvement the dea by borgia et al 2013 also helped to identify the specific reference schemes for each low performing scheme the use of dea and a tobit model in wuas of tunisia highlighted that management and maintenance are important tasks in determining the overall performance and efficiency frija et al 2009 moreover when applying dea for benchmarking of irrigation performance a degree of caution must be exercised in the number and selection of variables to be analysed and processed as a matter of fact the selection of variables must be closely related to the objectives of the study and the productive process being evaluated in addition there is the risk that the adoption of too many performance indicators would allow dea to consider all or the majority of the analysed wuas efficient and thus it would not provide any information about deviations of current situation from optimal management malana and malano 2006 alcón et al 2017 according to soto garcía et al 2013 the performance indicators should be i easy to obtain from data routinely collected in the wuas ii mostly oriented towards aspects related to wua management and iii suitable for the purpose of each specific study therefore a limited set of non redundant performance indicators but representative of as many as possible of the productive factors of wuas must be chosen for dea application at the irrigation sector in order to determine the relative efficiency of a wua and its position in relation to the optimal situation other non parametric techniques such as multi regression models can be integrated to dea and applied to the performance indicators not considered by dea itself this paper proposes a novel approach to optimise wua performance by benchmarking applying dea to a limited but significant set of performance indicators and coupling it to multiple regression analysis by principal component regression pcr in order to improve the performance of ten wuas operating in calabria the combination of these techniques is targeted to fully delineate the performances of the inefficient wuas under an optimised management scenario taking as reference a sample of efficient wuas and using the values of a set of operation and financial performance indicators collected throughout five years this aggregated diagnosis of current status and the prediction of future performance may be useful to the decision makers to give them a concrete idea about the overall performance of an irrigation scheme vis à vis other irrigation schemes phadnis and kuhlshrestha 2013 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the region of calabria is located in the extreme southern part of italian peninsula its climate can be classified as csa mild temperate dry and hot summer in coastal zones and csb mild temperate dry and warm summer in internal areas according the koppen geiger classification kottek et al 2006 agriculture in calabria is practised both on the few plains and in the hills the majority of the cultivated areas are irrigated farmers commonly use collective irrigation systems managed by 11 wuas called in italian consorzi di irrigazione e bonifica operating in the territory of calabria fig 1 many of these wuas are also involved in land reclamation dealing with soil conservation and watershed management but with a role limited to ordinary maintenance each wua manages a part of the calabrian territory administrated area and controls all the irrigation systems within its own part command area irrigation water is delivered only to the areas covered by crops irrigated area the ten investigated wuas together cover over 86 of the irrigated territory of calabria olive and citrus groves and vineyards are the dominant tree crops beside vegetables corn and forage as herbaceous crops table 1 water is supplied from small rivers and natural or artificial reservoirs except for wuas bscs airc and birc exploiting also groundwater and is distributed to farmers mainly by rotational systems except tcz some wuas have recently begun to turn to on demand system e g icz network conduits are mainly pressurised pipelines but open canals still exist in many wuas from wua bulletins water for irrigation is usually sufficient for the entire season even though occasionally some periods of shortage are recorded farmers use mainly surface and sprinkler irrigation systems with a low percentage making use of micro irrigation mainly in wua bics water is charged to farmers on the basis of the irrigated area often differentiating by crop only in the wua icz farmers pay irrigation volumes effectively consumed thanks to the adoption of automated measuring devices table 1 2 2 performance indicators for the quantitative analysis of wua performance malano and burton 2001 have proposed a set of performance indicators service delivery productive efficiency and environmental performance the performance indicators used in this study were selected based on both the availability of input data at the investigated wuas and findings of some authors in more detail the indicators of agricultural productivity and economics were not considered since data of agricultural production and gross net margins are not easily available for each farm or irrigation district but are aggregated only at provincial or regional scales the calculation of the indicators related to the environmental performance was not possible because the analysed wuas do not evaluate the irrigation water quality parameters and use of fertilizers however córcoles et al 2010 stated that it is possible to reduce the set of indicators by omitting just the production efficiency and environmental indicators without loosing too much information therefore in this study the attention was mainly paid to the indicators of service delivery performance which include a the adequacy with which the organization manages the operation of the irrigation delivery system to satisfy the water required by users system operation and b the efficiency with which the organization uses resources to provide this service financial performance more specifically service delivery indicators include aspects such as water distribution and irrigation areas while financial indicators are related to distribution of the total management operation and maintenance mom cost of the irrigation district corcoles et al 2016 ghazalli 2004 most of these indicators have strong interrelations for example the main differences among some indicators lie in considering different types of unit areas command or irrigated and volume of irrigation water supplied delivered consumed required córcoles et al 2010 therefore the service delivery indicators were properly selected considering those related to the size of the system water usage and financial and organisation aspects these data concerned as regards the size of the system administrative area aa ha command area ca ha and irrigated area ia ha understood as the total area under the administration of each wua the area equipped with irrigation infrastructure and actual irrigated area during the five years covered respectively number of users nu the number of farmers who are members of each wua and serviced by the collective irrigation system for this service water fees are invoiced and collected by the wuas average irrigated area per farm aia ha concerning the water usage annual volume of irrigation water delivery viwd m3 yr 1 calculated as the product of discharge measured by weir by distribution times in open canals or directly by counters in pipelines annual volume of irrigation water required viwr m3 yr 1 this latter parameter was calculated for each wuas as a weighted mean of covered areas by the net irrigation requirement of each crop that is the quantity of water exclusive of precipitation required for normal crop production the net irrigation requirement was estimated using the software cropwat 8 0 clarke et al 1998 fao 2009 and performing the daily water balance for each crop over the five years the daily meteorological data required by cropwat maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation relative humidity wind speed and daylight were measured selecting for each wua a barycentric meteorological station in relation to the crop data the root depth and crop coefficients for calculating evapo transpiration estimated by penman monteith model were derived from fao guidelines doorenbos and kassam 1986 the farm cultivation practices i e dates and operations were identified by interviewing the wuas managers soil hydrological parameters in the absence of direct measurements were estimated using the pedo transfer function of saxton et al 1986 on the basis of the soil texture reported by the soil map of the calabria region arssa 2003 the total irrigation requirement of each crop was calculated from the net irrigation requirement considering farm irrigation efficiency according to the methods commonly used in each cropped area for sprinklers the value of 0 70 was assumed while the values of 0 85 sprayers and 0 95 drippers were considered for micro irrigation in accordance with the cropwat guidelines clarke et al 1998 fao 2009 finally daily data of total irrigation requirement were aggregated at an annual scale the following financial and organisation variables gross revenue invoiced and gross revenue collected gri and grc yr 1 that is the annual revenues due from water users for provision of irrigation services and collected fee actually paid annual management operation and maintenance costs momc yr 1 providing the service staff maintenance energy management and other costs excluding capital expenditure and depreciation renewals number of personnel employed in the provision of the irrigation service npi these input data allowed the computation of the following indicators regarding service delivery performance and wuas financial performance beside each indicator its meaning is explained irrigated area command area ratio icr equal to ia ca which is an indicator of the coverage of the irrigation service over each wua command area it is also known as cropping intensity since it represents the actual intensity of land utilisation during the year corcoles et al 2016 annual irrigation water delivery per unit of irrigated area wdia m3 ha 1 yr 1 the most important service delivery performance indicator malano et al 2004 frija et al 2009 annual relative irrigation supplied ris calculated as the ratio between wdia and viwr this latter divided by the irrigated area ia thus ris 100 indicates that the water supply is insufficient to satisfy full irrigation demand while ris 100 indicates that an excess of water is applied therefore ris is a measure of the degree of irrigation requirement fulfilment annual management operation and maintenance cost per unit area moma ha 1 yr 1 ratio between momc and ia which standardizes the management costs on the irrigated area moma can be calculated either including or not including the cost of personnel in mom however given that this cost is generally proportional to the staff size the differences of salaries among employees being very low regardless of their jobs already included in npi and suia parameters we have excluded the staff cost in calculating moma henceforth indicated as moma cost recovery ratio crr calculated as the ratio between grc and momc which represents an index of the degree of financial self sufficiency of the wua hereafter crr will be indicated as crr the superscript indicating that the cost of personnel was included in momc required by crr revenue collection performance rcp calculated as the ratio between grc and gri indicating the wua s capacity of due fee collecting koç 2007 staffing number per unit irrigated area suia persons 100 ha 1 the ratio between npi and ia this indicator is also called personnel intensity by yercan et al 2009 cost of the irrigation service per unit of irrigated area cis ha 1 yr 1 which is the unit fee paid by users to the wuas for the irrigation service note that cis and moma measure different variables while moma is the cost of the irrigation service incurred by a wua cis is the price of the irrigation service provided by a wua to the farmers alone this latter does not cover the mom costs since an important share of the wuas revenues is usually covered by regional funds for some of the indicators used in this study literature e g bekisoglu 1994 vermillion 2000 nelson 2002 yercan et al 2009 reports the following acceptance limits to which the values detected in this study were compared rcp and crr poor if 40 acceptable if in the range 40 60 satisfactory if between 60 and 75 and good if 75 icr poor if 30 acceptable if in the range 30 40 satisfactory if between 40 and 50 and good if 50 suia poor if 0 3 persons per 100 ha satisfactory if 0 3 persons per 100 ha 2 3 data collection the methodology was applied to ten of the eleven wuas in calabria one of the wuas did not provide data a questionnaire was given to the managers and technicians in order to collect the input parameters needed to calculate the performance indicators the questionnaire complemented the information contained in the annual reports produced by the wuas the collected data covered five years 2011 2015 2 4 statistical analysis in order to identify possible mathematical structures between performance indicators and the related correlation coefficients the spearman correlation matrix was computed based on the current values of indicators surveyed in the analysed wuas preliminarily the indicators were standardised by converting data to zero mean and unit variance the benchmarking process of irrigation performance in the ten wuas of calabria was carried out by coupling dea and pcr as explained below in order to reduce the number of the analysed variable these techniques were applied only to the performance indicators icr wdia ris crr moma rcp suia and cis besides two other input parameters measuring the wua size that is ia and un and not to all the variables including the other input parameters surveyed at the wuas this choice derives from findings of some authors who state that most of the indicators usually utilised in benchmarking the irrigation performance have strong interrelations with each other 2 4 1 data envelopment analysis dea developed by charnes cooper and rhodes in 1978 was previously applied in the irrigation sector e g rodrìguez dìaz et al 2004a b 2008 borgia et al 2013 frija et al 2009 to evaluate the efficiency of a given wua compared to a group of representative wuas considered efficient and thus assumed as reference and identify the optimal management scenario on a quantitative approach dea belongs to the set of efficient frontier techniques allowing the comparison of less efficient to more efficient organisations these latter falling on the frontier malano et al 2004 in dea the frontier function is constructed using virtual units that are weighted combinations of observed most efficient decision making units dmus coelli et al 2005 in this study dea was implemented by an input oriented i o and an output oriented o o model the i o model measures the ability of a dmu in our case a wua to maintain the same capacity of production using a minimum of inputs cooper et al 2004 irrigated agriculture relies on finite and scarce water resources and in its current situation agriculture in europe does not need increased production but rather a more efficient use of inputs rodrìguez dìaz et al 2004a frija et al 2009 therefore in our study the use of i o dea was considered more appropriate to reduce inputs consumed in the production process malana and malano 2006 ia is the constant output for the efficient wuas for the inefficient wuas all the performance indicators related to wua management efficiency included ia are optimised the o o model refers to the capacity of a dmu to achieve the maximum volume of production output with the available inputs in our study since we want to maximize the financial performance of some inefficient wuas we adopted also an o o dea using as input factors the same parameters as the i o dea but we adopted crr as output the o o dea predicts to what extent managers can increase the financial self sufficiency measured by crr of the inefficient wuas by modifying the performance levels one of the analysis options in dea is a choice between constant returns to scale and variable returns to scale frija et al 2009 since the scale of activity that is the size of the wuas has an important effect on its efficiency umetsu et al 2005 we decided to adopt the variable return to scale increasing returns to scale indicate that an increase in the input resources produces more than proportionate increase in outputs similarly decreasing returns to scale suggest a less than proportionate increase in the outputs in response to an increase in inputs malana and malano 2006 2 4 2 multiple regression analysis by principal component regression pcr considering that dea was applied to a limited set of performance indicators it is necessary to estimate the values of the remaining indicators in the target scenarios for the inefficient wuas to this aim predictive models were built between the five performance indicators used by deas independent variables and the remaining five indicators dependent variables to be predicted principal component regression pcr massy 1965 was used as predictive model pcr is a combination of principal component analysis pca and multiple linear regression mlr often an ordinary least squares ols regression where the principal component pc scores are used as predictor variables and linear combinations are constructed between predictor and response variables pcr is advised when the factors are many and highly collinear wold 1975 as a matter of fact many pairs of performance indicators adopted in our study were strongly correlated as shown by the spearman s correlation matrix and therefore collinear since principal components pc are orthogonal the multicollinearity problems of the original variables are removed carrascal et al 2009 pcr was implemented in the efficient wuas as follows i a pca was applied to the five independent variables used by dea ii an ols regression was run on the first two pcs iii the dependent variables were calculated as a linear combination of the pcs explaining most of the variance of the original independent variables iv in these linear equations the scores of pcs were replaced by the scores calculated referring to the original independent variables that is those used by deas pcr was calibrated for the efficient wuas using the values of the five dea performance indicators for the current scenario the derived linear equations were applied to the inefficient wuas in order to predict the target values of the remaining indicators based on the target values of performance indicators provided by dea fig 2 reports the conceptual scheme of coupling deas and pcr to summarise pcr provides a linear function f x which receives as input the five performance indicators x used by dea and predicts the remaining indicators y this funcion is calibrated on the efficient wuas the function f x is applied to the inefficient wuas and provides the future values of the remaining indicators receiving as input the values of the performance indicators optimised by dea in fig 2 indicated as g x function pcr was performed using xlstat software while dea was performed using the free software deap 2 1 coelli 1996 3 results 3 1 main characteristics of wuas the wua bics has the largest command area 18685 ha and irrigates 5335 farms while the smallest wua is tvv ca of 676 ha and 150 associated farmers the area effectively

viwr is in the range 0 46 birc 32 49 bics mm3 yr 1 with an average value of 7 72 mm3 yr 1 concerning the financial aspects of the analysed wuas the gross revenue amount collected from the users grc on average 341660 yr 1 is much lower than the amount invoiced gri mean value equal to 528070 yr 1 both revenues show a high variability among wuas table 2 the momc including the staff cost is much higher compared to the revenues paid by users for the irrigation service from 3 fold bics to about 13 fold birc the grc table 2 the size of the irrigation staff npi is practically constant in time as shown by the very low inter annual cv but is strongly variable among the wuas from 22 tvv to 120 bics persons with different roles and jobs ranging from field workers to directive charges are employed in the irrigation service table 2 3 2 analysis of performance indicators in the current status this investigation reveals large differences in performance indicators and in technical efficiency among irrigation schemes icr shows a mean value of 27 9 and thus the cropping intensity is in general poor in accordance with the literature limits reported above this indicator varies widely among the wuas from poor values 8 0 in trc to good levels 54 7 recorded in tvv table 3 wdia is in the range 6500 tcz 14900 trc m3 ha 1 yr 1 on average 9500 m3 ha 1 yr 1 table 3 based on the water volumes delivered

trc is able to fully collect the invoiced fees while in some other wuas for example airc payment evasion is very high up to 60 table 3 moma which excludes staff costs is on average equal to 1445 ha 1 yr 1 and highly variable among wuas table 3 this variability is expected considering that mom costs vary according to different factors the physical condition of a network whether routine maintenance repair works are carried out or not organisation structure of the wuas collected irrigation fee revenue size of irrigated area and rate of irrigated to command area whether water is supplied by gravity or pumping etc koç 2007 zema et al 2015 crr considering personnel beside mom varies from 7 9 birc to 34 5 bics with an average value of 17 5 table 3 suia is on average 5 2 persons per 100 ha of ia with a high variability among the wuas 1 2 20 6 persons per 100 ha table 3 finally cis of calabrian wuas is on average 262 ha 1 yr 1 however this price is affected by a high variability among wuas from 118 ha 1 yr 1 tcz to even 611 ha 1 yr 1 birc but it is constant throughout the monitoring period cv 0 table 3 3 3 correlations between performance indicators the analysis of the spearman matrix highlighted interesting correlations among pairs of performance indicators measured by the coefficient of correlation r in more detail the processing of performance indicators showed that table 4 i crr directly r 0 758 as well as suia and cis inversely r 0 988 and 0 733 respectively are fairly correlated with ia ii furthermore crr is inversely influenced by suia r 0 745 iii moma is directly dependent on wdia r 0 758 and inversely on icr r 0 721 iv finally high correlations between cis and ia inverse r 0 733 as well suia r 0 745 are found 3 4 analysis of wua efficiency and performance improvement 3 4 1 data envelopment analysis initially we applied dea to all the input performance indicators considered as productive factors except those indicators used as dea output ia for i o and crr for o o these deas showed that all wuas were unrealistically efficient in this way dea did not provide any information about wuas performance and efficiency level to avoid this we ran deas both i i and o o with several combinations of a progressively reduced number of input parameters finally only a selection of four indicators was used as input for dea i a parameter related to water delivery

direct impact of collective service on users shown by cis if possible leave a blank line between the previous and the current paragraph 3 4 1 1 input oriented dea i o dea considered five wuas bics ikr icz tcz and tvv as efficient and thus took them as reference keeping constant all the performance indicators used for the remaining wuas bscs bmcs trc airc and birc that is the inefficient organisations a mean level of efficiency equal to 65 9 was found the most inefficient wua was trc mean efficiency of 46 3 table 5 a mean efficiency of about 45 implies that the same level of output could be produced with about 55 of the resources if these units were performing on the frontier in other words 45 of overall resources could be saved by raising the performance of these wuas to the highest level in order to limit such inefficiency dea showed that ia would triple 202 9 by decreasing on the average the productive factors as follows i wdia by 35 0 ii moma by 59 0 iii suia by 47 1 and iv cis by 53 1 fig 3 a if possible leave a blank line between the previous and the current paragraph 3 4 1 2 output oriented dea o o dea considered the same wuas to be efficient and inefficient as

average of 135 0 if the following average decreases of the input performance indicators were achieved i wdia of 10 8 ii moma of 35 9 iii suia of 65 5 and iv cis of 45 0 fig 3b 3 4 2 multiple

scenarios for the previously inefficient five wuas compared to the current values of the corresponding performance indicators the multiple regression models showed that fig 5 a and b i for the i o dea rcp ris icr nu and crr would increase on average by 3 6 21 0 55 3 1 2 and 35 7 respectively ii for the o o dea on average a reduction of rcp is expected of 0 1 as well as an increase of ris icr nu and ia of 1 6 284 235 and 1358 respectively 4 discussions the collective irrigation networks in calabria were strongly underutilised with few exceptions as shown by the value of the cropping intensity indicator icr although many of the nu numbers of users could potentially irrigate crops using the collective network of the ca in reality a large proportion of nu get irrigation water from different sources as confirmed by the low icr table 3 water usage varied noticeably among the monitored wuas and this did not reflect the type of irrigated crop in general in some wuas e g tvv and tcz where the main crops had higher irrigation requirements e g vegetables and fruit trees the water delivered to farms was on average lower compared to other wuas in which wheat maize and or olives requiring relatively little water were mainly produced e g bscs and bmcs wdia in calabria wuas 9500 m3 ha 1 yr 1 is much higher than the values between 1500 and 4300 m3 ha 1 yr 1 reported by córcoles et al 2010

cereals sunflower cotton garlic olive trees sugar beet maize beans asparagus onions pepper and potatoes camacho 2006 for olive trees wheat maize and citrus fruits and alcón et al 2017 for citrus

water delivered to crops was always in excess as shown by the very high ris compared to the theoretical irrigation requirement a ris near 100 would be more desirable than a higher value molden et al 1998 the mean ris 417 table 3 is i close to the maximum values reported by córcoles et al 2012 370 in spain and mateos et al 2010 213 in mauritania ii higher than the range estimated by lozano and mateos 2008 78 280 in an irrigation scheme in andalusia spain and iii much higher than the value estimated by rodríguez dìaz et al 2011 24 in andalusia spain soto garcía et al 2013 reported a ris ranging from 17 to 80 in the irrigated agriculture of region de murcia spain concerning the financial performance of the studied wuas moma on average 1445 ha 1 yr 1 table 3 is much higher compared to other studies reporting moma in the range 21 7 yavuz et al 2004 turkey 1014 alcón et al spain ha 1 yr 1 a key consideration with regard to the financial viability of the irrigation service in wuas of calabria is the relationship between the revenue received from farmers and the costs of operation and maintenance total revenue should be equal to or greater than the costs of operation and maintenance koç 2007 in our study none of the analysed wuas achieved a complete cost recovery indicated by crr and fee collection capacity explained by rcp which are both parts of financial self sufficiency yercan et al 2009 therefore their financial survival depended on external funds mainly from calabria region the very low self sufficiency of the wuas in calabria was mainly due to the high incidence of staff costs in fact the cost recovery ratio was on average equal to 200 if staff cost was not included in the analysis table 3 this means that wuas should be able to fully cover mom costs with water fees it is imperative to devise water fees for irrigation in such a manner to meet at least the annual mom costs to make the system self sustainable water fees should be such that minimum mom costs are recuperated by revenue recovered phadnis and kulshrestha 2012 moreover wuas may provide additional revenues selling electrical energy produced by small hydro power plants integrated in the irrigation networks zema et al 2016 2017 conversely if personnel salaries are considered in crr the cost recovery see crr values table 3 decreased to about 20 and became in general poor for the majority of the analysed wuas for crr literature shows values between 28 molden et al 1998 sri lanka and 170 cakmak et al 2009 turkey as regards the personnel requirement the values of suia detected in calabrian wuas on average 5 2 persons per 100 ha of ia table 3 appears very high compared to the extreme values reported in literature studies from 0 04 ijir and burton 1998 usa to 3 7 persons per 100 ha cornish 2005 china and however far from the acceptance limits reported in literature below 0 3 persons per 100 ha from the surveys in the calabrian wuas it has been noticed i a large variability of staff in the investigated wuas due to the normal variations of labour productivity service intensity and technology involved as also observed by koç 2007 ii a practically constant number of employees devoted to management and financial activities and iii a number of the field workers directly utilised for irrigation service maintenance not proportional to the irrigated area in literature all the studies have shown that the personnel cost in mom expenditure is much higher compared to other mom expenditures koc and bayazit 2015 as also noticed in the calabrian wuas here the reduced income was mostly used to cover fixed operational costs like salaries while funding for maintenance and minor works was reduced and this was also observed by marre et al 1997 another factor contributing to the poor financial performances was the limited capacity to collect the fees due from the associated farmers despite the average rcp being quite satisfactory in some wuas the fee evasion was high 45 60 of gross revenue invoiced it is not to be excluded that the values of this indicator could be affected by the economic condition of the users and the degree to which the users feel the system is worth supporting yercan et al 2009 this could confirm that in general in some wuas of calabria the satisfaction of farmers towards the irrigation service was low since the capacity to collect due fees is a significant indicator of the level of acceptance of irrigation water delivery as a service to the associated users bos 1997 marre et al 1997 the irregular spatial distribution of the cost of the irrigation service was due both to problems in the water delivery system and the low financial performance of some wuas as a matter of fact there was a large number of wuas with a high incidence of maintenance works mostly where there is widespread presence of free surface canals and energy costs for groundwater pumping to the associated farms required a higher cis also alcón et al 2017 stated that the use of groundwater increases the mom costs of the irrigation service the correlations among pairs of performance indicators shown by the spearman matrix table 4 are interesting and somewhat expected córcoles et al 2010 first of all the fair direct or inverse correlations of the cost recovery ratio crr of the wua personnel requirement per unit serviced area suia and the irrigation service cost cis on one hand and the irrigated area ia on the other hand showed an evident scale effect of the extension of the irrigation service in accordance with alcón et al 2017 who reported that the adoption of size growing policies allows obtaining economies of scale this confirms the better financial and organisation performances as well as the lower costs of the irrigation service for the larger wuas the capacity to collect due fees rcp was not correlated with the irrigated area conversely an increase of this capacity with decreasing wua size could be expected considering that presumably the lower the number of associated users or the area is the higher the control of the due fees is koç 2007 another interesting inverse correlation was found between the cost recovery ratio crr and the personnel intensity suia which can be explained by the fact that the lower the personnel cost the higher the financial self sufficiency of the wuas the mathematical dependencies between the mom costs per unit irrigated area moma on one hand and the water usage wdia positive correlation and cropping intensity icr negative correlation means that high volumes of delivered water per unit irrigated area involve high mom costs which in their turn increase with low service coverage icr moreover a weak correlation was detected between moma and ia differently from findings of rodrìguez dìaz et al 2008 who stated that in irrigation districts of higher size general expenses are divided among larger areas and then the unit values weigh less no correlation was found however between moma and crr as opposed to what was detected by phadnis and kulshrestha 2012 who found that the greater the mom costs the lower the cost recovery ratio finally the high regression coefficient between the cost of the irrigation service cis and ia evidenced that the water fees increase with decreasing serviced areas this means that the farmers in smaller sized associations pay considerably more than those in large units accordingly to findings of marre et al 1997 i o dea suggested that in order to improve the performances of the five inefficient wuas using more efficiently the productive factors the managers should reduce water usage mom cost personnel requirement and irrigation cost fig 3a to get this greater efficiency according to pcr the collective organisations should enlarge the irrigated area in order to benefit from the scale effect keeping nu and ca constant therefore without infrastructural works in none of the wuas the ia increase predicted by i o dea would exceed the ca which means that this goal is practically achievable this enlargement would lead to an increase of intensity of the irrigation service icr for instance this could be achieved by irrigating larger areas within the command area thus ia and icr would increase but ca and nu would remain constant furthermore irrigation of larger areas would lead to a decrease of the excessive water delivery to users detected in the inefficient wuas keeping constant the total irrigation water supplied by the system also the financial performance would noticeably improve and this is confirmed by the increased capacity to collect fees rcp and as a consequence of the financial self sufficiency crr of the organisations however negative changes of the performance indicators may be possible in some wuas such as the slight worsening of the financial self sufficiency e g crr in trc and the reduction of the capacity to collect fees e g rcp in bmcs trc and birc fig 5a moreover dea coupled with pcr models may predict for some performance indicator an unrealistic increase as for instance of the already extremely high degree of irrigation requirement fulfilment explained by ris presumably this may be due to the moderate explanatory capacity provided by the regression models as also noticed for o o dea of ris which could make its prediction not always realistic the o o dea was implemented to optimise the cost recovery capacity of the inefficient wuas this goal could be in general achieved for all the inefficient wuas o o dea predicted even a doubling of the cost recovery performance this would lead to a significant decrease of water usage personnel requirement mom costs and water fees fig 3b however pcr indicated that this improved scenario would require excessive changes of other performances which is basically unrealistic in the current situation for the five wuas both associated farms and cropping intensity would need to increase three fold and the irrigated area would need to increase ten fold in four of the five analysed wuas this latter would exceed the command area thus this resizing of the irrigation schemes may be unfeasible for the wuas fig 5b therefore the results of the o o dea must be interpreted with care and at the very least the feasibility of the predicted scenario must be checked by other prediction models 5 conclusions from the analysis of current performances of calabrian wuas it emerged that the irrigation service is underutilised and water delivered to crops is always in excess compared to the theoretical irrigation requirement from the financial point of view the cost recovery of the wuas is very low with revenues from the water fees covering only mom costs this is mainly due to both the incidence of staff costs and the low fee collection capability deas allowed firstly the identification of the inefficient wuas and the performance of the remaining collective organisations considered as efficient to be assumed as a reference for the inefficient wuas an input oriented dea coupled with pcr showed that water usage mom and personnel costs could be reduced significantly with a consequent decrease of water fees and a significant increase 3 fold of the irrigated area under this improved scenario the multi regression analysis predicted an enlarged irrigation service together with a high improvement in financial performance an output output dea coupled with pcr suggested a high increase of the cost recovery capacity of the inefficient wuas but this scenario would require major improvement actions for instance a 10 fold increase of the irrigated area which may be basically unsustainable for the collective organisations in the current situation and may also be unrealistic this means that o o dea must be applied with care and in any case its results should be properly controlled before any implementation on the whole the case study clearly demonstrated that irrigation is a complex process where every factor is important the combination of dea with multi regression and their implementation in the case study using a limited set of easy to survey performance indicators may be a powerful and easy to use tool in irrigation sector management by the implementation of these benchmarking techniques the diagnosis of the crucial factors affecting the collective irrigation service and the simulation of improved scenarios may be carried out for strategic purposes and support the identification of the countermeasures for weak point removal in the collective irrigation sector in this way it is possible to determine which practices lead to better performance in a district and subsequently adapt these practices to irrigation districts that perform less efficiently similarly wuas that perform more poorly will be able to determine which aspects are in need of improvement and take the necessary steps to achieve better performance 
11432,installation of tailwater reuse systems in irrigated farms is encouraged to achieve river water quality outcomes however assessment of their efficacy in improving irrigation efficiency or intercepting nutrients and chemicals is limited to a few studies the lifestyle productive and environmental consequences of tailwater reuse dam on dairy farms was investigated using interviews field monitoring and risk assessment in the shepparton irrigation region sir of australia thirty one reuse dams were monitored during the 2013 14 and 2014 15 irrigation seasons with water quantity and quality data collected the farmers believe that reuse dams provide greater flexibility in water management and recycling on farm between 3 and 28 of water delivered to a reuse dam catchment was captured in the reuse dam on average 63 of the total water captured in a reuse dam was pumped out for reuse only 14 of dam capacity was available to capture unanticipated storm runoff for 90 of the time reuse water satisfied environmental guidelines thresholds with respect to ec ph and nox n but greatly exceeded maximum levels for tn tp and frp with median concentrations of 8 1 3 7 and 1 9 mg l respectively under current irrigation and resue practices productive risk appears low however there is a likelihood of reuse water spills to regional drains following 25 mm in 24 h rainfall events even in the absence of large rainfall events number of spills were recorded on 46 of farms although it appears that the reuse dams in the sir provide productivity benefits and environmental benefits to some extent current reuse dam management practices on many farms do not conform to key recommended practices thus the risk to the environment from spills of nutrient enriched water is greater than that envisaged by the regulatory agencies the impact of water spilled into the drains is unclear and requires further investigation keywords surface irrigation runoff water quality dairy irrigation

pathogens chemicals and other toxins in addition to any rainfall initiated runoff farms using irrigation may routinely generate runoff as a direct consequence of farm irrigation practice well designed and managed sprinkler or micro irrigation systems produce little runoff burt et al 2000 but on farms using flowing water surface irrigation such as furrow or border irrigation adequately irrigating the lower portion of a field inevitably generates some tailwater runoff this runoff ranges from 10 to 20 of applied water under best practice burt et al 2000 wood and finger 2006 through to 20 50

of these systems include improved irrigation efficiency increased flexibility in timing and length of irrigations and the removal of standing water from ends of fields disadvantages can include the

consumption at a river basin level clemmens et al 2008 huffaker 2008 there is general consensus that well managed reuse systems should beneficially improve water quality in downstream rivers lakes and wetlands by decreasing salt sediment nutrient and chemical loads accordingly organisations such as the natural resources conservation service in the united states department of agriculture provide financial incentives for reuse system installation in river basins including the mississippi bouldin et al 2004 karki et al 2015 and colorado ward et al 2008 while government agencies in australia

objectives were to 1 understand the benefits that farmers gained from reuse dams 2 assess the operational performance of reuse dams and 3 assess whether if managed inappropriately reuse water and operational practices posed risks to the environment or productive land 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the shepparton irrigation region sir is a 5000 km2 area of the southern murray darling basin of australia fig 1 long term average annual rainfall and class a pan evaporation in the region are 450 490 mm and 1360 1590 mm respectively supplemented by an average 1 5 km3 of irrigation water each year irrigation water is delivered under gravity from surface water storages to farms via a 6300 km network of open canals and channels during each irrigation season 15 august through to 15 may some irrigators also secure water from other sources such as pumped groundwater treated wastewater dairy effluent and collected irrigation tailwater runoff the dairy industry in the sir generates 24 percent of australia s total milk production from a total area of 2980 km2 abares 2015 relying on grazed forages as the main feed source for dairy cattle these farms depend on border check irrigation for forage and fodder production between september and may when evaporation greatly exceeds rainfall in border check irrigation water is released through a gate at the top of the rectangular border then freely advances down a graded slope to the bottom with lateral spread of water controlled by check banks running parallel to the slope under best practice between 10 and 20 of water applied will

installation of reuse dams on dairy farms is encouraged by natural resource managers to minimise waterlogging maximise farm water use efficiency and minimise flow and nutrients in the sir regional drainage systems feehan and plunkett 2003 government incentives for the installation of reuse systems in the sir were provided between july 2001 and june 2010 with installed systems expected to satisfy recommended design and operating principles key operating recommendations included using captured water quickly keeping the reuse dam empty as much as possible and ensuring that water only spilt to regional drains during winter or after a summer storm of more than 50 mm in 24 h this would maximise water collection whilst minimising the concentration and build up of salt and nutrients dnre 2002 although reuse dam installation has been encouraged in the sir since the 1990s the exact number distribution and capacity of reuse dams is not known it is estimated that approximately 3300 reuse dams are installed in the sir of which 2700 were installed prior to the incentive scheme within the sir all water supplied to farms is metered and the flows loads in regional drains are regularly monitored yet the effectiveness of reuse dams in reducing farm nutrient exports to drains and receiving water bodies has never been explicitly assessed 2 2 farm interviews convergent interviewing dick 1998 was used to identify key elements of the dairy farm system influencing benefits from reuse dam management and to identify the relationship between these key elements and producers decisions and behaviour in relation to irrigation management interviews were conducted with twenty farmers from across the sir between november 2013 and january 2014 the twenty interviewees were selected using convenience sampling from lists of past participants of regional irrigation extension programs interviews were conducted with farmers from a range of contexts walter 2006 to minimise the risk that the sample was unrepresentative of certain groups of the population the farms varied in soils and topography ranging in size from 0 25 km2 with a milking herd of 120 cows through to 15 km2 and a milking herd of 1200 cows the interviewees varied in their age and educational background a semi structured interview schedule was developed prior to interviewing the selected sample the interview was designed to obtain information to understand how dairy farmers managed their irrigation water at the whole farm level questions about farm characteristics irrigation systems and irrigation practices provided the information to identify key elements of the farm system that influenced the benefits to be had from reuse dam management during the interviews the laddering technique grunert and grunert 1995 was used to systematically explore the reasoning underlying the decisions and actions of the interviewee interview responses were recorded manually by two interviewers summarised then analysed using case and cross case analysis patton 1990 this resulted in identification of benefit segments for reuse dam management on surface irrigated dairy farms in the sir 2 3 field monitoring reuse system operation under normal farm practice was monitored on 16 dairy farms for three week periods between december 2013 and may 2014 and on 15 dairy farms for five week periods between november 2014 and may 2015 three sites were monitored concurrently sites were purposively selected to cover a range of reuse management segments see section 2 1 and 3 1 and the diversity of water sources available to farmers gravity supplied surface water groundwater treated wastewater perennial pasture perennial ryegrass and white clover lucerne sorghum millet or annual pasture were irrigated on the farms with milking herd sizes ranging from 160 to 800 cows the reuse systems varied from single self contained dams to interlinked dams sited along natural depression lines with most being below ground sumps information was obtained from farmers about their farm irrigation practices reuse practices fertiliser and grazing regimes and how these had changed in the last ten years sites were then classified according to the defined reuse management segments section 2 2 2 3 1 measurements water delivered to the reuse dam s catchment was measured using existing water supply meters surface water groundwater and treated wastewater which were read at the start end and once per week during the monitoring period rainfall was measured using a tipping bucket rain gauge recording rainfall in 0 2 mm increments and logged every 5 2013 14 or 15 2014 15 minutes dam evaporation was monitored using a custom built floating evaporation pan similar to that used by masoner et al 2008 with water levels within the pan logged every 30 min using wt hr capacitance depth meters intech instruments new zealand reuse dam water levels were monitored using a pumppro 6150 advanced liquid level sensor environmental systems and services australia and logged every 5 2013 14 or 15 2014 15 minutes this sensor used a hydrostatic backpressure measuring system to calculate the depth of water above the submerged end of a tube ess 2008 with an accuracy of 50 mm for the 15 farms monitored in 2014 15 water quality and depth volume relationship measurements were also undertaken within each dam water samples were collected from five random locations at two depths near surface and near bottom on a weekly interval water samples for a given depth collected from 5 locations were combined for analysis a sample of delivered surface i e channel water was also collected for analysis once per site water quality parameters including ph electrical conductivity ec total nitrogen tn nox n nitrate no3 plus nitrite no2 total phosphorus tp and filterable reactive p frp 0 45 μm filter were determined ammonium n nh3 n was also determined for samples collected on and after 17 february 2015 all ph and ec measurements were made in situ using a sension portable multi parameter meter with ph and conductivity electrodes hach colorado usa with the electrodes calibrated weekly prior to field deployment the other water quality parameters were determined using flow injection analysis by the monash water studies centre clayton australia nata accreditation number 3285 water samples were stored on ice in the field and during transport and then refrigerated or frozen until arrival at the laboratory volume depth and surface area depth relationships for each dam were determined from a 3d digital terrain model of the dam developed by combining above water surface gps readings with echo based survey data ceescope echo sounder ceehydrosystems australia data were collected using a remotely controlled z boat teledyne oceanscience california usa 2 3 2 reuse dam operation performance the performance of reuse dams was assessed by measuring the number of spill events the percentage of time the dam was empty and full the percentage of water captured in the reuse system and the percentage of the captured water that was reused table 1 these were calculated using water delivery inflow and outflow data the volume of water held within the dam at start and end of monitoring was determined using the measured depth and depth volume relationship dam hydrographs of depth against time were used to identify rising and falling limbs indicating periods of inflow rising limb and outflow falling limb with steepness used to infer the cause of change possible inflows included rainfall runoff gradual increase in water level irrigation runoff rapid increase or direct delivery of other waters such as pumped groundwater or treated wastewater rapid increase possible outflows included pumping steep decline evaporation and seepage gradual decline and spills not quantifiable but indicated by duration that dam depth was at full capacity measured depths were converted to volumes using the depth volume relationships as inflows were not measured directly both inflow and outflow could be underestimated at times where inflow and outflow were concurrent the proportion of time that a given capacity was available to receive water was assessed using dam capacity exceedance curves for each water depth reading the water depth as a percentage of the maximum dam depth was calculated and then this value subtracted from 100 to give the available dam depth capacity at that time these data on the available dam depth capacity were then sorted from highest to lowest ranked and assigned a plotting position using the weibull formula gordon et al 1992 for 2014 15 data exceedance curves for dam capacity based on both dam depth and dam volume were developed 2 3 3 reuse dam water quality water quality was described using means standard errors of the mean and ranges of the selected constituents preliminary analysis using repeated measure reml linear mixed models showed there were no statistical differences in water quality parameters with depth so they were counted as additional samples additional exploratory analysis was undertaken to examine whether water quality parameters exhibited relationships with the volume of water in the dam the hydrologic process underway at the time of the observation or were influenced by the types of water used within the reuse catchment hydrologic process categories were inflow no change outflow pumping and outflow spill water type categories were 1 channel water 2 channel water and drain diversion 3 channel water and effluent 4 channel water and groundwater and 5 channel water groundwater and treated wastewater 2 4 risk of reuse water quality and reuse water management to production and environment the potential risks from reuse water to pasture production were assessed by 1 comparing the nutrient salt concentrations with irrigation water guidelines and 2 determining the load of the constituents to soil where this water is applied on the farm the observed reuse water quality data were compared to published water quality recommendations for irrigation purposes including anzecc and armcanz 2000b and ayers and westcot 1985 also at each site the average difference between sampled channel water and reuse water was determined for every water quality parameter the amount of n p and salt recirculated within the farm over the monitoring period was calculated by multiplying the total quantity of reuse water removed by pumping by the mean salt p or n concentration at that site the load to receiving land was calculated by dividing this amount by the area over which it was applied potential risks of the reuse water to the environment were assessed by 1 directly comparing the observed concentrations to environmental limits and 2 determining the possibility of reuse dam spills for combinations of various climatic farm and management factors observed for sir as explained in 2 4 1 the direct potential impact to receiving environments was assessed by comparing the data to environmental water requirements such as anzecc armcanz guidelines for lowland rivers in south eastern australia anzecc and armcanz 2000a and harrison 1994 criteria for nutrients in irrigation drains the probability of environmental risk taken as reuse dam spills to the regional drainage system was estimated by first estimating the likely volume of runoff generated for 24 h rainfall events and then assessing the probability of spills for a range of available reuse dam capacities 2 4 1 estimating rainfall runoff a probability distribution of total rainfall runoff for a range of climatic conditions farm characteristics reuse dam catchment areas irrigated or non irrigated farm proportions diversity of soil wetness following irrigation irrigation interval and reuse dam sizes was determined using 10000 monte carlo simulations parameter distributions for these simulations are in table 2 correlations among parameters were not considered long term climate data from the bureau of meterology s tatura weather station located within the sir were used in the analysis the monthly maximum 24 h rainfall series was extracted from 1942 to 2014 rainfall data and the median third quartile and maximum of this series table 3 were used to estimate runoff monthly average 24 h total evapotranspiration was calculated from pan evaporation data 1965 2014 using a pan factor of 0 7 robertson et al 2004 other parameter distributions drew on field monitoring social research data and other published literature for the sir the total rainfall runoff from a dairy farm of area a is the sum of the runoff from the irrigated portion of the farm airr and the runoff from the non irrigated portion anotirr the proportion of the farm that is irrigated will vary over the course of a year for a given rainfall event of p mm the runoff from anotirr roanotirr was estimated as r o a n o t i r r p 50 1 a i r r a a assuming that this unirrigated area could absorb up to 50 mm on any day without generating runoff this is certainly the case in summer the total runoff from the irrigated area roairr was calculated using a water balance approach airr will be watered over n days with n typically 2 days on a modernised farm and 3 4 days on a non modernised farm roairr is the sum of runoff generated on different sections of land that were irrigated on different days it was assumed that airr was divided evenly into n portions with one of these portions airrn watered in a day the average runoff from a section of land irrigated on one of the n days roairrn was estimated as the rainfall p in excess of the soil water r o a i r r n a i r r n p s w d depletion due to evapotranspiration swd since it was last irrigated i e assuming that each irrigation event saturated the soil the soil water depletion was the sum of the daily evapotranspiration since the last irrigation where the number of days elapsed was somewhere between 0 and the defined irrigation interval the irrigation interval was taken as 7 9 days in summer and 12 14 days in spring and autumn as per typical sir practice thus the total runoff from the irrigated area roairr is r o a i r r r o a i r r and the total rainfall runoff roa is given by r o a r o a i r r r o a n o t i r r 2 4 2 estimating probability of a reuse dam spill the current sir reuse dam operation guidelines seek to contain irrigation induced rainfall runoff within a farm stipulating that a reuse dam should not spill during the irrigation season unless a summer storm of more than 50 mm in 24 h occurs department of natural resources and environment 2002 unless an additional license is obtained reuse dam capacity is constrained to 100 m3 for every 10 000 m2 of irrigated perennial pasture to comply with the victorian water irrigation farm dams act 2002 this analysis assumed that a spill would occur if the total calculated rainfall runoff volume roa exceeded the maximum possible reuse dam capacity defined for regulatory compliance as 100 m3x airr where airr is in m2 the probability of a spill was calculated for a range of reuse dam available capacities then plotted as the percentage available capacity against probability of a spill for any day the risk of reuse dam spills to sir drains given current practice was assessed by matching the observed percentage of dam capacity available against time exceedance curves from 2 3 2 with the calculated spill probability dam capacity curve 3 results and discussion 3 1 sir farmer perceived benefits of reuse dams the surveyed farmers highly valued their reuse systems for introducing flexibility and greater control over their irrigation management for many irrigators installing a pump to remove water from their reuse dam created new opportunities for the movement of irrigation water around their farm revolutionising their overall water management farmers tended to rely on experience rather than technology when making day to day decisions about irrigation practice and management longley and kaine 2014 the farmers gained a variety of benefits from reuse systems table 4 which depended on the characteristics of their farm system and these benefits in turn strongly influenced their wider irrigation management where farmers sought to gain benefits such as management flexibility irrigating high ground or improved flow rates they often deliberately used practices leading to increased runoff so that the water could be stored in the reuse dam for subsequent use in those situations improving field scale water efficiency to reduce runoff generates significant opportunity cost to the farmer these opportunity costs include increased time and effort monitoring progress of irrigations to attain an ideal cutoff increased risk of under watering paddocks leading to pasture production losses further risk of pasture production losses in paddocks reliant on access to reuse water for adequate watering and increased risk of not watering certain paddocks due to difficulty in overcoming flow rate or gravity command deficiencies none of the surveyed farmers nor many of the 30 farmers subsequently involved in field monitoring spontaneously nominated reducing off farm discharge of water and nutrients as a benefit of reuse dams 3 2 operational performance of reuse dams rainfall and evaporation for the 2013 14 and 2014 15 irrigation seasons were consistent with long term average conditions for the region with totals at tatura of 277 mm and 1280 mm respectively for 2013 14 season and 223 mm and 1467 mm respectively for 2014 15 season in 2013 14 rainfall and evaporation totals over the three weeks of monitoring ranged between 9 and 71 mm and 32 and 252 mm respectively in 2014 15 the rainfall and evaporation totals for five week periods ranged between 9 and 44 mm and 111 and 313 mm respectively as shown by the frequency of rises and falls in fig 2 reuse dam activity was greatest in summer with farmers tending to store more water in their dams during spring and autumn many of the farmers mentioned that in the years since the 1997 2009 drought they have tended to store water in their reuse dam over winter to enable them to fill their channels or perform irrigations in early spring independently of delivered channel water allocations or restrictions between 3 and 28 of water delivered to a reuse dam catchment was captured in the reuse dam fig 3 this is similar to 5 25 of the applied water savings reported for reuse systems in upper rio grande basin michelsen et al 2009 farmers typically reused 63 of the total water that was captured in their reuse dam over the monitoring period ranging from 0 to 95 across the sites the proportion of water captured that was reused tended to be higher in summer than autumn table 5 using method described in table 1 the median water loss through evaporation and seepage was 4 fig 3 however this loss was proportionally higher in autumn with up to 39 of captured water lost through evaporation and seepage in autumn table 5 using method described in table 1 farmers tended to retain some water in their dams when removing water by pumping fig 3 median available water in the dam that was removed by pumping was 62 and ranged from 6 to 93 at the various sites possible reasons for this could include that the pumps used were of inadequate capacity that there was insufficient land available to receive the full volume of water or that water was deliberately being stored in the dam for later use few of the dams monitored in 2013 14 were ever fully emptied the mean percentage of time that dams were empty at less than 5 of capacity in 2014 15 was 6 while they were full at greater than 95 capacity for 18 of the time fig 4 in 2013 14 and to some extent in 2014 15 consistently shallower dam depths were available to hold water for a given proportion of time in late autumn than in summer reinforcing that more water was being stored in dams during autumn while variation existed between sites in 2014 15 the median dam capacity available for 90 of the time was 14 the median capacity available for 50 of the time was 38 and the median dam capacity available for 10 of the time was 79 reuse dam spills to regional drains were observed at 7 farms 46 of those monitored in 2014 15 despite no rainfall events greater than 50 mm in 24 h being recorded the largest 24 h rainfall total observed was 33 8 mm at some sites up to 7 spills occurred over the five week period these results show that on the sampled sir dairy farms most current reuse practices do not conform with key recommended practices in particular using captured water quickly keeping dams empty as much as possible and only letting water spill to drains after summer storms of more than 50 mm in 24 h 3 3 reuse dam water quality the water quality parameter means and their standard errors for the sampled irrigation supply channel water and reuse dam water are reported in table 6 the observed channel water quality concurs with channel water quality reported by nexhip et al 1997 dam surface water quality was not statistically different from that at the bottom because water stratification is less likely in reuse dams as they are shallow and subjected to regular turbulent mixing through inflow and pumping events nitrogen in reuse dam water tended to be in ammonium and organic n forms rather than as nitrate and nitrite nox table 6 higher levels of tn and ammonium compared to nitrate indicate that the majority of n reaching reuse dams is from animal excreta urine and manure and organic matter sources the reuse water quality data particularly ec tn and tp did not exhibit any apparent relationship with water volume in the dam fig 5 confirmed by further statistical regression analysis r2 values of less than 30 this suggests that salt or nutrients are not concentrating within the water column as water levels decrease in the dam which was one concern underpinning the current reuse guidelines management practices were left under farmer control and the number of observations differed for the various water flow types and water source categories thus it is not possible to draw conclusions about these data based on statistical difference however the data do suggest that reuse water quality may differ depending on the type of flow occurring at the time of observation or with the types of water used within the reuse dam catchment water sampled during inflow events had higher median tp frp and tn than water sampled during other flow events such as pumping no change or spills fig 6 no change means either no inflow or outflow or the inflow outflow at the time of water sampling this suggests that some nutrient transformation and or settling out occurs while the water resides in reuse dams median water quality parameters during spill events were similar to the no change water events median ec tended to be higher for sites using groundwater and wastewater within the catchment fig 7 while median tp frp and tn was higher for sites where effluent was used in the immediate vicinity of the dam or drained directly to the dam this is consistent with reported water quality characteristics for non channel water sources in the sir for example groundwater pumped from the upper shepparton formation has an average salinity of 25 s m range 10 200 surapaneni and olsson 2002 while effluent pond water from sir dairy farms has on average 277 mg l tn range 184 596 57 mg l tp range 20 106 and an ec of 26 s m range 12 39 da and depi 2013 3 4 potential risks from reuse dam water quality for plant production as expected reuse water had higher ec n and p levels than supplied channel water tables 6 and 7 and while average values are reported in table 6 to compare water quality with published criteria medians are used in table 7 irrigation water salinity in the sir should not exceed 8 s m in order to protect soil health and maintain clover based pasture production department of primary industries and department of sustainability and environment 2006 although the median ec for reuse dam water was within recommended limits table 7 reuse water at three sites consistently had a higher ec than the thresholds reaching a maximum of 25 8 s m the ph of reuse dam water was generally within the recommended range tp and tn levels were within anzecc armcanz short term ranges for irrigation water but significantly exceeded long term triggers table 7 the observed nutrient and salinity concentrations in reuse water do not pose an immediate risk to production but long term production risks will be determined by how individual farmers manage the reuse water where reuse dam water quality is poor operational practices that could increase risk to production include applying water to land without appropriate dilution repeated application of water to the same parcel of land applying water to a small area without knowing its salt and nutrient load or nutrient budgeting for fertiliser applications without considering the additional load from reuse water for example for every 1000 m3 of reuse water that is used for irrigation on average an additional 292 kg of salt range 53 1098 kg 3 8 kg of p range 1 0 6 7 kg and 8 7 kg of n range 3 1 15 3 kg is applied to the pasture compared to that supplied if an equivalent amount of channel water was used thus a typical sir practice 50 mm irrigation event using undiluted reuse water would add approximately 4 4 g n 1 9 g p and 146 g salt per m2 of soil more than the same irrigation using channel water fig 8 3 5 impact of reuse dam water quality and operational practice on the environment the risks from reuse water quality to the downstream environment expressed in terms of the possible spill risk will be strongly influenced by reuse dam size and operational practice monte carlo simulation indicates that if sir reuse dams consistent with water irrigation farm dams act 2002 capacity constraints were kept empty most dams would be able to capture and contain the runoff from median monthly 24 h maximum rainfall series events occurring during the irrigation season i e up to 15 mm of rain within 24 h under this scenario there is a near zero chance of spill if the dam is empty and a 42 chance of a spill if it is full fig 9 left however as the size of the storm events increase for example the third quartile monthly 24 h maximum rainfall series i e up to 25 mm in 24 h the chance of a spill is much higher the chance of a spill becomes 30 if it is empty and 70 if it is full fig 9 left if an extreme 24 h rainfall or storm occurs consistent with the maximum monthly 24 h maximum rainfall series 50 mm in 24 h a spill is extremely likely regardless of whether the dam is full or empty fig 9 left these extreme maximum rainfall events are unlikely in a typical irrigation season and reuse dams are not expected to contain all water in those situations the probability of a spill was lowest in summer and highest in autumn fig 9 right for both median and third quartile 24 h maximum rainfall higher rainfall and lower soil moisture depletion contributed to the high probability of spills in autumn the actual probability of a spill during autumn may be higher than this estimate given that farmers tended to keep water in their reuse dam during autumn the median exceedance curve for all monitoring data in fig 4 showed that over a given monitoring period dams were 90 full for 78 of the time and that they were 90 empty for only about 14 of time given this current practice as observed on the monitored farms after 15 mm of rain over 24 h median monthly maximum series there is a 30 chance for a spill for 78 of the time this will increase to 60 chance of spill for 78 of the time if rainfall consistent with the third quartile monthly maximum series occurs table 8 the observed reuse dam water quality satisfied the anzecc armcanz guidelines for lowland rivers with respect to ec ph and nox n but greatly exceeded maximum levels for tp frp and tn table 7 figs 6 and 7 most observations of nox n in reuse dams complied with harrison 1994 low levels for irrigation drainage but all observations of tp frp and tn would be classified as high table 7 releasing this lesser quality water off farm may deteriorate the water quality of receiving water bodies including rivers creeks and groundwater systems inefficient reuse of collected tailwater has been shown to result in leaching of nutrients and chemicals to groundwater systems elsewhere kim et al 2000 prichard et al 2005 smukler et al 2012 spalding et al 1979 but seepage losses from the monitored reuse dams in the sir were generally low table 5 in summary this study provides a reference base for the current reuse dam operational practices and of selected water quality constituents in reuse dam water on dairy farms in the sir reuse dams are providing lifestyle and productivity benefits to farmers through improving flexibility of water management and recycling nutrient enhanced water on farm and some environmental benefit off farm by intercepting nutrients and salt in surface runoff and reapplying them to the land however nearly half the observed reuse dams spilt water with tn and tp concentrations exceeding environmental guidelines to the regional drainage system in the absence of 50 mm or greater rainfall events in some cases multiple times this indicates that on many farms there is a possible issue with excess irrigation runoff or with reuse dam sizing or both it also suggests that under current reuse dam management practice the risk to the environment from spills is greater than that envisaged by the regulatory agencies this study did not attempt to demonstrate links between reuse dam spills and downstream water quality issues however the concentrations of tp tn and frp in reuse dam water were much higher than levels in sir regional drains reported by feehan and plunkett 2003 or in irrigation drainage from dairy dominated catchments in the lower murray river mosley and fleming 2010 the impact of reuse dam water once it enters the drainage system is unclear depending on the degree of dilution or transformation that occurs within the drains observed reuse dam spills into drains occurred independently of large rainfall events reducing the likelihood of immediate water dilution in the drain but conversely this also meant a lower chance of the discharged water reaching waterways however subsequent high rainfall events are likely to flush large loads of accumulated nutrients from drains into receiving waters harrison 1994 the fate of reuse water after it enters regional drains requires further study 4 conclusions reuse dams on dairy farms in the sir are providing lifestyle and productivity benefits to farmers through improved flexibility of water management and recycling tailwater runoff on farm interception of nutrients and salt by reuse dams though appears to provide some environmental benefits current reuse dam management practices on many farms do not conform to key recommended practices not keeping the reuse dams empty often enough to capture unanticipated storm runoff reuse water having nutrient concentrations exceeding environmental guidelines and a number of reuse dams spilling to regional drains despite the absence of large rainfall events were observed as key risks to the enviorment these observations suggest that on many farms there is a possible issue with excess irrigation runoff or with reuse dam sizing or both it also means that under the current irrigation and reuse management practices the risk to the environment from spills of nutrient salt enriched water is greater than that envisaged by the regulatory agencies the impact of water spilled into the drainage system is unclear and requires further

11432,installation of tailwater reuse systems in irrigated farms is encouraged to achieve river water quality outcomes however assessment of their efficacy in improving irrigation efficiency or intercepting nutrients and chemicals is limited to a few studies the lifestyle productive and environmental consequences of tailwater reuse dam on dairy farms was investigated using interviews field monitoring and risk assessment in the shepparton irrigation region sir of australia thirty one reuse dams were monitored during the 2013 14 and 2014 15 irrigation seasons with water quantity and quality data collected the farmers believe that reuse dams provide greater flexibility in water management and recycling on farm between 3 and 28 of water delivered to a reuse dam catchment was captured in the reuse dam on average 63 of the total water captured in a reuse dam was pumped out for reuse only 14 of dam capacity was available to capture unanticipated storm runoff for 90 of the time reuse water satisfied environmental guidelines thresholds with respect to ec ph and nox n but greatly exceeded maximum levels for tn tp and frp with median concentrations of 8 1 3 7 and 1 9 mg l respectively under current irrigation and resue practices productive risk appears low however there is a likelihood of reuse water spills to regional drains following 25 mm in 24 h rainfall events even in the absence of large rainfall events number of spills were recorded on 46 of farms although it appears that the reuse dams in the sir provide productivity benefits and environmental benefits to some extent current reuse dam management practices on many farms do not conform to key recommended practices thus the risk to the environment from spills of nutrient enriched water is greater than

operational practices posed risks to the environment or productive land 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the shepparton irrigation region sir is a 5000 km2 area of the southern murray darling basin of australia fig 1 long term average annual rainfall and class a pan evaporation in the region are 450 490 mm and 1360 1590 mm respectively supplemented by an average 1 5 km3 of irrigation water each year irrigation water is delivered under gravity from surface water storages to farms via a 6300 km network of open canals and channels during each irrigation season 15 august through to 15 may some irrigators also secure water from other sources such as pumped groundwater treated wastewater dairy effluent and collected irrigation tailwater runoff the dairy industry in the sir generates 24 percent of australia s total milk production from a total area of 2980 km2 abares 2015 relying on grazed forages as the main feed source for dairy cattle these farms depend on border check irrigation for forage and fodder production between september and may when evaporation greatly exceeds rainfall in border check irrigation water is released through a gate at the top of the rectangular border

installation of reuse dams on dairy farms is encouraged by natural resource managers to minimise waterlogging maximise farm water use efficiency and minimise flow and nutrients in the sir regional drainage systems feehan and plunkett 2003 government incentives for the installation of reuse systems in the sir were provided between july 2001 and june 2010 with installed systems expected to satisfy recommended design and operating principles key operating recommendations included using captured water quickly keeping the reuse dam empty as much as possible and ensuring that water only spilt to regional drains during winter or after a summer storm of more than 50 mm in 24 h this would maximise water collection whilst minimising the concentration and build up of salt and nutrients dnre 2002 although reuse dam installation has been encouraged in the sir since the 1990s the exact number distribution and capacity of reuse dams is not known it is estimated that approximately 3300 reuse dams are installed in the sir of which 2700 were installed prior to the incentive scheme within the sir all water supplied to farms is metered and the flows loads in regional drains are regularly monitored yet the effectiveness of reuse dams in reducing farm nutrient exports to drains and receiving water bodies has never been explicitly assessed 2 2 farm interviews convergent interviewing dick 1998 was used to identify key elements of the dairy farm system influencing benefits from reuse dam management and to identify the relationship between these key elements and producers decisions and behaviour in relation to irrigation management interviews were conducted with twenty farmers from across the sir between november 2013 and january 2014 the twenty interviewees were selected using convenience sampling from lists of past participants of regional irrigation extension programs interviews were conducted with farmers from a range of contexts walter 2006 to minimise the risk that the sample was unrepresentative of certain groups of the population the farms varied in soils and topography ranging in size from 0 25 km2 with a milking herd of 120 cows through to 15 km2 and a milking herd of 1200 cows the interviewees varied in their age and educational background a semi structured interview schedule was developed prior to interviewing the selected sample the interview was designed to obtain information to understand how dairy farmers managed their irrigation water at the whole farm level questions about farm characteristics irrigation systems and irrigation practices provided the information to identify key elements of the farm system that influenced the benefits to be had from reuse dam management during the interviews the laddering technique grunert and grunert 1995 was used to systematically explore the reasoning underlying the decisions and actions of the interviewee interview responses were recorded manually by two interviewers summarised then analysed using case and cross case analysis patton 1990 this resulted in identification of benefit segments for reuse dam management on surface irrigated dairy farms in the sir 2 3 field monitoring reuse system operation under normal farm practice was monitored on 16 dairy farms for three week periods between december 2013 and may 2014 and on 15 dairy farms for five week periods between november 2014 and may 2015 three sites were monitored concurrently sites were purposively selected to cover a range of reuse management segments see section 2 1 and 3 1 and the diversity of water sources available to farmers gravity supplied surface water groundwater treated wastewater perennial pasture perennial ryegrass and white clover lucerne sorghum millet or annual pasture were irrigated on the farms with milking herd sizes ranging from 160 to 800 cows the reuse systems varied from single self contained dams to interlinked dams sited along natural depression lines with most being below ground sumps information was obtained from farmers about their farm irrigation practices reuse practices fertiliser and grazing regimes and how these had changed in the last ten years sites were then classified according to the defined reuse management segments section 2 2 2 3 1 measurements water delivered to the reuse dam s catchment was measured using existing water supply meters surface water groundwater and treated wastewater which were read at the start end and once per week during the monitoring period rainfall was measured using a tipping bucket rain gauge recording rainfall in 0 2 mm increments and logged every 5 2013 14 or 15 2014 15 minutes dam evaporation was monitored using a custom built floating evaporation pan similar to that used by masoner et al 2008 with water levels within the pan logged every 30 min using wt hr capacitance depth meters intech instruments new zealand reuse dam water levels were monitored using a pumppro 6150 advanced liquid level sensor environmental systems and services australia and logged every 5 2013 14 or 15 2014 15 minutes this sensor used a hydrostatic backpressure measuring system to calculate the depth of water above the submerged end of a tube ess 2008 with an accuracy of 50 mm for the 15 farms monitored in 2014 15 water quality and depth volume relationship measurements were also undertaken within each dam water samples were collected from five random locations at two depths near surface and near bottom on a weekly interval water samples for a given depth collected from 5 locations were combined for analysis a sample of delivered surface i e channel water was also collected for analysis once per site water quality parameters including ph electrical conductivity ec total nitrogen tn nox n nitrate no3 plus nitrite no2 total phosphorus tp and filterable reactive p frp 0 45 μm filter were determined ammonium n nh3 n was also determined for samples collected on and after 17 february 2015 all ph and ec measurements were made in situ using a sension portable multi parameter meter with ph and conductivity electrodes hach colorado usa with the electrodes calibrated weekly prior to field deployment the other water quality parameters were determined using flow injection analysis by the monash water studies centre clayton australia nata accreditation number 3285 water samples were stored on ice in the field and during transport and then refrigerated or frozen until arrival at the laboratory volume depth and surface area depth relationships for each dam were determined from a 3d digital terrain model of the dam developed by combining above water surface gps readings with echo based survey data ceescope echo sounder ceehydrosystems australia data were collected using a remotely controlled z boat teledyne oceanscience california usa 2 3 2 reuse dam operation performance the performance of reuse dams was assessed by measuring the number of spill events the percentage of time the dam was empty and full the percentage of water captured in the reuse system and the percentage of the captured water that was reused table 1 these were calculated using water delivery inflow and outflow data the volume of water held within the dam at start and end of monitoring was determined using the measured depth and depth volume relationship dam hydrographs of depth against time were used to identify rising and falling limbs indicating periods of inflow rising limb and outflow falling limb with steepness used to infer the cause of change possible inflows included rainfall runoff gradual increase in water level irrigation runoff rapid increase or direct delivery of other waters such as pumped groundwater or treated wastewater rapid increase possible outflows included pumping steep decline evaporation and seepage gradual decline and spills not quantifiable but indicated by duration that dam depth was at full capacity measured depths were converted to volumes using the depth volume relationships as inflows were not measured directly both inflow and outflow could be underestimated at times where inflow and outflow were concurrent the proportion of time that a given capacity was available to receive water was assessed using dam capacity exceedance curves for each water depth reading the water depth as a percentage of the maximum dam depth was calculated and then this value subtracted from 100 to give the available dam depth capacity at that time these data on the available dam depth capacity were then sorted from highest to lowest ranked and assigned a plotting position using the weibull formula gordon et al 1992 for 2014 15 data exceedance curves for dam capacity based on both dam depth and dam volume were developed 2 3 3 reuse dam water quality water quality was described using means standard errors of the mean and ranges of the selected constituents preliminary analysis using repeated measure reml linear mixed models showed there were no statistical differences in water quality parameters with depth so they were counted as additional samples additional exploratory analysis was undertaken to examine whether water quality parameters exhibited relationships with the volume of water in the dam the hydrologic process underway at the time of the observation or were influenced by the types of water used within the reuse catchment hydrologic process categories were inflow no change outflow pumping and outflow spill water type categories were 1 channel water 2 channel water and drain diversion 3 channel water and effluent 4 channel water and groundwater and 5 channel water groundwater and treated wastewater 2 4 risk of reuse water quality and reuse water management to production and environment the potential risks from reuse water to pasture production were assessed by 1 comparing the nutrient salt concentrations with irrigation water guidelines and 2 determining the load of the constituents to soil where this water is applied on the farm the observed reuse water quality data were compared to published water quality recommendations for irrigation purposes including anzecc and armcanz 2000b and ayers and westcot 1985 also at each site the average difference between sampled channel water and reuse water was determined for every water quality parameter the amount of n p and salt recirculated within the farm over the monitoring period was calculated by multiplying the total quantity of reuse water removed by pumping by the mean salt p or n concentration at that site the load to receiving land was calculated by dividing this amount by the area over which it was applied potential risks of the reuse water to the environment were assessed by 1 directly comparing the observed concentrations to environmental limits and 2 determining the possibility of reuse dam spills for combinations of various climatic farm and management factors observed for sir as explained in 2 4 1 the direct potential impact to receiving environments was assessed by comparing the data to environmental water requirements such as anzecc armcanz guidelines for lowland rivers in south eastern australia anzecc and armcanz 2000a and harrison 1994 criteria for nutrients in irrigation drains the probability of environmental risk taken as reuse dam spills to the regional drainage system was estimated by first estimating the likely volume of runoff generated for 24 h rainfall events and then assessing the probability of spills for a range of available reuse dam capacities 2 4 1 estimating rainfall runoff a probability distribution of total rainfall runoff for a range of climatic conditions farm characteristics reuse dam catchment areas irrigated or non irrigated farm proportions diversity of soil wetness following irrigation irrigation interval and reuse dam sizes was determined using 10000 monte carlo simulations parameter distributions for these simulations are in table 2 correlations among parameters were not considered long term climate data from the bureau of meterology s tatura weather station located within the sir were used in the analysis the monthly maximum 24 h rainfall series was extracted from 1942 to 2014 rainfall data and the median third quartile and maximum of this series table 3 were used to estimate runoff monthly average 24 h total evapotranspiration was calculated from pan evaporation data 1965 2014 using a pan factor of 0 7 robertson et al 2004 other parameter distributions drew on field monitoring social research data and other published literature for the sir the total rainfall runoff from a dairy farm of area a is the sum of the runoff from the irrigated portion of the farm airr and the runoff from the non irrigated portion anotirr the proportion of the farm that is irrigated will vary over the course of a year for a given rainfall event of p mm the runoff from anotirr roanotirr was estimated as r o a n o t i r r p 50 1 a i r r a a assuming that this unirrigated area could absorb up to 50 mm on any day without generating runoff this is certainly the case in summer the total runoff from the irrigated area roairr was calculated using a water balance approach airr will be watered over n days with n typically 2 days on a modernised farm and 3 4 days on a non modernised farm roairr is the sum of runoff generated on different sections of land that were irrigated on different days it was assumed that airr was divided evenly into n portions with one of these portions airrn watered in a day the average runoff from a section of land irrigated on one of the n days roairrn was estimated as the rainfall p in excess of the soil water r o a i r r n a i r r n p s w d depletion due to evapotranspiration swd since it was last irrigated i e assuming that each irrigation event saturated the soil the soil water depletion was the sum of the daily evapotranspiration since the last irrigation where the number of days elapsed was somewhere between 0 and the defined irrigation interval the irrigation interval was taken as 7 9 days in summer and 12 14 days in spring and autumn as per typical sir practice thus the total runoff from the irrigated area roairr is r o a i r r r o a i r r and the total rainfall runoff roa is given by r o a r o a i r r r o a n o t i r r 2 4 2 estimating probability of a reuse dam spill the current sir reuse dam operation guidelines seek to contain irrigation induced rainfall runoff within a farm stipulating that a reuse dam should not spill during the irrigation season unless a summer storm of more than 50 mm in 24 h occurs department of natural resources and environment 2002 unless an additional license is obtained reuse dam capacity is constrained to 100 m3 for every 10 000 m2 of irrigated perennial pasture to comply with the victorian water irrigation farm dams act 2002 this analysis assumed that a spill would occur if the total calculated rainfall runoff volume roa exceeded the maximum possible reuse dam capacity defined for regulatory compliance as 100 m3x airr where airr is in m2 the probability of a spill was calculated for a range of reuse dam available capacities then plotted as the percentage available capacity against probability of a spill for any day the risk of reuse dam spills to sir drains given current practice was assessed by matching the observed percentage of dam capacity available against time exceedance curves from 2 3 2 with the calculated spill probability dam capacity curve 3 results and discussion 3 1 sir farmer perceived benefits of reuse dams the surveyed farmers highly valued their reuse systems for introducing flexibility and greater control over their irrigation management for many irrigators installing a pump to remove water from their reuse dam created new opportunities for the movement of irrigation water around their farm revolutionising their overall water management farmers tended to rely on experience rather than technology when making day to day decisions about irrigation practice and management longley and kaine 2014 the farmers gained a variety of benefits from reuse systems table 4 which depended on the characteristics of their farm system and these benefits in turn strongly influenced their wider irrigation management where farmers sought to gain benefits such as management flexibility irrigating high ground or improved flow rates they often deliberately used practices leading to increased runoff so that the water could be stored in the reuse dam for subsequent use in those situations improving field scale water efficiency to reduce runoff generates significant opportunity cost to the farmer these opportunity costs include increased time and effort monitoring progress of irrigations to attain an ideal cutoff increased risk of under watering paddocks leading to pasture production losses further risk of pasture production losses in paddocks reliant on access to reuse water for adequate watering and increased risk of not watering certain paddocks due to difficulty in overcoming flow rate or gravity command deficiencies none of the surveyed farmers nor many of the 30 farmers subsequently involved in field monitoring spontaneously nominated reducing off farm discharge of water and nutrients as a benefit of reuse dams 3 2 operational performance of reuse dams rainfall and evaporation for the 2013 14 and 2014 15 irrigation seasons were consistent with long term average conditions for the region with totals at tatura of 277 mm and 1280 mm respectively for 2013 14 season and 223 mm and 1467 mm respectively for 2014 15 season in 2013 14 rainfall and evaporation totals over the three weeks of monitoring ranged between 9 and 71 mm and 32 and 252 mm respectively in 2014 15 the rainfall and evaporation totals for five week periods ranged between 9 and 44 mm and 111 and 313 mm respectively as shown by the frequency of rises and falls in fig 2 reuse dam activity was greatest in summer with farmers tending to store more water in their dams during spring and autumn many of the farmers mentioned that in the years since the 1997 2009 drought they have tended to store water in their reuse dam over winter to enable them to fill their channels or perform irrigations in early spring independently of delivered channel water allocations or restrictions between 3 and 28 of water delivered to a reuse dam catchment was captured in the reuse dam fig 3 this is similar to 5 25 of the applied water savings reported for reuse systems in upper rio grande basin michelsen et al 2009 farmers typically reused 63 of the total water that was captured in their reuse dam over the monitoring period ranging from 0 to 95 across the sites the proportion of water captured that was reused tended to be higher in summer than autumn table 5 using method described in table 1 the median water loss through evaporation and seepage was 4 fig 3 however this loss was proportionally higher in autumn with up to 39 of captured water lost through evaporation and seepage in autumn table 5 using method described in table 1 farmers tended to retain some water in their dams when removing water by pumping fig 3 median available water in the dam that was removed by pumping was 62 and ranged from 6 to 93 at the various sites possible reasons for this could include that the pumps used were of inadequate capacity that there was insufficient land available to receive the full volume of water or that water was deliberately being stored in the dam for later use few of the dams monitored in 2013 14 were ever fully emptied the mean percentage of time that dams were empty at less than 5 of capacity in 2014 15 was 6 while they were full at greater than 95 capacity for 18 of the time fig 4 in 2013 14 and to some extent in 2014 15 consistently shallower dam depths were available to hold water for a given proportion of time in late autumn than in summer reinforcing that more water was being stored in dams during autumn while variation existed between sites in 2014 15 the median dam capacity available for 90 of the time was 14 the median capacity available for 50 of the time was 38 and the median dam capacity available for 10 of the time was 79 reuse dam spills to regional drains were observed at 7 farms 46 of those monitored in 2014 15 despite no rainfall events greater than 50 mm in 24 h being recorded the largest 24 h rainfall total observed was 33 8 mm at some sites up to 7 spills occurred over the five week period these results show that on the sampled sir dairy farms most current reuse practices do not conform with key recommended practices in particular using captured water quickly keeping dams empty as much as possible and only letting water spill to drains after summer storms of more than 50 mm in 24 h 3 3 reuse dam water quality the water quality parameter means and their standard errors for the sampled irrigation supply channel water and reuse dam water are reported in table 6 the observed channel water quality concurs with channel water quality reported by nexhip et al 1997 dam surface water quality was not statistically different from that at the bottom because water stratification is less likely in reuse dams as they are shallow and subjected to regular turbulent mixing through inflow and pumping events nitrogen in reuse dam water tended to be in ammonium and organic n forms rather than as nitrate and nitrite nox table 6 higher levels of tn and ammonium compared to nitrate indicate that the majority of n reaching reuse dams is from animal excreta urine and manure and organic matter sources the reuse water quality data particularly ec tn and tp did not exhibit any apparent relationship with water volume in the dam fig 5 confirmed by further statistical regression analysis r2 values of less than 30 this suggests that salt or nutrients are not concentrating within the water column as water levels decrease in the dam which was one concern underpinning the current reuse guidelines management practices were left under farmer control and the number of observations differed for the various water flow types and water source categories thus it is not possible to draw conclusions about these data based on statistical difference however the data do suggest that reuse water quality may differ depending on the type of flow occurring at the time of observation or with the types of water used within the reuse dam catchment water sampled during inflow events had higher median tp frp and tn than water sampled during other flow events such as pumping no change or spills fig 6 no change means either no inflow or outflow or the inflow outflow at the time of water sampling this suggests that some nutrient transformation and or settling out occurs while the water resides in reuse dams median water quality parameters during spill events were similar to the no change water events median ec tended to be higher for sites using groundwater and wastewater within the catchment fig 7 while median tp frp and tn was higher for sites where effluent was used in the immediate vicinity of the dam or drained directly to the dam this is consistent with reported water quality characteristics for non channel water sources in the sir for example groundwater pumped from the upper shepparton formation has an average salinity of 25 s m range 10 200 surapaneni and olsson 2002 while effluent pond water from sir dairy farms has on average 277 mg l tn range 184 596 57 mg l tp range 20 106 and an ec of 26 s m range 12 39 da and depi 2013 3 4 potential risks from reuse dam water quality for plant production as expected reuse water had higher ec n and p levels than supplied channel water tables 6 and 7 and while average values are reported in table 6 to compare water quality with published criteria medians are used in table 7 irrigation water salinity in the sir should not exceed 8 s m in order to protect soil health and maintain clover based pasture production department of primary industries and department of sustainability and environment 2006 although the median ec for reuse dam water was within recommended limits table 7 reuse water at three sites consistently had a higher ec than the thresholds reaching a maximum of 25 8 s m the ph of reuse dam water was generally within the recommended range tp and tn levels were within anzecc armcanz short term ranges for irrigation water but significantly exceeded long term triggers table 7 the observed nutrient and salinity concentrations in reuse water do not pose an immediate risk to production but long term production risks will be determined by how individual farmers manage the reuse water where reuse dam water quality is poor operational practices that could increase risk to production include applying water to land without appropriate dilution repeated application of water to the same parcel of land applying water to a small area without knowing its salt and nutrient load or nutrient budgeting for fertiliser applications without considering the additional load from reuse water for example for every 1000 m3 of reuse water that is used for irrigation on average an additional 292 kg of salt range 53 1098 kg 3 8 kg of p range 1 0 6 7 kg and 8 7 kg of n range 3 1 15 3 kg is applied to the pasture compared to that supplied if an equivalent amount of channel water was used thus a typical sir practice 50 mm irrigation event using undiluted reuse water would add approximately 4 4 g n 1 9 g p and 146 g salt per m2 of soil more than the same irrigation using channel water fig 8 3 5 impact of reuse dam water quality and operational practice on the environment the risks from reuse water quality to the downstream environment expressed in terms of the possible spill risk will be strongly influenced by reuse dam size and operational practice monte carlo simulation indicates that if sir reuse dams consistent with water irrigation farm dams act 2002 capacity constraints were kept empty most dams would be able to capture and contain the runoff from median monthly 24 h maximum rainfall series events occurring during the irrigation season i e up to 15 mm of rain within 24 h under this scenario there is a near zero chance of spill if the dam is empty and a 42 chance of a spill if it is full fig 9 left however as the size of the storm events increase for example the third quartile monthly 24 h maximum rainfall series i e up to 25 mm in 24 h the chance of a spill is much higher the chance of a spill becomes 30 if it is empty and 70 if it is full fig 9 left if an extreme 24 h rainfall or storm occurs consistent with the maximum monthly 24 h maximum rainfall series 50 mm in 24 h a spill is extremely likely regardless of whether the dam is full or empty fig 9 left these extreme maximum rainfall events are unlikely in a typical irrigation season and reuse dams are not expected to contain all water in those situations the probability of a spill was lowest in summer and highest in autumn fig 9 right for both median and third quartile 24 h maximum rainfall higher rainfall and lower soil moisture depletion contributed to the high probability of spills in autumn the actual probability of a spill during autumn may be higher than this estimate given that farmers tended to keep water in their reuse dam during autumn the median exceedance curve for all monitoring data in fig 4 showed that over a given monitoring period dams were 90 full for 78 of the time and that they were 90 empty for only about 14 of time given this current practice as observed on the monitored farms after 15 mm of rain over 24 h median monthly maximum series there is a 30 chance for a spill for 78 of the time this will increase to 60 chance of spill for 78 of the time if rainfall consistent with the third quartile monthly maximum series occurs table 8 the observed reuse dam water quality satisfied the anzecc armcanz guidelines for lowland rivers with respect to ec ph and nox n but greatly exceeded maximum levels for tp frp and tn table 7 figs 6 and 7 most observations of nox n in reuse dams complied with harrison 1994 low levels for irrigation drainage but all observations of tp frp and tn would be classified as high table 7 releasing this lesser quality water off farm may deteriorate the water quality of receiving water bodies including rivers creeks and groundwater systems inefficient reuse of collected tailwater has been shown to result in leaching of nutrients and chemicals to groundwater systems elsewhere kim et al 2000 prichard et al 2005 smukler et al 2012 spalding et al 1979 but seepage losses from the monitored reuse dams in the sir were generally low table 5 in summary this study provides a reference base for the current reuse dam operational practices and of selected water quality constituents in reuse dam water on dairy farms in the sir reuse dams are providing lifestyle and productivity benefits to farmers through improving flexibility of water management and recycling nutrient enhanced water on farm and some environmental benefit off farm by intercepting nutrients and salt in surface runoff and reapplying them to the land however nearly half the observed reuse dams spilt water with tn and tp concentrations exceeding environmental guidelines to the regional drainage system in the absence of 50 mm or greater rainfall events in some cases multiple times this indicates that on many farms there is a possible issue with excess irrigation runoff or with reuse dam sizing or both it also suggests that under current reuse dam management practice the risk to the environment from spills is greater than that envisaged by the regulatory agencies this study did not attempt to demonstrate links between reuse dam spills and downstream water quality issues however the concentrations of tp tn and frp in reuse dam water were much higher than levels in sir regional drains reported by feehan and plunkett 2003 or in irrigation drainage from dairy dominated catchments in the lower murray river mosley and fleming 2010 the impact of reuse dam water once it enters the drainage system is unclear depending on the degree of dilution or transformation that occurs within the drains observed reuse dam spills into drains occurred independently of large rainfall events reducing the likelihood of immediate water dilution in the drain but conversely this also meant a lower chance of the discharged water reaching waterways however subsequent high rainfall events are likely to flush large loads of accumulated nutrients from drains into receiving waters harrison 1994 the fate of reuse water after it enters regional drains requires further study 4 conclusions reuse dams on dairy farms in the sir are providing lifestyle and productivity benefits to farmers through improved flexibility of water management and recycling tailwater runoff on farm interception of nutrients and salt by reuse dams though appears to provide some environmental benefits current reuse dam management practices on many farms do not conform to key recommended practices not keeping the reuse dams empty often enough to capture unanticipated storm runoff reuse water having nutrient concentrations exceeding environmental guidelines and a number of reuse dams spilling to regional drains despite the absence of large rainfall events were observed as key risks to the enviorment these observations suggest that on many farms there is a possible issue with excess irrigation runoff or with reuse dam sizing or both it also means that under the current irrigation and reuse management practices the risk to the environment from spills of nutrient salt enriched water is greater than that envisaged by the regulatory agencies the impact of water spilled into the drainage system is unclear and requires further

11433,in the altay prefecture serious rust disease develops on apocynum venetum in the organic farming systems that apply water every two to three days using trickle irrigation a two year field experiment was conducted to study the influence of extending the irrigation frequency on rust development and the economic viability of a venetum the maximum disease index di max and the area under the disease progress curve audpc with an irrigation interval of three days t1 treatment control in this study reached 48 4 and 718 in 2012 and 54 4 and 1561 in 2013 with irrigation extended out to intervals of seven t3 treatment nine t4 treatment and eleven days t5 treatment the dimax were 35 4 to 61 9 and the audpc were 36 4 to 65 6 lower than that of the t1 treatment for all irrigation treatments the audpc had a significant positive correlation with the soil water content of the surface 0 20 cm in depth and the main distributing regions of roots 20 1 40 cm in depth as well as the density of a venetum for the t3 treatment the economic value of applied irrigation water was the highest and the amount of water applied was 54 8 lower than that of the t1 treatment and thus it was determined as the optimum irrigation regime keywords disease intensity irrigation schedule organic crop leaf production economic values 1 introduction apocynum venetum apocynaceae is a perennial herbaceous plant thevs et al 2012 the extracts of leaves of this plant have been proven to effectively lower blood pressure and have cardiotonic antidepressant anxiolytic and antioxidant activities and so it has been used to produce medicinal products xie et al 2012 since 2009 more than 7300 ha of a venetum fields have been established in the xinjiang uygur autonomous region china of which 2000 ha have been established in certified organic agricultural land near the alakak township of the altay prefecture in this region rust caused by melampsora apocyni is the major disease affecting a venetum and has been reported in some countries of northern europe and asian gao et al 2017 in the altay prefecture the rust disease on cultivated a venetum was first observed in 2009 and later on the attempt of a grower of a venetum to increase leaf yield through using frequent irrigation interval of two or three days couldn t continue as the rust disease became too severe the disease incidence maximums reached 100 causing leaf yellowing wilting and defoliation and even the death of the overwintering plant parts leading to huge economic loss gao et al 2017 the organic farming of a venetum crops prohibits the use of chemical fungicides to control the rust disease and no cultivars of the species with durable rust resistance exist thus there is an urgent requirement to utilize cultural practices such as optimization of irrigation schedules to improve rust disease management in the organic farming systems previous studies have shown that frequent irrigation increases the foliar rust intensity on some plants such as wheat triticum aestivum soybean glycine max and willow melampsora epitea resulting from changes of topsoil water content rotem and palti 1969 toome et al 2010a attempts to provide protection against the onset of foliar rust diseases and to decrease severity through decreasing irrigation frequency or the amount of irrigation have had some success in controlling rust disease palti and shoham 1983 dixon 2015 for example black et al 2001 reported that rust puccinia arachidis intensity of peanut arachis hypogaea plants under the lowest amount of irrigation treatment was 60 to 70 less than that of the highest amount of irrigation in altay prefecture water saving trickle irrigation using groundwater is in widespread use in organic a venetum fields to afford water for plant growth if the optimization of irrigation schedules has been applied to control rust disease of plants caused by the genus melampsora including on a venetum published reports are lacking the irrigation of a venetum fields not only influences the soil water content but also affects indirectly the density of a venetum plants the total coverage and also the diversity of weeds ping et al 2014 all of which may affect rust disease occurrence wennstrom and ericson 1991 had found that the change of vegetation coverage by grazing significantly reduced rust puccinia pulsatillae on pulsatilla pratensis another experiment by mitchell et al 2002 found that increased density of individual host species increased plant infection and disease severity in addition decreased plant species diversity increased pathogen load and the loading of the pathogens was almost three times greater in the average monoculture than in the average plot planted with 24 grassland plant species eleven individual diseases increased in severity percentage of leaf area infected by a single disease at low plant species diversity mitchell et al 2002 the density of a venetum plants and vegetation conditions may be modified by irrigation frequency adjustment and thus it is necessary to explore the relationship between these factors and the rust disease development the information gained would help explain how this agricultural practice affects rust development with cultivated a venetum plants in organic farming systems in this study a two year monitoring of the rust was implemented to characterize the temporal development of rust disease under five irrigation frequencies in addition the association of rust intensity with the soil water content the density of the a venetum crop and vegetation conditions were determined we hypothesized that the rust disease intensity will decrease with extending of irrigation interval as the irrigation adjustment will reduce the leaf yield the economic viability of a venetum crops was assessed including the net profit of a venetum leaf production and economic values of applied irrigation water the aim was to determine an optimal irrigation frequency through achieving a favorable balance between the reduction of rust and the economic viability of a venetum crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site was located in an organically cultivated field of a venetum 47 43 n 87 32 e at an altitude of 482 516 m area 866 ha in the alakak township of the altay prefecture china this region of china experiences a northern temperate zone monsoon climate with an annual rainfall of 126 7 mm and an annual average temperature of 4 5 c over the past 50 years the cultivated a venetum field was established in the early spring of 2011 the seedlings were grown from seeds that were collected from wild a venetum plants neighboring the cultivated field the plants were spaced at 1 m within rows and 3 m between rows as the site was initially too dry for the establishment of a venetum plants were irrigated every 2 or 3 days in 2011 by a trickle irrigation system the cultivated field was uniformly divided to provide blocks each within easy access to a water pump there were ten rows in each block and twenty of the multi stemmed plants in each row each block was separated by a 5 m wide pathway and could be irrigated independently through control valves the inner inlay drip irrigation piping tianye co ltd xinjiang china was laid on the surface of soil along rows and there was one drip emitter at the center of each a venetum plant the spacing of neighboring dripper emitters was 1 m and the discharge rate was 4 lh 1 2 2 soil properties the soil type was a sandy loam soil ph 7 91 organic matter 1 03 available k 212 1 ppm and available p 6 3 ppm to determine the hydraulic properties of the soil undisturbed soil was extracted by a drilling machine down to 80 cm the soil was used to fill a pvc pot diameter 15 cm height 80 cm watered to saturation and covered with a black plastic film to prevent evaporation after water ceased to flow from the pot it was weighed and dried in an oven at 70 c for 7 days the pot was then weighed to determine the mass of water and of the soil the upper limit of the soil water content θul was determined according to the gravimetric method using the following formula θul ww ws 100 where ww the mass of water and ws the total mass of soil the θul value calculated for this soil was 13 7 the available water in the soil was also assessed by measuring the lower limit of the soil water content θll to calculate this variable a venetum seedlings were sown in the pot that contained a core of undisturbed soil after the plants had been growing for one year no water was further added to the pot after all the leaves of plants had wilted from lack of water the soil water content was immediately determined using the above formula the θll value calculated for this soil was 3 0 2 3 plant roots distribution characteristics by using a soil drilling method the root distribution of a venetum in this study site was determined there was a small quantity of horizontal rhizomes and root hairs in the soil of the 0 20 cm depth topsoil in the soil of 20 1 40 cm in depth a large quantity of lateral roots and root hairs grew from taproots thus it was the main distributing root zone in the lowest soil that was from 40 cm to the end of taproots 80 cm there were less lateral roots and root hairs 2 4 experimental design the experiments were conducted in 1 june to 31 august of 2012 and 2013 in a flat area in the cultivated a venetum field altitude of 495 m area approximately 60 ha with uniform soil properties before the experiment the irrigation frequency in this commercial field was an interval of every three days this interval of three days served as the control treatment denoted as t1 four irrigation frequencies extending the spacing of the irrigation were applied in the study interval of five t2 treatment seven t3 treatment nine t4 treatment and eleven t5 treatment days the time of irrigation was between 10 00 am and 5 00 pm there were four replications of each treatment arranged in a randomized complete block with a total of 20 plots 2 5 measurement 2 5 1 disease evaluation each year the disease was evaluated every 7 10 days from june to august ten a venetum shrubs of a roughly similar size and height were marked in each plot and five stems of each shrub including one at the center were marked for a rust survey three leaves taken at each of three sampling heights 10 cm 11 50 cm and 50 cm above the ground of each marked stem were used to assess the disease severity of rust 450 leaves from each plot were sampled non destructively for each evaluation rust severity was recorded as one of six discrete levels by visually estimating the percentage of observed leaves that were covered by uredinia 0 for no signs of infection 1 for 0 1 to 5 of leaf area covered with pustules 2 for 5 1 to 20 3 for 20 1 to 75 4 for 75 1 to 90 and 5 for 90 1 to 100 the disease index di was calculated by the following formula and used to assess rust disease intensity 1 d i 5 l n 100 σ i 0 i l n where i is the disease severity scale i 0 1 2 3 4 5 and ln and ln are the total number of leaves and the number of leaves of each disease severity respectively zhang et al 2007 for each plot the mean disease index of those three heights was used to analyze the temporal disease progression at the end of the experiment another disease intensity index the area under the disease progress curve audpc was calculated according to the equation 2 a u d p c σ i 1 n y i y i 1 2 t i 1 t i where yi is the disease index at the ith observation n is the number of observations and ti is the time in days of the ith observation shaner and finney 1977 2 5 2 temperature and precipitation recording daily average air temperatures and precipitation levels were recorded from june to august of 2012 and 2013 at an automatic meteorological observation station em50 decagon devices inc pullman wa us located at the cultivated fields temperature data were summarized as monthly averages in degrees celsius and precipitation data were summarized as monthly totals in millimeters 2 5 3 soil water content measurement soil water content was measured from 1 to 19 june 17 27 july and 14 25 august in 2012 and 2013 the rainfall was low or absent during this time three shrubs of each plot were randomly selected and harvested at ground level before and after irrigation the soil beneath each plant was sampled at 10 cm intervals from the soil surface to a depth of 80 cm using a 3 cm diameter soil auger at the central and front positions of the wetted soil zone within each shrub the soil samples were sealed in an aluminum box immediately after they were collected in the field the fresh weights were measured in the laboratory and then the samples were oven dried dgg 9036a oven shanghai linping instrument co ltd china at 105 c for 48 h to determine the dry weight the soil water content of each sampling depth was presented as a percentage of the dried soil weight for each sampling point based on the distribution characteristics of a venetum roots the water content of topsoil 0 20 cm depth main distributing root zone 20 1 40 cm depth and lowest soil 40 1 80 cm depth was presented as average values of soil water content in corresponding depths at the central and front positions of the wetted soil zone 2 5 4 the density of a venetum and vegetation parameters collection during the same period of soil water content measurement stem numbers of a venetum in each quadrat were counted and the total vegetation coverage and species diversity in each quadrat was measured using the point intercept method developed by goodall 1952 five 5 5 m quadrats were surveyed at the middle and around the margins 2 rows from the margins of each plot the total vegetation coverage was estimated by recording the number of the vertical survey pin contacts with leaves the coverage of each species was estimated by recording the number of species touched by each pin the coverage data were expressed as the percentage of ground covered by all species and each species we used a steel tape to measure the vertical height cm of plants in each quadrat the shannon wiener index of diversity h for the community of each plot was computed from the formula as 3 h p i lnp i where pi h i h c i c 2 h and c are the total height and total coverage of species in the quadrat population h i and c i are the mean values of height and cover degree belonging to the ith species yang et al 2011 2 5 5 leaf yield measurement in 20 august of 2012 and 2013 the time of harvest ten unmarked a venetum shrubs were selected symmetrically from the two diagonals of each plot and from each of which three stems were randomly removed at ground level the leaves of these thirty stems per plot were placed into paper kraft bags and taken to the laboratory where they were air dried in a forced air oven soiltest model l 72c evanston illinois at 65 c for 72 h following which the dried leaves were weighed at the end of the experiment the number of plants in each plot was counted and the leaf yield per unit area hectare was calculated 2 5 6 the economic viability of a venetum crops assessment the a venetum leaves with rust symptoms are still acceptable for the production of some extracts the economic viability of a venetum crops assessment included the net profit of leaves produced and the economic value of the applied irrigation water the producers of a venetum grown commercially in the region provided these data related to the costs of irrigation including the cost of water the cost of electricity for using the water pumps and the cost of labour in the five treatments during the experiment they provided the data of profit of dry leaves per kilogram not excluding the costs of irrigation these data were used to calculate the net profit of dry leaves per hectare in the five treatments through irrigation costs deducted from the profit of dry leaves in this study the economic value of applied irrigation water eviw was defined as the net profit of dry leaf production np against the total amount of applied irrigation water taiw m3 per hectare for each irrigation interval treatment the value of eeiw was calculated according to the equation 4 ev iw np i ta iw i where np i and taiw i is the net profit of dry leaf production and the total amount of applied irrigation water per unit area at the ith irrigation interval treatment 2 6 data statistical analysis for each irrigation interval

service solutions version 19 0 ibm company chicago nc 3 results 3 1 disease progression in 2012 and 2013 rust disease commonly occurred in each plot from june to august the disease index increased gradually over time fig 1 the irrigation frequency and study year significantly p 0 001 affected the area under the disease progress curves audpc table 1 in 2013 rust occurred more severely than in 2012 and rust onset and maximum were 18 and 50 days earlier than in 2012 rust was observed at the same date in plants of the different irrigation treatments but the disease index di and audpc decreased with extension of irrigation frequencies fig 1 table 2 in 2012 and 2013 the maximum disease index dimax and audpc of the t1 interval of three days control in this study and t2 interval of five days treatments were not significantly p 0 89 p 0 21 different but both were higher p 0 05 than those of other treatments at most times fig 1 table 2 in 2012 dimax and audpc of the t3 interval of seven days t4 interval of nine days and t5 interval of eleven days treatments were 40 7 to 61 9 and 51 2 to 65 6 less p 0 05 than that of the t1 treatment respectively fig 1 table 2 in 2013 the decreasing range of dimax and audpc of the t3 t4 and t5 treatments was lower than that of 2012 being 35 4 to 52 and 36 4 to 51 1 p 0 05 less than that of the t1 treatment respectively fig 1 table 2 3 2 precipitation and temperature in 2013 the total precipitation 144 8 mm from june to august was more than twice that of 2012 64 1 mm while the mean temperature in these months plunged 1 7 c lower than that of 2012 table 3 in 2012 june had a little rain but the precipitation of july and august increased gradually being 19 4 mm and 36 0 mm respectively in contrast the precipitation of june in 2013 was the highest 69 0 mm and that of july and august were 19 8 mm and 11 4 mm respectively table 3 in 2012 and 2013 the mean temperatures of june july and august were from 20 1 to 23 9 c table 3 3 3 soil water content before the experiment in 2012 the mean soil water content of the 0 20 cm topsoil 20 1 40 cm the main distributing regions of roots and 40 1 to 80 cm lowest in depth was not significantly p 0 05 different between the five irrigation treatments but these values decreased with extension of irrigation frequencies fig 2 the individual and the combination of irrigation treatment and measure time month and year significantly affected the mean soil water content of the topsoil and the main distributing regions of roots table 1 for the t1 treatment the topsoil water content after irrigation in 2012 and 2013 was between 82 to 97 of the upper limit of soil water content and the values always remained between 69 to 88 before the next irrigation fig 2 the t2 treatment also had high topsoil water content after irrigation 70 8 to 88 3 of the upper limit of soil water content but the values before the next irrigation were lower than that of the t1 treatment and the difference achieved significant p 0 05 level in all recorded months of 2013 fig 2 for the t3 treatment the topsoil water content before and after irrigation was 15 to 50 of the upper limit of soil water content in 2012 and 2013 and it was significantly p 0 05 different from the t1 treatment fig 2 the topsoil water content after irrigation under the t4 and t5 treatments was not significantly p 0 05 different compared with the t3 treatment except in june of 2012 but the values before irrigation were lower than that of the t3 treatment except in july and august of 2013 being between 3 to 36 of the upper limit of the soil water content fig 2 this low water content was most pronounced in 2012 fig 2 with the topsoil being nearly dry before irrigating in 2012 whether before or after irrigation the soil water content of the main distributing regions of roots and lowest soil under the t1 and t2 treatments was higher than of the lower limit of the soil water content θll but lower than 75 of the upper limit of soil water content θds in most months in 2013 this value was higher than θds in most months fig 2 for the t3 t4 and t5 treatments the soil water content of the main distributing regions of roots and lowest soil was lower than θds in 2012 and these values before irrigation were lower than the θll except for the t3 treatment fig 2 a few plants became defoliated under the t4 and t5 treatments fig 3 d and e in 2013 the soil water content of the main distributing regions of roots and lowest soil under these three treatments was lower than θds but always higher than the θll 3 4 density of a venetum the irrigation treatment significantly affected the density of a venetum table 1 the density of a venetum under t1 t2 and t3 treatments was from 29 to 35 stems per square meter and there were no significant p 0 05 differences among them table 4 the values in the t4 and t5 treatments were lower p 0 05 than that of the t1 treatment being from 20 to 24 stems per square meter table 4 3 5 vegetation characteristics the irrigation treatment significantly affected the total vegetation coverage and the combination of irrigation treatment and year also had a

guo et al 2010 vialle et al 2011 li et al 2013 and previous studies have confirmed that the precipitation is a key factor on the rust disease development luo et al 1983 lawrence et al 2007 our results are in agreement as the disease index rapidly increased in the rainy period and the rust disease was more serious in the higher precipitation year based on climatic data for this site it could be argued that precipitation had a major role in determining the rust intensity there was less rain in 2012 throughout the period of disease development and the maximum values of disease index dimax and the differences in the area under the disease progress curves audpc between plants receiving the current and decreasing irrigation frequencies were visibly greater than those in 2013 with higher precipitation these data indicate that water availability is a major factor influencing the rust development topsoil water is a major source of water vapor through evaporation and thus has a direct effect on the microclimatic conditions in agriculture systems palti and shoham 1983 studies of rust disease on soybean glycine max and blackberry rubus laciniatus have found that the air humidity and temperature were decreased with decreased topsoil water content johnson and mahaffee 2010 sikora et al 2014 this microclimatic condition led to shortened periods of leaf wetness resulting in rust disease reduction rowlandson et al 2015 in another study despite trickle irrigation being applied to plants the disease intensity audpc of coffee rust was not decreased with the amount of irrigation and this can be attributed to the topsoil being kept dry due to the drip emitter being buried into the soil within the root zone paiva et al 2011 in this current study the topsoil below a venetum shrubs was always wet after irrigation and the topsoil water content was decreased with reducing irrigation frequency this implied that microclimatic changes resulting from decreasing irrigation frequency were less conducive to rust disease development our study has confirmed the speculation that the topsoil water content had a significant positive correlation with the audpc the soil water content of the main distributing region of a venetum roots also had a decreasing trend with irrigation frequency and the values were always lower than 75 of the upper limit of soil water content when the time between water applications was equal or greater than seven days some studies have confirmed that a venetum plants suffer from drought stress under this soil water condition and the degree of drought stress increases with reducing soil water content wang et al 2012 wang et al 2014 according to a new study in greenhouse conditions drought stress can enhance resistance of a venetum plants to the rust disease resulting from the closure of stomata of leaves high h2o2 content as well as the enhanced activity of pod ppo and pal in leaves as a consequence the disease index was decreased with increasing degree of drought stress gao et al 2018 this is in agreement with our field study results accordingly a reduction in irrigation frequency leads to a venetum plants being exposed to different degrees of drought stress resulting in enhanced resistance of a venetum plants to the rust disease and so may also be a factor that resulted in rust reduction apart from the soil water content the density of a venetum also decreased with reducing irrigation frequency resulting in a decreasing m apocyni urediniospore load and as a consequence there was a significant positive relationship between the density of a venetum and the audpc however research that examined the relationship between plant density and rust intensity in wheat cultivar mixtures and a natural population of jewelweed impatiens capensis did not find that the rust intensity differed when artificial density gradients were maintained chester 1946 lively et al 1995 in contrast some controlled density studies in mono cropping systems such as wheat triticum aestivum creeping bentgrass agrostis stolonifera and willow salix spp found that rust intensity increased with density and indicated that microclimatic conditions in the plant canopy were more conducive to rust infection for example a high plant density reduced air movement and increased leaf shading leading to an increase in the duration of leaf wetness pfleeger and mundt 1998 williams et al 1998 toome et al 2010b clearly in a mixture of a specific number of plants the change of host density does not affect the total coverage of plant communities but the total coverage of a single plant system became lower with decreasing plant density resulting in more adverse microclimatic conditions for rust infection this more accurately explains a universal positive correlation between the rust intensity and the density of a venetum and the total vegetation coverage because reduced irrigation frequency not only resulted in fewer a venetum plants but in fewer weeds and probably produced microclimatic changes less conducive to the rust disease development in agricultural systems weeds near to host plants may be potential alternate hosts of rust pathogens in addition to increasing closure of the canopy and which implies that there is a high risk of rust disease van bruggen and finckh 2016 in contrast a high presence of weeds non susceptible to rust will dilute the availability of susceptible plants resulting in a decreasing pathogen load and as a consequence increasing species diversity in a plant community can reduce disease mitchell et al 2002 a previous study had not found any alternate hosts of m apocyni amongst the weeds in the organic a venetum field gao et al 2017 in this study the species diversity between different irrigation frequency treatments was generally without significant differences and the correlation between the disease intensity and the species diversity was not statistically significant therefore weeds grown in the organic a venetum field did not have a negative effect on rust disease in contrast the weeds increased the total coverage of vegetation and the increase was most extensive under the most frequent irrigation and precipitation condition for example in the high precipitation year 2013 the total coverage of vegetation under the t1 treatment was the highest and was more than 70 in july and august this kind of vegetation condition whether for the grass and shrub lands or some arbor forests has been confirmed to be very favorable for rust development toome et al 2010b liu et al 2016 therefore decreasing irrigation frequency will help suppress weeds especially in the years of high precipitation and improve rust disease management in the organic farming system a venetum is a perennial plant and its yield of leaves will increase with plant age further an adequate water supply will enhance plant growth and should result in a higher leaf yield gao et al 2015 however this study found the opposite result that the yield of leaves under all irrigation treatments in 2013 the year with high precipitation was lower than that of 2012 this phenomenon has a high consistency with the disease intensity host plants have a series of complicated physiological and biochemical responses to the rust disease caused by the genus melampsora for example a build up of reactive oxygen species produced continuously in cellular compartments such as chloroplasts and mitochondria a decrease in photosynthetic pigment content and inhibited photosynthetic electron transport in photosystem ii resulted in a decreased net photosynthetic rate of plants zhang et al 2010 elena et al 2014 in general photosynthetic assimilation product loss increases with disease severity dawson and mccracken 1994 in addition defoliation caused by the genus melampsora infection commonly occurs in host plants such as willow salix spp and poplar populus spp after the disease intensity rapidly reaches or is near to the maximum value leading to a large loss of leaf kenaley et al 2014 elena et al 2014 in 2013 rust disease was more serious than that of 2012 and thus caused a greater loss of a venetum leaf in particular most plants appeared to be defoliated under the t1 and t2 treatments fig 3a b and this resulted in the leaf yield dramatically decreasing accordingly a sole focus on increasing yield of crops through increasing irrigation frequency is inappropriate given that this will lead to more serious rust that causes yield loss for organic a venetum crops especially in high rust outbreak years a venetum plants suffered from drought stress when the time between water applications was more than seven days t3 t4 and t5 and the longer the irrigation intervals the more severely the plant suffered from drought stress wang et al 2012 found that a venetum plants respond to drought stress by reducing leaf transpiration to prevent excessive water deficits through the closing of stomata but co2 diffusion is also restrained resulting in the photosynthetic capacity of plants being decreased there was also a significant decrease of the net photosynthetic rate with an increase in the duration and degree of stress in this study the yields of plant leaves under the t3 t4 and t5 treatments were 51 to 71 less than that of the t1 treatment even under a relative low disease intensity in the year of 2012 severe water shortage could significantly reduce rust disease on a venetum but the huge leaf yield losses would be unacceptable for growers especially in dry years to gain the highest profit is an ultimate objective for growers of crops including for growers of a venetum in this study the net profit of a venetum leaf production was highest in 2012 and 2013 with the t1 and or t2 treatments however the altay prefecture is located in the semi arid and arid regions of china and thus the amount of groundwater used for irrigation must be carefully considered in the commercial production of crops due to it being a non renewable resource ping et al 2014 in other words the highest economic value per unit of water consumption based on ecological economic and social responsibility is a crucial assessment index to ensure sustainable development of the organic crop industry in the semi arid and arid regions li et al 2008 in the five irrigation frequencies offsetting the impact of the reduction of rust disease was the economic value of the irrigation interval of seven days that was the highest value in 2012 and 2013 and was twice that of the t1 treatment with the total amount of water applied being 54 8 less than that of the t1 treatment table 7 the net profit of a venetum leaves of this treatment was only 15 to 18 lower than that of the t1 treatment this reduction of profit is acceptable for producers of a venetum therefore the irrigation interval of seven days is the optimal irrigation schedule for the cultivation of a venetum in the altay prefecture in order to facilitate acceptance of this irrigation schedule to a wider region the irrigation frequency should be reduced as far as possible while maintaining the soil water content of the main distributing region of roots between 50 and 60 of the upper limit of soil water content 5 conclusions this study confirms the hypothesis that extending the irrigation frequency can reduce the rust intensity through changes in soil water content host density and the total vegetation coverage more importantly achieving an optimal irrigation schedule for the cultivated a venetum in the altay prefecture can reduce water resource consumption and raise the economic value obtained from the applied water we believe this cultural practice is an effective means of achieving profitable yields with organic production of a venetum in arid and semi arid regions conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest

11433,in the altay prefecture serious rust disease develops on apocynum venetum in the organic farming systems that apply water every two to three days using trickle irrigation a two year field experiment was conducted to study the influence of extending the irrigation frequency on rust development and the economic viability of a venetum the maximum disease index di max and the area under the disease progress curve audpc with an irrigation interval of three days t1 treatment control in this study reached 48 4 and 718 in 2012 and 54 4 and 1561 in 2013 with irrigation extended out to intervals of seven t3 treatment nine t4 treatment and eleven days t5 treatment the dimax were 35 4 to 61 9 and the audpc were 36 4 to 65 6 lower than that of the t1 treatment for all irrigation treatments the audpc had a significant positive correlation with the soil water content of the surface 0 20 cm in depth and the main distributing regions of roots 20 1 40 cm in depth as well as the density of a venetum for the t3 treatment the economic value of applied irrigation water was the highest and the amount of water applied was 54 8 lower than that of the t1 treatment and thus it was determined as the optimum irrigation regime keywords disease intensity irrigation schedule organic crop leaf production economic values 1 introduction apocynum venetum apocynaceae is a perennial herbaceous plant thevs et al 2012 the extracts of leaves of this plant have been proven to effectively lower blood pressure and have cardiotonic antidepressant anxiolytic and antioxidant activities and so it has been used to produce medicinal products xie et al 2012 since 2009 more than 7300 ha of a venetum fields have been established in the xinjiang uygur autonomous region china of which 2000 ha have been established in certified organic agricultural land near the alakak township of the altay prefecture in this region rust caused by melampsora apocyni is the major disease affecting a venetum and has been reported in some countries of northern europe and asian gao et al 2017 in the altay prefecture the rust disease on cultivated a venetum was first observed in 2009 and later on the attempt of a grower of a venetum to increase leaf yield through using frequent irrigation interval of two or three days couldn t continue as the rust disease became too severe the disease incidence maximums reached 100 causing leaf yellowing wilting and defoliation and even the death of the overwintering plant parts leading to huge economic loss gao et al 2017 the organic farming of a venetum crops prohibits the use of chemical fungicides to control the rust disease and no cultivars of the species with durable rust resistance exist thus there is an urgent requirement to utilize cultural practices such as optimization of irrigation schedules to improve rust disease management in the organic farming systems previous studies have shown that frequent irrigation increases the foliar rust intensity on some plants such as wheat triticum aestivum soybean glycine max and willow melampsora epitea resulting from changes of topsoil water content rotem and palti 1969 toome et al 2010a attempts to provide protection against the onset of foliar rust diseases and to decrease severity through decreasing irrigation frequency or the amount of irrigation have had some success in controlling rust disease palti and shoham 1983 dixon 2015 for example black et al 2001 reported that rust puccinia arachidis intensity of peanut arachis hypogaea plants under the lowest amount of irrigation treatment was 60 to 70 less than that of the highest amount of irrigation in altay prefecture water saving trickle irrigation using groundwater is in widespread use in organic a venetum fields to afford water for plant growth if the optimization of irrigation schedules has been applied to control rust disease of plants caused by the genus melampsora including on a venetum published reports are lacking the irrigation of a venetum fields not only influences the soil water content but also affects indirectly the density of a venetum plants the total coverage and also the diversity of weeds ping et al 2014 all of which may affect rust disease occurrence wennstrom and ericson 1991 had found that the change of vegetation coverage by grazing significantly reduced rust puccinia pulsatillae on pulsatilla pratensis another experiment by mitchell et al 2002 found that increased density of individual host species increased plant infection and disease severity in addition decreased plant species diversity increased pathogen load and the loading of the pathogens was almost three times greater in the average monoculture than in the average plot planted with 24 grassland plant species eleven individual diseases increased in severity percentage of leaf area infected by a single disease at low plant species diversity mitchell et al 2002 the density of a venetum plants and vegetation conditions may be modified by irrigation frequency adjustment and thus it is necessary to explore the relationship between these factors and the rust disease development the information gained would help explain how this agricultural practice affects rust development with cultivated a venetum plants in organic farming systems in this study a two year monitoring of the rust was implemented to characterize the temporal development of rust disease under five irrigation frequencies in addition the association of rust intensity with the soil water content the density of the a venetum crop and vegetation conditions were determined we hypothesized that the rust disease intensity will decrease with extending of irrigation interval as the irrigation adjustment will reduce the leaf yield the economic viability of a venetum crops was assessed including the net profit of a venetum leaf production and economic values of applied irrigation water the aim was to determine an optimal irrigation frequency through achieving a favorable balance between the reduction of rust and the economic viability of a venetum crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site was located in an organically cultivated field of a venetum 47 43 n 87 32 e at an altitude of 482 516 m area 866 ha in the alakak township of the altay prefecture china this region of china experiences a northern temperate zone monsoon climate with an annual rainfall of 126 7 mm and an annual average temperature of 4 5 c over the past 50 years the cultivated a venetum field was established in the early spring of 2011 the seedlings were grown from seeds that were collected from wild a venetum plants neighboring the cultivated field the plants were spaced at 1 m within rows and 3 m between rows as the site was initially too dry for the establishment of a venetum plants were irrigated every 2 or 3 days in 2011 by a trickle irrigation system the cultivated field was uniformly divided to provide blocks each within easy access to a water pump there were ten rows in each block and twenty of the multi stemmed plants in each row each block was separated by a 5 m wide pathway and could be irrigated independently through control valves the inner inlay drip irrigation piping tianye co ltd xinjiang china was laid on the surface of soil along rows and there was one drip emitter at the center of each a venetum plant the spacing of neighboring dripper emitters was 1 m and the discharge rate was 4 lh 1 2 2 soil properties the soil type was a sandy loam soil ph 7 91 organic matter 1 03 available k 212 1 ppm and available p 6 3 ppm to determine the hydraulic properties of the soil undisturbed soil was extracted by a drilling machine down to 80 cm the soil was used to fill a pvc pot diameter 15 cm height 80 cm watered to saturation and covered with a black plastic film to prevent evaporation after water ceased to flow from the pot it was weighed and dried in an oven at 70 c for 7 days the pot was then weighed to determine the mass of water and of the soil the upper limit of the soil water content θul was determined according to the gravimetric method using the following formula θul ww ws 100 where ww the mass of water and ws the total mass of soil the θul value calculated for this soil was 13 7 the available water in the soil was also assessed by measuring the lower limit of the soil water content θll to calculate this variable a venetum seedlings were sown in the pot that contained a core of undisturbed soil after the plants had been growing for one year no water was further added to the pot after all the leaves of plants had wilted from lack of water the soil water content was immediately determined using the above formula the θll value calculated for this soil was 3 0 2 3 plant roots distribution characteristics by using a soil drilling method the root distribution of a venetum in this study site was determined there was a small quantity of horizontal rhizomes and root hairs in the soil of the 0 20 cm depth topsoil in the soil of 20 1 40 cm in depth a large quantity of lateral roots and root hairs grew from taproots thus it was the main distributing root zone in the lowest soil that was from 40 cm to the end of taproots 80 cm there were less lateral roots and root hairs 2 4 experimental design the experiments were conducted in 1 june to 31 august of 2012 and 2013 in a flat area in the cultivated a venetum field altitude of 495 m area approximately 60 ha with uniform soil properties before the experiment the irrigation frequency in this commercial field was an interval of every three days this interval of three days served as the control treatment denoted as t1 four irrigation frequencies extending the spacing of the irrigation were applied in the study interval of five t2 treatment seven t3 treatment nine t4 treatment and eleven t5 treatment days the time of irrigation was between 10 00 am and 5 00 pm there were four replications of each treatment arranged in a randomized complete block with a total of 20 plots 2 5 measurement 2 5 1 disease evaluation each year the disease was evaluated every 7 10 days from june to august ten a venetum shrubs of a roughly similar size and height were marked in each plot and five stems of each shrub including one at the center were marked for a rust survey three leaves taken at each of three sampling heights 10 cm 11 50 cm and 50 cm above the ground of each marked stem were used to assess the disease severity of rust 450 leaves from each plot were sampled non destructively for each evaluation rust severity was recorded as one of six discrete levels by visually estimating the percentage of observed leaves that were covered by uredinia 0 for no signs of infection 1 for 0 1 to 5 of leaf area covered with pustules 2 for 5 1 to 20 3 for 20 1 to 75 4 for 75 1 to 90 and 5 for 90 1 to 100 the disease index di was calculated by the following formula and used to assess rust disease intensity 1 d i 5 l n 100 σ i 0 i l n where i is the disease severity scale i 0 1 2 3 4 5 and ln and ln are the total number of leaves and the number of leaves of each disease severity respectively zhang et al 2007 for each plot the mean disease index of those three heights was used to analyze the temporal disease progression at the end of the experiment another disease intensity index the area under the disease progress curve audpc was calculated according to the equation 2 a u d p c σ i 1 n y i y i 1 2 t i 1 t i where yi is the disease index at the ith observation n is the number of observations and ti is the time in days of the ith observation shaner and finney 1977 2 5 2 temperature and precipitation recording daily average air temperatures and precipitation levels were recorded from june to august of 2012 and 2013 at an automatic meteorological observation station em50 decagon devices inc pullman wa us located at the cultivated fields temperature data were summarized as monthly averages in degrees celsius and precipitation data were summarized as monthly totals in millimeters 2 5 3 soil water content measurement soil water content was measured from 1 to 19 june 17 27 july and 14 25 august in 2012 and 2013 the rainfall was low or absent during this time three shrubs of each plot were randomly selected and harvested at ground level before and after irrigation the soil beneath each plant was sampled at 10 cm intervals from the soil surface to a depth of 80 cm using a 3 cm diameter soil auger at the central and front positions of the wetted soil zone within each shrub the soil samples were sealed in an aluminum box immediately after they were collected in the field the fresh weights were measured in the laboratory and then the samples were oven dried dgg 9036a oven shanghai linping instrument co ltd china at 105 c for 48 h to determine the dry weight the soil water content of each sampling depth was presented as a percentage of the dried soil weight for each sampling point based on the distribution characteristics of a venetum roots the water content of topsoil 0 20 cm depth main distributing root zone 20 1 40 cm depth and lowest soil 40 1 80 cm depth was presented as average values of soil water content in corresponding depths at the central and front positions of the wetted soil zone 2 5 4 the density of a venetum and vegetation parameters collection during the same period of soil water content measurement stem numbers of a venetum in each quadrat were counted and the total vegetation coverage and species diversity in each quadrat was measured using the point intercept method developed by goodall 1952 five 5 5 m quadrats were surveyed at the middle and around the margins 2 rows from the margins of each plot the total vegetation coverage was estimated by recording the number of the vertical survey pin contacts with leaves the coverage of each species was estimated by recording the number of species touched by each pin the coverage data were expressed as the percentage of ground covered by all species and each species we used a steel tape to measure the vertical height cm of plants in each quadrat the shannon wiener index of diversity h for the community of each plot was computed from the formula as 3 h p i lnp i where pi h i h c i c 2 h and c are the total height and total coverage of species in the quadrat population h i and c i are the mean values of height and cover degree belonging to the ith species yang et al 2011 2 5 5 leaf yield measurement in 20 august of 2012 and 2013 the time of harvest ten unmarked a venetum shrubs were selected symmetrically from the two diagonals of each plot and from each of which three stems were randomly removed at ground level the leaves of these thirty stems per plot were placed into paper kraft bags and taken to the laboratory where they were air dried in a forced air oven soiltest model l 72c evanston illinois at 65 c for 72 h following which the dried leaves were weighed at the end of the experiment the number of plants in each plot was counted and the leaf yield per unit area hectare was calculated 2 5 6 the economic viability of a venetum crops assessment the a venetum leaves with rust symptoms are still acceptable for the production of some extracts the economic viability of a venetum crops assessment included the net profit of leaves produced and the economic value of the applied irrigation water the producers of a venetum grown commercially in the region provided these data related to the costs of irrigation including the cost of water the cost of electricity for using the water pumps and the cost of labour in the five treatments during the experiment they provided the data of profit of dry leaves per kilogram not excluding the costs of irrigation these data were used to calculate the net profit of dry leaves per hectare in the five treatments through irrigation costs deducted from the profit of dry leaves in this study the economic value of applied irrigation water eviw was defined as the net profit of dry leaf production np against the total amount of applied irrigation water taiw m3 per hectare for each irrigation interval treatment the value of eeiw was calculated according to the equation 4 ev iw np i ta iw i where np i and taiw i is the net profit of dry leaf production and the total amount of applied irrigation water per unit area at the ith irrigation interval treatment 2 6 data statistical analysis for each irrigation interval

gradually over time fig 1 the irrigation frequency and study year significantly p 0 001 affected the area under the disease progress curves audpc table 1 in 2013 rust occurred more severely than in 2012 and rust onset and maximum were 18 and 50 days earlier than in 2012 rust was observed at the same date in plants of the different irrigation treatments but the disease index di and audpc decreased with extension of irrigation frequencies fig 1 table 2 in 2012 and 2013 the maximum disease index dimax and audpc of the t1 interval of three days control in this study and t2 interval of

treatment and measure time month and year significantly affected the mean soil water content of the topsoil and the main distributing regions of roots table 1 for the t1 treatment the topsoil water content after irrigation in 2012 and 2013 was between 82 to 97 of the upper limit of soil water content and the values always remained between 69 to 88 before the next irrigation fig 2 the t2 treatment also had high topsoil water content after irrigation 70 8 to 88 3 of the upper limit of soil water content but the values before the next irrigation were lower than that of the t1 treatment

between 3 to 36 of the upper limit of the soil water content fig 2 this low water content was most pronounced in 2012 fig 2 with the topsoil being nearly dry before irrigating in 2012 whether before or after irrigation the soil water content of the main distributing regions of roots and lowest soil under the t1 and t2 treatments was higher than of the lower limit of the soil water content θll but lower than 75 of the upper limit of soil water content θds in most months in 2013 this value was higher than θds in most months fig 2 for the t3 t4 and t5 treatments the soil water content of the main distributing regions of roots and lowest soil was lower than θds in 2012 and these values before irrigation were lower than the θll except for the t3 treatment fig 2 a few plants became defoliated under the t4 and t5 treatments fig 3 d and e in 2013 the soil water content of the main distributing regions of roots and lowest soil under these three treatments was lower than θds but always higher than the θll 3 4 density of a venetum the irrigation treatment significantly affected the density of a venetum table 1 the density of a venetum under t1 t2 and t3 treatments was from 29 to 35 stems

per square meter table 4 3 5 vegetation characteristics the irrigation treatment significantly affected the total vegetation coverage and the combination of irrigation treatment and year also had a significant effect on this variable table 1 there were no significant p 0 05 differences among the five irrigation treatments in june and july of 2012 but that of the t5 treatment was significantly p

respectively positive correlation between audpc and the mean soil water content of 0 to 20 cm and 20 1 40 cm depth and the mean density of a venetum table 5 for the mean total vegetation coverage a significant p 0 05 positive correlation r 0 941 to audpc was only found in 2013 there was a negative correlation in 2012 and 2013 between audpc and the mean values of diversity indices but the correlation was not significant p 0 05 table 5 3 7 leaf yield the individual and the combination of irrigation treatment and year significantly affected the dry leaf weight of single stems and dry leaf yield table 1 in 2012 the leaf dry weights of single stems of the t1 t2 and t3 treatments were the highest and there was no significant p 0 05 difference between them however the values in the t4

years respectively table 7 4 discussion for the genus melampsora urediniospore germination and infection of host plants requires the presence of free water such as rainwater on the surfaces of leaves guo et al 2010 vialle et al 2011 li et al 2013 and previous studies have confirmed that the precipitation is a key factor on the rust disease development luo et al 1983 lawrence et al 2007 our results are in agreement as the disease index rapidly increased in the rainy period and the rust disease was more serious in the higher precipitation year based on climatic data for this site it could be argued that precipitation had a major role in determining the rust intensity there was less rain in 2012 throughout the period of disease development and the maximum values of disease index dimax and the differences in the area under the disease progress curves audpc between plants receiving the current and decreasing irrigation frequencies were visibly greater than those in 2013 with higher precipitation these data indicate that water availability is a major factor influencing the rust development topsoil water is a major source of water vapor through evaporation and thus has a direct effect on the microclimatic conditions in agriculture systems palti and shoham 1983 studies of rust disease on soybean glycine max and blackberry rubus laciniatus have found that the air humidity and temperature were decreased with decreased topsoil water content johnson and mahaffee 2010 sikora et al 2014 this microclimatic condition led to shortened periods of leaf wetness resulting in rust disease reduction rowlandson et al 2015 in another study despite trickle irrigation being applied to plants the disease intensity audpc of coffee rust was not decreased with the amount of irrigation and this can be attributed to the topsoil being kept dry due to the drip emitter being buried into the soil within the root zone paiva et al 2011 in this current study the topsoil below a venetum shrubs was always wet after irrigation and the topsoil water content was decreased with reducing irrigation frequency this implied that microclimatic changes resulting from decreasing irrigation frequency were less conducive to rust disease development our study has confirmed the speculation that the topsoil water content had a significant positive correlation with the audpc the soil water content of the main distributing region of a venetum roots also had a decreasing trend with irrigation frequency and the values were always lower than 75 of the upper limit of soil water content when the time between water applications was equal or greater than seven days some studies have confirmed that a venetum plants suffer from drought stress under this soil water condition and the degree of drought stress increases with reducing soil water content wang et al 2012 wang et al 2014 according to a new study in greenhouse conditions drought stress can enhance resistance of a venetum plants to the rust disease resulting from the closure of stomata of leaves high h2o2 content as well as the enhanced activity of pod ppo and pal in leaves as a consequence the disease index was decreased with increasing degree of drought stress gao et al 2018 this is in agreement with our field study results accordingly a reduction in irrigation frequency leads to a venetum plants being exposed to different degrees of drought stress resulting in enhanced resistance of a venetum plants to the rust disease and so may also be a factor that resulted in rust reduction apart from the soil water content the density of a venetum also decreased with reducing irrigation frequency resulting in a decreasing m apocyni urediniospore load and as a consequence there was a significant positive relationship between the density of a venetum and the audpc however research that examined the relationship between plant density and rust intensity in wheat cultivar mixtures and a natural population of jewelweed impatiens capensis did not find that the rust intensity differed when artificial density gradients were maintained chester 1946 lively et al 1995 in contrast some controlled density studies in mono cropping systems such as wheat triticum aestivum creeping bentgrass agrostis stolonifera and willow salix spp found that rust intensity increased with density and indicated that microclimatic conditions in the plant canopy were more conducive to rust infection for example a high plant density reduced air movement and increased leaf shading leading to an increase in the duration of leaf wetness pfleeger and mundt 1998 williams et al 1998 toome et al 2010b clearly in a mixture of a specific number of plants the change of host density does not affect the total coverage of plant communities but the total coverage of a single plant system became lower with decreasing plant density resulting in more adverse microclimatic conditions for rust infection this more accurately explains a universal positive correlation between the rust intensity and the density of a venetum and the total vegetation coverage because reduced irrigation frequency not only resulted in fewer a venetum plants but in fewer weeds and probably produced microclimatic changes less conducive to the rust disease development in agricultural systems weeds near to host plants may be potential alternate hosts of rust pathogens in addition to increasing closure of the canopy and which implies that there is a high risk of rust disease van bruggen and finckh 2016 in contrast a high presence of weeds non susceptible to rust will dilute the availability of susceptible plants resulting in a decreasing pathogen load and as a consequence increasing species diversity in a plant community can reduce disease mitchell et al 2002 a previous study had not found any alternate hosts of m apocyni amongst the weeds in the organic a venetum field gao et al 2017 in this study the species diversity between different irrigation frequency treatments was generally without significant differences and the correlation between the disease intensity and the species diversity was not statistically significant therefore weeds grown in the organic a venetum field did not have a negative effect on rust disease in contrast the weeds increased the total coverage of vegetation and the increase was most extensive under the most frequent irrigation and precipitation condition for example in the high precipitation year 2013 the total coverage of vegetation under the t1 treatment was the highest and was more than 70 in july and august this kind of vegetation condition whether for the grass and shrub lands or some arbor forests has been confirmed to be very favorable for rust development toome et al 2010b liu et al 2016 therefore decreasing irrigation frequency will help suppress weeds especially in the years of high precipitation and improve rust disease management in the organic farming system a venetum is a perennial plant and its yield of leaves will increase with plant age further an adequate water supply will enhance plant growth and should result in a higher leaf yield gao et al 2015 however this study found the opposite result that the yield of leaves under all irrigation treatments in 2013 the year with high precipitation was lower than that of 2012 this phenomenon has a high consistency with the disease intensity host plants have a series of complicated physiological and biochemical responses to the rust disease caused by the genus melampsora for example a build up of reactive oxygen species produced continuously in cellular compartments such as chloroplasts and mitochondria a decrease in photosynthetic pigment content and inhibited photosynthetic electron transport in photosystem ii resulted in a decreased net photosynthetic rate of plants zhang et al 2010 elena et al 2014 in general photosynthetic assimilation product loss increases with disease severity dawson and mccracken 1994 in addition defoliation caused by the genus melampsora infection commonly occurs in host plants such as willow salix spp and poplar populus spp after the disease intensity rapidly reaches or is near to the maximum value leading to a large loss of leaf kenaley et al 2014 elena et al 2014 in 2013 rust disease was more serious than that of 2012 and thus caused a greater loss of a venetum leaf in particular most plants appeared to be defoliated under the t1 and t2 treatments fig 3a b and this resulted in the leaf yield dramatically decreasing accordingly a sole focus on increasing yield of crops through increasing irrigation frequency is inappropriate given that this will lead to more serious rust that causes yield loss for organic a venetum crops especially in high rust outbreak years a venetum plants suffered from drought stress when the time between water applications was more than seven days t3 t4 and t5 and the longer the irrigation intervals the more severely the plant suffered from drought stress wang et al 2012 found that a venetum plants respond to drought stress by reducing leaf transpiration to prevent excessive water deficits through the closing of stomata but co2 diffusion is also restrained resulting in the photosynthetic capacity of plants being decreased there was also a significant decrease of the net photosynthetic rate with an increase in the duration and degree of stress in this study the yields of plant leaves under the t3 t4 and t5 treatments were 51 to 71 less than that of the t1 treatment even under a relative low disease intensity in the year of 2012 severe water shortage could significantly reduce rust disease on a venetum but the huge leaf yield losses would be unacceptable for growers especially in dry years to gain the highest profit is an ultimate objective for growers of crops including for growers of a venetum in this study the net profit of a venetum leaf production was highest in 2012 and 2013 with the t1 and or t2 treatments however the altay prefecture is located in the semi arid and arid regions of china and thus the amount of groundwater used for irrigation must be carefully considered in the commercial production of crops due to it being a non renewable resource ping et al 2014 in other words the highest economic value per unit of water consumption based on ecological economic and social responsibility is a crucial assessment index to ensure sustainable development of the organic crop industry in the semi arid and arid regions li et al 2008 in the five irrigation frequencies offsetting the impact of the reduction of rust disease was the economic value of the irrigation interval of seven days that was the highest value in 2012 and 2013 and was twice that of the t1 treatment with the total amount of water applied being 54 8 less than that of the t1 treatment table 7 the net profit of a venetum leaves of this treatment was only 15 to 18 lower than that of the t1 treatment this reduction of profit is acceptable for producers of a venetum therefore the irrigation interval of seven days is the optimal irrigation schedule for the cultivation of a venetum in the altay prefecture in order to facilitate acceptance of this irrigation schedule to a wider region the irrigation frequency should be reduced as far as possible while maintaining the soil water content of the main distributing region of roots between 50 and 60 of the upper limit of soil water content 5 conclusions this study confirms the hypothesis that extending the irrigation frequency can reduce the rust intensity through changes in soil water content host density and the total vegetation coverage more importantly achieving an optimal irrigation schedule for the cultivated a venetum in the altay prefecture can reduce water resource consumption and raise the economic value obtained from the applied water we believe this cultural practice is an effective means of achieving profitable yields with organic production of a venetum in arid and semi arid regions conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest

11434,drip irrigation under film mulching is applied widely in maize field in northeastern china according to the water saving and grain increasing action implemented by chinese government in recent years the influence of mulching on water consumption and grain yield still needs systematic investigation for a better evaluation of such managements in this study a field experiment was conducted for three consecutive years in northeastern china net radiation above canopy r n soil evaporation e s and crop transpiration t r crop growth and yield were measured in film mulching m and non mulching nm maize fields with drip irrigation the results showed that the total evapotranspiration et of the m treatment was between 413 4 471 3 mm which was 2 8 5 2 lower than those of the nm treatment 430 0 497 4 mm for the three years film mulching reduced the r n of the maize field which is an important reason for the lower et of the m treatment the total e s of the m treatment was 45 2 lower yet the total t r of the m treatment was 8 9 higher than that of the nm treatment the ratio of e s to et was 12 5 14 5 of the m treatment while the ratio of the nm treatment was as high as 21 7 25 2 the measured basal crop coefficient during the mid growth period k cb mid mea of the m treatment 0 96 1 17 was 3 6 9 9 higher than those of the nm treatment 0 89 1 13 for the 3 years however the mean evaporation coefficient k e of the entire growth period of the m treatment 0 09 0 10 was significantly lower than those of the nm treatment 0 18 0 19 consequently the mean crop coefficient k c of the m treatment was 3 2 5 5 lower than those of the nm treatment for the 3 years the maturity stage was accelerated by 4 5 days in the field with the m treatment the yield increased by 5 9 8 8 and the water use efficiency wue increased by 10 7 13 1 in the field with the m treatment for the 3 years such results are helpful to explicit the influence of mulching on water consumption and give important reference to develop precise irrigation scheduling in maize field in this area keywords film mulching water consumption soil evaporation sap flow crop coefficient water use efficiency 1 introduction in recent years water shortages and extreme arid climates have become increasingly severe and frequent globally however the development of efficient water saving agricultural methods is an effective means to solve the contradiction between water supply and demand under a wide range of conditions xu et al 2010 from 2012 2015 the chinese government implemented the water saving and grain increasing action in four provinces in northeast china to encourage efficient water saving irrigation the micro irrigation area of 1 35 million hm2 mainly consisting of maize with drip irrigation under film mulching accounts for nearly 54 of the total water saving irrigation area wang et al 2015a the combination of film mulching and drip irrigation can effectively solve the problems of insufficient accumulated temperature during the early growth period while making fertilization easy zhao et al 2015 film mulching can increase soil temperature and improve soil moisture liu et al 2015 reduce soil evaporation li et al 2013 promote crop growth and increase yield and water use efficiency mbah et al 2009 yaghi et al 2013 therefore it has been applied worldwide many studies have investigated the effects of drip irrigation with film mulching but most of these have been conducted in arid or semi arid areas wang et al 2015b eldoma et al 2016 and have studied economic crops such as cotton fruit trees and vegetables wang et al 2006 wei et al 2015 in the northeastern semi humid area in china drip irrigation under film mulching has been applied to plant maize the main grain crop in this area according to the water saving and grain increasing action plan however the effects of this method on water consumption and grain yield of maize have not been subjected to systematic investigation film mulching influences the soil micro meteorological and boundary conditions above which soil water evaporates reduces net radiation of the canopy above which plant water transpires increases soil heat flux and changes the energy distribution resulting in changes in field water consumption feng et al 2017 changes in surface reflectance in response to film mulching can change the canopy radiation transmission and energy distribution prieto et al 2012 the midday latent heat flux of fields subjected to film mulching is lower than that of conventional irrigated farmland and the sensible heat flux is higher resulting in an increased temperature of the ambient atmosphere tarara 2000 such increases in temperature often lead to increased vapor pressure deficits and the soil moisture of film mulching fields is often high both of which benefit transpiration although film mulching reduced soil evaporation the effects on total evapotranspiration et in the field are not certain fan et al 2017 accordingly it is important to determine et and its components to understand the influence of mulching on field water consumption and develop precise irrigation scheduling to improve water use efficiency in such areas many studies have shown that film mulching changes the soil water content in the field creating good water fertilizer gas and heat conditions which are beneficial to crop growth and development thus it can increase crop yield and improve water use efficiency luo et al 2015 ji et al 2015 however film mulching does not always cause yield increases indeed its effects depend on soil hydrothermal conditions and the crop s own physiological characteristics in the case of cucumber and other plants which are tolerant to higher temperature the effects of film mulching are significant yaghi et al 2013 however for crops sensitive to high temperature film mulching may inhibit crop growth wang et al 2011 showed that film mulching can significantly reduce soil evaporation in the early growth stages of potato and maintain a high soil water content but that late stage mulching will cause the soil temperature to be too high resulting in decreased yield accordingly more studies are needed to determine if increased soil temperature in the late growth stage caused by film mulching will also cause the maize yield to decrease in northeastern areas of china in this study a field experiment was conducted for three consecutive years in northeastern china during the study period net radiation above canopy soil evaporation and crop transpiration crop growth and yield were measured in film mulching m and non mulching nm maize fields with drip irrigation the main objectives were to 1 quantify differences between the total amount of evapotranspiration and its components in the two treatments and 2 quantify the effects of mulching on plant growth yield and water use efficiency wue 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted at the heilongjiang

the wilcox method wilcox 1965 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted for three consecutive years 2014 2016 the field was surface drip irrigated and treated with mulching m and non mulching nm by plastic transparent film three replicates of both treatments were set with each area being 5 2 m 20 m the planted crop was spring maize zea mays l and the variety was dongfu no 1 crops were sown at the end of april and harvested at the end of september each year the growing stages were recorded according to the leaf collar method after abendroth et al 2011 the growing stages are divided into vegetative v and reproductive r stages vegetative stages are designated with a v followed by the total number of collared leaves present for example a plant with three visible leaf collars is v3 growth stage reproductive stages are designated with an r followed by the numbers 1 6 each specific v or r stage is defined only when 50 percent or more of the plants in the field are in or beyond that stage table 1 of abendroth et al 2011 s publication listed all the v and r stages and corresponding common names according to that table ve v6 vt r1 r3 and r6 are the starts of seedling jointing tasseling silking milk and physiological maturity respectively before sowing the experimental field was rototilled at a depth of 0 25 0 3 m a ridge with a width of 1 m and a height of 0 15 m forming a ditch 0 3 m wide was then built fig 1 two lines of maize were sown on the ridge with row spacing of 0 4 m and plant spacing of 0 25 0 3 m drip lines were laid in the middle of the ridge immediately after sowing and the film were laid at the same time covering above the ridge the discharge rate of the drip emitter was 1 38 l h 1 at the work pressure of 0 1 mpa and the spacing was 0 3 m the film was polyethylene transparent film with a thickness of 0 01 mm the film was used for both the m and nm treatment after sowing to ensure the emergence of seeds for the nm treatment the film was removed in about one week after emergence while the film was kept for treatment m dates of sowing emergence and film removal for the 3 years are listed in table 1 field management irrigation and fertilization scheduling were the same for the m and nm treatments the irrigation scheduling was determined by the upper and lower limits of soil water content in the nm treatments and the irrigation

times as topdressing during stage v6 the vegetative stage tassel stage vt and the reproductive stage three r3 with the proportion of 60 20 and 20 the topdressing was applied with irrigation by venturi fertilizers thus irrigation with amounts of 10 to15 mm was applied during fertilization to flush the drip lines and ensure all the fertilizer solution went into the field the irrigation and fertilization dates and total irrigation amounts for the 3 years are listed in table 1 2 3 soil evaporation measurements soil evaporation e s was measured using micro lysimeters made from pvc tubes and combined with an inner and outer barrel the inner barrel which had an inner diameter of 10 28 cm and a height of 15 cm was first pushed into the ground to drill the undisturbed soil the outer barrel which had a slightly larger diameter and the same height as the inner barrel was then fixed in the ground to ensure the inner barrel could be removed easily micro lysimeters were placed in three positions underneath the drip line 25 cm apart from the drip line and in the ridge for each plot fig 1 with three replicates for each position the micro lysimeters were reinstalled every 5 days as well as after each irrigation and rainfall event of more than 5 mm so that volumetric water content would be representative of the soil water content in the treatment plot as peer researchers recommended balwinder singh et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 weighing was conducted daily using an electric balance with a precision of 0 1 g we removed the micro lysimeters from the edge of the film mulch put back in the outer barrel after weighing and covered the film back again carefully to ensure that no damage occurred to the soil surface nor the mulch covered the mini lysimeters soil evaporation was taken as the difference between the two weighing results after which the units were converted to mm d 1 according to the barrel cross sectional area the field e s was obtained by the area weighted average of the soil evaporation at three positions 2 4 sap flow measurements and scaling flow32 1 k dynamax co houston tx usa based on the heat balance method was used in sap flow measurements two plants from each plot and two plots from each treatment were selected to install the sap flow sensors the diameters of maize stems changed greatly because of rapid plant growth during the vegetation stages however one sap flow gauge can only measure plants with a certain diameter range thus sap flow was measured for four plants from the vt stage in both the m and nm treatments sensors were installed at more than 20 cm above the ground surface details regarding the theory and installation are available in the dynamax flow32 1 k manual gauge outputs were measured every 60 s and recorded as 30 min means using a cr1000 data logger we took the average of two values in an hour as the hourly sap flow q g h 1 sap flux density j s g cm 2 h 1 was calculated based on q divided by the cross sectional area of the wrapped stem a si cm2 the cross sectional area of the stem was determined by the stem diameter measured by the vernier caliper to scale up single plant water use to transpiration of the field 20 plants were selected and their stem diameters were measured for each plot the stem cross sectional area was calculated as the average of the plot a sa ignoring the water capacity of the maize plant the field transpiration t r sf mm h 1 can be calculated by eq 2 bethenod et al 2000 2 t r sf 10 j s a s a a b where a and b are the row and plant spacing cm respectively and 10 is the unit conversion factor the cumulative value of t r sf for 24 h in a day is the daily transpiration mm d 1 2 5 dual crop coefficient method to determine et in this study the amount of transpiration was only measured in the mid and late season because of limitations measuring the diameter with the sap flow sensors we calculated the transpiration of the whole growth period using the dual crop coefficient method from the fao 56 manual with the adjusted mid and late season basal crop coefficient based on the measured transpiration the specific method is described in detail below the fao 56 dual crop coefficient method was used to estimate transpiration eq 3 allen et al 1998 3 t r k s k cb e t 0 where t r is the actual transpiration k s is the water stress reduction coefficient with a range of 0 1 which can be taken as 1 in this paper for sufficient irrigation supplied in fields and k cb is the basal crop coefficient et 0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 which is calculated by the fao penman monteith equation 4 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 vpd u 2 δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is net radiation at the reference height mj m 2 d 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 δ is the slope of the vapor pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 vpd is the vapor pressure deficit kpa which is calculated from the temperature and relative humidity rh of the day t is the daily air temperature at 2 m k which is obtained from the average of the highest and lowest air temperatures of the day and u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m m s 1 to obtain the value of k cb the plant growing period was first divided into four stages i e the initial stage the emergence stage ve to the vegetative stage three v3 crop development stage v3 to vt mid season

transpiration t r during the whole growth stage could be calculated by k cb mea and et 0 when combined with the e s measurements the et of the whole growth stage can be obtained and the crop coefficient k c is then calculated by eq 7 the ratio of e s to et 0 is the evaporation coefficient k e 7 k c e t e t 0 t r e s e t 0 2 6 net radiation measurements net radiation r n was measured by two net radiometers qtc 4 jinzhou sunshine technology co ltd liaoning china in the center of every representative plot of the m and nm treatments at a height of 50 cm above the canopy which was adjusted as the plant height increased the two radiometers were connected to a data logger pc 4 jinzhou sunshine technology co ltd liaoning china data were collected at 30 min intervals 2 7 measurements of other meteorological factors the meteorological data including solar radiation air temperature and humidity and wind speed were measured by a weather station located at the research station about 80 m from our experimental field a pyr type solar radiation sensor vp 4 air temperature and humidity sensors and ds 2 type wind speed sensor were connected to an em50 data logger all sensors and data loggers were obtained from decagon co pullman wa usa data were collected at 30 min intervals 2 8 plant growth and yield measurements plant height stem diameter and leaf area index lai were measured once per growth stage the plant height was measured using a meter with a precision of 1 cm stems were measured with a vernier caliper at 20 cm above the ground leaf length and width were measured using a meter after which the product was multiplied by a conversion coefficient of 0 74 to obtain the actual leaf area plant leaf area was summed from the area of all the leaves the lai was calculated by dividing the leaf area by the plant spacing three plants were selected randomly at the first measurement and tagged for the following measurements in each plot with nine replicates for each treatment for the height stem diameter and lai measurements for yield y estimation three subplots with an area of 3 m 1 3 m were selected for each plot from which all ears were collected dried and ground the grain weight and water content were determined to convert the yield at a water content of 18 water use efficiency wue kg m 3 was the ratio of y t hm 2 to et mm eq 8 8 wue 100 y e t where 100 is the unit conversion factor 2 9 statistical analysis the statistical differences between the two treatments for all data were tested with an anova using the spss 17 0 spss inc chicago il usa linear fit were applied to comparing the e s t r et and r n between m and nm treatments linear regression was used as well as to examine the relationship r n and et 3 results 3 1 soil evaporation and crop transpiration throughout the entire growth stage the e s of m was significantly lower than that of the nm treatment and all treatments showed a higher e s at the seedling stage and lower values at the maturity stage fig 2 e s of m in the growth stage of 2014 2016 varied between 0 06 1 40 0 05 1 54 and 0 12 1 99 mm d 1 respectively while e s of nm between 0 18 2 21 0 06 2 30 and 0 05 2 84 mm d 1 respectively total e s of the entire growth stage for m and nm treatments were 58 8 and 108 8 mm in 2014 60 0 and 107 6 mm in 2015 and 63 5 and 117 0 mm in 2016 respectively for the three year study period a significantly linear relationship was found between the e s of m and nm treatments with the e s of m being only about 52 4 of that of the nm treatment fig 3 the maximum transpiration of the m and nm treatments during the mid and later growth stages was 7 03 and 6 51 mm d 1 in 2014 6 57 and 6 11 mm d 1 in 2015 and 6 99 and 5 91 mm d 1 in 2016 respectively overall the t r of m was 1 088 times that of the nm treatment fig 4 specifically the film mulching could increase the t r by 8 8 during the mid and later growth stages for the 3 years the water consumption of the maize field was dominated by crop transpiration during the mid and later growth stages soil evaporation during the same stage was below 1 mm d 1 and 2 mm d 1 for the m and nm treatment respectively 3 2 evapotranspiration and crop coefficient the seasonal patterns of et of m and nm treatments were similar the et of m was lower than that of the nm treatment in the early ve to v6 stage and late growth stage r3 to r6 stage however during the mid growth period vt to r3 the differences in et between m and nm treatment were small and et of m was not always lower than that of nm fig 5 a c and e the average et for m and nm treatments throughout the growth stage were 3 06 and 3 23 mm d 1 in 2014 2 68 and 2 79 mm d 1 in 2015 and 2 94 and 3 02 mm d 1 in 2016 respectively the daily et for the two treatments showed linear correlations with r2 0 95 for the 3 years fig 5b d and f and the et values for the m treatment were 95 2 96 6 and 97 9 of the values for the nm treatment respectively for the 3 years evaluation of the accumulation values throughout the growth stage fig 6 a c and e revealed that the t r of m was 5 9 9 6 and 11 6 average 8 9 higher than that of the nm treatment in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively however plastic mulching decreased the e s by 45 2 50 1 mm averagely in this area over the three year study period and the total et of the m treatment was slightly lower than that of the nm treatment and the average over the 3 years was 4 0 lower among them et of m was 5 2 3 9 and 2 8 lower than that of the nm treatment in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the decrease in et treatment was mainly because of the decrease in the ratio of e s to et e s et and the corresponding increase in the ratio of t r to et t r et fig 6b d and f the ratio of e s et was 12 5 14 5 for the m treatment and was up to 21 7 25 2 for the nm treatment the ratio of t r et was 85 5 87 5 and 74 8 78 3 for the m and nm treatments for the 3 years the k c of m was significantly lower than that of the nm treatment in stages ve to v3 k c ini and after r3 k c end but the k c of m decreased somewhat or slightly increased in stages from vt to r3 k c mid when compared to that of treatment nm table 2 the mean k c values were 0 89 0 77 and 0 80 for the m treatments which were 5 4 5 5 and 3 2 lower than those of the nm treatments 0 94 0 81 and 0 83 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively however the middle season basal crop coefficient k cb mid mea of the m treatment was higher than that of the nm treatment by 7 1 for the three years there were no obvious seasonal patterns in the evaporation coefficient k e throughout the growth stages and the mean k e of m was between 0 09 and 0 10 which was significantly lower than that of the nm treatment 0 18 0 19 for the 3 years 3 3 available energy the net radiation above the canopy r n of m was lower than that of the nm treatment and there were significant linear relationships between the two treatments p 0 001 the r n values of m were 90 0 94 6 and 93 4 of those of the nm treatment in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 7 the mean r n of m decreased by 7 05 for the 3 years there were significant linear correlations between et and r n while there was no significant difference in the relationships between m and nm treatment fig 8 3 4 plant growth and yield plastic film accelerated plant growth development and senescence the v6 stage of m started 2 3 days earlier than nm while the vt stage started 5 7 days earlier and the r6 4 5 days earlier table 3 correspondingly the maximum lai of m was achieved earlier and the largest differences between treatment m and nm appeared at the beginning of stage vt fig 9 in addition because they were close to the time at which the film was uncovered the difference in lai between m and nm was little during the ve to v3 stages the results showed that maize growth y and wue were significantly p 0 1 affected by mulching with the exception of the difference in lai in 2014 not being significant p 0 11 the height diameter at a height of 20 cm biomass at the maturity stage the maximum lai y and wue of treatment m were significantly higher than those of treatment nm by 7 1 5 8 4 8 1 7 5 9 and 12 0 in 2014 5 4 8 8 6 9 2 2 8 8 and 13 1 in 2015 and 6 7 4 5 3 7 4 0 7 4 and 10 7 in 2016 respectively table 4 4 discussion 4 1 effect of mulching on et and its components evapotranspiration is very important to precise development of irrigation scheduling and is significantly influenced by weather conditions irrigation scheduling and field management practices such as surface mulching allen et al 1998 zhao et al 2010 the et totals 413 4 471 3 mm and daily mean et from sowing to harvest 2 69 3 06 mm d 1 of the m treatment for the 3 years in the study were comparable to the results of other studies with plastic mulching ding et al 2013 yet significantly lower than those of studies without mulching howell et al 1998 zhao et al 2010 and of the nm treatments in the same study plastic film mulching is a well established management strategy to reduce e s and et in the field wang et al 2011 doss et al 1970 found that total et of maize with complete plastic mulching was 25 4 29 2 lower for different years compared to that without mulching under furrow irrigation in the southeastern united states in another rain fed maize field zhou et al 2009 reported that partial mulching fraction of 0 7 and whole mulching with plastic film reduced total et by 11 1 and 16 6 respectively when compared to that without mulching fan et al 2017 found that total et of mulching treatment decreased by 13 8 in a maize field with full irrigation in arid regions based on the field experiment over three consecutive years we confirmed that both e s and et were reduced by plastic film mulching in a drip irrigated maize field under the semi humid climate in northeastern china figs 2 and 6 the accumulated e s of treatment m was reduced by 45 2 while the accumulated et of m was only slightly lower 2 8 5 2 than that of treatment nm the decrease of et in m treatment was lower than that reported in former studies but within the rage of a study with the same climate and irrigation method liu et al 2015 the difference in daily et between m and nm showed different patterns in different growth stages at the initial growth stage after uncovering the film the daily et was lower for treatment m than nm fig 5 because of the reduction of soil evaporation by the plastic film fig 2 from stage v3 to v12 the leaf area covers the ground gradually and e s decreased because the energy available to the ground surface decreased unger et al 2012 the differences in e s became much smaller between treatment m and nm after stage v12 moreover t r becomes an important component of et li et al 2013 in this study the t r of m was 1 088 times that of the nm treatment fig 4 leading to the higher et of the m treatment for several days fig 5 in stage vt in contrast the growth period was delayed for the nm treatment table 3 resulting in a higher et during the later growth stages fig 5 overall the cumulative et and k c were higher for treatment nm than m throughout the growth period table 2 one of the main reasons for the reduction in et by mulching was that the proportion of e s was reduced in our study the average ratio of e s to et of treatment m was from 12 5 14 5 which was much lower than ratios of 26 0 and 30 3 from non mulching maize fields reported by other researchers liu et al 2002 kang et al 2003 and in the present study 21 7 25 2 and comparable to studies of mulching fields 10 1 ding et al 2013 another reason the reduced et was that the available energy was reduced by film mulching in our study the plastic film made the available energy i e r n supplying the latent heat flux fig 7 decreased which reduced et the et variations were determined by r n with a linear slope of 0 33 0 41 being observed for the 3 years fig 8 these finding suggest that maize et was partly controlled by radiation energy or available energy which are similar to the reported results for the dense crop canopy fan et al 2017 liu et al 2017 4 2 effect of mulching on growth and yield the plastic mulch changed the albedo of the ground surface producing complex changes in the crop microclimate environment and accelerating crop development tarara 2000 many studies have indicated that plastic mulching not only reduced water loss from soil evaporation but also accelerated crop development in the early stages by increasing soil temperature and controlling weeds which would enhance crop yield zhou et al 2009 hou et al 2010 our results indicate that plastic mulch accelerated plant growth and advanced maize tasseling and maturity thereby improving biomass and yield fig 9 and table 2 one of the difference of influence of mulching on crop growth in this semi humid area from arid area where mulching is more widely used is that the temperature increase by film mulching is relatively important comparing to soil water improvement zhao et al 2015 film mulching in arid area is often for higher utilization of the limited rainfall wang et al 2016 however the rainfall in our study area is often abundant and with about 45 70 mm irrigation the soil water content can be kept above 75 filed capacity which would not limit crop growth allen et al 1998 study in the same area showed that compared with the nm treatment the topsoil accumulative temperatures of ridges were 245 c and 314 c higher at the m treatment in 2014 and 2015 respectively sui et al 2018 and they argued that the soil temperature increase may be one of the important reason for yield increase in northeastern china numerous studies have reported that plastic mulch can effectively improve the yield anikwe et al 2007 fan et al 2017 moreover some studies pointed out that the yield increase can be attributed to the improved root growth as well as increased water and nutrient absorption capacity under plastic mulching abou ei magd et al 2008 eldoma et al 2016 while other studies indicated that plastic film can effectively improve soil water storage and increase the fertility level of the soil surface layer li et al 2013 yield increase may also be attributed to higher water transpiration vial et al 2015 film mulching decreased e s and increased t r which is related to higher canopy stomatal conductance zhao et al 2011 when the stomatal conductance is high it is also beneficial to the co2 entry which increases the photosynthetic rate of the crop and improves yield lai is a very important eco physiological factor because it directly influences solar radiation interception air temperature and humidity penetration at every layer of the canopy and further affects leaf temperature water vapor and heat fluxes steduto and hsiao 1998 suyker and verma 2008 plastic film mulching increased the maximum lai and k cb mid mea but decreased the mean k c throughout the growing season fig 9 tables 2 and 4 suggesting that mulching has a positive effect on saving water in general plastic mulch improved yield and decreased water use both of which resulted in a higher wue for the m treatment 5 conclusions under the conditions of full water and n fertilizer application with drip irrigation the effects of film mulching on field evapotranspiration crop yield and water use efficiency were analyzed in a three year field experiment 1 film mulching reduced the total amount of evapotranspiration by about 4 0 and had a significant effect on the distribution between soil evaporation and crop transpiration for the three years the ratio of transpiration to total evapotranspiration of the m treatment increased and changed the water consumption distribution to processes beneficial to crop yield 2 film mulching reduced the mean crop coefficient of the whole growth period increased the basal crop coefficient during the mid growth period by 7 1 and reduced the evaporation coefficient from 0 18 0 19 to 0 09 0 10 for the three years 3 film mulching reduced the net radiation and energy available of the m treatment resulting in the lower evapotranspiration film mulching didn t affect the linear correlation between evapotranspiration and the net radiation 4 the maize growth stage was advanced in the field with the m treatment and the maturity stage was accelerated by 4 5 days the plant height stem diameter at 20 cm above ground biomass and the maximum leaf area index increased by 1 7 7 1 the yield increased by 5 9 8 8 and the water use efficiency increased by 10 7 13 1 for the three years acknowledgements we are grateful to the research grants from the national 12th five year plan scientific and technological project of china 2014bad12b05 and the iwhr innovative team project

11434,drip irrigation under film mulching is applied widely in maize field in northeastern china according to the water saving and grain increasing action implemented by chinese government in recent years the influence of mulching on water consumption and grain yield still needs systematic investigation for a better evaluation of such managements in this study a field experiment was conducted for three consecutive years in northeastern china net radiation above canopy r n soil evaporation e s and crop transpiration t r crop growth and yield were measured in film mulching m and non mulching nm maize fields with drip irrigation the results showed that the total evapotranspiration et of the m treatment was between 413 4 471 3 mm which was 2 8 5 2 lower than those of the nm treatment 430 0 497 4 mm for the three years film mulching reduced the r n of the maize field which is an important reason for the lower et of the m treatment the total e s of the m treatment was 45 2 lower yet the total t r of the m treatment was 8 9 higher than that of the nm treatment the ratio of e s to et was 12 5 14 5 of the m treatment while the ratio of the nm treatment was as high as 21 7 25 2 the measured basal crop coefficient during the mid growth period k cb mid mea of the m treatment 0 96 1 17 was 3 6 9 9 higher than those of the nm treatment 0 89 1 13 for the 3 years however the mean evaporation coefficient k e of the entire growth period of the m treatment 0 09 0 10 was significantly lower than those of the nm treatment 0 18 0 19 consequently the mean crop coefficient k c of the m treatment was 3 2 5 5 lower than those of the nm treatment for the 3 years the maturity stage was accelerated by 4 5 days in the field with the m treatment the yield increased by 5 9 8 8 and the water use efficiency wue increased by 10 7 13 1 in the field with the m treatment for the 3 years such results are helpful to explicit the influence of mulching on water consumption and give important reference to develop precise irrigation scheduling in maize field in this area keywords film mulching water consumption soil evaporation sap flow crop coefficient water use efficiency 1 introduction in recent years water shortages and extreme arid climates have become increasingly severe and frequent globally however the development of efficient water saving agricultural methods is an effective means to solve the contradiction between water supply and demand under a wide range of conditions xu et al 2010 from 2012 2015 the chinese government implemented the water saving and grain increasing action in four provinces in northeast china to encourage efficient water saving irrigation the micro irrigation area of 1 35 million hm2 mainly consisting of maize with drip irrigation under film mulching accounts for nearly 54 of the total water saving irrigation area wang et al 2015a the combination of film mulching and drip irrigation can effectively solve the problems of insufficient accumulated temperature during the early growth period while making fertilization easy zhao et al 2015 film mulching can increase soil temperature and improve soil moisture liu et al 2015 reduce soil evaporation li et al 2013 promote crop growth and increase yield and water use efficiency mbah et al 2009 yaghi et al 2013 therefore it has been applied worldwide many studies have investigated the effects of drip irrigation with film mulching but most of these have been conducted in arid or semi arid areas wang et al 2015b eldoma et al 2016 and have studied economic crops such as cotton fruit trees and vegetables wang et al 2006 wei et al 2015 in the northeastern semi humid area in china drip irrigation under film mulching has been applied to plant maize the main grain crop in this area according to the water saving and grain increasing action plan however the effects of this method on water consumption and grain yield of maize have not been subjected to systematic investigation film mulching influences the soil micro meteorological and boundary conditions above which soil water evaporates reduces net radiation of the canopy above which plant water transpires increases soil heat flux and changes the energy distribution resulting in changes in field water consumption feng et al 2017 changes in surface reflectance in response to film mulching can change the canopy radiation transmission and energy distribution prieto et al 2012 the midday latent heat flux of fields subjected to film mulching is lower than that of conventional irrigated farmland and the sensible heat flux is higher resulting in an increased temperature of the ambient atmosphere tarara 2000 such increases in temperature often lead to increased vapor pressure deficits and the soil moisture of film mulching fields is often high both of which benefit transpiration although film mulching reduced soil evaporation the effects on total evapotranspiration et in the field are not certain fan et al 2017 accordingly it is important to determine et and its components to understand the influence of mulching on field water consumption and develop precise irrigation scheduling to improve water use efficiency in such areas many studies have shown that film mulching changes the soil water content in the field creating good water fertilizer gas and heat conditions which are beneficial to crop growth and development thus it can increase crop yield and improve water use efficiency luo et al 2015 ji et al 2015 however film mulching does not always cause yield increases indeed its effects depend on soil hydrothermal conditions and the crop s own physiological characteristics in the case of cucumber and other plants which are tolerant to higher temperature the effects of film mulching are significant yaghi et al 2013 however for crops sensitive to high temperature film mulching may inhibit crop growth wang et al 2011 showed that film mulching can significantly reduce soil evaporation in the early growth stages of potato and maintain a high soil water content but that late stage mulching will cause the soil temperature to be too high resulting in decreased yield accordingly more studies are needed to determine if increased soil temperature in the late growth stage caused by film mulching will also cause the maize yield to decrease in northeastern areas of china in this study a field experiment was conducted for three consecutive years in northeastern china during the study period net radiation above canopy soil evaporation and crop transpiration crop growth and yield were measured in film mulching m and non mulching nm maize fields with drip irrigation the main objectives were to 1 quantify differences between the total amount of evapotranspiration and its components in the two treatments and 2 quantify the effects of mulching on plant growth yield and water use efficiency wue 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted at the heilongjiang provincial water science and technology experimental research center located in the daoli district of harbin 125 45 e 45 22 n at an elevation of 220 m the annual precipitation ranges between 400 and 650 mm 80 of which occurs in may september maize growth period according to the international classification criteria of soil texture the 0 100 cm soil layer is silty loam with organic matter and ph values of 25 94 g kg 1 and 8 69 respectively the bulk density saturated soil water content and field capacity of the 0 100 cm soil layer were 1 48 g cm 3 0 466 and 0 350 cm3 cm 3 respectively based on the wilcox method wilcox 1965 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted for three consecutive years 2014 2016 the field was surface drip irrigated and treated with mulching m and non mulching nm by plastic transparent film three replicates of both treatments were set with each area being 5 2 m 20 m the planted crop was spring maize zea mays l and the variety was dongfu no 1 crops were sown at the end of april and harvested at the end of september each year the growing stages were recorded according to the leaf collar method after abendroth et al 2011 the growing stages are divided into vegetative v and reproductive r stages vegetative stages are designated with a v followed by the total number of collared leaves present for example a plant with three visible leaf collars is v3 growth stage reproductive stages are designated with an r followed by the numbers 1 6 each specific v or r stage is defined only when 50 percent or more of the plants in the field are in or beyond that stage table 1 of abendroth et al 2011 s publication listed all the v and r stages and corresponding common names according to that table ve v6 vt r1 r3 and r6 are the starts of seedling jointing tasseling silking milk and physiological maturity respectively before sowing the experimental field was rototilled at a depth of 0 25 0 3 m a ridge with a width of 1 m and a height of 0 15 m forming a ditch 0 3 m wide was then built fig 1 two lines of maize were sown on the ridge with row spacing of 0 4 m and plant spacing of 0 25 0 3 m drip lines were laid in the middle of the ridge immediately after sowing and the film were laid at the same time covering above the ridge the discharge rate of the drip emitter was 1 38 l h 1 at the work pressure of 0 1 mpa and the spacing was 0 3 m the film was polyethylene transparent film with a thickness of 0 01 mm the film was used for both the m and nm treatment after sowing to ensure the emergence of seeds for the nm treatment the film was removed in about one week after emergence while the film was kept for treatment m dates of sowing emergence and film removal for the 3 years are listed in table 1 field management irrigation and fertilization scheduling were the same for the m and nm treatments the irrigation scheduling was determined by the upper and lower limits of soil water content in the nm treatments and the irrigation amount was kept the same between m and nm treatments and determined according to eq 1 1 q i a h θ up θ low p η where θ up and θ low are the upper and lower limits of soil water content respectively

taken after sowing to ensuring higher germination rate in 2014 once may 3rd 15 mm and 2015 twice may 1 st and may 8th 15 mm each according to the soil moisture and local management before sowing each plot received basal fertilizer of 62 0 kg hm 2 pure nitrogen n 150 0 kg hm 2 p2o5 and 80 0 kg hm 2 k2o based on local management experience the total n application rate was 330 kg hm 2 applied three times as topdressing during stage v6 the vegetative stage tassel stage vt and the reproductive stage three r3 with the proportion of 60 20 and 20 the topdressing was applied with irrigation by venturi fertilizers thus irrigation with amounts of 10 to15 mm was applied during fertilization to flush the drip lines and ensure all the fertilizer solution went into the field the irrigation and fertilization dates and total irrigation amounts for the 3 years are listed in table 1 2 3 soil evaporation measurements soil evaporation e s was measured using micro lysimeters made from pvc tubes and combined with an inner and outer barrel the inner barrel which had an inner diameter of 10 28 cm and a height of 15 cm was first pushed into the ground to drill the undisturbed soil the outer barrel which had a slightly larger diameter and the same height as the inner barrel was then fixed in the ground to ensure the inner barrel could be removed easily micro lysimeters were placed in three positions underneath the drip line 25 cm apart from the drip line and in the ridge for each plot fig 1 with three replicates for each position the micro lysimeters were reinstalled every 5 days as well as after each irrigation and rainfall event of more than 5 mm so that volumetric water content would be representative of the soil water content in the treatment plot as peer researchers recommended balwinder singh et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 weighing was conducted daily using an electric balance with a precision of 0 1 g we removed the micro lysimeters from the edge of the film mulch put back in the outer barrel after weighing and covered the film back again carefully to ensure that no damage occurred to the soil surface nor the mulch covered the mini lysimeters soil evaporation was taken as the difference between the two weighing results after which the units were converted to mm d 1 according to the barrel cross sectional area the field e s was obtained by the area weighted average of the soil evaporation at three positions 2 4 sap flow measurements and scaling flow32 1 k dynamax co houston tx usa based on the heat balance method was used in sap flow measurements two plants from each plot and two plots from each treatment were selected to install the sap flow sensors the diameters of maize stems changed greatly because of rapid plant growth during the vegetation stages however one sap flow gauge can only measure plants with a certain diameter range thus sap flow was measured for four plants from the vt stage in both the m and nm treatments sensors were installed at more than 20 cm above the ground surface details regarding the theory and installation are available in the dynamax flow32 1 k manual gauge outputs were measured every 60 s and recorded as 30 min means using a cr1000 data logger we took the average of two values in an hour as the hourly sap flow q g h 1 sap flux density j s g cm 2 h 1 was calculated based on q divided by the cross sectional area of the wrapped stem a si cm2 the cross sectional area of the stem was determined by the stem diameter measured by the vernier caliper to scale up single plant water use to transpiration of the field 20 plants were selected and their stem diameters were measured for each plot the stem cross sectional area was calculated as the average of the plot a sa ignoring the water capacity of the maize plant the field transpiration t r sf mm h 1 can be calculated by eq 2 bethenod et al 2000 2 t r sf 10 j s a s a a b where a and b are the row and plant spacing cm respectively and 10 is the unit conversion factor the cumulative value of t r sf for 24 h in a day is the daily transpiration mm d 1 2 5 dual crop coefficient method to determine et in this study the amount of transpiration was only measured in the mid and late season because of limitations measuring the diameter with the sap flow sensors we calculated the transpiration of the whole growth period using the dual crop coefficient method from the fao 56 manual with the adjusted mid and late season basal crop coefficient based on the measured transpiration the specific method is described in detail below the fao 56 dual crop coefficient method was used to estimate transpiration eq 3 allen et al 1998 3 t r k s k cb e t 0 where t r is the actual transpiration k s is the water stress reduction coefficient with a range of 0 1 which can be taken as 1 in this paper for sufficient irrigation supplied in fields and k cb is the basal crop coefficient et 0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 which is calculated by the fao penman monteith equation 4 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 vpd u 2 δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is net radiation at the reference height mj m 2 d 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 δ is the slope of the vapor pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 vpd is the vapor pressure deficit kpa which is calculated from the temperature and relative humidity rh of the day t is the daily air temperature at 2 m k which is obtained from the average of the highest and lowest air temperatures of the day and u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m m s 1 to obtain the value of k cb the plant growing period was first divided into four stages i e the initial stage the emergence stage ve to the vegetative stage three v3 crop development stage v3 to vt mid season

if the mean value of the daily minimum relative humidity rh min during the mid or late season growth stage differs from 45 or the wind speed at 2 m height over grass u 2 m s 1 is larger or smaller than 2 m s 1 and any of the values of k cb mid and k cb end are larger than 0 45 they must be adjusted using the following equation allen et al 1998 5 k c b k c b t a b 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 h 3

two net radiometers qtc 4 jinzhou sunshine technology co ltd liaoning china in the center of every representative plot of the m and nm treatments at a height of 50 cm above the canopy which was adjusted as the plant height increased the two radiometers were connected to a data logger pc 4 jinzhou sunshine technology co ltd liaoning china data were collected at 30 min intervals 2 7 measurements of other meteorological factors the meteorological data including solar radiation air temperature and humidity and wind speed were measured by a weather station located at the research station about 80 m from our experimental field a pyr type solar radiation sensor vp 4 air temperature and humidity sensors and ds 2 type wind speed sensor were connected to an em50 data logger all sensors and data loggers were obtained from decagon co pullman wa usa data were collected at 30 min intervals 2 8 plant growth and yield measurements plant height stem diameter and leaf area index lai were measured once per growth stage the plant height was measured using a meter with a precision of 1 cm stems were measured with a vernier caliper at 20 cm above the ground leaf length and width were measured using a meter after which the product was multiplied by a conversion coefficient of 0 74 to obtain the actual leaf area plant leaf area was summed from the area of all the leaves the lai was calculated by dividing the leaf area by the plant spacing three plants were selected randomly at the first measurement and tagged for the following measurements in each plot with nine replicates for each treatment for the height stem diameter and lai measurements for yield y estimation three subplots with an area of 3 m 1 3 m were selected for each plot from which all ears were collected dried and ground the grain weight and water content were determined to convert the yield at a water content of 18 water use efficiency wue kg m 3 was the ratio of y t hm 2 to et mm eq 8 8 wue 100 y e t where 100 is the unit conversion factor 2 9 statistical analysis the statistical differences between the two treatments for all data were tested with an anova using the spss 17 0 spss inc chicago il usa linear fit were applied to comparing the e s t r et and r n between m and nm treatments linear regression was used as well as to examine the relationship r n and et 3 results 3 1 soil evaporation and crop transpiration throughout the entire growth stage the e s of m was significantly lower than that of the nm treatment and all treatments showed a higher e s at the seedling stage and lower values at the maturity stage fig 2 e s of m in the growth stage of 2014 2016 varied between 0 06 1 40 0 05 1 54 and 0 12 1 99 mm d 1 respectively while e s of nm between 0 18 2 21 0 06 2 30 and 0 05 2 84 mm d 1 respectively total e s of the entire growth stage for m and nm treatments were 58 8 and 108 8 mm in 2014 60 0 and 107 6 mm in 2015 and 63 5 and 117 0 mm in 2016 respectively for the three year study period a significantly linear relationship was found between the e s of m and nm treatments with the e s of m being only about 52 4 of that of the nm treatment fig 3 the maximum transpiration of the m and nm treatments during the mid and later growth stages was 7 03 and 6 51 mm d 1 in 2014 6 57 and 6 11 mm d 1 in 2015 and 6 99 and 5 91 mm d 1 in 2016 respectively overall the t r of m was 1 088 times that of the nm treatment fig 4 specifically the film mulching could increase the t r by 8 8 during the mid and later growth stages for the 3 years the water consumption of the maize field was dominated by crop transpiration during the mid and later growth stages soil evaporation during the same stage was below 1 mm d 1 and 2 mm d 1 for the m and nm treatment respectively 3 2 evapotranspiration and crop coefficient the seasonal patterns of et of m and nm treatments were similar the et of m was lower than that of the nm treatment in the early ve to v6 stage and late growth stage r3 to r6 stage however during the mid growth period vt to r3 the differences in et between m and nm treatment were small and et of m was not always lower than that of nm fig 5 a c and e the average et for m and nm treatments throughout the growth stage were 3 06 and 3 23 mm d 1 in 2014 2 68 and 2 79 mm d 1 in 2015 and 2 94 and 3 02 mm d 1 in 2016 respectively the daily et for the two treatments showed linear correlations with r2 0 95 for the 3 years fig 5b d and f and the et values for the m treatment were 95 2 96 6 and 97 9 of the values for the nm treatment respectively for the 3 years evaluation of the accumulation values throughout the growth stage fig 6 a c and e revealed that the t r of m was 5 9 9 6 and 11 6 average 8 9 higher than that of the nm treatment in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively however plastic mulching decreased the e s by 45 2 50 1 mm averagely in this area over the three year study period and the total et of the m treatment was slightly lower than that of the nm treatment and the average over the 3 years was 4 0 lower among them et of m was 5 2 3 9 and 2 8 lower than that of the nm treatment in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the decrease in et treatment was mainly because of the decrease in the ratio of e s to et e s et and the corresponding increase in the ratio of t r to et t r et fig 6b d and f the ratio of e s et was 12 5 14 5 for the m treatment and was up to 21 7 25 2 for the nm treatment the ratio of t r et was 85 5 87 5 and 74 8 78 3 for the m and nm treatments for the 3 years the k c of m was significantly lower than that of the nm treatment in stages ve to v3 k c ini and after r3 k c end but the k c of m decreased somewhat or slightly increased in stages from vt to r3 k c mid when compared to that of treatment nm table 2 the mean k c values were 0 89 0 77 and 0 80 for the m treatments which were 5 4 5 5 and 3 2 lower than those of the nm treatments 0 94 0 81 and 0 83 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively however the middle season basal crop coefficient k cb mid mea of the m treatment was higher than that of the nm treatment by 7 1 for the three years there were no obvious seasonal patterns in the evaporation coefficient k e throughout the growth stages and the mean k e of m was between 0 09 and 0 10 which was significantly lower than that of the nm treatment 0 18 0 19 for the 3 years 3 3 available energy the net radiation above the canopy r n of m was lower than that of the nm treatment and there were significant linear relationships between the two treatments p 0 001 the r n values of m were 90 0 94 6 and 93 4 of those of the nm treatment in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 7 the mean r n of m decreased by 7 05 for the 3 years there were significant linear correlations between et and r n while there was no significant difference in the relationships between m and nm treatment fig 8 3 4 plant growth and yield plastic film accelerated plant growth development and senescence the v6 stage of m started 2 3 days earlier than nm while the vt stage started 5 7 days earlier and the r6 4 5 days earlier table 3 correspondingly the maximum lai of m was achieved earlier and the largest differences between treatment m and nm appeared at the beginning of stage vt fig 9 in addition because they were close to the time at which the film was uncovered the difference in lai between m and nm was little during the ve to v3 stages the results showed that maize growth y and wue were significantly p 0 1 affected by mulching with the exception of the difference in lai in 2014 not being significant p 0 11 the height diameter at a height of 20 cm biomass at the maturity stage the maximum lai y and wue of treatment m were significantly higher than those of treatment nm by 7 1 5 8 4 8 1 7 5 9 and 12 0 in 2014 5 4 8 8 6 9 2 2 8 8 and 13 1 in 2015 and 6 7 4 5 3 7 4 0 7 4 and 10 7 in 2016 respectively table 4 4 discussion 4 1 effect of mulching on et and its components evapotranspiration is very important to precise development of irrigation scheduling and is significantly influenced by weather conditions irrigation scheduling and field management practices such as surface mulching allen et al 1998 zhao et al 2010 the et totals 413 4 471 3 mm and daily mean et from sowing to harvest 2 69 3 06 mm d 1 of the m treatment for the 3 years in the study were comparable to the results of other studies with plastic mulching ding et al 2013 yet significantly lower than those of studies without mulching howell et al 1998 zhao et al 2010 and of the nm treatments in the same study plastic film mulching is a well established management strategy to reduce e s and et in the field wang et al 2011 doss et al 1970 found that total et of maize with complete plastic mulching was 25 4 29 2 lower for different years compared to that without mulching under furrow irrigation in the southeastern united states in another rain fed maize field zhou et al 2009 reported that partial mulching fraction of 0 7 and whole mulching with plastic film reduced total et by 11 1 and 16 6 respectively when compared to that without mulching fan et al 2017 found that total et of mulching treatment decreased by 13 8 in a maize field with full irrigation in arid regions based on the field experiment over three consecutive years we confirmed that both e s and et were reduced by plastic film mulching in a drip irrigated maize field under the semi humid climate in northeastern china figs 2 and 6 the accumulated e s of treatment m was reduced by 45 2 while the accumulated et of m was only slightly lower 2 8 5 2 than that of treatment nm the decrease of et in m treatment was lower than that reported in former studies but within the rage of a study with the same climate and irrigation method liu et al 2015 the difference in daily et between m and nm showed different patterns in different growth stages at the initial growth stage after uncovering the film the daily et was lower for treatment m than nm fig 5 because of the reduction of soil evaporation by the plastic film fig 2 from stage v3 to v12 the leaf area covers the ground gradually and e s decreased because the energy available to the ground surface decreased unger et al 2012 the differences in e s became much smaller between treatment m and nm after stage v12 moreover t r becomes an important component of et li et al 2013 in this study the t r of m was 1 088 times that of the nm treatment fig 4 leading to the higher et of the m treatment for several days fig 5 in stage vt in contrast the growth period was delayed for the nm treatment table 3 resulting in a higher et during the later growth stages fig 5 overall the cumulative et and k c were higher for treatment nm than m throughout the growth period table 2 one of the main reasons for the reduction in et by mulching was that the proportion of e s was reduced in our study the average ratio of e s to et of treatment m was from 12 5 14 5 which was much lower than ratios of 26 0 and 30 3 from non mulching maize fields reported by other researchers liu et al 2002 kang et al 2003 and in the present study 21 7 25 2 and comparable to studies of mulching fields 10 1 ding et al 2013 another reason the reduced et was that the available energy was reduced by film mulching in our study the plastic film made the available energy i e r n supplying the latent heat flux fig 7 decreased which reduced et the et variations were determined by r n with a linear slope of 0 33 0 41 being observed for the 3 years fig 8 these finding suggest that maize et was partly controlled by radiation energy or available energy which are similar to the reported results for the dense crop canopy fan et al 2017 liu et al 2017 4 2 effect of mulching on growth and yield the plastic mulch changed the albedo of the ground surface producing complex changes in the crop microclimate environment and accelerating crop development tarara 2000 many studies have indicated that plastic mulching not only reduced water loss from soil evaporation but also accelerated crop development in the early stages by increasing soil temperature and controlling weeds which would enhance crop yield zhou et al 2009 hou et al 2010 our results indicate that plastic mulch accelerated plant growth and advanced maize tasseling and maturity thereby improving biomass and yield fig 9 and table 2 one of the difference of influence of mulching on crop growth in this semi humid area from arid area where mulching is more widely used is that the temperature increase by film mulching is relatively important comparing to soil water improvement zhao et al 2015 film mulching in arid area is often for higher utilization of the limited rainfall wang et al 2016 however the rainfall in our study area is often abundant and with about 45 70 mm irrigation the soil water content can be kept above 75 filed capacity which would not limit crop growth allen et al 1998 study in the same area showed that compared with the nm treatment the topsoil accumulative temperatures of ridges were 245 c and 314 c higher at the m treatment in 2014 and 2015 respectively sui et al 2018 and they argued that the soil temperature increase may be one of the important reason for yield increase in northeastern china numerous studies have reported that plastic mulch can effectively improve the yield anikwe et al 2007 fan et al 2017 moreover some studies pointed out that the yield increase can be attributed to the improved root growth as well as increased water and nutrient absorption capacity under plastic mulching abou ei magd et al 2008 eldoma et al 2016 while other studies indicated that plastic film can effectively improve soil water storage and increase the fertility level of the soil surface layer li et al 2013 yield increase may also be attributed to higher water transpiration vial et al 2015 film mulching decreased e s and increased t r which is related to higher canopy stomatal conductance zhao et al 2011 when the stomatal conductance is high it is also beneficial to the co2 entry which increases the photosynthetic rate of the crop and improves yield lai is a very important eco physiological factor because it directly influences solar radiation interception air temperature and humidity penetration at every layer of the canopy and further affects leaf temperature water vapor and heat fluxes steduto and hsiao 1998 suyker and verma 2008 plastic film mulching increased the maximum lai and k cb mid mea but decreased the mean k c throughout the growing season fig 9 tables 2 and 4 suggesting that mulching has a positive effect on saving water in general plastic mulch improved yield and decreased water use both of which resulted in a higher wue for the m treatment 5 conclusions under the conditions of full water and n fertilizer application with drip irrigation the effects of film mulching on field evapotranspiration crop yield and water use efficiency were analyzed in a three year field experiment 1 film mulching reduced the total amount of evapotranspiration by about 4 0 and had a significant effect on the distribution between soil evaporation and crop transpiration for the three years the ratio of transpiration to total evapotranspiration of the m treatment increased and changed the water consumption distribution to processes beneficial to crop yield 2 film mulching reduced the mean crop coefficient of the whole growth period increased the basal crop coefficient during the mid growth period by 7 1 and reduced the evaporation coefficient from 0 18 0 19 to 0 09 0 10 for the three years 3 film mulching reduced the net radiation and energy available of the m treatment resulting in the lower evapotranspiration film mulching didn t affect the linear correlation between evapotranspiration and the net radiation 4 the maize growth stage was advanced in the field with the m treatment and the maturity stage was accelerated by 4 5 days the plant height stem diameter at 20 cm above ground biomass and the maximum leaf area index increased by 1 7 7 1 the yield increased by 5 9 8 8 and the water use efficiency increased by 10 7 13 1 for the three
