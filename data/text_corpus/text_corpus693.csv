3465,to quantify the hydrological effects of disconnected impervious area is significant for urban planning and storm water management most relevant studies were event based analysis and only focused on surface runoff the accumulated impacts of disconnected imperviousness on both surface and subsurface runoff have not been fully understood yet in this study a physically based model coupling surface runoff subsurface runoff and evapotranspiration was constructed for continuous simulation of the hydrological processes in an rpa receiving pervious area dia disconnected impervious area system at street block scale five rpa types with natural clay loam compacted clay loam natural sandy clay loam and depressed clay loam were considered for each rpa type urban development scenarios with varying disconnected impervious area ratios dirs were designed the results presented that both the annual total and averaged event based surface runoff followed a generally power form relationship with dir for all the rpa types which can be satisfactorily described by a concise and meaningful formula disconnected impervious surface can lead to higher event based initial soil moistures and it is much more significant when during dry months autumn and winter with less potential evapotranspiration intensity than during wet months spring and summer this results imply the importance to take the potential increased initial soil moisture of rpa and the corresponded increased runoff generation into consideration of storm water management when imperviousness disconnection is applied at last with the increase of dir the annual total groundwater recharge had a tendency to rise first and then decrease this proves the possibility of improving underground water resource storage or maintain the groundwater recharge to the predeveloped level in the process of urban imperviousness expanding since this simulation work lacks on ground validation further studies based on the conclusions are still needed from the perspective of measured data analysis in urban rpa dia system keywords impervious surface receiving pervious area surface subsurface modelling groundwater recharge low impacts development sponge city 1 introduction the world has experienced a rapid urbanization process in recent decades deng et al 2009 increased impervious cover surface and sealed soil area along with the urbanization has greatly changed the original hydrological process by preventing soil infiltration and evapotranspiration this further leads to increased surface runoff amount and urban floods increased river flashiness altered groundwater recharge and river base flow and also degraded river ecosystem jacobson 2011 shuster et al 2005 the issue of the hydrological effects from urban imperviousness has become a hotspot in recent years the hydrological effects of impervious surface are highly depended on its hydraulic connectivity to the urban drainage systems ebrahimian et al 2016 based on this connectivity total impervious area can be divided into directly connected impervious area dcia and disconnected impervious area dia runoff on the dcia flows directly to the drainage networks with nearly no loss han and burian 2009 while runoff on the dia will go through the infiltration by the downslope pervious surface also referred as receiving pervious area rpa before reaching the catchment outlet the dia comparing with the dcia thus has less impacts on surface runoff increasing and groundwater recharge impairing due to the concentrated infiltration on the rpa voter and loheide 2018 transforming dcia to dia by disconnecting impervious surface with rpa like green infrastructure gi low impacts development lid or sponge city sc facilities to form an rpa dia system has become a widespread popular strategy for mitigating surface runoff and also improving subsurface storage in urban areas eckart et al 2017 newcomer et al 2014 stephens et al 2012 the hydrological process of the rpa dia system has received much attention for its significance in urban planning and storm water management recently the infiltration capability of the rpa has been regarded as one of the most important factors affecting the hydrological effects from the dia guan et al 2016 guo et al 2010 holman dodds et al 2003 silva and silva 2020 valinski and chandler 2015 voter and loheide 2018 lower infiltration capability for rpa caused by factors like soil compaction and lid clogging in urban areas can weaken the hydrodynamic disconnection between the dia and the drainage networks and lead to larger runoff increasing from dia davis 2008 guo et al 2010 silva and silva 2020 voter and loheide 2018 yong et al 2013 besides the larger relative area of dia to rpa also decreases the effectiveness of imperviousness disconnection for runoff mitigating since smaller rpa dia ratio represents higher runoff loading for the rpa whose runoff retention volume is limited yang and chui 2018 with the same reason the runoff mitigation effectiveness is lower under less frequent events as well holman dodds et al 2003 palla and gnecco 2015 furthermore the increase of soil water storage volume or rpa ponding volume have also been noticed to significantly improve runoff retention efficiency wang et al 2021b however most of these studies were event based analyses and only focused on surface runoff the subsurface dynamics and the inter event infiltration capacity recovery through evapotranspiration that may also provide explanations for the altered hydrological response have always been ignored lim and welty 2017 besides the event based analysis always has the premise of totally same antecedent soil moisture this ignores the potential impacts of dia on antecedent soil moisture since the dia may affect the infiltration volume per unit rpa overall how does dia affect the original surface subsurface hydrological process in continuous rainfall and evapotranspiration has not been fully understood yet in this paper we explored the impacts of disconnected impervious surface on original hydrological process in an rpa dia system at street block scale a physically based surface subsurface hydrological model was constructed for continuous simulation of the hydrological processes during three years five representative land use types of rpa with different soil plants and engineering conditions were considered these conditions have covered a wide range of representative soil hydraulic conductivity and varying surface ponding volumes of the rpa for each the rpa type modelling scenarios with varying disconnected impervious area ratios dirs were designed the dir here refers to the area ratio of dia to the whole rpa dia system the accumulated effects of dia on surface runoff generation evapotranspiration soil water content and groundwater recharge were evaluated based on the simulation results 2 materials and methods 2 1 the rpa dia system at street block scale an urban street block was chosen as the modelling scale in our study figure 1 indeed as the street blocks are separated with each other by the impervious streets each one could be seen as a generally independent hydrological unit or say sub catchment in urban catchments by targeting on the street blocks the results can have representative implications for exploring the hydrological impacts of urbanization taking the actual topography and hydrogeological conditions in wuhan a plain city locating at humid regions in china as an example the urban street block was generalized to a 2d slope with a length of 200 m and a plain slope of 0 005 the ground water table was hypothesized to stay constant at 2 m chen 2016 during the simulation years in the imperviousness scenarios designs the impervious surface was arranged and clustered at the most upslope of the 2d slope which made the imperviousness to be disconnected by the pervious area this arrangement indeed represented the most low impact pattern of imperviousness distribution since all the impervious surface was disconnected and all the pervious area received and infiltrated runoff from the upslope imperviousness the upslope disconnected impervious area dia together with the downslope receiving pervious area rpa formed the so called rpa dia system figure 1 2 2 modeling method an integrated 1d surface 2d subsurface flow model was constructed and used for the hydrological simulation the governing equation for the 2d subsurface flow is the richards equation 1 θ t k h h z s where θ is the soil water content t is time t h is the subsurface pressure head l k h is the soil hydraulic conductivity lt 1 z is the elevation l and s is the sink source term lt 1 the relationships between θ k h and h were described by the van genuchten model 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 3 k θ k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where θr is the residual water content θs is the saturated water content α n m are empirical parameters 1 l ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t se is the effective water content l is also an empirical parameter the diffusion wave approximation of the shallow water equation was used as the governing equation for the 1d surface shallow water flow and can be expressed as weill et al 2009 4 h s t h s 5 3 n m s h s z q r q e where hs is the surface water depth l nm is the manning s coefficient s is the bed slope qr is the rainfall rate lt 1 and qe is the exchange rate with the subsurface lt 1 both the gradient and critical depth outlet conditions eqs 5 and 6 respectively were implemented into the overland flow simulator 5 q out h s o u t 5 3 n m o u t s out h s z n 6 q out g h s o u t 3 where n is the outward normal direction at the outlet evapotranspiration and canopy interception was also simulated based on the model put forward by kristensen and jensen kristensen and jensen 1975 in which the maximum canopy interception was calculated by 7 i max c int l a i where c int is an interception coefficient l and lai is the leaf area index root plant transpiration for node i was described as 8 e plant i f 1 l a i f 2 θ i r d f i e p 9 f 1

1 l a i 12 f 3 θ i θ i θ w θ fc 2 θ fc θ w θ fc 2 for θ i θ w θ f 2 0 for θ i θ w θ f 2 where θr is the residual volumetric water content the interception and local depression storage in the model were handled as follows the local depression storage was treated as the water depth threshold of local water movement in overland flow that is local water movement did not occur until the ponded depth has exceeded the depression and once the water movement occurred the hs in the equation 4 should be equal to local water depth minus the depression depth as for the actual interception storage it has a bound from zero to imax in each time step the interception storage increases with the rate of rainfall once the imax has been reached during rainfall the residual rainfall that interception storage has no space to receive anymore will be conveyed to land surface for calculation of infiltration and overland flow similarly the potential evapotranspiration rate was applied to decrease interception and surface water depth firstly at each time step once the sum of interception and surface water depth was smaller than the potential evapotranspiration depth in one time step the residual evapotranspiration will be conveyed to equation 8 and equation 10 for calculation of soil plant evapotranspiration it should be noticed that the evaporation of surface ponding occurs before transpiration in our model which was based on the assumption that the designed land use scenario of shallow grass see section 2 3 will be submerged by surface ponding the open source software fenics alnaes et al 2015 was used for solving the governing equations with the galerkin finite element method and the python language was applied to construct the structure and process of the model the modified implicit picard iteration method celia et al 1990 was used for the richards equation to gain better mass balance for the shallow water equation the implicit newton iteration method was applied instead the lumped mass matrix was also included for solving the richards equation to avoid numerical oscillation ju and kung 1997 the surface and subsurface flow were externally coupled with the output from subsurface flow passed as input to surface flow more details about the coupling process of the model was represented in appendix a 2 3 modelling scenarios and parameters also take the actual condition in wuhan as an example five groups of soil plants and engineering conditions were designed in the street block scale slope natural clay loam n cl natural sandy clay loam n scl compacted clay loam c cl conventional depressed 10 cm clay loam d cl 10 and unconventional depressed 30 cm clay loam d cl 30 for the n cl type the soil was modelled with a clay loam texture which is the most major soil textures in wuhan city covering area ratio of 42 1 to the main city according to the spatial distribution data of soil texture in china from resource and environment science and data center https www resdc cn the n scl type represents soil with sandy clay loam texture which is also a major soil textures in wuhan city covering area ratio of 37 5 to the main city the sandy texture and the high soil conductivity of the n scl type soil indeed generally fulfil the requirements of the soil after infiltration retrofit according to the technical guide for sponge city construction in wuhan trial the n scl type rpa thus can also be seen as the results after soil retrofit of n cl the c cl type referred to soil compacting due to trampling and urban pressure and presenting lower hydraulic conductivity and porosity of soil up to depth of 30 cm nawaz et al 2013 on the basis of the natural clay loam to be specific the hydraulic conductivity for the 30 cm depth compacted soil was reduced by a factor of 10 and porosity by 10 comparing on the basis of n cl voter and loheide 2018 in our designing table 1 at last the d cl 10 condition referred to natural pervious area transforming to a simplified bioretention by with reference to the technical guide for sponge city construction in wuhan trial adding a 0 1 m height overflow outlet and applying overall land surface depression for the pervious area on the basis of the n cl condition for the d cl 30 condition an unconventional outlet height and overall depression depth of 0 3 m was added on the basis of the n cl instead its overall depression is much deeper than the conventional one suggested by the technical guide for wuhan d cl 10 the d cl 30 thus can be treated as a strategy of unconventional surface depression handling while the depression depth of 30 cm is not unpractical at the same time it should be noticed that the overall land surface depression for rpa has different meaning with the local depression storage the local depression reflects the slight unevenness of the ground whereas the overall depression results in the rpa to become a ponding area the ponding depth in the ponding area is generally determined by the overflow outlet height as shown in figure 2 the plants for the n cl n scl and d cl types were treated to be shallow rooted and have a middle density the lai and root depth for plants are designed as 2 0 and 0 3 m respectively according to plant database of mike she model who had the same method for evapotranspiration modelling the plant for the c cl however was treated to have a lower density with lai of 1 0 the root depth for the c cl was also restricted to 0 2 m due to soil compaction bouwman and arts 2000 collectively these rpa types have covered a wide range of representative soil hydraulic conductivities and also varying surface ponding depths to allow for broad representations of our simulation work for each of the above rpa types imperviousness development scenarios with varying dirs from 0 to 0 9 with a gradient of 0 1 were designed in addition three extreme dirs of 0 95 0 98 and 1 0 i e field totally covered by impervious surface were also included altogether these resulted in a total of 63 simulation scenarios for our study major model parameters for surface and subsurface flow as well as evapotranspiration were displayed in table 1 with references 2 4 model applying no flow boundary was applied to all sides of the subsurface domain and the land surface where imperviousness was arranged the rest of the land surface had a neumann boundary with flux equaling surface water supplying rate and was switched to dirichlet boundary whenever the pressure head at the land surface was greater than zero a constant pressure head of zero was applied at the bottom of the domain to represent the constant groundwater table structured triangle meshes were applied for the spatial domain discretization fine vertical resolutions of 0 01 m and 0 02 m were chosen near the land surface and the bottom of the domain respectively to better calculate infiltration and groundwater recharge vertical resolutions varying from 0 02 m to 0 1 m were used for the rest domain space the spatial resolution of 20 m was applied at the horizontal direction and was refined to 0 5 m 8 m around the junction of the imperviousness and the pervious area to better handle infiltration of surface runoff generated from upslope imperviousness and potential strong lateral subsurface flow here this discretization method finally led to a total of 840 to 2184 cells of the subsurface domain as for the 1d surface domain discretization a constant horizontal resolution of 0 5 m was applied instead a method of linear interpolation was used to exchange fluxes and pressure heads between the surface domain and the subsurface domain who have different horizontal mesh resolutions see appendix a for more information the gradient boundary was applied at the outlet of the land surface for the rpa types of n cl c cl and n scl for the d cl 10 and d cl 30 types however the calculation of overland flow on pervious area and impervious area were separated to achieve the overall depression of bioretention for the impervious area part the critical depth boundary was applied at the most downslope to reflect runoff from imperviousness freefalling into the depressed bioretention correspondingly for the pervious area part neumann flux equaling to the imperviousness outflow was applied at the most upslope representing inflow from the impervious area besides the critical depth boundary was also applied at the outlet for the pervious area representing freefalling outflow in the bioretention overflow outlet as the overflow outlet had a depth of 0 1 m or 0 3 m the outflow from pervious area did not occur until water depth at the outlet had exceeded the depth daily meteorological and radiation data from china meteorological data service centre data cma cn for the year 2018 was put into the well known penman monteith formula for calculation of daily potential evapotranspiration in wuhan the representative humid city we consider hourly precipitation data for wuhan in year 2018 was also obtained from ear5 in the climate data store https cds climate copernicus eu the year 2018 was chosen as a representative year because its total precipitation 1250 mm was close to the multiyear average annual rainfall depth of 1205 mm in wuhan tao et al 2021 to develop a typical initial soil moisture distribution the urban street block slope with no impervious covering was modelled with the rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data successively for each soil and engineering condition until the soil moisture had reached dynamic equilibrium the potential evapotranspiration data and the precipitation data together were replicated three times to generate a representative three year meteorological input for forcing the model this allows for comparisons in two temporal scales event to event fluctuations and year to year trending the replicated one year meteorological input isolates the effects of annual meteorological condition from the potential varying behavior of the accumulated impacts in the year to year trending an adaptive time step was utilized in our simulation to guarantee both accuracy and speed a minimum time step of 1 min and a maximum time step of 1d were set during dry times when rainfall intensity is zero and the specific time step was adapted according to the iteration convergence conditions of the governing equations when rainfall intensity is greater than zero the time step was adjusted to a constant value of 1 min to gain better modelling accuracy of infiltration and overland flow process during rainfall events 2 5 model validation and performance to validate our model data from two laboratory rainfall simulation experiments by abdul gillham 1984 and pappas et al 2008 were used the two experiments have covered both infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff generation mechanisms moreover the rainfall runoff process in a pervious impervious system was also included in the experiment by pappas et al 2008 altogether the two experiments are competent for validation of our integrated surface subsurface runoff model who is target on modelling runoff in pervious impervious systems the specific description of the experiments and the validation results can be seen in appendix b to add the mass balance errors for all the simulations were also calculated and shown in appendix c to provide information of the model performance 3 results and discussion in this section results for surface runoff soil water content groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration in the first simulating year were analyzed and discussed to explore the accumulated impacts of dia on these elements in the span of a whole year subsection 3 1 subsection 3 4 then the results in the first the second and the third simulating year were compared with each other to explore how the accumulated impacts behave in year spanning long term subsection 3 5 3 1 surface outflow 3 1 1 annual total surface runoff coefficient modelled outflow rate for the first whole simulation year was integrated with time to get annual total outflow annual total surface runoff coefficient for each scenario was then calculated by dividing the total outflow with the annual total rainfall figure 3 the results show that the larger total surface runoff is corresponded to higher impervious area and rpa types with lower soil hydraulic conductivity or less ponding volume as expected besides the relationship between the total surface runoff coefficient and the dir for each rpa type represents increasingly steeper slopes as dir gets larger however the extent of this trend seems being highly positive with the soil conductivity since the c cl type behaves a nearly linear runoff dir relationship with changeless slopes the slight slope under low dir in the runoff dir relationship can be explained by the fact that under this condition the rpa is able for retention of extra overland flow generated from the impervious area this results in the minor change of outflow with dir however as dir increases accompanied with the larger runoff loading for the rpa and also shorter pervious path for runoff infiltration the rpa becomes less able to control the upslope surface runoff the change of impervious area thus causes more dramatic effects on outflow with higher dir based on same reasons the infiltration capacity for the c cl type rpa seems to be too limited to control the surface runoff from the upslope no matter dir is at a low or high level which explains the changeless slope of runoff to dir as dir continues to increase and gets closer to 1 0 the proportion of the effects on runoff from rpa types is theoretically getting smaller which is represented by the converged tendency of the runoff dir relationships for all the varying rpa types considering the dir comes exactly to 1 0 which refers to no pervious surface existing the surface runoff should totally be independent on rpa types but surface ponding volume to be specific smaller annual runoff coefficient is corresponded to larger ponding volume since larger ponding volume means more water remained on the land surface for evaporation but not contribute to outflow a concise and also meaningful power form fitting formula has been found to successfully cover the above runoff dir relationships for all of the five rpa types with nonlinear fitting coefficient reaching greater than 0 97 13 r r 0 r 1 r 0 d i r n where r is the annual surface runoff coefficient r0 is the original runoff coefficient without impervious surface r1 represents the runoff coefficient when the field is fully covered by impervious surface n is the nonlinear parameter that reflect the nonlinearity of the runoff dir relationship it should be noticed that the parameters r0 and r1 are directly determined by the results of dir 0 and dir 1 0 respectively therefore only the nonlinear parameter n is iterated to fit the formula with the simulated runoff dir relationship the nonlinearity of the runoff coefficient dir relationship contains the information of reduced runoff caused by imperviousness disconnection considering the impervious surface is directly connected to the outlet and expanding from the most downslope to upslope the runoff should theoretically increase in generally linear trend in other words the higher parameter n also has the meaning of higher effectiveness of runoff reduction by imperviousness disconnection with the corresponded rpa type in fact there do exist several other forms of formulas such as exponential and polynomial that can better or even perfectly fit the runoff dir relationships for all the rpa types however the parameters in those forms of formulas have totally vague meaning and are hard to determine based on which we think it is meaningless to put forward them on the contrary the parameters in our power form formula do have clear meanings the parameters r0 and r1 can be directly determined by measuring runoff in a totally pervious representative plot and a totally impervious representative plot respectively the only one empirical parameter in our formula is n its determination may require data from more comprehensive simulations an empirical table of the parameter n may can be developed in further studies just like the parameter table of cn in the scs model with the simple form of the fitting formula it is under anticipate that the fitting has some derivations d cl 10 in figure 3 since the hydrological process is so complex but on the whole the fitting formula can generally satisfactorily describe the runoff dir relationships with varying soil textures and varying overall depressions as the impervious surface arrangement in the simulation represented the most low impact condition of imperviousness distribution the runoff coefficient dir relationship can help predict the minimum runoff increasing led by impervious area expanding this can further provide reference of the maximum extent of impervious area allowed or the minimum rpa needed to maintain annual runoff under a certain level which plays an important role in the design of sponge city for example to achieve the goal of annual runoff control ratio of 85 in wuhan s sponge city construction which has a close meaning of keeping annual runoff coefficient below 0 15 the maximum imperviousness ratios allowed in a single sub catchment are about 0 5 0 9 0 7 and 0 9 for the n cl n scl d cl 10 and d cl 30 types rpa respectively according to our simulation results for the c cl type however the annual runoff coefficient cannot reach the runoff control goal even with no impervious surface which suggests the necessity of soil de compaction in sponge city construction focusing on the results of the n cl and d cl 10 the conventional 10 cm surface depression handling can reduce runoff to a certain extent but this reduction is still too limited to get outflow volume smaller than the n scl type with sandy texture soil take dir 0 95 as a reference when under this high level of dir the d cl 10 has a 22 9 lower annual runoff than the n cl while this value is 42 8 for the n scl with no surface depression however with the unconventional 30 cm overall surface depression the annual runoff coefficient under all dirs becomes generally similar to that for the n scl type to sum up the numerical simulation results confirm the effectiveness of conventional surface depression handling 10 cm for runoff mitigation but it is significantly less effective than infiltration retrofitting by replacing clay texture rpa soil with sandy texture in aim of annual runoff control larger overflow depth may need to be considered to update the technical guide for sponge city construction in wuhan according to our modelling results depression handling with 30 cm outflow depth is a satisfactory and also practical one however it should be noticed that the parameters of this study are directly obtained from empirical values and lack on ground validation further studies based on on ground data analysis may be still needed to adjust the above references according to the specific underlying conditions 3 1 2 event based surface runoff coefficients the statistics of runoff coefficients for all the rainfall events during the first simulation year under each imperviousness scenario were summarized in figure 4 here a rainfall event is defined by the following principle the minimum duration between two neighboring events should be larger than 6 h the total rainfall depth for an event should be greater than 2 mm surface runoff coefficient for each rainfall event was calculated with dividing the total surface outflow depth by the total rainfall amount the overall relationship between surface runoff coefficient and dir under rainfall event time scale shows similar trend with that under annual time scale i e the results of annual total surface runoff in figure 3 with the same reason for the annual runoff results the event based runoff coefficient also has the tendency of slighter change with imperviousness under lower dir higher soil conductivity and smaller rainfall amount with a general exclusion of the evapotranspiration the average event based runoff coefficient dir relationship can also be well described by the formula in form of equation 13 however the fitting is still relative worse for the d cl 10 rpa type than the other types which is consistent to the results of annual runoff comparing the 50 percentiles of the event based runoff coefficient for the d cl 10 and the n scl with the n cl it seems soil infiltration retrofit and conventional surface depression have similar efficiencies on runoff mitigation however focusing on the maximum runoff coefficient for each dir the conventional surface depression d cl 10 behaves to have limited effectiveness on runoff mitigation the maximum runoff coefficient indeed corresponds to the rainfall events with the least frequency in the year under this condition the average runoff reduction for the conventional surface depression is just 10 6 on the basis of the n cl type on the contrary the infiltration retrofit has been observed to control runoff much more efficiently under the least frequent rainfall event even when dir is at high levels of 0 9 and 0 95 the corresponding reductions of runoff are 24 8 and 12 9 respectively for the n scl with comparison of n cl nevertheless for the unconventional depression handling in d cl 30 its performance in event based runoff mitigation is even a bit better than the n scl including for the least frequent rainfall event overall the modelling results suggest the effectiveness of both soil infiltration retrofitting and conventional surface depression handling 10 cm on runoff control for frequent rainfall events for less frequent events however the conventional surface depression handling shows limited efficiency on runoff mitigation while soil infiltration retrofitting still has the effectiveness in addition increasing the depression depth to 30 cm can get similar event based runoff control efficiency with that by soil infiltration retrofit 3 2 water content of unsealed soil annual average effective soil water content of the unsealed soil for each scenario was represented in figure 5 the unsealed soil refers to the soil body beneath the pervious surface and vertically extending to the groundwater table only the unsealed soil is discussed here because it is this part of soil that plays the major roles in hydrological processes including infiltration groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration it is obvious that the average soil moisture increases with dir and the less change of soil moisture is corresponded to rpa types with lower infiltration capacity this increase is due to the concentrated infiltration occurred on rpa as has been discussed above the increase of disconnected impervious area can result in additional more runoff supplying for infiltration on the rpa which cumulatively leads to larger infiltration volume and also higher soil water content in the annual time scale accordingly the concentrated infiltration will have less impacts on soil moisture for rpa with lower infiltration capability similar results can also be found in the study by alizadehtazi et al 2020 who compared soil moisture data of two bioretention facilities in new york city u s and observed larger magnitude of soil moisture change in response to rainfall for the one with larger contributing area it is also noticeable that with the continuous increase of dir the change of average soil water content shows an evident increasingly larger extent this trend is more obvious for soil texture with higher soil conductivity besides as the increase of surface ponding volume has prolonged the remaining time of runoff on the rpa for infiltration the higher soil water content is thus presented for the d cl 10 and d cl 30 than the n cl type however the ponding volume of rpa seems to have limited effects on soil moisture when dir is lower than 0 5 which may be caused by the small occurring frequency of surface ponding when dir is under a low level in addition to the average soil moisture the effective water content of the unsealed soil in 20 cm depth at the beginning of each rainfall event was also extracted for representation of event based initial soil moisture the extracted initial soil moistures were divided into two groups based on during wet months and during dry months figure 6 the wet months here refer to spring and summer from march to august and the dry days refer to the rest of the year the results reveal that both the overall distributions and the average value of the initial soil moisture still generally increases with the dir during the dry and the wet months besides the increase extent is promoted by higher soil conductivity and larger ponding volume of rpa which is consistent with the results of annual average soil moisture however comparing to dry months the 25 50 75 percentiles and also the average of the initial soil moistures in wet months increase in less extent with dir for all the rpa types which indicate larger impacts of dia on initial soil moisture in dry months according to the simulation results with dir rising from 0 to 0 9 the average initial effective soil water contents during dry months have increased 16 4 8 7 14 0 18 7 and 20 4 for the n cl c cl n scl d cl 10 and d cl 30 types respectively while these values are 9 0 4 2 12 8 13 5 and 19 1 for wet months indeed comparing to the dry months the wet months during spring and summer are corresponded to larger rainfall amount and also larger potential evapotranspiration according to the meteorological data for simulation under this condition the shallow soil layer has suffered a large range of soil moisture altering due to the strong infiltration and also evapotranspiration which can be confirmed by the wider range of boxes for wet months than dry months in figure 6 furthermore the effects of dia causing the event based initial soil moisture to increase can be limited by the strong evapotranspiration in spring and summer especially during events with smaller rainfall and slower succession on the contrary with lower evapotranspiration intensity during autumn and winter the increased higher soil water content due to the dia may be less possible to decrease to the original level before the next rainfall event the increased antecedent soil moisture is the most direct result of the accumulated impacts by dia this is the point that event based analysis ignores which can lead to underestimation of the design flood events pathiraja et al 2012 since initial soil moisture is an important factor affecting runoff generation the increased event based initial soil moisture may also contribute partly to the increasingly higher surface runoff with dir presented in subsection 3 1 besides based on the fact of large contribution area about 1 20 of rpa in urban storm water management the initial soil moisture of rpa under this condition may go through an evident increase comparing with the original level based on the modelling results though previous observations mostly came to the conclusion that antecedent soil moisture did not play a significant role in urban runoff miller and hess 2017 smith et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 more recent studies indicated the reverse one saadi et al 2020 investigated a large sample of events and catchments 852 in u s and found the antecedent soil moisture plays a significant role in urbanized catchments as in rural ones the study by fidal and kjeldsen 2020 demonstrated that linking soil moisture into modelling can improve its performance by 12 across 28 urban catchments in u k besides studies that focused on urban stormwater management also suggested the significance for higher initial saturation of lid facilities in weakening the effectiveness of runoff reduction jingming et al 2019 palla and gnecco 2015 based on the above discussions our simulations results can imply the importance of taking the potential increase of antecedent soil moisture into consideration of lid or sponge city designing especially during dry months with less evapotranspiration intensity and when rpa surface depression was applied however as far as we know imperviousness disconnection leading to higher antecedent soil moisture has seldom been mentioned in previous studies considering the lack of model validation this novel result may still need further research from the perspective of on ground investigations in the region for example just like the study by alizadehtazi et al 2020 hydrological monitoring works could be settled at several lid facilities with varied contributing areas antecedent soil moistures thus could be extracted and compared which has not been included in the work by alizadehtazi et al 2020 3 3 groundwater recharge relationships between annual total groundwater recharge and dir with varying rpa types were represented in figure 7 the lower soil hydraulic conductivity results in generally less groundwater recharge as expected the trends of the relationship between groundwater recharge and dir are quite different among varying rpa types for the c cl type the total groundwater recharge decreases constantly with the expanding of impervious surface as well as the shrunk of pervious area for infiltration however for the other four rpa types turning points of dir are found in the recharge dir relationships to be specific the groundwater recharge rises slowly with dir firstly when dir is below the turning point but decreases sharply latter with dir when dir has exceeded this point this resulted in a maximum increase of 26 0 in the annual groundwater recharge for the n cl type and 42 5 32 6 61 4 for the n scl d cl 10 d cl 30 types respectively due to the expanded disconnected impervious surface this also make it possible to maintain the groundwater recharge in the street block to stay at the pre development level even under a highly developed condition with dir ranging from 0 8 to 0 9 comparing the d cl 10 and the d cl 30 with the n cl type the additional depressed handling of rpa has led to an evident increase of groundwater recharge by an average extent of 32 9 and 73 2 respectively which makes the total recharge volume can be even similar to the n scl type who has much larger soil conductivity on the contrary by comparing the results for the n cl and the c cl types the soil compaction has been found to dramatically decrease the groundwater recharge with an extent of 56 6 even when dir is zero in fact as discussed in the results of soil water content the disconnected imperviousness caused additional runoff supply for infiltration at the pervious area comparing to the original condition with no impervious area covering this promotes development of stronger and deeper penetrating wetting fronts that escape the influence of the root zone and thereby may increase groundwater recharge stephens et al 2012 voter and loheide 2018 it is actually how the impacts of dia on groundwater recharge accumulates to sum up the increase of dir reduced the pervious area for infiltration and groundwater recharge on the one hand and on the other hand facilitated the concentrated infiltration and deep drainage the effects of the concentrated infiltration seem to be so strong that they can eliminate the effects of the shrunk pervious area when dir is at a low level however for the c cl type rpa the concentrated infiltration is limited by the low soil conductivity which leads to the major role of the shrunk infiltration area in affecting the recharge and therefore constantly decreased groundwater recharge with dir with the continuous increase of dir the shrunk pervious area limits the space where the concentrated infiltration can take effects on the recharge at the same time this explains the reducing trend of the recharge when dir exceeds the turning point in the recharge dir relationship figure 7 it should be noticed that these results may be bounded to the regional characteristic we consider in our modelling design the modelling domain has a very shallow groundwater table and also a shallow plant root depth these result in infiltrated water easy to escape the influence of root zone and easy to reach the groundwater table which may amplify the effects of concentrated infiltration on groundwater recharge the groundwater recharge in semi arid or arid region with deeper groundwater table deeper plant root and smaller rainfall may follow a totally different tendency with dia how the dia affects groundwater recharge in semi arid or arid region requires further investigation overall the simulation results reveal potential groundwater recharge enhancement by urban impervious surface developed in disconnected ways and this enhancement can be further improved by soil infiltration retrofit and surface depression handling of rpa consistent with our results several studies have also reported urban recharge enhancement attributed to concentrated infiltration in lid facilities or recharge basins ku et al 1992 calculated groundwater recharge of nassau county new york with the method of water budget calculation it was found that annual recharge can increase about 12 percent due to urban imperviousness but with the assumption that runoff generated on the impervious surface all be infiltrated by recharge basins mooers et al 2018 modelled groundwater with modflow in a small catchment 11 7 ha in halifax nova scotia canada with simple calculation of net infiltration and evapotranspiration using pcswmm at the same time it was predicted that urban development with lid facilities could restore predevelopment aquifer recharge conditions besides stephens et al 2012 also modelled groundwater using modflow in a 34 ha small urban catchment with four retention ponds in new mexico while modelling of surface runoff process was not included and infiltration from retention ponds was determined by validation as a result they found that lid practices had promoted recharge relative to predevelopment condition similar with our modelling methods bhaskar et al 2015 simulated fully distributed and coupled surface subsurface runoff in baltimore metropolitan area 13216 km2 using parflow with a horizontal resolution of 500 m due to the coarse model resolution they have not especially considered scenarios of applying lid practices for impervious surface disconnecting and thus the concentrated infiltration however this coarse resolution did not allow them to include urban pipe drainage on the other hand this indeed made the imperviousness that was not adjacent to streams all be dia in their study in the end their results indicate slight higher subsurface storage for urbanized scenario than predevelopment scenario on the contrary some studies have reported observations of decreased groundwater recharge or base flow with urban development instead hardison et al 2009 konrad et al 2005 rose and peters 2001 several modelling studies that used lumped method for runoff generation calculation e g scs model also came to the conclusion of declined recharge with urban imperviousness expanding erickson and stefan 2009 wang et al 2021a a potential factor that caused the difference of our results and these studies could be due to the varying of meteorological and hydrogeological conditions however a more important factor should be the absence of the concentrated infiltration in these studies for example in the above mentioned observation studies hardison et al 2009 compared stream base flow of several rural small impervious area and urban large impervious area catchments however the impervious area in the urban catchments they investigated was well connected to urban drainage under which condition the runoff generated from the imperviousness directly flows to streams but not to pervious surface for infiltration for the same reason the modelling studies by erickson and stefan 2009 and wang et al 2021a using scs model for runoff generation calculation also ignored spatial distribution of imperviousness and further the effects of the concentrated infiltration nevertheless one exception is the research by minnig et al 2018 who concluded enhanced recharge with urban development by applying scs and water budget method for calculation of groundwater recharge in dübendorf switerland based on their results the decrease of evapotranspiration is larger than the increase of surface runoff when urban developed which led to higher infiltration and recharge though generated from lumped model that ignores the concentrated infiltration their results of water budget indeed contained consistent theory with ours that is infiltration increased while evapotranspiration decreased during urbanization which means more infiltrated water escaped the effects of root zone this is exactly what happened with the concentrated infiltration as has been discussed above 3 4 evapotranspiration the total evapotranspiration for the whole rpa dia system was represented in figure 8 a the results show that with the increase of dir evapotranspiration declines generally linearly for all the rpa types this can be explained by the fact of shrunk pervious area where evapotranspiration mainly occurs fang et al 2020 mazrooei et al 2021 the c cl and scl have overall lower total evapotranspiration comparing to n cl because of the smaller density of plants and the faster soil water drainage to deeper layer respectively the data for rpa types with overall depressions d cl 10 and d cl 30 were not included in the figure since they were generally overlapped with the results for cl 5 28 maximum and 0 26 average difference this indeed indicates little effects of ponding volume on total evapotranspiration however from an intuitive view the increased ponding volume should result in more water remained on the depression for evaporation with the rate of potential evapotranspiration the total evapotranspiration thereby should be larger for rpa types with larger ponding volume the counter intuitive results we guess should be caused by two aspects of reasons firstly when the rpa dia ratio is large and surface ponding occurs not much frequently the effects of the ponding on evaporation may can be neglected in the annual time scale secondly when the rpa dia ratio gets so large that surface ponding frequently occurs the effects from the ponding in the whole rpa dia system may be rather limited by the small area of rpa to explore how the altered soil moisture induced by dia affects the evapotranspiration in rpa the soil plant evapotranspiration per unit rpa was extracted and presented in figure 8b evaporation from interception and surface ponding that has nothing to do with soil moisture is excluded from the results for most cases the results show slightly increasing trend of the evapotranspiration per unit rpa with dir this is due to the increased soil moisture led by the expanding of dia figure 5 similar results have also been reported from voter and loheide 2018 and shields and tague 2015 who found increased evapotranspiration by disconnecting imperviousness with vegetated pervious area exceptions exist for d cl 10 and d cl 30 whose soil plant evapotranspiration shows a decline trend with dir when dir exceeds a certain level this should be caused by frequently overall surface ponding that prevents evapotranspiration from soil and plant in other words the evaporation from free water surface for these two rpa types accounts for a greater proportion of total evapotranspiration than the other rpa types overall though expanded dia can lead to higher soil water content of the rpa which may further enhance plant and soil evapotranspiration this seems not enough to eliminate the effects of decreased pervious area according to our simulation work 3 5 the year spanning accumulated impacts the annual runoff groundwater recharge soil water content and evapotranspiration in the first year the second year and the third year were compared to explore the year spanning accumulated impacts the results show limited year spanning changes for most of the simulated hydrological elements including annual surface runoff annual average unsealed soil water content event based initial soil moisture except for the first rainfall event in each year and annual evapotranspiration the maximum difference between all these elements in the latter two simulation years and the first year is just 0 35 the only year spanning change that can be noticed is the groundwater recharge for the second year the annual groundwater recharge has been found to reduce by a maximum of 77 37 table 2 comparing to the first year besides the annual groundwater recharge in the third year is generally same with that in the second year nevertheless the recharge dir relationships for the latter two separating years still generally follow the trend in figure 7 the larger groundwater recharge at the first year should be originated from the gravitational water remained beneath the impervious covering since the initial soil water distribution is obtained from the results of multiyear simulation with totally pervious land surface in general it seems the accumulated impacts from dia have a quick response to meteorological conditions and stabilize in just one year indeed the cumulative character of the impacts by dia originated from the altered level of soil moisture led by the continuous events spanning concentrated infiltrations in rpa for the water content in shallow layer soil on whom the accumulated impacts on surface runoff and evapotranspiration rely it obviously has a quick response to infiltration relative to the annual time scale thereby the surface runoff and evapotranspiration are reasonable to behave limited year spanning changes when annual meteorological input is same the changeless annual groundwater recharge across years however may be due to the shallow water table in our rpa dia system the shallow water table as well as the thin vadose zone may cause the infiltrated water easier to reach the water table for drainage this make the overall saturation of the vadose zone and the groundwater recharge also response quickly to the concentrated infiltration relative to the annual time scale however for regions with thick vadose zone the lag time of deep drainage recharging groundwater may exceed even a century mcmahon et al 2006 scanlon et al 2010 the response of recharge to changes of external conditions like climate change can lag in time scale of years rossman et al 2014 therefore it is reasonable to think that regions with deeper groundwater table and root depth may have distinct year spanning accumulated impacts from dia and the accumulated impacts on vadose zone soil moisture as well as groundwater recharge may take years to stabilize further studies are still needed to investigate the long term accumulated impacts of dia on groundwater in regions with deep water tables 4 conclusion this paper focused on a representative urban rpa dia system and the impacts of dia on the hydrological processes inside was explored in addition to changes of impervious area five typical land use types of rpa were also considered continuous simulation using an integrated surface subsurface flow model was applied based on the empirical hydrological parameters following major results and conclusions were obtained both the annual total and event based surface runoff follow a generally power form relationship with dir for all the rpa types a concise and also meaningful formula was found to satisfactorily describe this relationship furthermore as the rpa dia system represents a most low impact condition of imperviousness distribution the runoff coefficient dir relationship can provide reference for the maximum urban impervious area allowed or the minimum pervious area needed to control the surface outflow below a certain level at street block scale it has also been found that rpa surface depression soil de compaction and infiltration retrofit all can significantly enhance the effectiveness of runoff reduction by disconnecting impervious surface disconnected impervious surface can lead to higher annual average soil water content of the rpa comparing to the pre developed condition and becomes more evident when dir gets larger though with the existence of evapotranspiration event based initial soil moistures are also observed to increase with dir and it is much more significant during dry months autumn and winter with less potential evapotranspiration intensity than during wet months spring and summer the results imply the importance to take the potential increased initial soil moisture of rpa and the corresponded increased runoff generation into consideration of storm water management when imperviousness disconnection is applied with the increase of dir the annual total groundwater recharge has a tendency to rise first and decrease later this tendency is strengthened by the higher soil conductivity and the larger surface ponding volume however for the compacted clay loam no increase of groundwater recharge can be observed due to its poor infiltration capacity at land surface the results prove the possibility of improving underground water resource storage or maintain the groundwater recharge to the pre developed level in the process of urban imperviousness expanding annual total evapotranspiration was found to generally linearly decrease with dir which suggest the area of pervious surface being the only major factor affecting the original evapotranspiration in the rpa dia system though the raised soil water content caused by imperviousness expanding enhances soil plant evapotranspiration per unit rpa this effect is too limited if comparing to the change of pervious area a limitation of this study is the lack of validation with on ground data and the parameters our model used were directly determined by empirical values or relevant literatures further studies based on the above conclusions are still needed from the perspective of on ground data analysis in urban rpa dia systems in the region especially those seldom be mentioned by previous studies e g impacts of dia on antecedent soil moisture also the accumulated impacts of dia on the hydrological processes in other semi arid or arid regions are another topic worth exploring distinct results may can be generated comparing to this study who target on a typical rpa dia system in humid region credit authorship contribution statement y wang conceptualization data curation formal analysis

nos 41890823 and 52009092 appendix a model coupling method the surface and subsurface flows are externally coupled with following processes step1 for each time step the water supply i e the sum of rainfall depth and surface water depth at each node was applied as the neumann flux for the subsurface domain at unsaturated land surface nodes and was applied as dirichlet depth at saturated land surface nodes step2 infiltration was then calculated for unsaturated nodes the infiltration is exactly the water supply for saturated nodes infiltration was calculated by a1 f k h n h z where n h z refers to the gradient of soil water potential at the direction of the boundary normal step3 the infiltration and rainfall was then put into the shallow water equation for calculation of the water depth distribution at the end of this time step as the surface and subsurface domain may have different horizontal resolutions the infiltration calculated from the subsurface domain was linearly interpolated to fit the surface domain with finer horizontal resolutions see figure a1 as an example the results of step3 were put back to step1 for calculation of the next time step until total simulation time has come to the end time to judge a node was saturated or unsaturated in each time step the following iterations were applied step i give an initial list of saturated nodes and the rest nodes were thus unsaturated step ⅱ apply the neumann and dirichlet boundary to the land surface nodes as described in step1 step iii surface nodes with pressure head greater than zero in the results of step ⅱ were extracted to update the saturated nodes list step ⅳ the updated saturated nodes from step iii were then put to step i for iteration until the initial saturated nodes list was same with the updated saturated nodes list b model validation against laboratory rainfall simulation experiment the coupling model was validated with the data from two laboratory rainfall simulation experiments by abdul gillham 1984 and pappas et al 2008 the first experiment by abdul gillham 1984 consists in a plexiglas sandbox with 140 cm long 120 cm high and 8 cm wide the filling sand had a porosity of 0 34 a uniform slope of 12 and a manning surface roughness of 0 185 s m1 3 an outlet was located at a height of 74 m at which the initial water table was also assigned in the experiment a constant rainfall rate of 43 mm h was applied for 20 min the above settlement can result in strong interactions between surface flow and subsurface flow during rainfall which make the experiment suitable for validation of our integrated surface subsurface runoff model the saturated hydraulic conductivity was tested to be 3 5 10 5m s the soil hydrodynamic parameters were also obtained by fitting the vangenuchten model to the tested drying curve of the sand the specific values are α 2 4 m 1 n 5 note that the fitting values were borrowed from kollet maxwell 2006 who used the same experimental data for validation of their model parflow with the whole sand box being the simulation domain it is discretizated with a vertical resolution of 1 cm and a laterl resolution of 2 cm a constant time step of 10 s was used in our simulation our modelling results of outflow rate together with the measured data in the experiment were presented in fig b1 the results simulating the same experiment using integrated hydrology model inhm is also included in the figure note that the experimental measured data and the results of inhm are both extracted from kollet maxwell 2006 the second experiment we choose for model validation was conducted on a cascade of four sloped 5 soil boxes pappas et al 2008 each the soil box was 1 m long 60 cm wide the box was filled with silt loam and has a soil depth of 20 cm the saturated water content of the soil was 0 41 soil water was allowed to drain freely from the bottom of these boxes impervious covering could be applied on the box to transform the original soil surface s to impervious surface i three underlying scenarios were designed in this experiment impervious covering applied at the downslope two boxes ssii or at the upslope two boxes iiss or at no boxes ssss the rainfall was applied at 20 mm h for 48 min then 30 mm h for 24 min and 40 mm h for 24 min the initial average soil moisture was 0 22 in the model simulation the vertical and lateral discretization was 1 cm and 2 cm respectively and a constant time step of 10 s was applied as this experiment had not tested the saturation capillary pressure relationship of the soil we have firstly calibrated our model with the data of the ssss scenario by hand the calibrated hydrograph is presented in fig b2 a the calibrated parameters can be seen in table b 1 using the calibrated soil hydrodynamic parameters we then modelled the runoff of the ssii and the iiss scenarios the modelling results are shown in fig b3 overall the above validation results with the two laboratory experiments shows the efficiency of our model for simulating both surface subsurface runoff in pervious area and runoff in impervious pervious system c water balance errors for all the simulations

3465,to quantify the hydrological effects of disconnected impervious area is significant for urban planning and storm water management most relevant studies were event based analysis and only focused on surface runoff the accumulated impacts of disconnected imperviousness on both surface and subsurface runoff have not been fully understood yet in this study a physically based model coupling surface runoff subsurface runoff and evapotranspiration was constructed for continuous simulation of the hydrological processes in an rpa receiving pervious area dia disconnected impervious area system at street block scale five rpa types with natural clay loam compacted clay loam natural sandy clay loam and depressed clay loam were considered for each rpa type urban development scenarios with varying disconnected impervious area ratios dirs were designed the results presented that both the annual total and averaged event based surface runoff followed a generally power form relationship with dir for all the rpa types which can be satisfactorily described by a concise and meaningful formula disconnected impervious surface can lead to higher event based initial soil moistures and it is much more significant when during dry months autumn and winter with less potential evapotranspiration intensity than during wet months spring and summer this results imply the importance to take the potential increased initial soil moisture of rpa and the corresponded increased runoff generation into consideration of storm water management when imperviousness disconnection is applied at last with the increase of dir the annual total groundwater recharge had a tendency to rise first and then decrease this proves the possibility of improving underground water resource storage or maintain the groundwater recharge to the predeveloped level in the process of urban imperviousness expanding since this simulation work lacks on ground validation further studies based on the conclusions are still needed from the perspective of measured data analysis in urban rpa dia system keywords impervious surface receiving pervious area surface subsurface modelling groundwater recharge low impacts development sponge city 1 introduction the world has experienced a rapid urbanization process in recent decades deng et al 2009 increased impervious cover surface and sealed soil area along with the urbanization has greatly changed the original hydrological process by preventing soil infiltration and evapotranspiration this further leads to increased surface runoff amount and urban floods increased river flashiness altered groundwater recharge and river base flow and also degraded river ecosystem jacobson 2011 shuster et al 2005 the issue of the hydrological effects from urban imperviousness has become a hotspot in recent years the hydrological effects of impervious surface are highly depended on its hydraulic connectivity to the urban drainage systems ebrahimian et al 2016 based on this connectivity total impervious area can be divided into directly connected impervious area dcia and disconnected impervious area dia runoff on the dcia flows directly to the drainage networks with nearly no loss han and burian 2009 while runoff on the dia will go through the infiltration by the downslope pervious surface also referred as receiving pervious area rpa before reaching the catchment outlet the dia comparing with the dcia thus has less impacts on surface runoff increasing and groundwater recharge impairing due to the concentrated infiltration on the rpa voter and loheide 2018 transforming dcia to dia by disconnecting impervious surface with rpa like green infrastructure gi low impacts development lid or sponge city sc facilities to form an rpa dia system has become a widespread popular strategy for mitigating surface runoff and also improving subsurface storage in urban areas eckart et al 2017 newcomer et al 2014 stephens et al 2012 the hydrological process of the rpa dia system has received much attention for its significance in urban planning and storm water management recently the infiltration capability of the rpa has been regarded as one of the most important factors affecting the hydrological effects from the dia guan et al 2016 guo et al 2010 holman dodds et al 2003 silva and silva 2020 valinski and chandler 2015 voter and loheide 2018 lower infiltration capability for rpa caused by factors like soil compaction and lid clogging in urban areas can weaken the hydrodynamic disconnection between the dia and the drainage networks and lead to larger runoff increasing from dia davis 2008 guo et al 2010 silva and silva 2020 voter and loheide 2018 yong et al 2013 besides the larger relative area of dia to rpa also decreases the effectiveness of imperviousness disconnection for runoff mitigating since smaller rpa dia ratio represents higher runoff loading for the rpa whose runoff retention volume is limited yang and chui 2018 with the same reason the runoff mitigation effectiveness is lower under less frequent events as well holman dodds et al 2003 palla and gnecco 2015 furthermore the increase of soil water storage volume or rpa ponding volume have also been noticed to significantly improve runoff retention efficiency wang et al 2021b however most of these studies were event based analyses and only focused on surface runoff the subsurface dynamics and the inter event infiltration capacity recovery through evapotranspiration that may also provide explanations for the altered hydrological response have always been ignored lim and welty 2017 besides the event based analysis always has the premise of totally same antecedent soil moisture this ignores the potential impacts of dia on antecedent soil moisture since the dia may affect the infiltration volume per unit rpa overall how does dia affect the original surface subsurface hydrological process in continuous rainfall and evapotranspiration has not been fully understood yet in this paper we explored the impacts of disconnected impervious surface on original hydrological process in an rpa dia system at street block scale a physically based surface subsurface hydrological model was constructed for continuous simulation of the hydrological processes during three years five representative land use types of rpa with different soil plants and engineering conditions were considered these conditions have covered a wide range of representative soil hydraulic conductivity and varying surface ponding volumes of the rpa for each the rpa type modelling scenarios with varying disconnected impervious area ratios dirs were designed the dir here refers to the area ratio of dia to the whole rpa dia system the accumulated effects of dia on surface runoff generation evapotranspiration soil water content and groundwater recharge were evaluated based on the simulation results 2 materials and methods 2 1 the rpa dia system at street block scale an urban street block was chosen as the modelling scale in our study figure 1 indeed as the street blocks are separated with each other by the impervious streets each one could be seen as a generally independent hydrological unit or say sub catchment in urban catchments by targeting on the street blocks the results can have representative implications for exploring the hydrological impacts of urbanization taking the actual topography and hydrogeological conditions in wuhan a plain city locating at humid regions in china as an example the urban street block was generalized to a 2d slope with a length of 200 m and a plain slope of 0 005 the ground water table was hypothesized to stay constant at 2 m chen 2016 during the simulation years in the imperviousness scenarios designs the impervious surface was arranged and clustered at the most upslope of the 2d slope which made the imperviousness to be disconnected by the pervious area this arrangement indeed represented the most low impact pattern of imperviousness distribution since all the impervious surface was disconnected and all the pervious area received and infiltrated runoff from the upslope imperviousness the upslope disconnected impervious area dia together with the downslope receiving pervious area rpa formed the so called rpa dia system figure 1 2 2 modeling method an integrated 1d surface 2d subsurface flow model was constructed and used for the hydrological simulation the governing equation for the 2d subsurface flow is the richards equation 1 θ t k h h z s where θ is the soil water content t is time t h is the subsurface pressure head l k h is the soil hydraulic conductivity lt 1 z is the elevation l and s is the sink source term lt 1 the relationships between θ k h and h were described by the van genuchten model 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 3 k θ k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where θr is the residual water content θs is the saturated water content α n m are empirical parameters 1 l ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t se is the effective water content l is also an empirical parameter the diffusion wave approximation of the shallow water equation was used as the governing equation for the 1d surface shallow water flow and can be expressed as weill et al 2009 4 h s t h s 5 3 n m s h s z q r q e where hs is the surface water depth l nm is the manning s coefficient s is the bed slope qr is the rainfall rate lt 1 and qe is the exchange rate with the subsurface lt 1 both the gradient and critical depth outlet conditions eqs 5 and 6 respectively were implemented into the overland flow simulator 5 q out h s o u t 5 3 n m o u t s out h s z n 6 q out g h s o u t 3 where n is the outward normal direction at the outlet evapotranspiration and canopy interception was also simulated based on the model put forward by kristensen and jensen kristensen and jensen 1975 in which the maximum canopy interception was calculated by 7 i max c int l a i where c int is an interception coefficient l and lai is the leaf area index root plant transpiration for node i was described as 8 e plant i f 1 l a i f 2 θ i r d f i e p 9 f 1

1 l a i 12 f 3 θ i θ i θ w θ fc 2 θ fc θ w θ fc 2 for θ i θ w θ f 2 0 for θ i θ w θ f 2 where θr is the residual volumetric water content the interception and local depression storage in the model were handled as follows the local depression storage was treated as the water depth threshold of local water movement in overland flow that is local water movement did not occur until the ponded depth has exceeded the depression and once the water movement occurred the hs in the equation 4 should be equal to local water depth minus the depression depth as for the actual interception storage it has a bound from zero to imax in each time step the interception storage increases with the rate of rainfall once the imax has been reached during rainfall the residual rainfall that interception storage has no space to receive anymore will be conveyed to land surface for calculation of infiltration and overland flow similarly the potential evapotranspiration rate was applied to decrease interception and surface water depth firstly at each time step once the sum of interception and surface water depth was smaller than the potential evapotranspiration depth in one time step the residual evapotranspiration will be conveyed to equation 8 and equation 10 for calculation of soil plant evapotranspiration it should be noticed that the evaporation of surface ponding occurs before transpiration in our model which was based on the assumption that the designed land use scenario of shallow grass see section 2 3 will be submerged by surface ponding the open source software fenics alnaes et al 2015 was used for solving the governing equations with the galerkin finite element method and the python language was applied to construct the structure and process of the model the modified implicit picard iteration method celia et al 1990 was used for the richards equation to gain better mass balance for the shallow water equation the implicit newton iteration method was applied instead the lumped mass matrix was also included for solving the richards equation to avoid numerical oscillation ju and kung 1997 the surface and subsurface flow were externally coupled with the output from subsurface flow passed as input to surface flow more details about the coupling process of the model was represented in appendix a 2 3 modelling scenarios and parameters also take the actual condition in wuhan as an example five groups of soil plants and engineering conditions were designed in the street block scale slope natural clay loam n cl natural sandy clay loam n scl compacted clay loam c cl conventional depressed 10 cm clay loam d cl 10 and unconventional depressed 30 cm clay loam d cl 30 for the n cl type the soil was modelled with a clay loam texture which is the most major soil textures in wuhan city covering area ratio of 42 1 to the main city according to the spatial distribution data of soil texture in china from resource and environment science and data center https www resdc cn the n scl type represents soil with sandy clay loam texture which is also a major soil textures in wuhan city covering area ratio of 37 5 to the main city the sandy texture and the high soil conductivity of the n scl type soil indeed generally fulfil the requirements of the soil after infiltration retrofit according to the technical guide for sponge city construction in wuhan trial the n scl type rpa thus can also be seen as the results after soil retrofit of n cl the c cl type referred to soil compacting due to trampling and urban pressure and presenting lower hydraulic conductivity and porosity of soil up to depth of 30 cm nawaz et al 2013 on the basis of the natural clay loam to be specific the hydraulic conductivity for the 30 cm depth compacted soil was reduced by a factor of 10 and porosity by 10 comparing on the basis of n cl voter and loheide 2018 in our designing table 1 at last the d cl 10 condition referred to natural pervious area transforming to a simplified bioretention by with reference to the technical guide for sponge city construction in wuhan trial adding a 0 1 m height overflow outlet and applying overall land surface depression for the pervious area on the basis of the n cl condition for the d cl 30 condition an unconventional outlet height and overall depression depth of 0 3 m was added on the basis of the n cl instead its overall depression is much deeper than the conventional one suggested by the technical guide for wuhan d cl 10 the d cl 30 thus can be treated as a strategy of unconventional surface depression handling while the depression depth of 30 cm is not unpractical at the same time it should be noticed that the overall land surface depression for rpa has different meaning with the local depression storage the local depression reflects the slight unevenness of the ground whereas the overall depression results in the rpa to become a ponding area the ponding depth in the ponding area is generally determined by the overflow outlet height as shown in figure 2 the plants for the n cl n scl and d cl types were treated to be shallow rooted and have a middle density the lai and root depth for plants are designed as 2 0 and 0 3 m respectively according to plant database of mike she model who had the same method for evapotranspiration modelling the plant for the c cl however was treated to have a lower density with lai of 1 0 the root depth for the c cl was also restricted to 0 2 m due to soil compaction bouwman and arts 2000 collectively these rpa types have covered a wide range of representative soil hydraulic conductivities and also varying surface ponding depths to allow for broad representations of our simulation work for each of the above rpa types imperviousness development scenarios with varying dirs from 0 to 0 9 with a gradient of 0 1 were designed in addition three extreme dirs of 0 95 0 98 and 1 0 i e field totally covered by impervious surface were also included altogether these resulted in a total of 63 simulation scenarios for our study major model parameters for surface and subsurface flow as well as evapotranspiration were displayed in table 1 with references 2 4 model applying no flow boundary was applied to all sides of the subsurface domain and the land surface where imperviousness was arranged the rest of the land surface had a neumann boundary with flux equaling surface water supplying rate and was switched to dirichlet boundary whenever the pressure head at the land surface was greater than zero a constant pressure head of zero was applied at the bottom of the domain to represent the constant groundwater table structured triangle meshes were applied for the spatial domain discretization fine vertical resolutions of 0 01 m and 0 02 m were chosen near the land surface and the bottom of the domain respectively to better calculate infiltration and groundwater recharge vertical resolutions varying from 0 02 m to 0 1 m were used for the rest domain space the spatial resolution of 20 m was applied at the horizontal direction and was refined to 0 5 m 8 m around the junction of the imperviousness and the pervious area to better handle infiltration of surface runoff generated from upslope imperviousness and potential strong lateral subsurface flow here this discretization method finally led to a total of 840 to 2184 cells of the subsurface domain as for the 1d surface domain discretization a constant horizontal resolution of 0 5 m was applied instead a method of linear interpolation was used to exchange fluxes and pressure heads between the surface domain and the subsurface domain who have different horizontal mesh resolutions see appendix a for more information the gradient boundary was applied at the outlet of the land surface for the rpa types of n cl c cl and n scl for the d cl 10 and d cl 30 types however the calculation of overland flow on pervious area and impervious area were separated to achieve the overall depression of bioretention for the impervious area part the critical depth boundary was applied at the most downslope to reflect runoff from imperviousness freefalling into the depressed bioretention correspondingly for the pervious area part neumann flux equaling to the imperviousness outflow was applied at the most upslope representing inflow from the impervious area besides the critical depth boundary was also applied at the outlet for the pervious area representing freefalling outflow in the bioretention overflow outlet as the overflow outlet had a depth of 0 1 m or 0 3 m the outflow from pervious area did not occur until water depth at the outlet had exceeded the depth daily meteorological and radiation data from china meteorological data service centre data cma cn for the year 2018 was put into the well known penman monteith formula for calculation of daily potential evapotranspiration in wuhan the representative humid city we consider hourly precipitation data for wuhan in year 2018 was also obtained from ear5 in the climate data store https cds climate copernicus eu the year 2018 was chosen as a representative year because its total precipitation 1250 mm was close to the multiyear average annual rainfall depth of 1205 mm in wuhan tao et al 2021 to develop a typical initial soil moisture distribution the urban street block slope with no impervious covering was modelled with the rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data successively for each soil and engineering condition until the soil moisture had reached dynamic equilibrium the potential evapotranspiration data and the precipitation data together were replicated three times to generate a representative three year meteorological input for forcing the model this allows for comparisons in two temporal scales event to event fluctuations and year to year trending the replicated one year meteorological input isolates the effects of annual meteorological condition from the potential varying behavior of the accumulated impacts in the year to year trending an adaptive time step was utilized in our simulation to guarantee both accuracy and speed a minimum time step of 1 min and a maximum time step of 1d were set during dry times when rainfall intensity is zero and the specific time step was adapted according to the iteration convergence conditions of the governing equations when rainfall intensity is greater than zero the time step was adjusted to a constant value of 1 min to gain better modelling accuracy of infiltration and overland flow process during rainfall events 2 5 model validation and performance to validate our model data from two laboratory rainfall simulation experiments by abdul gillham 1984 and pappas et al 2008 were used the two experiments have covered both infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff generation mechanisms moreover the rainfall runoff process in a pervious impervious system was also included in the experiment by pappas et al 2008 altogether the two experiments are competent for validation of our integrated surface subsurface runoff model who is target on modelling runoff in pervious impervious systems the specific description of the experiments and the validation results can be seen in appendix b to add the mass balance errors for all the simulations were also calculated and shown in appendix c to provide information of the model performance 3 results and discussion in this section results for surface runoff soil water content groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration in the first simulating year were analyzed and discussed to explore the accumulated impacts of dia on these elements in the span of a whole year subsection 3 1 subsection 3 4 then the results in the first the second and the third simulating year were compared with each other to explore how the accumulated impacts behave in year spanning long term subsection 3 5 3 1 surface outflow 3 1 1 annual total surface runoff coefficient modelled outflow rate for the first whole simulation year was integrated with time to get annual total outflow annual total surface runoff coefficient for each scenario was then calculated by dividing the total outflow with the annual total rainfall figure 3 the results show that the larger total surface runoff is corresponded to higher impervious area and rpa types with lower soil hydraulic conductivity or less ponding volume as expected besides the relationship between the total surface runoff coefficient and the dir for each rpa type represents increasingly steeper slopes as dir gets larger however the extent of this trend seems being highly positive with the soil conductivity since the c cl type behaves a nearly linear runoff dir relationship with changeless slopes the slight slope under low dir in the runoff dir relationship can be explained by the fact that under this condition the rpa is able for retention of extra overland flow generated from the impervious area this results in the minor change of outflow with dir however as dir increases accompanied with the larger runoff loading for the rpa and also shorter pervious path for runoff infiltration the rpa becomes less able to control the upslope surface runoff the change of impervious area thus causes more dramatic effects on outflow with higher dir based on same reasons the infiltration capacity for the c cl type rpa seems to be too limited to control the surface runoff from the upslope no matter dir is at a low or high level which explains the changeless slope of runoff to dir as dir continues to increase and gets closer to 1 0 the proportion of the effects on runoff from rpa types is theoretically getting smaller which is represented by the converged tendency of the runoff dir relationships for all the varying rpa types considering the dir comes exactly to 1 0 which refers to no pervious surface existing the surface runoff should totally be independent on rpa types but surface ponding volume to be specific smaller annual runoff coefficient is corresponded to larger ponding volume since larger ponding volume means more water remained on the land surface for evaporation but not contribute to outflow a concise and also meaningful power form fitting formula has been found to successfully cover the above runoff dir relationships for all of the five rpa types with nonlinear fitting coefficient reaching greater than 0 97 13 r r 0 r 1 r 0 d i r n where r is the annual surface runoff coefficient r0 is the original runoff coefficient without impervious surface r1 represents the runoff coefficient when the field is fully covered by impervious surface n is the nonlinear parameter that reflect the nonlinearity of the runoff dir relationship it should be noticed that the parameters r0 and r1 are directly determined by the results of dir 0 and dir 1 0 respectively therefore only the nonlinear parameter n is iterated to fit the formula with the simulated runoff dir relationship the nonlinearity of the runoff coefficient dir relationship contains the information of reduced runoff caused by imperviousness disconnection considering the impervious surface is directly connected to the outlet and expanding from the most downslope to upslope the runoff should theoretically increase in generally linear trend in other words the higher parameter n also has the meaning of higher effectiveness of runoff reduction by imperviousness disconnection with the corresponded rpa type in fact there do exist several other forms of formulas such as exponential and polynomial that can better or even perfectly fit the runoff dir relationships for all the rpa types however the parameters in those forms of formulas have totally vague meaning and are hard to determine based on which we think it is meaningless to put forward them on the contrary the parameters in our power form formula do have clear meanings the parameters r0 and r1 can be directly determined by measuring runoff in a totally pervious representative plot and a totally impervious representative plot respectively the only one empirical parameter in our formula is n its determination may require data from more comprehensive simulations an empirical table of the parameter n may can be developed in further studies just like the parameter table of cn in the scs model with the simple form of the fitting formula it is under anticipate that the fitting has some derivations d cl 10 in figure 3 since the hydrological process is so complex but on the whole the fitting formula can generally satisfactorily describe the runoff dir relationships with varying soil textures and varying overall depressions as the impervious surface arrangement in the simulation represented the most low impact condition of imperviousness distribution the runoff coefficient dir relationship can help predict the minimum runoff increasing led by impervious area expanding this can further provide reference of the maximum extent of impervious area allowed or the minimum rpa needed to maintain annual runoff under a certain level which plays an important role in the design of sponge city for example to achieve the goal of annual runoff control ratio of 85 in wuhan s sponge city construction which has a close meaning of keeping annual runoff coefficient below 0 15 the maximum imperviousness ratios allowed in a single sub catchment are about 0 5 0 9 0 7 and 0 9 for the n cl n scl d cl 10 and d cl 30 types rpa respectively according to our simulation results for the c cl type however the annual runoff coefficient cannot reach the runoff control goal even with no impervious surface which suggests the necessity of soil de compaction in sponge city construction focusing on the results of the n cl and d cl 10 the conventional 10 cm surface depression handling can reduce runoff to a certain extent but this reduction is still too limited to get outflow volume smaller than the n scl type with sandy texture soil take dir 0 95 as a reference when under this high level of dir the d cl 10 has a 22 9 lower annual runoff than the n cl while this value is 42 8 for the n scl with no surface depression however with the unconventional 30 cm overall surface depression the annual runoff coefficient under all dirs becomes generally similar to that for the n scl type to sum up the numerical simulation results confirm the effectiveness of conventional surface depression handling 10 cm for runoff mitigation but it is significantly less effective than infiltration retrofitting by replacing clay texture rpa soil with sandy texture in aim of annual runoff control larger overflow depth may need to be considered to update the technical guide for sponge city construction in wuhan according to our modelling results depression handling with 30 cm outflow depth is a satisfactory and also practical one however it should be noticed that the parameters of this study are directly obtained from empirical values and lack on ground validation further studies based on on ground data analysis may be still needed to adjust the above references according to the specific underlying conditions 3 1 2 event based surface runoff coefficients the statistics of runoff coefficients for all the rainfall events during the first simulation year under each imperviousness scenario were summarized in figure 4 here a rainfall event is defined by the following principle the minimum duration between two neighboring events should be larger than 6 h the total rainfall depth for an event should be greater than 2 mm surface runoff coefficient for each rainfall event was calculated with dividing the total surface outflow depth by the total rainfall amount the overall relationship between surface runoff coefficient and dir under rainfall event time scale shows similar trend with that under annual time scale i e the results of annual total surface runoff in figure 3 with the same reason for the annual runoff results the event based runoff coefficient also has the tendency of slighter change with imperviousness under lower dir higher soil conductivity and smaller rainfall amount with a general exclusion of the evapotranspiration the average event based runoff coefficient dir relationship can also be well described by the formula in form of equation 13 however the fitting is still relative worse for the d cl 10 rpa type than the other types which is consistent to the results of annual runoff comparing the 50 percentiles of the event based runoff coefficient for the d cl 10 and the n scl with the n cl it seems soil infiltration retrofit and conventional surface depression have similar efficiencies on runoff mitigation however focusing on the maximum runoff coefficient for each dir the conventional surface depression d cl 10 behaves to have limited effectiveness on runoff mitigation the maximum runoff coefficient indeed corresponds to the rainfall events with the least frequency in the year under this condition the average runoff reduction for the conventional surface depression is just 10 6 on the basis of the n cl type on the contrary the infiltration retrofit has been observed to control runoff much more efficiently under the least frequent rainfall event even when dir is at high levels of 0 9 and 0 95 the corresponding reductions of runoff are 24 8 and 12 9 respectively for the n scl with comparison of n cl nevertheless for the unconventional depression handling in d cl 30 its performance in event based runoff mitigation is even a bit better than the n scl including for the least frequent rainfall event overall the modelling results suggest the effectiveness of both soil infiltration retrofitting and conventional surface depression handling 10 cm on runoff control for frequent rainfall events for less frequent events however the conventional surface depression handling shows limited efficiency on runoff mitigation while soil infiltration retrofitting still has the effectiveness in addition increasing the depression depth to 30 cm can get similar event based runoff control efficiency with that by soil infiltration retrofit 3 2 water content of unsealed soil annual average effective soil water content of the unsealed soil for each scenario was represented in figure 5 the unsealed soil refers to the soil body beneath the pervious surface and vertically extending to the groundwater table only the unsealed soil is discussed here because it is this part of soil that plays the major roles in hydrological processes including infiltration groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration it is obvious that the average soil moisture increases with dir and the less change of soil moisture is corresponded to rpa types with lower infiltration capacity this increase is due to the concentrated infiltration occurred on rpa as has been discussed above the increase of disconnected impervious area can result in additional more runoff supplying for infiltration on the rpa which cumulatively leads to larger infiltration volume and also higher soil water content in the annual time scale accordingly the concentrated infiltration will have less impacts on soil moisture for rpa with lower infiltration capability similar results can also be found in the study by alizadehtazi et al 2020 who compared soil moisture data of two bioretention facilities in new york city u s and observed larger magnitude of soil moisture change in response to rainfall for the one with larger contributing area it is also noticeable that with the continuous increase of dir the change of average soil water content shows an evident increasingly larger extent this trend is more obvious for soil texture with higher soil conductivity besides as the increase of surface ponding volume has prolonged the remaining time of runoff on the rpa for infiltration the higher soil water content is thus presented for the d cl 10 and d cl 30 than the n cl type however the ponding volume of rpa seems to have limited effects on soil moisture when dir is lower than 0 5 which may be caused by the small occurring frequency of surface ponding when dir is under a low level in addition to the average soil moisture the effective water content of the unsealed soil in 20 cm depth at the beginning of each rainfall event was also extracted for representation of event based initial soil moisture the extracted initial soil moistures were divided into two groups based on during wet months and during dry months figure 6 the wet months here refer to spring and summer from march to august and the dry days refer to the rest of the year the results reveal that both the overall distributions and the average value of the initial soil moisture still generally increases with the dir during the dry and the wet months besides the increase extent is promoted by higher soil conductivity and larger ponding volume of rpa which is consistent with the results of annual average soil moisture however comparing to dry months the 25 50 75 percentiles and also the average of the initial soil moistures in wet months increase in less extent with dir for all the rpa types which indicate larger impacts of dia on initial soil moisture in dry months according to the simulation results with dir rising from 0 to 0 9 the average initial effective soil water contents during dry months have increased 16 4 8 7 14 0 18 7 and 20 4 for the n cl c cl n scl d cl 10 and d cl 30 types respectively while these values are 9 0 4 2 12 8 13 5 and 19 1 for wet months indeed comparing to the dry months the wet months during spring and summer are corresponded to larger rainfall amount and also larger potential evapotranspiration according to the meteorological data for simulation under this condition the shallow soil layer has suffered a large range of soil moisture altering due to the strong infiltration and also evapotranspiration which can be confirmed by the wider range of boxes for wet months than dry months in figure 6 furthermore the effects of dia causing the event based initial soil moisture to increase can be limited by the strong evapotranspiration in spring and summer especially during events with smaller rainfall and slower succession on the contrary with lower evapotranspiration intensity during autumn and winter the increased higher soil water content due to the dia may be less possible to decrease to the original level before the next rainfall event the increased antecedent soil moisture is the most direct result of the accumulated impacts by dia this is the point that event based analysis ignores which can lead to underestimation of the design flood events pathiraja et al 2012 since initial soil moisture is an important factor affecting runoff generation the increased event based initial soil moisture may also contribute partly to the increasingly higher surface runoff with dir presented in subsection 3 1 besides based on the fact of large contribution area about 1 20 of rpa in urban storm water management the initial soil moisture of rpa under this condition may go through an evident increase comparing with the original level based on the modelling results though previous observations mostly came to the conclusion that antecedent soil moisture did not play a significant role in urban runoff miller and hess 2017 smith et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 more recent studies indicated the reverse one saadi et al 2020 investigated a large sample of events and catchments 852 in u s and found the antecedent soil moisture plays a significant role in urbanized catchments as in rural ones the study by fidal and kjeldsen 2020 demonstrated that linking soil moisture into modelling can improve its performance by 12 across 28 urban catchments in u k besides studies that focused on urban stormwater management also suggested the significance for higher initial saturation of lid facilities in weakening the effectiveness of runoff reduction jingming et al 2019 palla and gnecco 2015 based on the above discussions our simulations results can imply the importance of taking the potential increase of antecedent soil moisture into consideration of lid or sponge city designing especially during dry months with less evapotranspiration intensity and when rpa surface depression was applied however as far as we know imperviousness disconnection leading to higher antecedent soil moisture has seldom been mentioned in previous studies considering the lack of model validation this novel result may still need further research from the perspective of on ground investigations in the region for example just like the study by alizadehtazi et al 2020 hydrological monitoring works could be settled at several lid facilities with varied contributing areas antecedent soil moistures thus could be extracted and compared which has not been included in the work by alizadehtazi et al 2020 3 3 groundwater recharge relationships between annual total groundwater recharge and dir with varying rpa types were represented in figure 7 the lower soil hydraulic conductivity results in generally less groundwater recharge as expected the trends of the relationship between groundwater recharge and dir are quite different among varying rpa types for the c cl type the total groundwater recharge decreases constantly with the expanding of impervious surface as well as the shrunk of pervious area for infiltration however for the other four rpa types turning points of dir are found in the recharge dir relationships to be specific the groundwater recharge rises slowly with dir firstly when dir is below the turning point but decreases sharply latter with dir when dir has exceeded this point this resulted in a maximum increase of 26 0 in the annual groundwater recharge for the n cl type and 42 5 32 6 61 4 for the n scl d cl 10 d cl 30 types respectively due to the expanded disconnected impervious surface this also make it possible to maintain the groundwater recharge in the street block to stay at the pre development level even under a highly developed condition with dir ranging from 0 8 to 0 9 comparing the d cl 10 and the d cl 30 with the n cl type the additional depressed handling of rpa has led to an evident increase of groundwater recharge by an average extent of 32 9 and 73 2 respectively which makes the total recharge volume can be even similar to the n scl type who has much larger soil conductivity on the contrary by comparing the results for the n cl and the c cl types the soil compaction has been found to dramatically decrease the groundwater recharge with an extent of 56 6 even when dir is zero in fact as discussed in the results of soil water content the disconnected imperviousness caused additional runoff supply for infiltration at the pervious area comparing to the original condition with no impervious area covering this promotes development of stronger and deeper penetrating wetting fronts that escape the influence of the root zone and thereby may increase groundwater recharge stephens et al 2012 voter and loheide 2018 it is actually how the impacts of dia on groundwater recharge accumulates to sum up the increase of dir reduced the pervious area for infiltration and groundwater recharge on the one hand and on the other hand facilitated the concentrated infiltration and deep drainage the effects of the concentrated infiltration seem to be so strong that they can eliminate the effects of the shrunk pervious area when dir is at a low level however for the c cl type rpa the concentrated infiltration is limited by the low soil conductivity which leads to the major role of the shrunk infiltration area in affecting the recharge and therefore constantly decreased groundwater recharge with dir with the continuous increase of dir the shrunk pervious area limits the space where the concentrated infiltration can take effects on the recharge at the same time this explains the reducing trend of the recharge when dir exceeds the turning point in the recharge dir relationship figure 7 it should be noticed that these results may be bounded to the regional characteristic we consider in our modelling design the modelling domain has a very shallow groundwater table and also a shallow plant root depth these result in infiltrated water easy to escape the influence of root zone and easy to reach the groundwater table which may amplify the effects of concentrated infiltration on groundwater recharge the groundwater recharge in semi arid or arid region with deeper groundwater table deeper plant root and smaller rainfall may follow a totally different tendency with dia how the dia affects groundwater recharge in semi arid or arid region requires further investigation overall the simulation results reveal potential groundwater recharge enhancement by urban impervious surface developed in disconnected ways and this enhancement can be further improved by soil infiltration retrofit and surface depression handling of rpa consistent with our results several studies have also reported urban recharge enhancement attributed to concentrated infiltration in lid facilities or recharge basins ku et al 1992 calculated groundwater recharge of nassau county new york with the method of water budget calculation it was found that annual recharge can increase about 12 percent due to urban imperviousness but with the assumption that runoff generated on the impervious surface all be infiltrated by recharge basins mooers et al 2018 modelled groundwater with modflow in a small catchment 11 7 ha in halifax nova scotia canada with simple calculation of net infiltration and evapotranspiration using pcswmm at the same time it was predicted that urban development with lid facilities could restore predevelopment aquifer recharge conditions besides stephens et al 2012 also modelled groundwater using modflow in a 34 ha small urban catchment with four retention ponds in new mexico while modelling of surface runoff process was not included and infiltration from retention ponds was determined by validation as a result they found that lid practices had promoted recharge relative to predevelopment condition similar with our modelling methods bhaskar et al 2015 simulated fully distributed and coupled surface subsurface runoff in baltimore metropolitan area 13216 km2 using parflow with a horizontal resolution of 500 m due to the coarse model resolution they have not especially considered scenarios of applying lid practices for impervious surface disconnecting and thus the concentrated infiltration however this coarse resolution did not allow them to include urban pipe drainage on the other hand this indeed made the imperviousness that was not adjacent to streams all be dia in their study in the end their results indicate slight higher subsurface storage for urbanized scenario than predevelopment scenario on the contrary some studies have reported observations of decreased groundwater recharge or base flow with urban development instead hardison et al 2009 konrad et al 2005 rose and peters 2001 several modelling studies that used lumped method for runoff generation calculation e g scs model also came to the conclusion of declined recharge with urban imperviousness expanding erickson and stefan 2009 wang et al 2021a a potential factor that caused the difference of our results and these studies could be due to the varying of meteorological and hydrogeological conditions however a more important factor should be the absence of the concentrated infiltration in these studies for example in the above mentioned observation studies hardison et al 2009 compared stream base flow of several rural small impervious area and urban large impervious area catchments however the impervious area in the urban catchments they investigated was well connected to urban drainage under which condition the runoff generated from the imperviousness directly flows to streams but not to pervious surface for infiltration for the same reason the modelling studies by erickson and stefan 2009 and wang et al 2021a using scs model for runoff generation calculation also ignored spatial distribution of imperviousness and further the effects of the concentrated infiltration nevertheless one exception is the research by minnig et al 2018 who concluded enhanced recharge with urban development by applying scs and water budget method for calculation of groundwater recharge in dübendorf switerland based on their results the decrease of evapotranspiration is larger than the increase of surface runoff when urban developed which led to higher infiltration and recharge though generated from lumped model that ignores the concentrated infiltration their results of water budget indeed contained consistent theory with ours that is infiltration increased while evapotranspiration decreased during urbanization which means more infiltrated water escaped the effects of root zone this is exactly what happened with the concentrated infiltration as has been discussed above 3 4 evapotranspiration the total evapotranspiration for the whole rpa dia system was represented in figure 8 a the results show that with the increase of dir evapotranspiration declines generally linearly for all the rpa types this can be explained by the fact of shrunk pervious area where evapotranspiration mainly occurs fang et al 2020 mazrooei et al 2021 the c cl and scl have overall lower total evapotranspiration comparing to n cl because of the smaller density of plants and the faster soil water drainage to deeper layer respectively the data for rpa types with overall depressions d cl 10 and d cl 30 were not included in the figure since they were generally overlapped with the results for cl 5 28 maximum and 0 26 average difference this indeed indicates little effects of ponding volume on total evapotranspiration however from an intuitive view the increased ponding volume should result in more water remained on the depression for evaporation with the rate of potential evapotranspiration the total evapotranspiration thereby should be larger for rpa types with larger ponding volume the counter intuitive results we guess should be caused by two aspects of reasons firstly when the rpa dia ratio is large and surface ponding occurs not much frequently the effects of the ponding on evaporation may can be neglected in the annual time scale secondly when the rpa dia ratio gets so large that surface ponding frequently occurs the effects from the ponding in the whole rpa dia system may be rather limited by the small area of rpa to explore how the altered soil moisture induced by dia affects the evapotranspiration in rpa the soil plant evapotranspiration per unit rpa was extracted and presented in figure 8b evaporation from interception and surface ponding that has nothing to do with soil moisture is excluded from the results for most cases the results show slightly increasing trend of the evapotranspiration per unit rpa with dir this is due to the increased soil moisture led by the expanding of dia figure 5 similar results have also been reported from voter and loheide 2018 and shields and tague 2015 who found increased evapotranspiration by disconnecting imperviousness with vegetated pervious area exceptions exist for d cl 10 and d cl 30 whose soil plant evapotranspiration shows a decline trend with dir when dir exceeds a certain level this should be caused by frequently overall surface ponding that prevents evapotranspiration from soil and plant in other words the evaporation from free water surface for these two rpa types accounts for a greater proportion of total evapotranspiration than the other rpa types overall though expanded dia can lead to higher soil water content of the rpa which may further enhance plant and soil evapotranspiration this seems not enough to eliminate the effects of decreased pervious area according to our simulation work 3 5 the year spanning accumulated impacts the annual runoff groundwater recharge soil water content and evapotranspiration in the first year the second year and the third year were compared to explore the year spanning accumulated impacts the results show limited year spanning changes for most of the simulated hydrological elements including annual surface runoff annual average unsealed soil water content event based initial soil moisture except for the first rainfall event in each year and annual evapotranspiration the maximum difference between all these elements in the latter two simulation years and the first year is just 0 35 the only year spanning change that can be noticed is the groundwater recharge for the second year the annual groundwater recharge has been found to reduce by a maximum of 77 37 table 2 comparing to the first year besides the annual groundwater recharge in the third year is generally same with that in the second year nevertheless the recharge dir relationships for the latter two separating years still generally follow the trend in figure 7 the larger groundwater recharge at the first year should be originated from the gravitational water remained beneath the impervious covering since the initial soil water distribution is obtained from the results of multiyear simulation with totally pervious land surface in general it seems the accumulated impacts from dia have a quick response to meteorological conditions and stabilize in just one year indeed the cumulative character of the impacts by dia originated from the altered level of soil moisture led by the continuous events spanning concentrated infiltrations in rpa for the water content in shallow layer soil on whom the accumulated impacts on surface runoff and evapotranspiration rely it obviously has a quick response to infiltration relative to the annual time scale thereby the surface runoff and evapotranspiration are reasonable to behave limited year spanning changes when annual meteorological input is same the changeless annual groundwater recharge across years however may be due to the shallow water table in our rpa dia system the shallow water table as well as the thin vadose zone may cause the infiltrated water easier to reach the water table for drainage this make the overall saturation of the vadose zone and the groundwater recharge also response quickly to the concentrated infiltration relative to the annual time scale however for regions with thick vadose zone the lag time of deep drainage recharging groundwater may exceed even a century mcmahon et al 2006 scanlon et al 2010 the response of recharge to changes of external conditions like climate change can lag in time scale of years rossman et al 2014 therefore it is reasonable to think that regions with deeper groundwater table and root depth may have distinct year spanning accumulated impacts from dia and the accumulated impacts on vadose zone soil moisture as well as groundwater recharge may take years to stabilize further studies are still needed to investigate the long term accumulated impacts of dia on groundwater in regions with deep water tables 4 conclusion this paper focused on a representative urban rpa dia system and the impacts of dia on the hydrological processes inside was explored in addition to changes of impervious area five typical land use types of rpa were also considered continuous simulation using an integrated surface subsurface flow model was applied based on the empirical hydrological parameters following major results and conclusions were obtained both the annual total and event based surface runoff follow a generally power form relationship with dir for all the rpa types a concise and also meaningful formula was found to satisfactorily describe this relationship furthermore as the rpa dia system represents a most low impact condition of imperviousness distribution the runoff coefficient dir relationship can provide reference for the maximum urban impervious area allowed or the minimum pervious area needed to control the surface outflow below a certain level at street block scale it has also been found that rpa surface depression soil de compaction and infiltration retrofit all can significantly enhance the effectiveness of runoff reduction by disconnecting impervious surface disconnected impervious surface can lead to higher annual average soil water content of the rpa comparing to the pre developed condition and becomes more evident when dir gets larger though with the existence of evapotranspiration event based initial soil moistures are also observed to increase with dir and it is much more significant during dry months autumn and winter with less potential evapotranspiration intensity than during wet months spring and summer the results imply the importance to take the potential increased initial soil moisture of rpa and the corresponded increased runoff generation into consideration of storm water management when imperviousness disconnection is applied with the increase of dir the annual total groundwater recharge has a tendency to rise first and decrease later this tendency is strengthened by the higher soil conductivity and the larger surface ponding volume however for the compacted clay loam no increase of groundwater recharge can be observed due to its poor infiltration capacity at land surface the results prove the possibility of improving underground water resource storage or maintain the groundwater recharge to the pre developed level in the process of urban imperviousness expanding annual total evapotranspiration was found to generally linearly decrease with dir which suggest the area of pervious surface being the only major factor affecting the original evapotranspiration in the rpa dia system though the raised soil water content caused by imperviousness expanding enhances soil plant evapotranspiration per unit rpa this effect is too limited if comparing to the change of pervious area a limitation of this study is the lack of validation with on ground data and the parameters our model used were directly determined by empirical values or relevant literatures further studies based on the above conclusions are still needed from the perspective of on ground data analysis in urban rpa dia systems in the region especially those seldom be mentioned by previous studies e g impacts of dia on antecedent soil moisture also the accumulated impacts of dia on the hydrological processes in other semi arid or arid regions are another topic worth exploring distinct results may

rainfall depth and surface water depth at each node was applied as the neumann flux for the subsurface domain at unsaturated land surface nodes and was applied as dirichlet depth at saturated land surface nodes step2 infiltration was then calculated for unsaturated nodes the infiltration is exactly the water supply for saturated nodes infiltration was calculated by a1 f k h n h z where n h z refers to the gradient of soil water potential at the direction of the boundary normal step3 the infiltration and rainfall was then put into the shallow water equation for calculation of the water depth distribution at the end of this time step as the surface and subsurface domain may have different horizontal resolutions the infiltration calculated from the subsurface domain was linearly interpolated to fit the surface domain with finer horizontal resolutions see figure a1 as an example the results of step3 were put back to step1 for calculation of the next time step until total simulation time has come to the end time to judge a node was saturated or unsaturated in each time step the following iterations were applied step i give an initial list of saturated nodes and the rest nodes were thus unsaturated step ⅱ apply the neumann and dirichlet boundary to the land surface nodes as described in step1 step iii surface nodes with pressure head greater than zero in the results of step ⅱ were extracted to update the saturated nodes list step ⅳ the updated saturated nodes from step iii were then put to step i for iteration until the initial saturated nodes list was same with the updated saturated nodes list b model validation against laboratory rainfall simulation experiment the coupling model was validated with the data from two laboratory rainfall simulation experiments by abdul gillham 1984 and pappas et al 2008 the first experiment by abdul gillham 1984 consists in a plexiglas sandbox with 140 cm long 120 cm high and 8 cm wide the filling sand had a porosity of 0 34 a uniform slope of 12 and a manning surface roughness of 0 185 s m1 3 an outlet was located at a height of 74 m at which the initial water table was also assigned in the experiment a constant rainfall rate of 43 mm h was applied for 20 min the above settlement can result in strong interactions between surface flow and subsurface flow during rainfall which make the experiment suitable for validation of our integrated surface subsurface runoff model the saturated hydraulic conductivity was tested to be 3 5 10 5m s the soil hydrodynamic parameters were also obtained by fitting the vangenuchten model to the tested drying curve of the sand the specific values are α 2 4 m 1 n 5 note that the fitting values were borrowed from kollet maxwell 2006 who used the same experimental data for validation of their model parflow with the whole sand box being the simulation domain it is discretizated with a vertical resolution of 1 cm and a laterl resolution of 2 cm a constant time step of 10 s was used in our simulation our modelling results of outflow rate together with the measured data in the experiment were presented in fig b1 the results simulating the same experiment using integrated hydrology model inhm is also included in the figure note that the experimental measured data and the results of inhm are both extracted from kollet maxwell 2006 the second experiment we choose for model validation was conducted on a cascade of four sloped 5 soil boxes pappas et al 2008 each the soil box was 1 m long 60 cm wide the box was filled with silt loam and has a soil depth of 20 cm the saturated water content of the soil was 0 41 soil water was allowed to drain freely from the bottom of these boxes impervious covering could be applied on the box to transform the original soil surface s to impervious surface i three underlying scenarios were designed in this experiment impervious covering applied at the downslope two boxes ssii or at the upslope two boxes iiss or at no boxes ssss the rainfall was applied at 20 mm h for 48 min then 30 mm h for 24 min and 40 mm h for 24 min the initial average soil moisture was 0 22 in the model simulation the vertical and lateral discretization was 1 cm and 2 cm respectively and a constant time step of 10 s was applied as this experiment had not tested the saturation capillary pressure relationship of the soil we have firstly calibrated our model with the data of the ssss scenario by hand the calibrated hydrograph is presented in fig b2 a the calibrated parameters can be seen in table b 1 using the calibrated soil hydrodynamic parameters we then modelled the runoff of the ssii and the iiss scenarios the modelling results are shown in fig b3 overall the above validation results with the two laboratory experiments shows the efficiency of our model for simulating both surface subsurface runoff in pervious area and runoff in impervious pervious system c water balance errors for all the simulations

3466,soil moisture is a crucial component of the forest ecosystem because it primarily controls vegetation growth however the potential for predicting the subsurface from the surface soil moisture through de coupling in boreal larch forest larix gmenilii in china has rarely been investigated in the present study the regression and residual as well as cross correlation analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between the surface 5 cm and subsurface 10 20 and 40 cm as well as the profile soil moisture soil moisture in the larix gmenilii forest the applicability of the exponential filter expf and cumulative distribution function matching cdf methods for estimating the subsurface using the surface soil moisture in the study area and the impacts of de coupling on the simulation accuracy were assessed our results shown that the coupling between surface and subsurface soil moisture decreased with soil depth increasing and decoupling is dominant in the range varying between 0 11 and 0 22 cm3cm 3 the cdf method exhibits superiority for estimating the subsurface soil moisture relative to the expf method in the study area furthermore the surface soil moisture values in the coupling range capture the dynamics of the subsurface soil moisture while decoupling significantly reduces the accuracy of simulating the subsurface soil moisture thus we propose an approach involving the reconstruction of the coupling time series associated with the de coupling which improves the accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture simulation particularly at depth where the coupling is weak thus the de coupling effect should henceforth be incorporated in the future subsurface soil moisture simulation studies and is helpful to understand the hydrological process of soil improve regional models and the associated parameters keywords soil moisture decoupling effect coupling strength soil moisture estimation boreal forests 1 introduction soil moisture in forest region is considered to be a critical variable of eco hydrological processes which has significant influences on vegetation growth runoff modeling land atmosphere interactions as well as carbon and water cycle mohanty and skaggs 2001 jung et al 2010 brocca et al 2010 green et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 mallet et al 2020 in recent years however owing to the hydraulic vulnerability of boreal forest ecosystem is fragile and sensitive to climatic change peng et al 2011 soil moisture dynamics in boreal forest ecosystems are increasingly impacted by global warming and extreme weather events e g extreme precipitation and drought thus understanding soil moisture dynamics in boreal forest is valuable for related eco hydrological processes assessment under changing environment profile distribution of soil moisture is characterized by significant spatial heterogeneity and this complicates its characterization wang et al 2015 tian et al 2019 queiroz et al 2020 yetbarek and ojha 2020 in the previous studies the subsurface soil moisture is controlled by the surface soil moisture and the coupled between these two parameters at varying depths in some climate conditions and landforms characteristics has been investigated albergel et al 2008 kumar et al 2009 carranza et al 2018 tian et al 2020 for example mahmood and hubbard 2007 reported a decreasing correlation between the surface and subsurface soil moisture with increasing layer depth for different locations and land cover types in the great plains region in usa since the coupled between surface and subsurface soil moisture was characterized the simulation of the subsurface soil moisture using the surface soil moisture has recently been attracting tremendous interest albergel et al 2008 ford et al 2014 wang et al 2017 gao et al 2019 tian et al 2020 and a variety of methods for estimating subsurface soil moisture from surface soil moisture have been developed and employed albergel et al 2008 han et al 2013 manfreda et al 2014 gao et al 2019 however although these methods have been widely utilized limitations emerged because of differences in climatic conditions soil properties and vegetation types tian et al 2020 for example reported a better performance of the exponential filter expf relative to the cumulative distribution function cdf matching method in cold mountainous areas conversely gao et al 2019 stated lower uncertainty values for the cdf relative to the expf method based on studies involving varied environments in fact by literature review methods for simulating subsurface soil moisture from surface soil moisture in boreal forest regions using long term in situ soil moisture dataset have rarely been evaluated especially in china thus evaluating the performance of methods for estimating the subsurface soil moisture in boreal forest regions of china is of scientific significance through the above analysis it is recognized that the performance of an estimation method is closely related to coupling between the surface and subsurface soil moisture kumar et al 2009 tian et al 2020 for example carranza et al 2018 suggested that the accuracy of the simulation of subsurface soil moisture from surface soil moisture is significantly affected by vertical coupling because of its lower variability in the associated range also tian et al 2020 indicated that the applicability of different methods for estimating the subsurface soil moisture using the surface soil moisture decreases with increasing depth and this was attributed to decreasing coupling however the existence of decoupling between surface and subsurface soil moisture was highlighted by capehart and carlson 1997 and carranza et al 2018 as we know the decoupling between surface and subsurface soil moisture in boreal forest of china has rarely been investigated more importantly previous studies have not been assessed how decoupling affects the accuracy of subsurface soil moisture simulation which lead to a lack of important understanding of the relationship between surface and subsurface soil moisture thus investigating the decoupling between the surface and subsurface soil moisture and its influences on the accuracy of subsurface soil moisture simulation has improved the understanding of the potential prediction of the subsurface soil moisture from surface soil moisture in boreal forest of china in the present study the native larix gmelinii forest of china was selected which is located in the southern margin of the siberian zone one of the largest boreal forests associated with a wide permafrost in the world yang et al 2011 liu et al 2020 we utilized in situ soil moisture measurement data obtained from a larix gmelinii forest during the 2015 2020 growing seasons to investigate the relationship between the surface and the subsurface soil moisture the hypothesis of this study was that decoupling significantly reduced the accuracy of subsurface soil moisture simulation based on this hypothesis a scientific question was proposed that how to solve the accuracy decrease of subsurface soil moisture simulation caused by decoupling thus the specific objectives of the present study were as follows 1 identifying the de coupling between the surface and the subsurface soil moisture in a larix gmelinii forest 2 to evaluation the performance of the cdf and expf methods for estimating the subsurface soil moisture in the study area 3 to evaluate the impact of the de coupling on the accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture simulation and 4 to propose an approach incorporating de coupling to improve the accuracy of simulating the subsurface soil moisture these can be exploited to understand the hydrological process of soil enhance regional models and correct parameters involved in the subsurface soil moisture simulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the present study was conducted in the mohe ecological research station 53 27 59 n 122 20 06 e which represents a high latitude boreal forest along with the permafrost in china fig 1 a the area is characterized by a typical cold temperate continental monsoon climate and the annual mean temperature between 1959 and 2017 was 5 5 c the annual mean precipitation during this period was 460 8 mm and more than 70 of the precipitation occurred during the growing season which lasts from june to september liu et al 2020 the natural forest is dominated by the larix gmelinii which represents the principal community of forest ecosystems in the study site fig 1c the main soil type in the study area is the gleyic cambisols fig 1b https www fao org soils portal soil survey soil maps and databases the soil properties and root distribution of the larix gmelinii forest was following as table 1 2 2 data collection in the present study daily soil moisture data from 2015 to 2020 were obtained from the gradient meteorological observation system which was installed in the study area in november 2014 meanwhile precipitation was measured at an altitude of 23 m above the ground level using a te525 unheated tipping bucket rain gauge campbell scientific logan usa and the data were saved at 30 min intervals using a cr3000 datalogger campbell scientific logan usa considering the soil thickness the soil moisture was measured using four cs650 probes campbell scientific logan usa at depths of 5 layer 1 10 layer 2 20 layer 3 and 40 cm layer 4 below the ground level and the data were saved at 30 min intervals using the cr3000 datalogger campbell scientific logan usa the profile soil moisture profile which refers to the soil moisture covering the depth range between 0 and 40 cm was calculated as follows gao et al 2019 1 î profile î 1 l 1 i 2 4 î i 1 î i 2 l i l where θprofile is the profile soil moisture cm3cm 3 θi at li i 1 2 3 and 4 represents the soil moisture contents at depths of 5 10 20 and 40 cm and l denotes the observation depth of the soil profile 40 cm considering that the soil in the area is frozen in the winter and the growth dynamics of larix gmelinii the present study period from june to september was conducted and defined as growing season which the soil layer is thawed and relatively active mahmood et al 2012 tian et al 2020 fig 2 exhibiting the daily soil moisture dynamics and the precipitation during growing seasons from 2015 to 2020 and the changes in soil moisture is closely related to precipitation events in the present study the surface soil moisture refers to moisture at a depth of 5 cm layer 1 while the subsurface soil moisture refers to moisture at 10 layer 2 20 layer 3 and 40 cm layer 4 as well as the soil profile profile to ensure the accuracy of soil moisture by cs650 probes the oven dry method was used to calibrate the measured data bittelli et al 2008 in study sample plot the gravimetrical soil moistures at 5 10 20 and 40 cm was measured by oven dry method 105 c until a constant weight from jun to sep in 2018 and 2019 once a month then the soil volumetric moisture was calculated by multiplying soil bulk density and gravimetrical soil moisture the calibrated result is shown in fig 3 and the coefficients of determination r2 reached the 0 95 which indicates the soil moisture measured by cs650 probes was accurately 2 3 cross correlation analysis in the previous studies the cross correlation analysis has been widely employed for characterization of the lagged relationship between the surface and the subsurface soil moisture albergel et al 2008 mahmood et al 2012 ford et al 2014 gao et al 2019 the maximum cross correlation coefficients and the lag times were calculated to highlight the strength of the coupling between the surface and subsurface soil moisture a high cross correlation coefficient indicates a strong coupling relationship which indicates a strong potential for predicting the subsurface from the surface soil moisture and vice versa ford et al 2014 tian et al 2020 similarly in the present study the cross correlation analysis was employed to investigate the coupling strengths between the surface soil moisture at a depth of 5 cm layer 1 and the subsurface soil moisture at depths of 10 layer 2 20 layer 3 and 40 cm layer 4 as well as the soil profile profile 0 40 cm 2 4 regression and residual analysis according to the previous studies the spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture exhibits significant variation with the soil depth jia et al 2016 carranza et al 2018 zhang and huang 2021 carranza et al 2018 proposed a method for calculating the vertical variability in the surface and subsurface soil moisture across a soil moisture range first the conditional mean and the standard deviation were calculated for each 0 01 cm3cm 3 interval second a nonparametric locally weighted regression was selected to fit the relationship between the surface and the subsurface soil moisture and then residuals were calculated across the soil moisture range finally the cumulative residuals were analyzed for each 0 01 cm3cm 3 and the breakpoint of each cumulative residual line was identified the breakpoint separates the soil moisture range into two sections which represents the decoupling and the coupling ranges of the surface soil moisture a detail description of this approach was reported in carranza et al 2018 2 5 estimation of the subsurface from the surface soil moisture 2 5 1 cumulative distribution function matching cdf method the cdf is a simple and effective statistical approach that has been employed for estimating the subsurface soil moisture using the surface soil moisture in the previous studies gao et al 2019 tian et al 2020 in the present study this approach involved the following steps i the surface 5 cm and subsurface 10 20 and 40 cm soil moisture time series data were ranked according to the study period ii the difference δ between the surface and the subsurface soil moisture was calculated as follows 2 δ θ s θ sf where θs refers to surface soil moisture 5 cm and θsf denotes the subsurface soil moisture 10 20 and 40 cm iii next a third order polynomial was used to show the relationship between δ and θs gao et al 2019 and this was expressed as follows 3 δ p a b θ s 3 c θ s 2 d θ s where δp is the predicted difference between the surface and subsurface soil moisture while a b c and d are parameters iv finally the subsurface soil moisture was calculated using the cdf as follows 4 θ cdf θ s δ p where θcdf is the predicted subsurface soil moisture 2 5 2 exponential filter method expf the expf involves a semi empirical approach in which a recursive exponential filter is exploited to predict the subsurface soil moisture based on the soil water index swi albergel et al 2008 the swi and recursive equation can be expressed as follows 5 swi i î i î i min î i max î i min 6 swi im t n swi im t n 1 k i t n ms i t n swi im t n 1 where θi is the soil moisture of the i layer and θi min and θi max are the minimum and maximum soil moisture contents of the time series of the i layer respectively the swi im t n and swi im t n 1 are the predicted subsurface soil water indexes at times tn and tn 1 for the i layer respectively and ms t n is the measured surface soil moisture at a time tn the parameter k t n which refers to the gain at the time tn can be calculated as follows 7 k t n k t n 1 k t n 1 e t n t n 1 t where k t n 1 is the gain at the time tn 1 and t represents the characteristic parameter of the timescale d which is determined using the maximum nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of each year fig a1 in the recursive equation swi m t 1 ms t 1 and k t 1 1 initially albergel et al 2008 gao et al 2019 also proposed a re scaled predicted swi equation 6 using the θi min and θi max in the original time series and this is expressed as follows 8 î i t swi im t n î i max î i min î i min where î i t is the predicted subsurface soil moisture of the i layer a detailed description of the expf method was provided in albergel et al 2008 and gao et al 2019 2 6 subsurface soil moisture estimation accuracy improvement using the de coupling effect in existing approaches exploiting the surface soil moisture for estimating the subsurface soil moisture the de coupling between both soil levels is neglected however several studies indicate that soil moisture is associated with decoupling and that it impacts the estimation accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture mahmood and hubbard 2007 ford et al 2014 carranza et al 2018 therefore in the present study a framework which exploits the de coupling effect to improve the estimation accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture from the surface soil moisture is proposed this framework fig 4 is briefly described as follows i the de coupled range of the soil moisture was determined as explained in section 2 3 ii the type of functions tested to arrive at the most suitable function and then fit the coupling data of the surface and subsurface soil moisture was determined and this can be expressed as follows 9 y coupled sub f x coupled sur where xcoupled sur is the surface soil moisture value in the coupled range and ycoupled sub refers to the corresponding subsurface soil moisture value e g layers 2 3 4 and profile iii the subsurface soil moisture values for layers 2 3 4 and the profile in the decoupled range were introduced into the inverse of the equation 9 and the corresponding coupled surface soil moisture values were derived iv new surface soil moisture times series data corresponding to layers 2 3 4 and the profile were generated by combining the measured value of surface soil moisture in the coupled range section 2 3 and the coupled surface soil moisture values derived from equation 9 then the subsurface soil moisture was estimated from new surface soil moisture times series data using the cdf and expf methods described in section 2 5 the framework schematically of calculation processes as shown in fig 4 2 7 statistical analysis the simulation results of subsurface soil moisture were evaluated by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and pearson correlation coefficient r the regression results were evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 all statistical analysis were performed using ibm spss 24 0 statistics software spss inc chicago il usa and figures were prepared with origin pro 2021 software origin lab inc northampton ma usa the significance level of all statistical analysis was 0 05 3 results 3 1 cross correlation analysis figure 5 shown that the mean cross correlation coefficients decreased from 0 88 to 0 71 from layer 2 to layer 4 correspondingly while the mean lag time increased from 0 08 to 0 43 days also the mean cross correlation coefficient and the lag time for layer 2 are similar to those of the profile furthermore the cross correlation coefficient of layer 2 and the profile are significantly higher than that of layer 4 p 0 010 and p 0 006 respectively these results indicate coupling strength between the surface and subsurface soil moisture decreases as the soil depth increases 3 2 identification of the de coupling range between the surface and subsurface soil moisture in fig 6 and fig a2 as the surface soil moisture increases vertical variability of the subsurface soil moisture layers 2 3 4 and profile increases and then decreases further fig 7 reveals that residuals variance occurred in all layers at a similar range of surface soil moisture and this is consistent with the vertical variability meanwhile the de coupling range of the surface soil moisture is clearly observed at the breakpoint of the cumulative residual variance fig 7 in particular surface soil moisture decoupling corresponds to the steep slope area with values between 0 11 and 0 22 cm3cm 3 while the other areas are associated with coupling these results demonstrated that the decoupling was occurred in the larix gmelinii forest and the decoupling range without significantly changing as the soil depth increases 3 3 performance of methods for simulating the subsurface from the surface soil moisture in fig 8 the mean nse for the cdf method is significantly higher p 0 05 than that for the expf method for all layers while the rmse for the cdf method is significantly lower p 0 05 as compared with expf method except in layer 4 also fig 9 suggests that the expf method underestimates the subsurface soil moisture in each layer during study period relative to the cdf method these results demonstrated that the cdf method is more suitable for estimating the subsurface from the surface soil moisture in our study area thus the cdf method was used to analyze the de coupling impact on the accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture estimation subsequently 3 4 relationship between the performance of the cdf method and de coupling in fig 10 both the cross correlation coefficient and the vertical variability exhibit strong linear relationships with the nse rmse and r p 0 01 these results demonstrated that the simulation accuracy of the cdf method is significantly impacted by the coupling strength and the vertical variability between the surface and subsurface soil moisture in addition in table 2 and fig 11 the r2 after the fitting of all estimated values vary between 0 645 and 0 916 however the r2 after fitting of the decoupling values between surface and subsurface soil moisture are 0 610 in contrast the r2 after fitting of the coupling values exceeded 0 912 which are closer to the soil moisture values measured in each soil layer these results demonstrated that decoupling significantly reduces the accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture simulation 3 5 improving estimation accuracy of subsurface soil moisture using de coupling effect according to the calculation procedure presented in section 2 6 the function was obtained using the coupled values between surface and subsurface soil moisture table 3 and fig a 3 the r2 values for all equations in table 3 exceed 0 8 and these highlight the reliability of the fitting equations thus based on equations 9 and 1 4 simulated time series for the subsurface soil moisture layers 2 3 4 and the profile through the de coupling were derived in fig 12 both the values for all estimates and decoupling obtained using the cdf method incorporating de coupling processes cdfcoupled are closer to the measured values than those from the conventional cdf method simulation particularly for layers 3 and 4 in addition the nse rmse and r in table 4 associated with the cdfcoupled method are better than those linked to the conventional cdf method for each layer for layer 4 specifically based on the cdfcoupled method the nse rmse and r of all estimated values and the decoupling values are 0 933 0 013 0 966 and 0 967 0 008 0 983 respectively which were significantly higher than the corresponding conventional cdf method values with 0 645 0 030 0 803 and 0 369 0 018 0 608 table 4 furthermore fig a 4 revealed that the estimation accuracy of the cdfcoupled method was also better than that the conventional cdf method in different hydrological years with rainfall of 195 7 329 8 and 383 3 mm measured in 2015 2020 and 2018 these results indicate that the incorporation of the de coupling associated with the soil moisture effectively improves the accuracy of estimating the subsurface from the surface soil moisture 4 discussion 4 1 assessment of de coupling between the surface and subsurface soil moisture according to the results the coupling strength decreases with increasing soil depth was quantified by cross correlation analysis and this is consistent with results from the previous studies wu et al 2002 mahmood and hubbard 2007 mahmood and hubbard 2007 demonstrated that correlations between the surface and second layer were higher for all land uses and these decreased significantly between the surface and third to fifth layers however it should be noted that the cross correlation analysis generally considers the lagged linear dependence between surface and subsurface soil moisture shumway and stoffer 2010 but they may not be varied linearly given also that decoupling occurs thus a flexible nonparametric locally weighted regression function recommended by carranza et al 2018 was selected to identify the decoupling based on this we found that the decoupling occurred in the range from 0 11 to 0 22 cm3cm 3 in the study area which is also consistent with the previous studies capehart and carlson 1997 hirschi et al 2014 carranza et al 2018 carranza et al 2018 for example reported a decoupled range between 0 08 and 0 39 cm3cm 3 for surface soil moisture from four sites and demonstrated that decoupling can occur at any soil moisture range and in any study area the de coupling between the surface and subsurface soil moisture is associated with many factors carranza et al 2018 with vegetation types soil properties and climate conditions representing the most influential ford et al 2014 carranza et al 2018 gao et al 2019 however in a study area soil and vegetation types are unlikely to change significantly during a short time thus the climate condition of the land surface vertical distribution of plant roots and soil profile properties is the likely major drivers of the de coupling as the soil depth increases the soil properties show the obviously different and result in the change of soil hydraulic conductivity yi et al 2013 li et al 2019 for instance yi et al 2013 indicated that soil hydraulic conductivity negative correlation with soil bulk density while positive correlation with porosity as shown in table 1 our results suggested that with the increase of soil depth the bulk density increases and porosity decreases in study plot and result in the vertical flow slower into deeper soil layers it is may be one of the reasons for the coupling strength reduction between surface and subsurface soil moisture on the other hand plant root distribution is closely related to soil moisture dynamics schymanski et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 plant roots can significantly change the soil structure such as soil porosity and bulk density through the growth mishra and sharma 2010 which can promote the rapid infiltration of rainfall and have hydraulic conductivity better zhang et al 2020 in our study site the fine roots of larix gmelinii mainly distributed in topsoil and decrease with soil depth increase table 1 which is consistent with the chu et al 2011 consequently leads to the reduction of infiltration and hydraulic conductivity of the subsoil and resulting in coupling strength decline besides owing to the vertical distribution of plant roots and soil profile properties the sensitivity of the subsurface soil moisture to precipitation and temperature is less than that of the surface soil moisture mahmood et al 2012 tian et al 2019 and subsequently leads to the reduced hydrological connectivity between the surface and the subsurface in the soil moisture response to precipitation decreases with increasing soil depth and thus the coupling between the surface and the subsurface soil moisture decreases while the lag time increases fig 5 further in fig 13 soil moisture decoupling is associated with extensive episodes involving 5 mm of rainfall according to some studies significant changes in the soil moisture can be attributed to rainfall exceeding 5 mm he et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 thus we infer that owing to the difference between the surface and subsurface soil moisture responses vertical variability in the moisture content of soils increases during rainfall as highlighted in fig 6 and this promotes the decoupling of soil moisture 4 2 effect of de coupling on the accuracy of simulating the subsurface soil moisture our results demonstrate that the cdf method is more suitable for estimating the subsurface from the surface soil moisture than the expf method in the study area however inconsistencies attributed to climate were reported in the performance of these methods in the previous studies gao et al 2019 tian et al 2020 tian et al 2020 for example reported that the expf method captures soil moisture dynamics better than the cdf and artificial neural network methods in cold mountainous areas in contrast gao et al 2019 reported low uncertainties for data obtained using the cdf method from stations in humid continental humid subtropical and semiarid regions and thereby confirmed that climate significantly influences the performance of this method previous studies indicated that the characteristic parameter t estimation is great important in the expf method tian et al 2020 albergel et al 2008 suggested that the estimation of characteristic parameter t influenced by soil bulk density clay and sand fraction the organic matter content and climate condition in study site precipitation regime temperature and wind speed thus the difference in performance observed between different methods may be attributed to climate soil and topography in different study site meanwhile our results demonstrate that the estimation performance of the methods utilized was related to the coupling between the surface and subsurface soil moisture fig 10 alternatively as the soil depth increases the coupling decreases thereby decreasing the performance of estimation methods a similarly result was obtained by mahmood and hubbard 2007 mahmood et al 2012 ford et al 2014 gao et al 2019 and tian et al 2020 kumar et al 2009 for example used four land surface models involving different coupling strengths to estimate the subsurface soil moisture and they reported that performance was strongly correlated to the coupling as discussed in section 4 1 the vertical distribution of plant root and soil profile properties associated with extensive episodes of precipitation event result in the coupling strength reduction and decoupling occurred between surface and subsurface soil moisture thus the accuracy of these methods for simulating the subsurface from the surface soil moisture was decreased with soil depth increase fig 9 further based on the analysis although the cdf method provided better estimates of the subsurface soil moisture from the surface soil moisture relative to the expf method for the study site decoupling significantly reduced the accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture simulation using the cdf method fig 11 according to carranza et al 2018 the accuracy of simulating the subsurface from the surface soil moisture can be significantly affected by vertical coupling because of the lower vertical variability in the coupled range therefore to resolving this issue a framework incorporating de coupling before the estimation of the subsurface soil moisture section 2 6 is proposed our results demonstrate that this framework improves the performance of the cdf method for each layer table 4 these finding reflect the importance of de coupling in estimating the subsurface soil moisture particularly for deep soil moisture which is weakly coupled to the surface soil moisture 4 3 implications for soil moisture estimation in recent years the utilization of the surface soil moisture for simulating the subsurface soil moisture has attracted significant attention particularly in association with remote sensing technology however most the previous studies neglected the impact of de coupling on the subsurface soil moisture estimation from the surface soil moisture and this accounts for the limited advances in soil moisture simulation the present study demonstrates that decoupling significantly reduces the accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture simulation therefore a framework which enables the reconstruction of the coupling time series between the surface and subsurface soil moisture to account for decoupling before estimating the subsurface soil moisture is proposed this framework effectively improved the performance of the cdf method for each layer importantly it is feasible and simple for applications of this framework in other study sites a critical step is to identify the de coupling range before simulating the subsurface soil moisture and reconstruct the surface soil moisture corresponding to subsurface soil moisture in different soil depth to eliminate the impact of decoupling between subsurface and surface soil moisture see section 2 6 therefore the de coupling must be considered when using the surface soil moisture to simulate the subsurface soil moisture this can be exploited to enhance regional models and correct parameters involved in the subsurface soil moisture simulation 5 uncertainty and limitations in the present study the relationship between the surface and subsurface soil moisture and the potential prediction of the latter from the former were investigated by incorporating de coupling however several limitations and uncertainties remain and these will be addressed in future studies first although the time series length is enough the scale was limited to a plot therefore the applicability of the proposed approach to a larger scale e g watershed or region is unclear second because of the single forest soil type and limited on measurement soil depth in the study area understanding of decoupling mechanisms associated with the soil moisture remains limited therefore larger scale studies associated with varied land use types and deeper soil depth are needed to enhance understanding of the relationship between the surface and subsurface soil moisture third the fitting functions utilized for the reconstruction of coupling time series in the study area were restricted in other study areas because of differences in the soil type vegetation and climate alternative functions will be required 6 conclusions in the present study we used de coupling to investigate the relationship between the surface and subsurface soil moisture and the potential of predicting the latter from the former in boreal larch forest in china according to the results although the overall performance of the cdf method was superior to that of the expf method for the larix gmelinii forest decoupling between the surface and the subsurface moisture was occurred and significantly limited accuracy of subsurface soil moisture simulation particularly for deep soil moisture in the study site thus we propose a framework for reconstructing the coupling time series to enhance the accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture simulation particularly for soil moisture at depths characterized by weak coupling therefore the de coupling between the surface and the subsurface soil moisture should be incorporated in the future subsurface soil moisture simulation studies and applications of the associated models this can be exploited to understand the hydrological process of soil enhance regional models and correct parameters involved in the subsurface soil moisture

3466,soil moisture is a crucial component of the forest ecosystem because it primarily controls vegetation growth however the potential for predicting the subsurface from the surface soil moisture through de coupling in boreal larch forest larix gmenilii in china has rarely been investigated in the present study the regression and residual as well as cross correlation analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between the surface 5 cm and subsurface 10 20 and 40 cm as well as the profile soil moisture soil moisture in the larix gmenilii forest the applicability of the exponential filter expf and cumulative distribution function matching cdf methods for estimating the subsurface using the surface soil moisture in the study area and the impacts of de coupling on the simulation accuracy were assessed our results shown that the coupling between surface and subsurface soil moisture decreased with soil depth increasing and decoupling is dominant in the range varying between 0 11 and 0 22 cm3cm 3 the cdf method exhibits superiority for estimating the subsurface soil moisture relative to the expf method in the study area furthermore the surface soil moisture values in the coupling range capture the dynamics of the subsurface soil moisture while decoupling significantly reduces the accuracy of simulating the subsurface soil moisture thus we propose an approach involving the reconstruction of the coupling time series associated with the de coupling which improves the accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture simulation particularly at depth where the coupling is weak thus the de coupling effect should henceforth be incorporated in the future subsurface soil moisture simulation studies and is helpful to understand the hydrological process of soil improve regional models and the associated parameters keywords soil moisture decoupling effect coupling strength soil moisture estimation boreal forests 1 introduction soil moisture in forest region is considered to be a critical variable of eco hydrological processes which has significant influences on vegetation growth runoff modeling land atmosphere interactions as well as carbon and water cycle mohanty and skaggs 2001 jung et al 2010 brocca et al 2010 green et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 mallet et al 2020 in recent years however owing to the hydraulic vulnerability of boreal forest ecosystem is fragile and sensitive to climatic change peng et al 2011 soil moisture dynamics in boreal forest ecosystems are increasingly impacted by global warming and extreme weather events e g extreme precipitation and drought thus understanding soil moisture dynamics in boreal forest is valuable for related eco hydrological processes assessment under changing environment profile distribution of soil moisture is characterized by significant spatial heterogeneity and this complicates its characterization wang et al 2015 tian et al 2019 queiroz et al 2020 yetbarek and ojha 2020 in the previous studies the subsurface soil moisture is controlled by the surface soil moisture and the coupled between these two parameters at varying depths in some climate conditions and landforms characteristics has been investigated albergel et al 2008 kumar et al 2009 carranza et al 2018 tian et al 2020 for example mahmood and hubbard 2007 reported a decreasing correlation between the surface and subsurface soil moisture with increasing layer depth for different locations and land cover types in the great plains region in usa since the coupled between surface and subsurface soil moisture was characterized the simulation of the subsurface soil moisture using the surface soil moisture has recently been attracting tremendous interest albergel et al 2008 ford et al 2014 wang et al 2017 gao et al 2019 tian et al 2020 and a variety of methods for estimating subsurface soil moisture from surface soil moisture have been developed and employed albergel et al 2008 han et al 2013 manfreda et al 2014 gao et al 2019 however although these methods have been widely utilized limitations emerged because of differences in climatic conditions soil properties and vegetation types tian et al 2020 for example reported a better performance of the exponential filter expf relative to the cumulative distribution function cdf matching method in cold mountainous areas conversely gao et al 2019 stated lower uncertainty values for the cdf relative to the expf method based on studies involving varied environments in fact by literature review methods for simulating subsurface soil moisture from surface soil moisture in boreal forest regions using long term in situ soil moisture dataset have rarely been evaluated especially in china thus evaluating the performance of methods for estimating the subsurface soil moisture in boreal forest regions of china is of scientific significance through the above analysis it is recognized that the performance of an estimation method is closely related to coupling between the surface and subsurface soil moisture kumar et al 2009 tian et al 2020 for example carranza et al 2018 suggested that the accuracy of the simulation of subsurface soil moisture from surface soil moisture is significantly affected by vertical coupling because of its lower variability in the associated range also tian et al 2020 indicated that the applicability of different methods for estimating the subsurface soil moisture using the surface soil moisture decreases with increasing depth and this was attributed to decreasing coupling however the existence of decoupling between surface and subsurface soil moisture was highlighted by capehart and carlson 1997 and carranza et al 2018 as we know the decoupling between surface and subsurface soil moisture in boreal forest of china has rarely been investigated more importantly previous studies have not been assessed how decoupling affects the accuracy of subsurface soil moisture simulation which lead to a lack of important understanding of the relationship between surface and subsurface soil moisture thus investigating the decoupling between the surface and subsurface soil moisture and its influences on the accuracy of subsurface soil moisture simulation has improved the understanding of the potential prediction of the subsurface soil moisture from surface soil moisture in boreal forest of china in the present study the native larix gmelinii forest of china was selected which is located in the southern margin of the siberian zone one of the largest boreal forests associated with a wide permafrost in the world yang et al 2011 liu et al 2020 we utilized in situ soil moisture measurement data obtained from a larix gmelinii forest during the 2015 2020 growing seasons to investigate the relationship between the surface and the subsurface soil moisture the hypothesis of this study was that decoupling significantly reduced the accuracy of subsurface soil moisture simulation based on this hypothesis a scientific question was proposed that how to solve the accuracy decrease of subsurface soil moisture simulation caused by decoupling thus the specific objectives of the present study were as follows 1 identifying the de coupling between the surface and the subsurface soil moisture in a larix gmelinii forest 2 to evaluation the performance of the cdf and expf methods for estimating the subsurface soil moisture in the study area 3 to evaluate the impact of the de coupling on the accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture simulation and 4 to propose an approach incorporating de coupling to improve the accuracy of simulating the subsurface soil moisture these can be exploited to understand the hydrological process of soil enhance regional models and correct parameters involved in the subsurface soil moisture simulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the present study was conducted in the mohe ecological research station 53 27 59 n 122 20 06 e which represents a high latitude boreal forest along with the permafrost in china fig 1 a the area is characterized by a typical cold temperate continental monsoon climate and the annual mean temperature between 1959 and 2017 was 5 5 c the annual mean precipitation during this period was 460 8 mm and more than 70 of the precipitation occurred during the growing season which lasts from june to september liu et al 2020 the natural forest is dominated by the larix gmelinii which represents the principal community of forest ecosystems in the study site fig 1c the main soil type in the study area is the gleyic cambisols fig 1b https www fao org soils portal soil survey soil maps and databases the soil properties and root distribution of the larix gmelinii forest was following as table 1 2 2 data collection in the present study daily soil moisture data from 2015 to 2020 were obtained from the gradient meteorological observation system which was installed in the study area in november 2014 meanwhile precipitation was measured at an altitude of 23 m above the ground level using a te525 unheated tipping bucket rain gauge campbell scientific logan usa and the data were saved at 30 min intervals using a cr3000 datalogger campbell scientific logan usa considering the soil thickness the soil moisture was measured using four cs650 probes campbell scientific logan usa at depths of 5 layer 1 10 layer 2 20 layer 3 and 40 cm layer 4 below the ground level and the data were saved at 30 min intervals using the cr3000 datalogger campbell scientific logan usa the profile soil moisture profile which refers to the soil moisture covering the depth range between 0 and 40 cm was calculated as follows gao et al 2019 1 î profile î 1 l 1 i 2 4 î i 1 î i 2 l i l where θprofile is the profile soil moisture cm3cm 3 θi at li i 1 2 3 and 4 represents the soil moisture contents at depths of 5 10 20 and 40 cm and l denotes the observation depth of the soil profile 40 cm considering that the soil in the area is frozen in the winter and the growth dynamics of larix gmelinii the present study period from june to september was conducted and defined as growing season which the soil layer is thawed and relatively active mahmood et al 2012 tian et al 2020 fig 2 exhibiting the daily soil moisture dynamics and the precipitation during growing seasons from 2015 to 2020 and the changes in soil moisture is closely related to precipitation events in the present study the surface soil moisture refers to moisture at a depth of 5 cm layer 1 while the subsurface soil moisture refers to moisture at 10 layer 2 20 layer 3 and 40 cm layer 4 as well as the soil profile profile to ensure the accuracy of soil moisture by cs650 probes the oven dry method was used to calibrate the measured data bittelli et al 2008 in study sample plot the gravimetrical soil moistures at 5 10 20 and 40 cm was measured by oven dry method 105 c until a constant weight from jun to sep in 2018 and 2019 once a month then the soil volumetric moisture was calculated by multiplying soil bulk density and gravimetrical soil moisture the calibrated result is shown in fig 3 and the coefficients of determination r2 reached the 0 95 which indicates the soil moisture measured by cs650 probes was accurately 2 3 cross correlation analysis in the previous studies the cross correlation analysis has been widely employed for characterization of the lagged relationship between the surface and the subsurface soil moisture albergel et al 2008 mahmood et al 2012 ford et al 2014 gao et al 2019 the maximum cross correlation coefficients and the lag times were calculated to highlight the strength of the coupling between the surface and subsurface soil moisture a high cross correlation coefficient indicates a strong coupling relationship which indicates a strong potential for predicting the subsurface from the surface soil moisture and vice versa ford et al 2014 tian et al 2020 similarly in the present study the cross correlation analysis was employed to investigate the coupling strengths between the surface soil moisture at a depth of 5 cm layer 1 and the subsurface soil moisture at depths of 10 layer 2 20 layer 3 and 40 cm layer 4 as well as the soil profile profile 0 40 cm 2 4 regression and residual analysis according to the previous studies the spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture exhibits significant variation with the soil depth jia et al 2016 carranza et al 2018 zhang and huang 2021 carranza et al 2018 proposed a method for calculating the vertical variability in the surface and subsurface soil moisture across a soil moisture range first the conditional mean and the standard deviation were calculated for each 0 01 cm3cm 3 interval second a nonparametric locally weighted regression was selected to fit the relationship between the surface and the subsurface soil moisture and then residuals were calculated across the soil moisture range finally the cumulative residuals were analyzed for each 0 01 cm3cm 3 and the breakpoint of each cumulative residual line was identified the breakpoint separates the soil moisture range into two sections which represents the decoupling and the coupling ranges of the surface soil moisture a detail description of this approach was reported in carranza et al 2018 2 5 estimation of the subsurface from the surface soil moisture 2 5 1 cumulative distribution function matching cdf method the cdf is a simple and effective statistical approach that has been employed for estimating the subsurface soil moisture using the surface soil moisture in the previous studies gao et al 2019 tian et al 2020 in the present study this approach involved the following steps i the surface 5 cm and subsurface 10 20 and 40 cm soil moisture time series data were ranked according to the study period ii the difference δ between the surface and the subsurface soil moisture was calculated as follows 2 δ θ s θ sf where θs refers to surface soil moisture 5 cm and θsf denotes the subsurface soil moisture 10 20 and 40 cm iii next a third order polynomial was used to show the relationship between δ and θs gao et al 2019 and this was expressed as follows 3 δ p a b θ s 3 c θ s 2 d θ s where δp is the predicted difference between the surface and subsurface soil moisture while a b c and d are parameters iv finally the subsurface soil moisture was calculated using the cdf as follows 4 θ cdf θ s δ p where θcdf is the predicted subsurface soil moisture 2 5 2 exponential filter method expf the expf involves a semi empirical approach in which a recursive exponential filter is exploited to predict the subsurface soil moisture based on the soil water index swi albergel et al 2008 the swi and recursive equation can be expressed as follows 5 swi i î i î i min î i max î i min 6 swi im t n swi im t n 1 k i t n ms i t n swi im t n 1 where θi is the soil moisture of the i layer and θi min and θi max are the minimum and maximum soil moisture contents of the time series of the i layer respectively the swi im t n and swi im t n 1 are the predicted subsurface soil water indexes at times tn and tn 1 for the i layer respectively and ms t n is the measured surface soil moisture at a time tn the parameter k t n which refers to the gain at the time tn can be calculated as follows 7 k t n k t n 1 k t n 1 e t n t n 1 t where k t n 1 is the gain at the time tn 1 and t represents the characteristic parameter of the timescale d which is determined using the maximum nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of each year fig a1 in the recursive equation swi m t 1 ms t 1 and k t 1 1 initially albergel et al 2008 gao et al 2019 also proposed a re scaled predicted swi equation 6 using the θi min and θi max in the original time series and this is expressed as follows 8 î i t swi im t n î i max î i min î i min where î i t is the predicted subsurface soil moisture of the i layer a detailed description of the expf method was provided in albergel et al 2008 and gao et al 2019 2 6 subsurface soil moisture estimation accuracy improvement using the de coupling effect in existing approaches exploiting the surface soil moisture for estimating the subsurface soil moisture the de coupling between both soil levels is neglected however several studies indicate that soil moisture is associated with decoupling and that it impacts the estimation accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture mahmood and hubbard 2007 ford et al 2014 carranza et al 2018 therefore in the present study a framework which exploits the de coupling effect to improve the estimation accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture from the surface soil moisture is proposed this framework fig 4 is briefly described as follows i the de coupled range of the soil moisture was determined as explained in section 2 3 ii the type of functions tested to arrive at the most suitable function and then fit the coupling data of the surface and subsurface soil moisture was determined and this can be expressed as follows 9 y coupled sub f x coupled sur where xcoupled sur is the surface soil moisture value in the coupled range and ycoupled sub refers to the corresponding subsurface soil moisture value e g layers 2 3 4 and profile iii the subsurface soil moisture values for layers 2 3 4 and the profile in the decoupled range were introduced into the inverse of the equation 9 and the corresponding coupled surface soil moisture values were derived iv new surface soil moisture times series data corresponding to layers 2 3 4 and the profile were generated by combining the measured value of surface soil moisture in the coupled range section 2 3 and the coupled surface soil moisture values derived from equation 9 then the subsurface soil moisture was estimated from new surface soil moisture times series data using the cdf and expf methods described in section 2 5 the framework schematically of calculation processes as shown in fig 4 2 7 statistical analysis the simulation results of subsurface soil moisture were evaluated by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and pearson correlation coefficient r the regression results were evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 all statistical analysis were performed using ibm spss 24 0 statistics software spss inc chicago il usa and figures were prepared with origin pro 2021 software origin lab inc northampton ma usa the significance level of all statistical analysis was 0 05 3 results 3 1 cross correlation analysis figure 5 shown that the mean cross correlation coefficients decreased from 0 88 to 0 71 from layer 2 to layer 4 correspondingly while the mean lag time increased from 0 08 to 0 43 days also the mean cross correlation coefficient and the lag time for layer 2 are similar to those of the profile furthermore the cross correlation coefficient of layer 2 and the profile are significantly higher than that of layer 4 p 0 010 and p 0 006 respectively these results indicate coupling strength between the surface and subsurface soil moisture decreases as the soil depth increases 3 2 identification of the de coupling range between the surface and subsurface soil moisture in fig 6 and fig a2 as the surface soil moisture increases vertical variability of the subsurface soil moisture layers 2 3 4 and profile increases and then decreases further fig 7 reveals that residuals variance occurred in all layers at a similar range of surface soil moisture and this is consistent with the vertical variability meanwhile the de coupling range of the surface soil moisture is clearly observed at the breakpoint of the cumulative residual variance fig 7 in particular surface soil moisture decoupling corresponds to the steep slope area with values between 0 11 and 0 22 cm3cm 3 while the other areas are associated with coupling these results demonstrated that the decoupling was occurred in the larix gmelinii forest and the decoupling range without significantly changing as the soil depth increases 3 3 performance of methods for simulating the subsurface from the surface soil moisture in fig 8 the mean nse for the cdf method is significantly higher p 0 05 than that for the expf method for all layers while the rmse for the cdf method is significantly lower p 0 05 as compared with expf method except in layer 4 also fig 9 suggests that the expf method underestimates the subsurface soil moisture in each layer during study period relative to the cdf method these results demonstrated that the cdf method is more suitable for estimating the subsurface from the surface soil moisture in our study area thus the cdf method was used to analyze the de coupling impact on the accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture estimation subsequently 3 4 relationship between the performance of the cdf method and de coupling in fig 10 both the cross correlation coefficient and the vertical variability exhibit strong linear relationships with the nse rmse and r p 0 01 these results demonstrated that the simulation accuracy of the cdf method is significantly impacted by the coupling strength and the vertical variability between the surface and subsurface soil moisture in addition in table 2 and fig 11 the r2 after the fitting of all estimated values vary between 0 645 and 0 916 however the r2 after fitting of the decoupling values between surface and subsurface soil moisture are 0 610 in contrast the r2 after fitting of the coupling values exceeded 0 912 which are closer to the soil moisture values measured in each soil layer these results demonstrated that decoupling significantly reduces the accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture simulation 3 5 improving estimation accuracy of subsurface soil moisture using de coupling effect according to the calculation procedure presented in section 2 6 the function was obtained using the coupled values between surface and subsurface soil moisture table 3 and fig a 3 the r2 values for all equations in table 3 exceed 0 8 and these highlight the reliability of the fitting equations thus based on equations 9 and 1 4 simulated time series for the subsurface soil moisture layers 2 3 4 and the profile through the de coupling were derived in fig 12 both the values for all estimates and decoupling obtained using the cdf method incorporating de coupling processes cdfcoupled are closer to the measured values than those from the conventional cdf method simulation particularly for layers 3 and 4 in addition the nse rmse and r in table 4 associated with the cdfcoupled method are better than those linked to the conventional cdf method for each layer for layer 4 specifically based on the cdfcoupled method the nse rmse and r of all estimated values and the decoupling values are 0 933 0 013 0 966 and 0 967 0 008 0 983 respectively which were significantly higher than the corresponding conventional cdf method values with 0 645 0 030 0 803 and 0 369 0 018 0 608 table 4 furthermore fig a 4 revealed that the estimation accuracy of the cdfcoupled method was also better than that the conventional cdf method in different hydrological years with rainfall of 195 7 329 8 and 383 3 mm measured in 2015 2020 and 2018 these results indicate that the incorporation of the de coupling associated with the soil moisture effectively improves the accuracy of estimating the subsurface from the surface soil moisture 4 discussion 4 1 assessment of de coupling between the surface and subsurface soil moisture according to the results the coupling strength decreases with increasing soil depth was quantified by cross correlation analysis and this is consistent with results from the previous studies wu et al 2002 mahmood and hubbard 2007 mahmood and hubbard 2007 demonstrated that correlations between the surface and second layer were higher for all land uses and these decreased significantly between the surface and third to fifth layers however it should be noted that the cross correlation analysis generally considers the lagged linear dependence between surface and subsurface soil moisture shumway and stoffer 2010 but they may not be varied linearly given also that decoupling occurs thus a flexible nonparametric locally weighted regression function recommended by carranza et al 2018 was selected to identify the decoupling based on this we found that the decoupling occurred in the range from 0 11 to 0 22 cm3cm 3 in the study area which is also consistent with the previous studies capehart and carlson 1997 hirschi et al 2014 carranza et al 2018 carranza et al 2018 for example reported a decoupled range between 0 08 and 0 39 cm3cm 3 for surface soil moisture from four sites and demonstrated that decoupling can occur at any soil moisture range and in any study area the de coupling between the surface and subsurface soil moisture is associated with many factors carranza et al 2018 with vegetation types soil properties and climate conditions representing the most influential ford et al 2014 carranza et al 2018 gao et al 2019 however in a study area soil and vegetation types are unlikely to change significantly during a short time thus the climate condition of the land surface vertical distribution of plant roots and soil profile properties is the likely major drivers of the de coupling as the soil depth increases the soil properties show the obviously different and result in the change of soil hydraulic conductivity yi et al 2013 li et al 2019 for instance yi et al 2013 indicated that soil hydraulic conductivity negative correlation with soil bulk density while positive correlation with porosity as shown in table 1 our results suggested that with the increase of soil depth the bulk density increases and porosity decreases in study plot and result in the vertical flow slower into deeper soil layers it is may be one of the reasons for the coupling strength reduction between surface and subsurface soil moisture on the other hand plant root distribution is closely related to soil moisture dynamics schymanski et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 plant roots can significantly change the soil structure such as soil porosity and bulk density through the growth mishra and sharma 2010 which can promote the rapid infiltration of rainfall and have hydraulic conductivity better zhang et al 2020 in our study site the fine roots of larix gmelinii mainly distributed in topsoil and decrease with soil depth increase table 1 which is consistent with the chu et al 2011 consequently leads to the reduction of infiltration and hydraulic conductivity of the subsoil and resulting in coupling strength decline besides owing to the vertical distribution of plant roots and soil profile properties the sensitivity of the subsurface soil moisture to precipitation and temperature is less than that of the surface soil moisture mahmood et al 2012 tian et al 2019 and subsequently leads to the reduced hydrological connectivity between the surface and the subsurface in the soil moisture response to precipitation decreases with increasing soil depth and thus the coupling between the surface and the subsurface soil moisture decreases while the lag time increases fig 5 further in fig 13 soil moisture decoupling is associated with extensive episodes involving 5 mm of rainfall according to some studies significant changes in the soil moisture can be attributed to rainfall exceeding 5 mm he et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 thus we infer that owing to the difference between the surface and subsurface soil moisture responses vertical variability in the moisture content of soils increases during rainfall as highlighted in fig 6 and this promotes the decoupling of soil moisture 4 2 effect of de coupling on the accuracy of simulating the subsurface soil moisture our results demonstrate that the cdf method is more suitable for estimating the subsurface from the surface soil moisture than the expf method in the study area however inconsistencies attributed to climate were reported in the performance of these methods in the previous studies gao et al 2019 tian et al 2020 tian et al 2020 for example reported that the expf method captures soil moisture dynamics better than the cdf and artificial neural network methods in cold mountainous areas in contrast gao et al 2019 reported low uncertainties for data obtained using the cdf method from stations in humid continental humid subtropical and semiarid regions and thereby confirmed that climate significantly influences the performance of this method previous studies indicated that the characteristic parameter t estimation is great important in the expf method tian et al 2020 albergel et al 2008 suggested that the estimation of characteristic parameter t influenced by soil bulk density clay and sand fraction the organic matter content and climate condition in study site precipitation regime temperature and wind speed thus the difference in performance observed between different methods may be attributed to climate soil and topography in different study site meanwhile our results demonstrate that the estimation performance of the methods utilized was related to the coupling between the surface and subsurface soil moisture fig 10 alternatively as the soil depth increases the coupling decreases thereby decreasing the performance of estimation methods a similarly result was obtained by mahmood and hubbard 2007 mahmood et al 2012 ford et al 2014 gao et al 2019 and tian et al 2020 kumar et al 2009 for example used four land surface models involving different coupling strengths to estimate the subsurface soil moisture and they reported that performance was strongly correlated to the coupling as discussed in section 4 1 the vertical distribution of plant root and soil profile properties associated with extensive episodes of precipitation event result in the coupling strength reduction and decoupling occurred between surface and subsurface soil moisture thus the accuracy of these methods for simulating the subsurface from the surface soil moisture was decreased with soil depth increase fig 9 further based on the analysis although the cdf method provided better estimates of the subsurface soil moisture from the surface soil moisture relative to the expf method for the study site decoupling significantly reduced the accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture simulation using the cdf method fig 11 according to carranza et al 2018 the accuracy of simulating the subsurface from the surface soil moisture can be significantly affected by vertical coupling because of the lower vertical variability in the coupled range therefore to resolving this issue a framework incorporating de coupling before the estimation of the subsurface soil moisture section 2 6 is proposed our results demonstrate that this framework improves the performance of the cdf method for each layer table 4 these finding reflect the importance of de coupling in estimating the subsurface soil moisture particularly for deep soil moisture which is weakly coupled to the surface soil moisture 4 3 implications for soil moisture estimation in recent years the utilization of the surface soil moisture for simulating the subsurface soil moisture has attracted significant attention particularly in association with remote sensing technology however most the previous studies neglected the impact of de coupling on the subsurface soil moisture estimation from the surface soil moisture and this accounts for the limited advances in soil moisture simulation the present study demonstrates that decoupling significantly reduces the accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture simulation therefore a framework which enables the reconstruction of the coupling time series between the surface and subsurface soil moisture to account for decoupling before estimating the subsurface soil moisture is proposed this framework effectively improved the performance of the cdf method for each layer importantly it is feasible and simple for applications of this framework in other study sites a critical step is to identify the de coupling range before simulating the subsurface soil moisture and reconstruct the surface soil moisture corresponding to subsurface soil moisture in different soil depth to eliminate the impact of decoupling between subsurface and surface soil moisture see section 2 6 therefore the de coupling must be considered when using the surface soil moisture to simulate the subsurface soil moisture this can be exploited to enhance regional models and correct parameters involved in the subsurface soil moisture simulation 5 uncertainty and limitations in the present study the relationship between the surface and subsurface soil moisture and the potential prediction of the latter from the former were investigated by incorporating de coupling however several limitations and uncertainties remain and these will be addressed in future studies first although the time series length is enough the scale was limited to a plot therefore the applicability of the proposed approach to a larger scale e g watershed or region is unclear second because of the single forest soil type and limited on measurement soil depth in the study area understanding of decoupling mechanisms associated with the soil moisture remains limited therefore larger scale studies associated with varied land use types and deeper soil depth are needed to enhance understanding of the relationship between the surface and subsurface soil moisture third the fitting functions utilized for the reconstruction of coupling time series in the study area were restricted in other study areas because of differences in the soil type vegetation and climate alternative functions will be required 6 conclusions in the present study we used de coupling to investigate the relationship between the surface and subsurface soil moisture and the potential of predicting the latter from the former in boreal larch forest in china according to the results although the overall performance of the cdf method was superior to that of the expf method for the larix gmelinii forest decoupling between the surface and the subsurface moisture was occurred and significantly limited accuracy of subsurface soil moisture simulation particularly for deep soil moisture in the study site thus we propose a framework for reconstructing the coupling time series to enhance the accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture simulation particularly for soil moisture at depths characterized by weak coupling therefore the de coupling between the surface and the subsurface soil moisture should be incorporated in the future subsurface soil moisture simulation studies and applications of the associated models this can be exploited to understand the hydrological process of soil enhance regional models and correct parameters involved in the subsurface soil moisture

different ecological characteristics despite similar land use throughout the corn belt region of the midwest sorenson et al 1999 in minnesota river basin mrb back in the 1970 s farmers tried to crop as much land as possible the basin is characterized by intensive row crop agriculture and the landscape has both surface and subsurface drainage to enhance crop yields magner and steffen 2000 li et al 2020 over time marginal riparian land failed to provide an economic return on investment mpca 2010 further due to changes in upland drainage and climate riparian zones were abandoned and weedy shrubs and trees took over many riparian corridors which had severely affected the aquatic biology stark and richards 2008 lenhart et al 2013 a small percent of the land was managed via the conservation reserve program but conscientious riparian management did not occur because economic margins tightened when the price of commodities fell down mpca 2020 for several decades government officials and practitioners have suggested that more water storage was required within the mrb to better manage water quantity and quality johnson et al 2009 this conclusion acknowledges the systematic loss of wetlands and water storage by advanced subsurface drainage technology magner and steffen 2000 lenhart et al 2012 in recent years government officials and practitioners have recognized the need for deliberate management of riparian corridors for meeting water quantity and quality goals in mrb lenhart et al 2010 mpca 2020 li et al 2020 the biophysical function and human use of a riparian zone are dependent on several factors including stream size position with respect to the river and landform type hills mountains plateaus canyons and valleys and vary significantly between headwater and sea quinn et al 2001 pinay et al 2018 for instance riparian zones play a significant role in contaminant attenuation and transport from the terrestrial to the aquatic in headwater streams draining into v shaped valleys quinn et al 2001 in lowland floodplains water from mainstem channels spills onto terrestrial land during floods it has been found that the significance of riparian zones relative to a particular riparian function for human use is dependent on the interpretation of their structure composition and other function specific characteristics abernathy and rutherford 2000 lind et al 2019 for instance the ability of riparian vegetation to strengthen the stream bank through tree roots decreases as the bank depth exceeds the rooting depth krzeminska et al 2019 similarly the capacity of riparian vegetation to shade the stream channel decreases with an increase in channel width and the effectiveness of soil denitrification is dependent on riparian vegetation characteristics such as composition and structure liu et al 2008 renouf and harding 2015 tomer et al 2020a the dominant trees and shrubs comprise the foundation species that shape riparian zones composition structure and ecosystem functionality stella and bendix 2019 for example fish communities experience better living conditions in wooded riparian zones than those with more open canopy because of higher dissolved oxygen levels and good stream quality stauffer et al 2000 pusey and arthington 2003 lind et al 2019 riparian wetlands in mrb have significantly contributed to limiting nitrate fluxes in agricultural catchments hansen et al 2018 groh et al 2020 however the effectiveness of wetlands in controlling nitrogen fluxes is dependent on hydrological connectivity between hillslope riparian wetland and stream montreuil et al 2010 the biochemical capacity of stream for retention transfer and removal of nitrogen also depends on design of riparian corridors and seasonal variations pinay et al 2018 lee et al 2020 riparian buffers function as sinks for inorganic nitrogen especially nitrates by removing nitrogen from surface runoff groundwater plant uptake and microbial degradation in soil olokeogun et al 2020 johnes et al 2020 but the physical properties of riparian buffer such as width soil texture slope and vegetation biomass play a critical role in determining the nitrogen removal efficiency achieved lyu et al 2021 these studies collectively point to the dependence of riparian functionality on associated physical and stream characteristics the dynamic interactions of riparian zone functions and physical characteristics such as type of landform slope vegetation density and stream properties pose a challenge to managing riparian zones and placing bmps specific to a given watershed researchers have thus classified riparian zones into areas with homogeneous attributes such as vegetation height stream width riparian slope etc by accounting for the difference in riparian functions suggesting a better management approach delong and brusven 1991 quinn et al 2001 a class wise riparian zone classification based on desired riparian functions and stream characteristics has assisted conservationists in effectively planning riparian bmps gibling 2006 developed a valley classification system based on geology and rosgen 2008 also developed a valley classification and linked it to hydrology and stream geomorphology to classify streams meehan and o brien 2019 some studies have taken riparian vegetation and shore characteristics to classify riparian zones aided by spatial mapping using geographical information systems delong and brusven 1991 macfarlane et al 2017a tompalski et al 2017 tomer et al 2020a classified riparian zones using agricultural conservation planning framework acpf to delineate sites for using riparian buffer vegetation to protect stream bank interception of runoff and moderate groundwater nitrate in thirty watersheds of east central iowa these functions were achieved by classifying riparian settings of 250 m length based on height above the channel and upslope contributing area other researchers have classified riparian zones into areas with homogeneous physical attributes such as valley bottom cross section accounting for riparian function differences quinn et al 2001 a recent study by stutter et al 2021 provides a comprehensive review of the utility of spatial data for the delineation of riparian zones based on natural and human riparian functions this study explores the incorporation of bmps using spatial data to classify riparian delineation into three classes fixed width variable width by river corridor features and variable width due to local pressures or desired riparian functionality such classification allowed the study stutter et al 2021 to address natural functions like filtering overland flow and desired riparian functions for human use such as downstream flood control previous studies classification of riparian zones offers insight into the variety of riparian bmps and their dependence on riparian characteristics but a significant limitation of such studies is their inability to provide a comprehensive decision support framework dsf that can guide bmp selection by simultaneously considering the different classes viz stream features riparian characteristics desired riparian functions while dealing with uncertain and conflicting perceptions of multiple stakeholders towards the data concerning these classes such a dsf should mathematically account for the landowner s uncertain perceptions towards riparian classes required to guide bmp selection there is also variability and uncertainty involved in determining the relative importance of these classes while modeling the framework pan et al 2018 srinivas et al 2018 for example denser tree cover in the riparian zone indicates good stream quality and greater dissolved oxygen levels stark et al 2000 montreuil et al 2010 on the other hand thin tree cover promotes the growth of phytoplankton which helps maintain lower levels of nitrate concentration in water sebilo et al 2006 in such a situation conservationists need to adjust the amount of tree cover in a riparian zone based on conflicting functions of filtering overland flow and maintaining nitrogen levels the maintenance of adequate tree cover would require a specific set of management functions such challenges arouse a need for a robust mathematical modeling framework to guide conservationists towards adopting bmps for a given riparian function and human use corresponding to specific geography the modeling framework should integrate the conflicting viewpoints of stakeholders due to the uncertain nature of the riparian corridor characteristics and stream parameters to propose bmps which can perform the desired riparian functions one of the powerful ways to deal with uncertainty present in the decision support framework is to employ fuzzy logic techniques singh et al 2007 rehana and mujumdar 2009 srinivas et al 2017 fuzzy logic methods are not universally used by hydrologic practitioners thus we have provided a list of key terms and definitions in table 1 fuzzy logic provides a latitude to mathematically incorporate the differences in opinion of multiple stakeholders towards the relative importance of riparian classes by converting their linguistic responses to mathematical relationships using fuzzy membership functions qin 2012 the fuzzy membership function is a curve that expresses the uncertainty by mapping any mathematical input to a membership value between 0 and 1 srinivas et al 2015 the use of fuzzy logic techniques in watershed management has recently gained popularity zou et al 2013 srinivas et al 2020 wang et al 2014 used variable fuzzy set theory to perform fuzzy binary comparisons to evaluate the tseng wen river s water quality in taiwan xu and qin 2015 developed a superiority inferiority fuzzy sequential programming to assess the uncertainty for supporting water supply and demand analysis for tianjin binhai china minatour et al 2016 used a modified fuzzy analytical hierarchy process ahp with interval valued fuzzy sets ivfss for enhanced watershed management ahp is a multi criteria decision making tool used to rank the decision alternatives based on decision criteria and the project s overall goal srinivas et al 2018 ivfss are a modified form of traditional sets as the membership function of the ivfss is a fuzzy classification within the interval of 0 1 several researchers have employed fuzzy logic to delineate riparian zones schmitt et al 2014 weissteiner et al 2016 betz et al 2018 weissteiner et al 2016 coupled fuzzy logic with object based image analysis to identify observed potential and actual riparian zones based on a large open database including digital elevation models dem soils land use land cover data hydrology and vegetation indices betz et al 2018 have used fuzzy logic for delineating riparian zones in data scare regions by modeling the uncertainties associated with riparian zone boundaries the paper deals with uncertainty related to heterogenous riverscape along with the quality of the digital elevation data schmitt et al 2014 developed a fuzzy logic based framework for analyzing and classifying fluvial systems in data scarce environments using a characteristic fuzzy signature of hydro morphology drivers for each river reach despite wide applications of fuzzy techniques there has been limited research in developing a hybrid model coupling two advanced fuzzy based methods wherein conflicting views of stakeholders towards imprecise riparian corridor data can be addressed to support sound riparian bmps decisions moreover fuzzy logic has not been used to develop a comprehensive and flexible decision support framework to propose riparian bmps based on riparian stream characteristics and desired riparian functions this work develops a hybrid model by coupling a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process ahp with fuzzy inference systems fis the advantage of the hybrid model is its ability to allow the decision maker to prioritize critical criteria belonging to riparian categories to ensure maximum impact on the riparian bmp proposed by the model the primary aim of this work is to introduce a dsf hybrid model for guiding riparian bmp selection in minnesota river basin mrb the dsf was applied to three tributaries of minnesota river in particular the objectives of the study are as follows a identification of critical criteria belonging to riparian stream characteristics and riparian functions using fuzzy ahp b coupling fuzzy logic approaches ahp and inference systems to determine suitable riparian bmps based on critical criteria c developing a flexible and interactive decision support framework dsf to identify bmps in riparian zones of mrb and d validating the outcomes of dsf for three tributaries of minnesota river the application of the dsf in other geographic regions has also been discussed 2 methodology 2 1 study area and data the minnesota river basin mrb fig 1 drains nearly 20 of minnesota and some parts of iowa north dakota and south dakota the basin s estimated area is about 43 430 km2 in the united states and 92 of the land use in the basin accounts for agricultural activities li et al 2020 the basin area consists of twelve major hydrologic watersheds and thirteen management watersheds 85 of the mrb is occupied by the central lowland physiographic province which contains erosive loess soils delong 2005 characterized by shallow impoundments a series of locks and dams and river channelization structures that aid in commercial navigation between minneapolis and cairo the basin is known for its contribution to agricultural production commercial navigation and municipal water supply weitzell et al 2003 intensive row crop agriculture characterises majority of the basin with both surface and subsurface drainage to enhance crop production magner and steffen 2000 li et al 2020 previous studies in the region have indicated that aquatic biology is affected by the riparian cover and runoff potential zumberge et al 2003 stark and richards 2008 popular riparian management practices prevalent in the area include establishing grass buffer strips riparian revegetation riffles and the addition of boulders in this study we have developed the dsf hybrid model by studying the riparian characteristics of selected streams in the mrb based on research conducted by the elder author magner and steffen 2000 magner et al 2012 lenhart et al 2012 pierce 2020 model outcome validation occurs in three tributaries of the minnesota river with varying hydrologic unit code huc sizes the cottonwood river huc 8 elm creek huc 10 and seven mile creek huc 12 data and corresponding sources used for developing the dsf have been described in table s2 these data are analyzed by expert stakeholders table s3 and their responses are procured with the help of survey questionnaire table s4 all experts are professionals with vast experience of working with agencies like minnesota pollution control board mpca their responses are processed in hybrid fuzzy logic model 2 2 methodological overview the study develops a fuzzy logic based hybridized decision support framework dsf fig 2 which has two components namely fuzzy ahp and fuzzy inference system fis fuzzy ahp ranks different criteria sub categories of riparian class based on their assessed relevance to the problem statement since individuals could have varying assessments regarding the most significant criteria fuzzy ahp helps mitigate uncertainty related to decision making by ranking assessment criteria based on pairwise comparison srinivas et al 2018 the application of fuzzy ahp has been discussed in detail in section 2 4 1 fuzzy inference system fis is a mathematical decision making framework that employs if then rules connected with logical operators or and and to obtain fuzzy scores corresponding to recommended outputs srinivas et al 2017 the application of the fis framework for recommending bmps has been explained at length in section 2 4 2 the survey questionnaire and list of experts have been provided in tables s3 and s4 respectively three classes of inputs namely stream characteristics riparian characteristics natural riparian functions and human use are considered for delineating suitable bmps firstly based on available data and expert opinion fuzzy analytical hierarchical process ahp has been employed for pairwise comparison of criteria belonging to each of these classes and relative significance of individual criteria would be obtained in the form of weights this process of pairwise comparison of criteria to obtain fuzzy weights has been demonstrated in step 2 of fig 2 the criteria obtaining the highest weights are considered critical these critical criteria serve as inputs to fis in the second component of dsf critical criteria are assessed using fis to obtain suitable bmps along with a score indicating their degree of effectiveness although the dsf was developed for the mrb it applies to any geographic location while applying the proposed dsf to new watershed the user would be required to rank the input physical characteristics and desired riparian use considering the watershed management goals then fuzzy ahp would delineate the critical criteria and fis would recommend suitable riparian bmps the implementation of dsf in other regions has been discussed in detail in section 4 3 2 3 riparian classes and sub categories as emphasized earlier it is essential to classify riparian corridors into areas of homogenous physical characteristics vegetation height stream width riparian slope etc for proper delineation of riparian bmps the riparian bmps also depend on desired functionality of the riparian corridor which depends on their physical characteristics thus the study classifies riparian zones based on three classes stream characteristics riparian characteristics riparian function and human use table 2 represents the subcategories criteria corresponding to these classes as depicted in step 1 of fig 2 the sub categories under each class are obtained based on extensive literature review and form the criteria used for developing the dsf stream characteristics stream water quality significantly impacts the aquatic ecosystem and affects the utility of accompanying riparian zones the groundwater nitrate concentrations in mrb streams exceed the national median by a significant margin of 4 mg l mpca 2010 but the same mrb streams draining gravel deposits and surficial sand have lower nitrate concentrations than groundwater thus maintaining riverbed characteristics would be a suitable bmp in the riparian zone with a large bed material size to obtain the desired function of denitrification this study utilizes similar relationships among stream criteria and riparian functions to recommend suitable bmps riparian characteristics riparian characteristics are intricately linked to riparian functions for example a lower riparian slope would help downstream flood control while denser riparian vegetation shade streams also it has been noted that riparian zones with greater width of low lying land offer better opportunities for denitrification porter et al 2018 this study accounts for such dependencies of riparian functions on riparian characteristics which would aid in recommending appropriate bmps riparian function and human use riparian zones perform various natural biophysical functions like filtration of overland flow nutrient transport from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems etc but it is important to note that riparian zones are often employed for human use as recreational areas or agricultural purposes this study accounts for both types of utilities of riparian zones for adopting suitable bmps 2 4 hybridized riparian decision support framework considering the dynamics concerning classes and bmps we have proposed a dsf which is an amalgamation of two fuzzy based methods namely modified fuzzy ahp and fuzzy inference systems the responses of expert stakeholders obtained using survey questionnaire table s4 are the inputs to dsf based on the expert recommendation specific physical characteristics were selected for each class stream and riparian characteristics desired riparian function and use their weights were obtained by employing fuzzy ahp methodology then fuzzy logic rules were formed to represent the natural relationships among these classes and riparian bmps 2 4 1 fuzzy analytical hierarchy process in phase i the fuzzy ahp method uses fuzzy sets to compare criteria sub categories of each riparian class accommodating uncertainties associated with stakeholders viewpoints towards the datasets of riparian classes pairwise comparisons of criteria discussed in table 1 have been conducted using triangular membership functions triangular membership functions have been explained in section s2 of the supplementary material the detailed methodology of fuzzy ahp has been explained by srinivas et al 2018 for brevity the authors have provided only the significant steps as given below experts responses towards each criterion are used to perform the pairwise comparison and a fuzzy rating is assigned table s5 each element in the comparison matrix is of the form t ij a ij b ij c ij where all a ij b ij and c ij are elements of a triangular fuzzy number if n represents the number of criteria then the pairwise comparison matrix m ij can be represented in the form of equation 1 1 m ij 1 t 12 t 1 n 1 t 12 1 t 2 n 1 t 1 n 1 t 2 n 1 the geometric mean z i and fuzzy weights w i are determined for each criterion using equations 2 and 3 respectively as given below 2 z i j 1 n t ij 1 n 3 w i z i j 1 n z j 1 the fuzzy weights are defuzzified using the gravity centre method equation 4 to obtain crisp score x i where μ z is the membership function equation 4 x i μ z z d z μ z d z for a triangular membership function a ij b ij c ij equation 4 can be written in the form of equation 5 5 x i a ij b ij c ij 3 each criterion is ranked based on its defuzzified crisp score and only the best criteria are chosen for analysis using a fuzzy inference system this helps experts in including only the relevant criteria in phase ii to propose bmps 2 4 2 fuzzy inference system in phase ii critical criteria obtained using fuzzy ahp are analysed using matlab fuzzy inference system to determine the overall score of potential bmps srinivas et al 2017 have described the detailed methodology of fis for brevity only crucial steps are discussed in this section fuzzification by defining of membership functions critical criteria obtained from phase i are classified linguistically and assigned appropriate fuzzy membership functions mfs allowing the decision maker to develop the proposed framework the mf s shape could be triangular trapezoidal gaussian sigmoidal etc the mf was chosen based on how the expert stakeholders wish to quantify the uncertainty associated with the riparian classes data table s2 we have referred to scientific literature to select appropriate mfs srinivas et al 2017 2018 sadollah 2018 the input and output variables of the fis are listed in table s7 a total of twenty seven input variables have been broadly classified into stream characteristics riparian characteristics and riparian function and human use the fis output variable represents the suggested bmp a total of twenty eight bmps are considered to formulate fis rules table s7 gives the list of bmps along with their sources most of the input and output variables have been classified into three linguistic classes viz low l medium m and high h however a different membership function was adopted for certain input variables such as riparian width and stream width as they demonstrate more than three distinctive naturally occurring classes in such cases four linguistic classes viz very low l low l high h and very high vh are adopted fig 3 demonstrates some of the mfs used in this study triangular mfs are used to represent the linguistic classes low l and high h in contrast the linguistic class medium m has been represented using trapezoidal mf this is considered appropriate as the medium class represents a range of values which can be represented using a trapezoid similarly for the input characteristics of the stream and riparian width triangular mf represents the linguistic classes very high vh and very low vl in contrast trapezoidal membership function represents intermediate classes high h and low l developing expert fuzzy inference rules the relationships among inputs criteria and output variables are used to form fuzzy inference rules here the conflicting viewpoints of stakeholders play a crucial role rules are in the form of if then statements conjugated using fuzzy operators and or or the rules scientifically represent real life phenomena and satisfy available datasets mathematically the total number of rules possible for a given input equals r number of linguistic variables number of criteria suppose there are three linguistic classes i e low medium high and twenty seven input parameters then the total number of possible rules would be of the order 327 it is essential to realize that it would not be possible to form scientifically sound relationships for all combinations of input parameters therefore extensive research is required to arrive at the fuzzy rules in this study a total of forty two rules have been formulated for mrb assigning weights to fuzzy rules this is one of the novel features of this work where each rule has been assigned weights depending on the ranking of the input criteria obtained in phase ii in this manner prioritized criteria will have maximum impact on the output obtained using fis integration of rule outputs and defuzzification fis rules are executed in the fuzzy expert system the outputs of these rules are integrated to obtain an aggregated membership function then the defuzzification is performed using the gravity centre method to obtain suggested bmp and a defuzzified crisp score the bmp with the highest crisp score is recommended 2 5 development of decision support framework the fuzzy ahp method described in the earlier section has been applied to evaluate the importance weights of criteria under each of the three riparian classes once the relevant criteria are selected pairwise comparisons are performed for relevance in riparian zone utility and management using a fuzzy scale table s5 the pairwise comparisons among criteria are performed based on stakeholder s opinion as stated in step 2 of fig 2 for instance the criterion of bed material size was assigned a fuzzy scale rating of 1 1 3 when compared to percent macrophyte cover indicating that bed material size is almost equally important to the criterion of percent macrophyte cover when recommending bmps for riparian zones in mrb in an analogous manner pairwise comparisons are made for all combinations of criteria tables 3 and s6 represent the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix obtained for the criteria under stream characteristics s1 s5 and riparian function and human use rf1 rf10 respectively a similar matrix has been obtained for criteria under riparian characteristics as well using equations 4 5 final defuzzified weights are obtained for each criterion the stepwise methodology for obtaining defuzzified criteria weights has been explained in step 3 of fig 2 table 4 illustrates the weights obtained for the criteria for better understanding detailed calculations for obtaining weights of criteria under stream characteristics are given below based on expert ratings pairwise comparison matrix is obtained for stream characteristics table 3 using equation 1 for example relative comparison of s1 stream width and s2 bed material size is rated as 1 1 1 which means both are equally important according to linguistic meanings given in table s5 using fuzzy comparison matrix elements a geometric mean is calculated for each criterion for illustration the geometric mean gm of s1 is calculated using equation 2 as follows gm s 1 g m f w s 1 s 1 f w s 1 s 2 f w s 1 s 3 f w s 1 s 4 f w s 1 s 5 a b c g m s 1 g m 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 3 gm s 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 3 3 1 5 gm s 1 a b c 1 1 1 55 similarly the geometric mean of all criteria is calculated the obtained geometric means of other stream characteristics s2 s3 s4 and s5 are 1 1 1 55 1 1 1 55 0 52 1 1 and 0 52 1 1 respectively the sum of the geometric mean is calculated as given below g m 1 1 1 55 1 1 1 55 1 1 1 55 0 52 1 1 0 52 1 1 4 04 5 6 65 the reciprocal of the sum of the geometric mean is calculated as given below r e c i p r o c a l g m r e c i p r o c a l 4 04 5 6 65 0 15 0 2 0 25 final fuzzy weights fw of each criterion are calculated using equation 3 for example fuzzy weight of stream width s1 is calculated as fw s 1 g m s 1 r e c i p r o c a l g m fw s 1 1 1 1 55 0 15 0 2 0 25 f w s 1 0 15 0 2 0 3875 similarly fuzzy weights for all criteria are obtained fuzzy weights are defuzzified using the gravity centre method equation 4 and 5 to obtain crisp score x i defuzzifiedweight s 1 0 15 0 2 0 3875 3 defuzzifiedweight s 1 0 245 similarly defuzzified weights of s2 s3 s4 and s5 criterion are 0 245 0 245 0 175 and 0 175 respectively the sum of defuzzified weights is 1 085 the defuzzified weights of all criteria are normalized to obtain final defuzzified weights for example the weight for stream width s1 is obtained as follows f i n a l d e f u z z i f i e d w e i g h t s 2 0 245 1 085 0 225 similarly final defuzzified weights of other criteria are obtained table 4 all weights are obtained on the scale of 0 1 once the criteria weights are obtained using fuzzy ahp phase ii begins where membership functions are assigned to each criterion the criteria represent physical characteristics and functionality of riparian zones a total of forty two fuzzy logic inference rules have then been formulated table s1 based on literature survey and stakeholders input step 4 of fig 2 all the rules are fed into matlab 2021a fis toolbox and multiple scenarios are considered to develop the dsf hybrid model for mrb the system fires fuzzy rules to process the inputs the outputs of the rules are the bmps along with their score representing the degree of suitability the developed dsf consists of 28 recommended bmps table s7 3 results 3 1 best management practices obtained using decision support framework we have developed a decision support framework dsf using a fuzzy based hybrid model by assessing the riparian and stream characteristics of selected streams in the mrb based on research conducted by the elder author magner and steffen 2000 magner et al 2012 lenhart et al 2012 pierce 2020 table 5 shows the ten rules and corresponding weights obtained using the dsf for example rule 8 consists of three inputs stream width vegetation height and shade the criteria under stream and riparian characteristics are used to account for the physical characteristics of the riparian zone in contrast the criteria under riparian function and human use were used to represent the desired utility from the riparian zone the output consists of the category of best management practice as given below rule 8 if stream width is high and vegetation height is high and shade high is the desired function then riparian revegetation high is the bmp weights assigned to each rule are equivalent to the average weights obtained for the inputs in phase i involved in that rule for illustration rule 1 inputs are water clarity and filtering overland flow with fuzzy ahp weights of 0 225 and 0 165 the average of these two weights i e 0 195 is the weight assigned to rule one the objective is to accurately structure the rule to represent natural relationships among physical characteristics and utility to guide bmp selection table 6 illustrates the outcomes of fuzzy rules for one such case with fuzzy rule inputs and output values step 5 of fig 2 twelve rules consist of twelve inputs are executed with six outputs bmps as observed the bmp namely maintaining riverbed characteristics has attained the highest score of 8 12 followed by riparian revegetation with a score of 8 07 at the same time all other bmps obtain a score of 5 the bmps obtaining high scores can be explained through the physical characteristics of the riparian zone in consideration as shown in table 6 the normalized value of bed material size is 9 which gives a membership value of 0 75 using membership functions this value is indicative of the presence of large particles such as gravel and boulder in the basin one of the desired functions of the riparian zone is denitrification nitrogen control with a normalized input value of 8 which corresponds to a membership value of 0 5 in class high stark et al 2000 have shown that nitrate concentrations in rivers draining surficial sand and gravel deposits were low thus maintaining riverbed characteristics would be a suitable bmp in the riparian zone with a large bed material size to obtain the desired function of denitrification similarly the riparian zone having tall natural vegetation and long stream width with normalized input values of 7 yields membership values of 0 25 with membership class high vegetation with tall height is suitable for shading streams of larger width therefore bmp for ensuring shade to the stream is riparian revegetation hence a combination of the bmps with the highest scores i e riparian revegetation and maintaining riverbed characteristics would be most suitable for this riparian zone if enough resources are not available to implement a combination of bmps maintaining riverbed characteristics is an optimal solution 3 2 scenarios developed using dsf for cottonwood river elm creek and seven mile creek using the hybridized dsf we have developed scenarios table 7 representing different combinations of physical characteristics and desired riparian function and human use for the three tributaries cottonwood river elm creek and seven mile creek of the minnesota river these scenarios were used to obtain the suitable riparian bmp s and the score representing its degree of suitability on a scale of 0 10 fig 4 presents the distribution of suggested bmps for the tested scenarios in the three tributaries of mrb the prominent bmps are riparian revegetation buffer strips management of wetlands the addition of woody debris and increase in tree cover table 7 the dsf obtained riparian revegetation and buffer strips as the suggested bmp at 35 and 25 of the examined sites fig 4 whereas increase in tree cover is suggested bmp at 10 of the observed sites 4 discussion 4 1 improving riparian zone management in minnesota river basin using dsf the outcomes of dsf table 5 table 6 would play a significant role in improving riparian zone management in mrb urban agricultural and industrial land use are primary sources of water quality degradation in mrb in the release of organic compounds metal sediments and point and non point nutrient sources lee et al 2001 fang et al 2005 dalzell and mulla 2018 mckay et al 2019 gordon et al 2021 poor management of riparian zones reduces the fish population degrades streams and causes eutrophication in mrb stauffer et al 2000 mndnr 2016 the effect of nutrient discharge from intensive corn soybean agriculture on water quality and biotic communities was acknowledged by several state and federal programs in the us which started recommending bmps as early as the 1970s wang et al 2002 macfarlane et al 2017b antolini et al 2020 the prominent bmps in mrb obtained using dsf are riparian revegetation maintenance of riverbed characteristics buffer strips management of wetlands the addition of woody debris increase in tree cover table 5 these outcomes are also supported by previous studies conducted in the riparian zones of mrb streams rivers wan et al 2014 found that riparian buffer strips and wetlands have been instrumental in lowering nitrate delivery rates in mrb streams and recognized that mrb s geomorphology and soils are favourable for wetland restoration magner et al 2012 and mpca 2010 observed that the creation of ditches and subsurface tile drain pipes had attenuated mrb s upland hydraulic residence time resulting in ecologically poor water quality with increased nutrient and sediment losses from the catchment these studies recognized the importance of riparian zone buffer systems for trapping sediment phosphorus and nitrogen as suggested by the dsf in addition riparian vegetation could provide biological connectivity between the riparian zone and channel bed to buffer the influence of polluted runoff magner et al 2008 magner et al 2012 also recognized the role of riparian wetland management riparian revegetation and buffers in controlling sediment and nutrients in ditches and streams and minimizing the areal extent of flooding in mrb rule 14 17 25 of dsf table s1 recommend installing riparian buffers of varying widths to achieve denitrification riparian revegetation is the dominant activity for non navigated river water quality management projects in mrb magner et al 2012 when riparian vegetation is not managed weed species dominate and leave less than desirable vegetative sustainability out of the total river enhancement projects undertaken between 1972 and 2005 in mrb non navigated river regions 98 of water quality management projects aimed at riparian revegetation o donnell galat 2007 macfarlane et al 2017b stauffer et al 2000 investigated 24 streams in the minnesota river basin they found that streams with a woody riparian cover were more suitable habitats for fish communities than streams with an open canopy on considering riparian zones with high normalized input values of vegetation density wooded riparian zones riparian revegetation was recommended as the bmp when the desired riparian zone utility was fish spawning habitat cover in contrast when riparian zones with low vegetation density and open canopy vegetation were considered inputs to dsf the addition of woody debris seemed a suitable bmp for fish spawning habitat cover these results are well supported by previous studies dalzell and mulla 2018 gordon et al 2021 guyon et al 2016 demonstrate the essential role of forested floodplain ecosystems and high density wooded riparian zones in sustaining over 150 fish species and 45 species of amphibians and reptiles in the mrb brewer 2016 emphasized the significance of low density open canopy oak pine forests in supporting the plant and animal diversity of the riparian zones rule 9 and 10 in table 5 model this natural relationship between vegetation density the riparian function of fish habitat cover and required bmps high surface water nitrate concentrations occur tile drained agricultural areas in the us including the mrb usda nrcs 2005 wan et al 2014 water quality control through denitrification is a common goal of riparian zone management projects in mrb riparian zones with comprehensive low lying land influence groundwater quality through the presence of deep rooted vegetation which aids in denitrification mayer et al 2007 reviewed the process of nitrogen removal in riparian buffers and emphasized the importance of buffer strips in managing nitrogen in riparian zones the study finds that wide buffers 50 m are more consistent in removing substantial amounts of nitrogen entering a riparian zone than narrow buffers 0 25 m further porter et al 2018 explored the possible relationships between the width of low lying land local runoff delivery and the riparian utility of nitrogen control through denitrification in this study riparian zones were classified using normalized input values of width of low lying land and local runoff delivery and riparian buffer of varying width was suggested as potential bmp rules 14 16 table s1 represent this riparian classification based on buffer width low buffer width represents a buffer greater than 6 10 m and was suggested in riparian zones with low runoff and narrow low lying land similarly medium buffer width refers to buffer between 25 and 50 m and is recommended in riparian zones with wider low lying land in comparison high buffer width indicates a value between 50 and 90 m and is intended for flood control downstream when local runoff delivery is high these estimated values of riparian buffer form the basis of classification tomer et al 2020b on analyzing fis rules table s1 formulated based on the professional judgment of experts and case studies in the mrb it was observed that the degree of seasonal saturation forms a crucial natural characteristic that influences riparian utility rule 17 to 20 table s1 demonstrate the dependence of multiple riparian functions on the degree of seasonal saturation for example rule 16 indicates that if degree of seasonal saturation falls in the membership class low which indicates that the riparian zone is situated upland and significant levels of streambank erosion occur represented by the zone s high membership class then bank fencing would be the most suitable bmp rule 17 indicates that vegetative buffer strip would be the recommended bmp for the same degree of streambank erosion if the degree of seasonal saturation changes to medium subsequent rules describe the relationship of seasonal saturation with the riparian utility of filtering overland flow and denitrification nitrogen control ralston and sarr 2017 classified riparian zones in the mrb to explain the relationship between riparian functionality and the degree of seasonal saturation and recommend that riparian restoration efforts should lead to native upland plants in sites that experience seasonal drying due to lack of flooding or stream downcutting the duration of wetland manifested as natural features like forested floodplains and seasonal wetlands in a riparian zone influences its flow filtration and flood control abilities peterjohn and correll 1984 in the case of mrb forested floodplains and wetlands play a critical role in controlling downstream flow nitrogen removal and sediment abatement wan et al 2014 an increase in tree cover outcome of rules 1 3 is another bmp observed in mrb magner et al 2012 brewer 2016 stark et al 2000 have observed that eutrophication assessment in streams should be collectively based on the presence of riparian tree cover and biological communities and nitrate concentration in water porter et al 2018 found that streams with less tree cover allow increased growth of phytoplankton and thus help in reducing the dissolved concentration of nitrate in water hence a low degree of increase in tree cover should be adopted as bmp in riparian zones where nitrogen control through denitrification is the desired goal on the other hand an increase in tree cover is beneficial for water clarity and concentration of dissolved oxygen thus promoting a high degree of tree cover as the suggested bmps at riparian zones where water clarity is low this work provides a comprehensive framework to the practitioners which can suggest bmps for riparian management while also providing a basis to mathematically incorporate the dynamics associated with riparian and stream characteristics 4 2 validation of decision support framework for cottonwood river elm creek and seven mile creek the outcomes of the dsf were validated in three tributaries of the minnesota river with varying hydrologic unit code huc sizes as stated in step 5 of fig 2 the three tributaries of minnesota river taken under consideration are the cottonwood river huc 8 elm creek huc 10 and seven mile creek huc 12 data table s2 from three tributaries in mrb are evaluated on the developed framework to obtain suitable bmps the results of scenarios table 7 fig 4 agree with the field studies performed by magner and steffen 2000 lenhart et al 2012 bateman et al 2019 pierce 2020 and mpca 2020 in the riparian zones of cottonwood river elm creek and seven mile creek pierce 2020 as part of her ms degree measured multiple metrics in the three study watersheds shown in fig 1 where dfs procedures were applied magner and steffen 2000 visited twenty five usgs gaging stations including cottonwood river and studied stream morphologic response to land use and classified stream reaches using schumm s and rosgen s systems the intensive row crop corn soybean agriculture and surface subsurface drainage have increased stream density and channel conveyance leading to channel incision which disconnected the channel from the active flood plain loss of flood plain caused destabilization of riparian vegetation and buffering capacity of riparian corridor where channel incision resulted in land loss and increased sediment loads field observations reveal that managing riparian vegetation buffer strips and increase in tree cover have played a critical role in reviving some flood plain connectivity limiting streambank sediment loads and slowing the channel enlargement process the current study obtained riparian revegetation and buffer strips as the suggested bmp at 35 and 25 of the examined sites fig 4 whereas increase in tree cover is suggested bmp at 10 of the observed sites based on field observations at four sites in the riparian zones of cottonwood river pierce 2020 classified the streams using rosgen stream channel type soil type degree of incision and dominant vegetation also she monitored the depth to the shallow riparian groundwater table the presence of riparian buffers had great potential to remove nitrogen from shallow groundwater in the riparian corridors if water was forced to move through the zone and not bypass the zone via tile drain pipe to the channel edge this observation agreed with the bmp buffer strips suggested by dsf corn soybean agriculture occupies 86 of the elm creek watershed with mainly unmanaged riparian perennial trees shrubs and forbs lenhart et al 2012 and gordon et al 2021 studied the relationships between channel morphology and total suspended sediment tss concentrations in elm creek one of the highest contributors of suspended sediment in the mrb they observed that riparian wetlands had once covered 50 of the riparian zones in elm creek but over time loss of wetlands due to grading plowing and subsurface drainage led to increased peak flow therefore the dsf suggests riparian wetland management as a suitable bmp to reduce suspended loads and limit impaired biota bmps related to wetland management formed 15 of the total obtained bmps fig 4 further elm creek has experienced three significant changes in its plan view viz i expansion of drainage area through ditches and subsurface pipes ii loss of river length and sinuosity due to channelization at road crossings and iii eradication of headwater channels or sloughs due to plowing burial and draining via deposition from field erosion these observations of lenhart et al 2012 suggest the need to rebuild upland hydrologic storage via wetland restoration and revive the functions of flood plains in incised channels to control sediment discharge in the elm creek corn soybean production is the predominant agricultural activity in the seven mile creek watershed producing tss and nutrients contributing nearly 10 of the total load to the minnesota river dalzell and mulla 2018 downer et al 2020 the most significant stressors in the creek are tile drained land use and streambank erosion adding excess nitrate nitrogen and tss other factors include loss of fish habitat loss of wetlands flow alteration and road crossings perched culverts for connectivity channelization and under drought conditions a loss of baseflow bateman et al 2019 mpca 2020 in addition the removal of riparian vegetation and wooded riparian zones increased stream temperatures in the upper reaches kuehner 2009 bateman et al 2019 kuehner 2009 observed that the re establishment of riparian buffers improved the stream hydrologic cycle and lowered water temperatures and limited sedimentation mpca s 2020 nine element plan suggested ravine stabilization deep and densely rooted riparian vegetation buffer strips and restoration of floodplains to control stream bank erosion reduce downstream pollutant transport bateman et al 2019 observed a lack of wooded debris and refuge areas riparian wetlands with limited fish community and macroinvertebrate movement throughout the system dalzell and mulla 2018 observed that 76 of the sediment in seven mile creek was contributed from ravine stream bank erosion thus riparian vegetation could play a significant role in controlling sediment delivery to the creek the studies outcomes above validate the riparian bmps wetland management revegetation and woody debris suggested by dsf in the riparian zones of the seven mile creek 10 of the examined riparian zones have woody debris as a suggested bmp fig 4 4 3 fuzzy logic based riparian management framework and its universal applicability the hybridized dsf developed in this study allows practitioners to classify riparian zones based on the riparian stream characteristics and desired riparian functions to guide the selection of suitable riparian bmps and their degree of suitability in riparian zones of the mrb it consists of 27 input characteristics 28 bmps and 42 fuzzy rules the outcomes were validated for three tributaries of the minnesota river the dsf lays out a framework for application in other tributaries given the availability of input data the dsf s novelty is adapting a weighting framework to emphasize the results of a prioritization process on the outcome bmps while analyzing the uncertainty associated with critical input data criteria the fuzzy ahp framework ensures that the model accommodates the uncertainty in decision making by considering multiple stakeholders diverse and conflicting opinions towards riparian classes data and bmps fis provides a flexible interface to the practitioners to access the adaptability of a given riparian zone for a set of functions which may be conflicting in nature riparian properties and functionality are characteristic of a region and this variation should be acknowledged before suggesting bmps dsf has been built using primary and secondary datasets table s2 where primary datasets were obtained from studies conducted in mrb and interviews survey of professionals working in mrb while the secondary datasets were from studies conducted in mrb as well as other geographic locations across the globe thus the comprehensive dsf can be adopted to any global geography to suggest bmps for riparian zones in addition the dsf facilitates implementation in other regions by offering a flexible environment to the practitioners in the following aspects a weights of input physical characteristics and desired riparian functions can be modified b if required more criteria can be added removed from the fis c the rules can be modified based on expert recommendation d more bmp choices can be added the dsf requires normalized input values of riparian and stream characteristics for a riparian zone under consideration demanding knowledge of the natural ranges observed for riparian and stream parameters on the broader watershed this presents a challenge in the applicability of the proposed framework in data scarce regions where prior information regarding riparian and stream characteristics may not be available in such remote and economically challenged regions the unavailability of high resolution data is compounded by the inflated cost associated with data acquisition limiting the scope of riparian management analysis to small river reaches betz et al 2018 betz et al 2020 utilized an easily accessible open access data set to delineate riparian zones and riparian vegetation in a data scarce region using a fuzzy logic approach the study was able to satisfactorily identify riparian vegetation by using a linear membership function for a vegetation index and integrating it with riparian zone delineation in a similar study by schmitt et al 2014 remote sensing data was used to classify fluvial systems to develop a framework capable of structuring large scale river hydro morphology data to derive characteristic combinations using clustering based machine learning classification aided by an integrated fuzzy classifier the proposed dsf can be applied to delineate bmps in data scare watersheds by integrating similar frameworks schmitt et al 2014 betz et al 2020 capable of utilizing large scale remote sensing data and obtaining local stream riparian characteristics data it can be developed into a user friendly web mobile application the interface would require the practitioner to input the local riparian and stream characteristics data and select the desired riparian functions the application saves resources and time by suggesting optimal riparian bmps 5 conclusions this study develops a comprehensive riparian management dsf based on fuzzy logic which can help the local watershed users and decision making bodies to select optimized riparian management actions the hybridized model aims at building a user friendly mathematical framework that bridges the gap between understanding the relationship between physical riparian characteristics and desired riparian function the incorporation of fuzzy set theory concepts provides latitude to the model to deal with the uncertainty associated with riparian zone data and experts opinions the scenario assessment shows the applicability of dsf in the three tributaries of different huc sizes the model is flexible and applies to the watershed of any huc size provided there is the availability of data and knowledge about the riparian corridor of the watershed the model helps conservationists move towards better optimized zones and environmentally sound agricultural land use which could control agricultural farm pollution and enhance the riparian zones ecological functions the suggested management actions would contribute with organic material filter the drainage and support the riverine ecosystem with instream wood and bank stability one of the limitations of the dsf is its inability to represent the results in a geospatial environment secondly the dsf depends on the prior knowledge of the stakeholders hence it would need additional inputs such as high resolution lidar images in data scare regions these limitations can be overcome by integrating them with the gis framework watershed models in the past have not dealt comprehensively with the subject of riparian management the proposed model can be coupled with existing watershed models such as agricultural conservation planning framework acpf environmental policy integrated climate agricultural policy environmental extender epic apex better assessment science integrating point and nonpoint sources basins hydrological simulation program fortran hspf prioritize target and measure application ptmapp for better understanding of riparian stream interaction and more effective planning of bmps to achieve tmdl goals it is believed that this study would immensely help watershed managers integrate riparian management with riparian utility and incorporate the aims of riparian management in

3467,riparian corridors serve as buffer zones between land and water thereby supporting essential ecosystem services though riparian zones occupy around 1 of land area in midwestern usa watersheds their management has significant societal consequences on downstream ecosystem services such as water quantity and quality the management of riparian zones in the minnesota river basin mrb needs a comprehensive decision support framework dsf to guide conservationists to invest resources efficiently this study attempts to classify riparian zones based on three classes stream features riparian characteristics and riparian functions to suggest suitable best management practices bmps we developed a comprehensive hybrid decision support framework dsf by integrating fuzzy analytical hierarchy process ahp and fuzzy inference system fis to propose riparian bmps based on the physical characteristics of stream riparian zone and desired riparian functions the dsf accommodates the uncertainty associated with the stakeholder s perceptions towards the riparian zone classes while also accounting for continuous variation in riparian dynamics the advantage of a hybrid model is its ability to allow the stakeholders to prioritize critical criteria belonging to the classes to ensure that they have maximum impact on the riparian bmps proposed by the model we have demonstrated the model using three minnesota river tributaries at the hydrologic unit code huc 8 huc 10 huc 12 scales results show that bmps such as riparian revegetation buffer strips wetland management the addition of woody debris and an increase in tree cover obtained the highest scores and occupied 35 25 15 10 and 10 of the observed sites respectively keywords best management practices fuzzy logic riparian function uncertainty water quality 1 introduction riparian corridors are three dimensional zones that occur alongside water and water bodies where terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems interact gregory et al 1991 tomer et al 2020a riparian zones occupy less than 1 of the land area in midwestern watersheds in the us still their management is of paramount importance since they support biophysical processes which influence the downstream aquatic ecosystems and the biological activities of the catchment area at large usda nrcs 2005 xiang et al 2017 lee et al 2020 an investigation of seventy streams and rivers within three national water quality assessment nawqa study in the upper midwest during august 1997 revealed that due to the variation in riparian buffer zones streams flowing in the cropland exhibit different ecological characteristics despite similar land use throughout the corn belt region of the midwest sorenson et al 1999 in minnesota river basin mrb back in the 1970 s farmers tried to crop as much land as possible the basin is characterized by intensive row crop agriculture and the landscape has both surface and subsurface drainage to enhance crop yields magner and steffen 2000 li et al 2020 over time marginal riparian land failed to provide an economic return on investment mpca 2010 further due to changes in upland drainage and climate riparian zones were abandoned and weedy shrubs and trees took over many riparian corridors which had severely affected the aquatic biology stark and richards 2008 lenhart et al 2013 a small percent of the land was managed via the conservation reserve program but conscientious riparian management did not occur because economic margins tightened when the price of commodities fell down mpca 2020 for several decades government officials and practitioners have suggested that more water storage was required within the mrb to better manage water quantity and quality johnson et al 2009 this conclusion acknowledges the systematic loss of wetlands and water storage by advanced subsurface drainage technology magner and steffen 2000 lenhart et al 2012 in recent years government officials and practitioners have recognized the need for deliberate management of riparian corridors for meeting water quantity and quality goals in mrb lenhart et al 2010 mpca 2020 li et al 2020 the biophysical function and human use of a riparian zone are dependent on several factors including stream size position with respect to the river and landform type hills mountains plateaus canyons and valleys and vary significantly between headwater and sea quinn et al 2001 pinay et al 2018 for instance riparian zones play a significant role in contaminant attenuation and transport from the terrestrial to the aquatic in headwater streams draining into v shaped valleys quinn et al 2001 in lowland floodplains water from mainstem channels spills onto terrestrial land during floods it has been found that the significance of riparian zones relative to a particular riparian function for human use is dependent on the interpretation of their structure composition and other function specific characteristics abernathy and rutherford 2000 lind et al 2019 for instance the ability of riparian vegetation to strengthen the stream bank through tree roots decreases as the bank depth exceeds the rooting depth krzeminska et al 2019 similarly the capacity of riparian vegetation to shade the stream channel decreases with an increase in channel width and the effectiveness of soil denitrification is dependent on riparian vegetation characteristics such as composition and structure liu et al 2008 renouf and harding 2015 tomer et al 2020a the dominant trees and shrubs comprise the foundation species that shape riparian zones composition structure and ecosystem functionality stella and bendix 2019 for example fish communities experience better living conditions in wooded riparian zones than those with more open canopy because of higher dissolved oxygen levels and good stream quality stauffer et al 2000 pusey and arthington 2003 lind et al 2019 riparian wetlands in mrb have significantly contributed to limiting nitrate fluxes in agricultural catchments hansen et al 2018 groh et al 2020 however the effectiveness of wetlands in controlling nitrogen fluxes is dependent on hydrological connectivity between hillslope riparian wetland and stream montreuil et al 2010 the biochemical capacity of stream for retention transfer and removal of nitrogen also depends on design of riparian corridors and seasonal variations pinay et al 2018 lee et al 2020 riparian buffers function as sinks for inorganic nitrogen especially nitrates by removing nitrogen from surface runoff groundwater plant uptake and microbial degradation in soil olokeogun et al 2020 johnes et al 2020 but the physical properties of riparian buffer such as width soil texture slope and vegetation biomass play a critical role in determining the nitrogen removal efficiency achieved lyu et al 2021 these studies collectively point to the dependence of riparian functionality on associated physical and stream characteristics the dynamic interactions of riparian zone functions and physical characteristics such as type of landform slope vegetation density and stream properties pose a challenge to managing riparian zones and placing bmps specific to a given watershed researchers have thus classified riparian zones into areas with homogeneous attributes such as vegetation height stream width riparian slope etc by accounting for the difference in riparian functions suggesting a better management approach delong and brusven 1991 quinn et al 2001 a class wise riparian zone classification based on desired riparian functions and stream characteristics has assisted conservationists in effectively planning riparian bmps gibling 2006 developed a valley classification system based on geology and rosgen 2008 also developed a valley classification and linked it to hydrology and stream geomorphology to classify streams meehan and o brien 2019 some studies have taken riparian vegetation and shore characteristics to classify riparian zones aided by spatial mapping using geographical information systems delong and brusven 1991 macfarlane et al 2017a tompalski et al 2017 tomer et al 2020a classified riparian zones using agricultural conservation planning framework acpf to delineate sites for using riparian buffer vegetation to protect stream bank interception of runoff and moderate groundwater nitrate in thirty watersheds of east central iowa these functions were achieved by classifying riparian settings of 250 m length based on height above the channel and upslope contributing area other researchers have classified riparian zones into areas with homogeneous physical attributes such as valley bottom cross section accounting for riparian function differences quinn et al 2001 a recent study by stutter et al 2021 provides a comprehensive review of the utility of spatial data for the delineation of riparian zones based on natural and human riparian functions this study explores the incorporation of bmps using spatial data to classify riparian delineation into three classes fixed width variable width by river corridor features and variable width due to local pressures or desired riparian functionality such classification allowed the study stutter et al 2021 to address natural functions like filtering overland flow and desired riparian functions for human use such as downstream flood control previous studies classification of riparian zones offers insight into the variety of riparian bmps and their dependence on riparian characteristics but a significant limitation of such studies is their inability to provide a comprehensive decision support framework dsf that can guide bmp selection by simultaneously considering the different classes viz stream features riparian characteristics desired riparian functions while dealing with uncertain and conflicting perceptions of multiple stakeholders towards the data concerning these classes such a dsf should mathematically account for the landowner s uncertain perceptions towards riparian classes required to guide bmp selection there is also variability and uncertainty involved in determining the relative importance of these classes while modeling the framework pan et al 2018 srinivas et al 2018 for example denser tree cover in the riparian zone indicates good stream quality and greater dissolved oxygen levels stark et al 2000 montreuil et al 2010 on the other hand thin tree cover promotes the growth of phytoplankton which helps maintain lower levels of nitrate concentration in water sebilo et al 2006 in such a situation conservationists need to adjust the amount of tree cover in a riparian zone based on conflicting functions of filtering overland flow and maintaining nitrogen levels the maintenance of adequate tree cover would require a specific set of management functions such challenges arouse a need for a robust mathematical modeling framework to guide conservationists towards adopting bmps for a given riparian function and human use corresponding to specific geography the modeling framework should integrate the conflicting viewpoints of stakeholders due to the uncertain nature of the riparian corridor characteristics and stream parameters to propose bmps which can perform the desired riparian functions one of the powerful ways to deal with uncertainty present in the decision support framework is to employ fuzzy logic techniques singh et al 2007 rehana and mujumdar 2009 srinivas et al 2017 fuzzy logic methods are not universally used by hydrologic practitioners thus we have provided a list of key terms and definitions in table 1 fuzzy logic provides a latitude to mathematically incorporate the differences in opinion of multiple stakeholders towards the relative importance of riparian classes by converting their linguistic responses to mathematical relationships using fuzzy membership functions qin 2012 the fuzzy membership function is a curve that expresses the uncertainty by mapping any mathematical input to a membership value between 0 and 1 srinivas et al 2015 the use of fuzzy logic techniques in watershed management has recently gained popularity zou et al 2013 srinivas et al 2020 wang et al 2014 used variable fuzzy set theory to perform fuzzy binary comparisons to evaluate the tseng wen river s water quality in taiwan xu and qin 2015 developed a superiority inferiority fuzzy sequential programming to assess the uncertainty for supporting water supply and demand analysis for tianjin binhai china minatour et al 2016 used a modified fuzzy analytical hierarchy process ahp with interval valued fuzzy sets ivfss for enhanced watershed management ahp is a multi criteria decision making tool used to rank the decision alternatives based on decision criteria and the project s overall goal srinivas et al 2018 ivfss are a modified form of traditional sets as the membership function of the ivfss is a fuzzy classification within the interval of 0 1 several researchers have employed fuzzy logic to delineate riparian zones schmitt et al 2014 weissteiner et al 2016 betz et al 2018 weissteiner et al 2016 coupled fuzzy logic with object based image analysis to identify observed potential and actual riparian zones based on a large open database including digital elevation models dem soils land use land cover data hydrology and vegetation indices betz et al 2018 have used fuzzy logic for delineating riparian zones in data scare regions by modeling the uncertainties associated with riparian zone boundaries the paper deals with uncertainty related to heterogenous riverscape along with the quality of the digital elevation data schmitt et al 2014 developed a fuzzy logic based framework for analyzing and classifying fluvial systems in data scarce environments using a characteristic fuzzy signature of hydro morphology drivers for each river reach despite wide applications of fuzzy techniques there has been limited research in developing a hybrid model coupling two advanced fuzzy based methods wherein conflicting views of stakeholders towards imprecise riparian corridor data can be addressed to support sound riparian bmps decisions moreover fuzzy logic has not been used to develop a comprehensive and flexible decision support framework to propose riparian bmps based on riparian stream characteristics and desired riparian functions this work develops a hybrid model by coupling a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process ahp with fuzzy inference systems fis the advantage of the hybrid model is its ability to allow the decision maker to prioritize critical criteria belonging to riparian categories to ensure maximum impact on the riparian bmp proposed by the model the primary aim of this work is to introduce a dsf hybrid model for guiding riparian bmp selection in minnesota river basin mrb the dsf was applied to three tributaries of minnesota river in particular the objectives of the study are as follows a identification of critical criteria belonging to riparian stream characteristics and riparian functions using fuzzy ahp b coupling fuzzy logic approaches ahp and inference systems to determine suitable riparian bmps based on critical criteria c developing a flexible and interactive decision support framework dsf to identify bmps in riparian zones of mrb and d validating the outcomes of dsf for three tributaries of minnesota river the application of the dsf in other geographic regions has also been discussed 2 methodology 2 1 study area and data the minnesota river basin mrb fig 1 drains nearly 20 of minnesota and some parts of iowa north dakota and south dakota the basin s estimated area is about 43 430 km2 in the united states and 92 of the land use in the basin accounts for agricultural activities li et al 2020 the basin area consists of twelve major hydrologic watersheds and thirteen management watersheds 85 of the mrb is occupied by the central lowland physiographic province which contains erosive loess soils delong 2005 characterized by shallow impoundments a series of locks and dams and river channelization structures that aid in commercial navigation between minneapolis and cairo the basin is known for its contribution to agricultural production commercial navigation and municipal water supply weitzell et al 2003 intensive row crop agriculture characterises majority of the basin with both surface and subsurface drainage to enhance crop production magner and steffen 2000 li et al 2020 previous studies in the region have indicated that aquatic biology is affected by the riparian cover and runoff potential zumberge et al 2003 stark and richards 2008 popular riparian management practices prevalent in the area include establishing grass buffer strips riparian revegetation riffles and the addition of boulders in this study we have developed the dsf hybrid model by studying the riparian characteristics of selected streams in the mrb based on research conducted by the elder author magner and steffen 2000 magner et al 2012 lenhart et al 2012 pierce 2020 model outcome validation occurs in three tributaries of the minnesota river with varying hydrologic unit code huc sizes the cottonwood river huc 8 elm creek huc 10 and seven mile creek huc 12 data and corresponding sources used for developing the dsf have been described in table s2 these data are analyzed by expert stakeholders table s3 and their responses are procured with the help of survey questionnaire table s4 all experts are professionals with vast experience of working with agencies like minnesota pollution control board mpca their responses are processed in hybrid fuzzy logic model 2 2 methodological overview the study develops a fuzzy logic based hybridized decision support framework dsf fig 2 which has two components namely fuzzy ahp and fuzzy inference system fis fuzzy ahp ranks different criteria sub categories of riparian class based on their assessed relevance to the problem statement since individuals could have varying assessments regarding the most significant criteria fuzzy ahp helps mitigate uncertainty related to decision making by ranking assessment criteria based on pairwise comparison srinivas et al 2018 the application of fuzzy ahp has been discussed in detail in section 2 4 1 fuzzy inference system fis is a mathematical decision making framework that employs if then rules connected with logical operators or and and to obtain fuzzy scores corresponding to recommended outputs srinivas et al 2017 the application of the fis framework for recommending bmps has been explained at length in section 2 4 2 the survey questionnaire and list of experts have been provided in tables s3 and s4 respectively three classes of inputs namely stream characteristics riparian characteristics natural riparian functions and human use are considered for delineating suitable bmps firstly based on available data and expert opinion fuzzy analytical hierarchical process ahp has been employed for pairwise comparison of criteria belonging to each of these classes and relative significance of individual criteria would be obtained in the form of weights this process of pairwise comparison of criteria to obtain fuzzy weights has been demonstrated in step 2 of fig 2 the criteria obtaining the highest weights are considered critical these critical criteria serve as inputs to fis in the second component of dsf critical criteria are assessed using fis to obtain suitable bmps along with a score indicating their degree of effectiveness although the dsf was developed for the mrb it applies to any geographic location while applying the proposed dsf to new watershed the user would be required to rank the input physical characteristics and desired riparian use considering the watershed management goals then fuzzy ahp would delineate the critical criteria and fis would recommend suitable riparian bmps the implementation of dsf in other regions has been discussed in detail in section 4 3 2 3 riparian classes and sub categories as emphasized earlier it is essential to classify riparian corridors into areas of homogenous physical characteristics vegetation height stream width riparian slope etc for proper delineation of riparian bmps the riparian bmps also depend on desired functionality of the riparian corridor which depends on their physical characteristics thus the study classifies riparian zones based on three classes stream characteristics riparian characteristics riparian function and human use table 2 represents the subcategories criteria corresponding to these classes as depicted in step 1 of fig 2 the sub categories under each class are obtained based on extensive literature review and form the criteria used for developing the dsf stream characteristics stream water quality significantly impacts the aquatic ecosystem and affects the utility of accompanying riparian zones the groundwater nitrate concentrations in mrb streams exceed the national median by a significant margin of 4 mg l mpca 2010 but the same mrb streams draining gravel deposits and surficial sand have lower nitrate concentrations than groundwater thus maintaining riverbed characteristics would be a suitable bmp in the riparian zone with a large bed material size to obtain the desired function of denitrification this study utilizes similar relationships among stream criteria and riparian functions to recommend suitable bmps riparian characteristics riparian characteristics are intricately linked to riparian functions for example a lower riparian slope would help downstream flood control while denser riparian vegetation shade streams also it has been noted that riparian zones with greater width of low lying land offer better opportunities for denitrification porter et al 2018 this study accounts for such dependencies of riparian functions on riparian characteristics which would aid in recommending appropriate bmps riparian function and human use riparian zones perform various natural biophysical functions like filtration of overland flow nutrient transport from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems etc but it is important to note that riparian zones are often employed for human use as recreational areas or agricultural purposes this study accounts for both types of utilities of riparian zones for adopting suitable bmps 2 4 hybridized riparian decision support framework considering the dynamics concerning classes and bmps we have proposed a dsf which is an amalgamation of two fuzzy based methods namely modified fuzzy ahp and fuzzy inference systems the responses of expert stakeholders obtained using survey questionnaire table s4 are the inputs to dsf based on the expert recommendation specific physical characteristics were selected for each class stream and riparian characteristics desired riparian function and use their weights were obtained by employing fuzzy ahp methodology then fuzzy logic rules were formed to represent the natural relationships among these classes and riparian bmps 2 4 1 fuzzy analytical hierarchy process in phase i the fuzzy ahp method uses fuzzy sets to compare criteria sub categories of each riparian class accommodating uncertainties associated with stakeholders viewpoints towards the datasets of riparian classes pairwise comparisons of criteria discussed in table 1 have been conducted using triangular membership functions triangular membership functions have been explained in section s2 of the supplementary material the detailed methodology of fuzzy ahp has been explained by srinivas et al 2018 for brevity the authors have provided only the significant steps as given below experts responses towards each criterion are used to perform the pairwise comparison and a fuzzy rating is assigned table s5 each element in the comparison matrix is of the form t ij a ij b ij c ij where all a ij b ij and c ij are elements of a triangular fuzzy number if n represents the number of criteria then the pairwise comparison matrix m ij can be represented in the form of equation 1 1 m ij 1 t 12 t 1 n 1 t 12 1 t 2 n 1 t 1 n 1 t 2 n 1 the geometric mean z i and fuzzy weights w i are determined for each criterion using equations 2 and 3 respectively as given below 2 z i j 1 n t ij 1 n 3 w i z i j 1 n z j 1 the fuzzy weights are defuzzified using the gravity centre method equation 4 to obtain crisp score x i where μ z is the membership function equation 4 x i μ z z d z μ z d z for a triangular membership function a ij b ij c ij equation 4 can be written in the form of equation 5 5 x i a ij b ij c ij 3 each criterion is ranked based on its defuzzified crisp score and only the best criteria are chosen for analysis using a fuzzy inference system this helps experts in including only the relevant criteria in phase ii to propose bmps 2 4 2 fuzzy inference system in phase ii critical criteria obtained using fuzzy ahp are analysed using matlab fuzzy inference system to determine the overall score of potential bmps srinivas et al 2017 have described the detailed methodology of fis for brevity only crucial steps are discussed in this section fuzzification by defining of membership functions critical criteria obtained from phase i are classified linguistically and assigned appropriate fuzzy membership functions mfs allowing the decision maker to develop the proposed framework the mf s shape could be triangular trapezoidal gaussian sigmoidal etc the mf was chosen based on how the expert stakeholders wish to quantify the uncertainty associated with the riparian classes data table s2 we have referred to scientific literature to select appropriate mfs srinivas et al 2017 2018 sadollah 2018 the input and output variables of the fis are listed in table s7 a total of twenty seven input variables have been broadly classified into stream characteristics riparian characteristics and riparian function and human use the fis output variable represents the suggested bmp a total of twenty eight bmps are considered to formulate fis rules table s7 gives the list of bmps along with their sources most of the input and output variables have been classified into three linguistic classes viz low l medium m and high h however a different membership function was adopted for certain input variables such as riparian width and stream width as they demonstrate more than three distinctive naturally occurring classes in such cases four linguistic classes viz very low l low l high h and very high vh are adopted fig 3 demonstrates some of the mfs used in this study triangular mfs are used to represent the linguistic classes low l and high h in contrast the linguistic class medium m has been represented using trapezoidal mf this is considered appropriate as the medium class represents a range of values which can be represented using a trapezoid similarly for the input characteristics of the stream and riparian width triangular mf represents the linguistic classes very high vh and very low vl in contrast trapezoidal membership function represents intermediate classes high h and low l developing expert fuzzy inference rules the relationships among inputs criteria and output variables are used to form fuzzy inference rules here the conflicting viewpoints of stakeholders play a crucial role rules are in the form of if then statements conjugated using fuzzy operators and or or the rules scientifically represent real life phenomena and satisfy available datasets mathematically the total number of rules possible for a given input equals r number of linguistic variables number of criteria suppose there are three linguistic classes i e low medium high and twenty seven input parameters then the total number of possible rules would be of the order 327 it is essential to realize that it would not be possible to form scientifically sound relationships for all combinations of input parameters therefore extensive research is required to arrive at the fuzzy rules in this study a total of forty two rules have been formulated for mrb assigning weights to fuzzy rules this is one of the novel features of this work where each rule has been assigned weights depending on the ranking of the input criteria obtained in phase ii in this manner prioritized criteria will have maximum impact on the output obtained using fis integration of rule outputs and defuzzification fis rules are executed in the fuzzy expert system the outputs of these rules are integrated to obtain an aggregated membership function then the defuzzification is performed using the gravity centre method to obtain suggested bmp and a defuzzified crisp score the bmp with the highest crisp score is recommended 2 5 development of decision support framework the fuzzy ahp method described in the earlier section has been applied to evaluate the importance weights of criteria under each of the three riparian classes once the relevant criteria are selected pairwise comparisons are performed for relevance in riparian zone utility and management using a fuzzy scale table s5 the pairwise comparisons among criteria are performed based on stakeholder s opinion as stated in step 2 of fig 2 for instance the criterion of bed material size was assigned a fuzzy scale rating of 1 1 3 when compared to percent macrophyte cover indicating that bed material size is almost equally important to the criterion of percent macrophyte cover when recommending bmps for riparian zones in mrb in an analogous manner pairwise comparisons are made for all combinations of criteria tables 3 and s6 represent the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix obtained for the criteria under stream characteristics s1 s5 and riparian function and human use rf1 rf10 respectively a similar matrix has been obtained for criteria under riparian characteristics as well using equations 4 5 final defuzzified weights are obtained for each criterion the stepwise methodology for obtaining defuzzified criteria weights has been explained in step 3 of fig 2 table 4 illustrates the weights obtained for the criteria for better understanding detailed calculations for obtaining weights of criteria under stream characteristics are given below based on expert ratings pairwise comparison matrix is obtained for stream characteristics table 3 using equation 1 for example relative comparison of s1 stream width and s2 bed material size is rated as 1 1 1 which means both are equally important according to linguistic meanings given in table s5 using fuzzy comparison matrix elements a geometric mean is calculated for each criterion for illustration the geometric mean gm of s1 is calculated using equation 2 as follows gm s 1 g m f w s 1 s 1 f w s 1 s 2 f w s 1 s 3 f w s 1 s 4 f w s 1 s 5 a b c g m s 1 g m 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 3 gm s 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 3 3 1 5 gm s 1 a b c 1 1 1 55 similarly the geometric mean of all criteria is calculated the obtained geometric means of other stream characteristics s2 s3 s4 and s5 are 1 1 1 55 1 1 1 55 0 52 1 1 and 0 52 1 1 respectively the sum of the geometric mean is calculated as given below g m 1 1 1 55 1 1 1 55 1 1 1 55 0 52 1 1 0 52 1 1 4 04 5 6 65 the reciprocal of the sum of the geometric mean is calculated as given below r e c i p r o c a l g m r e c i p r o c a l 4 04 5 6 65 0 15 0 2 0 25 final fuzzy weights fw of each criterion are calculated using equation 3 for example fuzzy weight of stream width s1 is calculated as fw s 1 g m s 1 r e c i p r o c a l g m fw s 1 1 1 1 55 0 15 0 2 0 25 f w s 1 0 15 0 2 0 3875 similarly fuzzy weights for all criteria are obtained fuzzy weights are defuzzified using the gravity centre method equation 4 and 5 to obtain crisp score x i defuzzifiedweight s 1 0 15 0 2 0 3875 3 defuzzifiedweight s 1 0 245 similarly defuzzified weights of s2 s3 s4 and s5 criterion are 0 245 0 245 0 175 and 0 175 respectively the sum of defuzzified weights is 1 085 the defuzzified weights of all criteria are normalized to obtain final defuzzified weights for example the weight for stream width s1 is obtained as follows f i n a l d e f u z z i f i e d w e i g h t s 2 0 245 1 085 0 225 similarly final defuzzified weights of other criteria are obtained table 4 all weights are obtained on the scale of 0 1 once the criteria weights are obtained using fuzzy ahp phase ii begins where membership functions are assigned to each criterion the criteria represent physical characteristics and functionality of riparian zones a total of forty two fuzzy logic inference rules have then been formulated table s1 based on literature survey and stakeholders input step 4 of fig 2 all the rules are fed into matlab 2021a fis toolbox and multiple scenarios are considered to develop the dsf hybrid model for mrb the system fires fuzzy rules to process the inputs the outputs of the rules are the bmps along with their score representing the degree of suitability the developed dsf consists of 28 recommended bmps table s7 3 results 3 1 best management practices obtained using decision support framework we have developed a decision support framework dsf using a fuzzy based hybrid model by assessing the riparian and stream characteristics of selected streams in the mrb based on research conducted by the elder author magner and steffen 2000 magner et al 2012 lenhart et al 2012 pierce 2020 table 5 shows the ten rules and corresponding weights obtained using the dsf for example rule 8 consists of three inputs stream width vegetation height and shade the criteria under stream and riparian characteristics are used to account for the physical characteristics of the riparian zone in contrast the criteria under riparian function and human use were used to represent the desired utility from the riparian zone the output consists of the category of best management practice as given below rule 8 if stream width is high and vegetation height is high and shade high is the desired function then riparian revegetation high is the bmp weights assigned to each rule are equivalent to the average weights obtained for the inputs in phase i involved in that rule for illustration rule 1 inputs are water clarity and filtering overland flow with fuzzy ahp weights of 0 225 and 0 165 the average of these two weights i e 0 195 is the weight assigned to rule one the objective is to accurately structure the rule to represent natural relationships among physical characteristics and utility to guide bmp selection table 6 illustrates the outcomes of fuzzy rules for one such case with fuzzy rule inputs and output values step 5 of fig 2 twelve rules consist of twelve inputs are executed with six outputs bmps as observed the bmp namely maintaining riverbed characteristics has attained the highest score of 8 12 followed by riparian revegetation with a score of 8 07 at the same time all other bmps obtain a score of 5 the bmps obtaining high scores can be explained through the physical characteristics of the riparian zone in consideration as shown in table 6 the normalized value of bed material size is 9 which gives a membership value of 0 75 using membership functions this value is indicative of the presence of large particles such as gravel and boulder in the basin one of the desired functions of the riparian zone is denitrification nitrogen control with a normalized input value of 8 which corresponds to a membership value of 0 5 in class high stark et al 2000 have shown that nitrate concentrations in rivers draining surficial sand and gravel deposits were low thus maintaining riverbed characteristics would be a suitable bmp in the riparian zone with a large bed material size to obtain the desired function of denitrification similarly the riparian zone having tall natural vegetation and long stream width with normalized input values of 7 yields membership values of 0 25 with membership class high vegetation with tall height is suitable for shading streams of larger width therefore bmp for ensuring shade to the stream is riparian revegetation hence a combination of the bmps with the highest scores i e riparian revegetation and maintaining riverbed characteristics would be most suitable for this riparian zone if enough resources are not available to implement a combination of bmps maintaining riverbed characteristics is an optimal solution 3 2 scenarios developed using dsf for cottonwood river elm creek and seven mile creek using the hybridized dsf we have developed scenarios table 7 representing different combinations of physical characteristics and desired riparian function and human use for the three tributaries cottonwood river elm creek and seven mile creek of the minnesota river these scenarios were used to obtain the suitable riparian bmp s and the score representing its degree of suitability on a scale of 0 10 fig 4 presents the distribution of suggested bmps for the tested scenarios in the three tributaries of mrb the prominent bmps are riparian revegetation buffer strips management of wetlands the addition of woody debris and increase in tree cover table 7 the dsf obtained riparian revegetation and buffer strips as the suggested bmp at 35 and 25 of the examined sites fig 4 whereas increase in tree cover is suggested bmp at 10 of the observed sites 4 discussion 4 1 improving riparian zone management in minnesota river basin using dsf the outcomes of dsf table 5 table 6 would play a significant role in improving riparian zone management in mrb urban agricultural and industrial land use are primary sources of water quality degradation in mrb in the release of organic compounds metal sediments and point and non point nutrient sources lee et al 2001 fang et al 2005 dalzell and mulla 2018 mckay et al 2019 gordon et al 2021 poor management of riparian zones reduces the fish population degrades streams and causes eutrophication in mrb stauffer et al 2000 mndnr 2016 the effect of nutrient discharge from intensive corn soybean agriculture on water quality and biotic communities was acknowledged by several state and federal programs in the us which started recommending bmps as early as the 1970s wang et al 2002 macfarlane et al 2017b antolini et al 2020 the prominent bmps in mrb obtained using dsf are riparian revegetation maintenance of riverbed characteristics buffer strips management of wetlands the addition of woody debris increase in tree cover table 5 these outcomes are also supported by previous studies conducted in the riparian zones of mrb streams rivers wan et al 2014 found that riparian buffer strips and wetlands have been instrumental in lowering nitrate delivery rates in mrb streams and recognized that mrb s geomorphology and soils are favourable for wetland restoration magner et al 2012 and mpca 2010 observed that the creation of ditches and subsurface tile drain pipes had attenuated mrb s upland hydraulic residence time resulting in ecologically poor water quality with increased nutrient and sediment losses from the catchment these studies recognized the importance of riparian zone buffer systems for trapping sediment phosphorus and nitrogen as suggested by the dsf in addition riparian vegetation could provide biological connectivity between the riparian zone and channel bed to buffer the influence of polluted runoff magner et al 2008 magner et al 2012 also recognized the role of riparian wetland management riparian revegetation and buffers in controlling sediment and nutrients in ditches and streams and minimizing the areal extent of flooding in mrb rule 14 17 25 of dsf table s1 recommend installing riparian buffers of varying widths to achieve denitrification riparian revegetation is the dominant activity for non navigated river water quality management projects in mrb magner et al 2012 when riparian vegetation is not managed weed species dominate and leave less than desirable vegetative sustainability out of the total river enhancement projects undertaken between 1972 and 2005 in mrb non navigated river regions 98 of water quality management projects aimed at riparian revegetation o donnell galat 2007 macfarlane et al 2017b stauffer et al 2000 investigated 24 streams in the minnesota river basin they found that streams with a woody riparian cover were more suitable habitats for fish communities than streams with an open canopy on considering riparian zones with high normalized input values of vegetation density wooded riparian zones riparian revegetation was recommended as the bmp when the desired riparian zone utility was fish spawning habitat cover in contrast when riparian zones with low vegetation density and open canopy vegetation were considered inputs to dsf the addition of woody debris seemed a suitable bmp for fish spawning habitat cover these results are well supported by previous studies dalzell and mulla 2018 gordon et al 2021 guyon et al 2016 demonstrate the essential role of forested floodplain ecosystems and high density wooded riparian zones in sustaining over 150 fish species and 45 species of amphibians and reptiles in the mrb brewer 2016 emphasized the significance of low density open canopy oak pine forests in supporting the plant and animal diversity of the riparian zones rule 9 and 10 in table 5 model this natural relationship between vegetation density the riparian function of fish habitat cover and required bmps high surface water nitrate concentrations occur tile drained agricultural areas in the us including the mrb usda nrcs 2005 wan et al 2014 water quality control through denitrification is a common goal of riparian zone management projects in mrb riparian zones with comprehensive low lying land influence groundwater quality through the presence of deep rooted vegetation which aids in denitrification mayer et al 2007 reviewed the process of nitrogen removal in riparian buffers and emphasized the importance of buffer strips in managing nitrogen in riparian zones the study finds that wide buffers 50 m are more consistent in removing substantial amounts of nitrogen entering a riparian zone than narrow buffers 0 25 m further porter et al 2018 explored the possible relationships between the width of low lying land local runoff delivery and the riparian utility of nitrogen control through denitrification in this study riparian zones were classified using normalized input values of width of low lying land and local runoff delivery and riparian buffer of varying width was suggested as potential bmp rules 14 16 table s1 represent this riparian classification based on buffer width low buffer width represents a buffer greater than 6 10 m and was suggested in riparian zones with low runoff and narrow low lying land similarly medium buffer width refers to buffer between 25 and 50 m and is recommended in riparian zones with wider low lying land in comparison high buffer width indicates a value between 50 and 90 m and is intended for flood control downstream when local runoff delivery is high these estimated values of riparian buffer form the basis of classification tomer et al 2020b on analyzing fis rules table s1 formulated based on the professional judgment of experts and case studies in the mrb it was observed that the degree of seasonal saturation forms a crucial natural characteristic that influences riparian utility rule 17 to 20 table s1 demonstrate the dependence of multiple riparian functions on the degree of seasonal saturation for example rule 16 indicates that if degree of seasonal saturation falls in the membership class low which indicates that the riparian zone is situated upland and significant levels of streambank erosion occur represented by the zone s high membership class then bank fencing would be the most suitable bmp rule 17 indicates that vegetative buffer strip would be the recommended bmp for the same degree of streambank erosion if the degree of seasonal saturation changes to medium subsequent rules describe the relationship of seasonal saturation with the riparian utility of filtering overland flow and denitrification nitrogen control ralston and sarr 2017 classified riparian zones in the mrb to explain the relationship between riparian functionality and the degree of seasonal saturation and recommend that riparian restoration efforts should lead to native upland plants in sites that experience seasonal drying due to lack of flooding or stream downcutting the duration of wetland manifested as natural features like forested floodplains and seasonal wetlands in a riparian zone influences its flow filtration and flood control abilities peterjohn and correll 1984 in the case of mrb forested floodplains and wetlands play a critical role in controlling downstream flow nitrogen removal and sediment abatement wan et al 2014 an increase in tree cover outcome of rules 1 3 is another bmp observed in mrb magner et al 2012 brewer 2016 stark et al 2000 have observed that eutrophication assessment in streams should be collectively based on the presence of riparian tree cover and biological communities and nitrate concentration in water porter et al 2018 found that streams with less tree cover allow increased growth of phytoplankton and thus help in reducing the dissolved concentration of nitrate in water hence a low degree of increase in tree cover should be adopted as bmp in riparian zones where nitrogen control through denitrification is the desired goal on the other hand an increase in tree cover is beneficial for water clarity and concentration of dissolved oxygen thus promoting a high degree of tree cover as the suggested bmps at riparian zones where water clarity is low this work provides a comprehensive framework to the practitioners which can suggest bmps for riparian management while also providing a basis to mathematically incorporate the dynamics associated with riparian and stream characteristics 4 2 validation of decision support framework for cottonwood river elm creek and seven mile creek the outcomes of the dsf were validated in three tributaries of the minnesota river with varying hydrologic unit code huc sizes as stated in step 5 of fig 2 the three tributaries of minnesota river taken under consideration are the cottonwood river huc 8 elm creek huc 10 and seven mile creek huc 12 data table s2 from three tributaries in mrb are evaluated on the developed framework to obtain suitable bmps the results of scenarios table 7 fig 4 agree with the field studies performed by magner and steffen 2000 lenhart et al 2012 bateman et al 2019 pierce 2020 and mpca 2020 in the riparian zones of cottonwood river elm creek and seven mile creek pierce 2020 as part of her ms degree measured multiple metrics in the three study watersheds shown in fig 1 where dfs procedures were applied magner and steffen 2000 visited twenty five usgs gaging stations including cottonwood river and studied stream morphologic response to land use and classified stream reaches using schumm s and rosgen s systems the intensive row crop corn soybean agriculture and surface subsurface drainage have increased stream density and channel conveyance leading to channel incision which disconnected the channel from the active flood plain loss of flood plain caused destabilization of riparian vegetation and buffering capacity of riparian corridor where channel incision resulted in land loss and increased sediment loads field observations reveal that managing riparian vegetation buffer strips and increase in tree cover have played a critical role in reviving some flood plain connectivity limiting streambank sediment loads and slowing the channel enlargement process the current study obtained riparian revegetation and buffer strips as the suggested bmp at 35 and 25 of the examined sites fig 4 whereas increase in tree cover is suggested bmp at 10 of the observed sites based on field observations at four sites in the riparian zones of cottonwood river pierce 2020 classified the streams using rosgen stream channel type soil type degree of incision and dominant vegetation also she monitored the depth to the shallow riparian groundwater table the presence of riparian buffers had great potential to remove nitrogen from shallow groundwater in the riparian corridors if water was forced to move through the zone and not bypass the zone via tile drain pipe to the channel edge this observation agreed with the bmp buffer strips suggested by dsf corn soybean agriculture occupies 86 of the elm creek watershed with mainly unmanaged riparian perennial trees shrubs and forbs lenhart et al 2012 and gordon et al 2021 studied the relationships between channel morphology and total suspended sediment tss concentrations in elm creek one of the highest contributors of suspended sediment in the mrb they observed that riparian wetlands had once covered 50 of the riparian zones in elm creek but over time loss of wetlands due to grading plowing and subsurface drainage led to increased peak flow therefore the dsf suggests riparian wetland management as a suitable bmp to reduce suspended loads and limit impaired biota bmps related to wetland management formed 15 of the total obtained bmps fig 4 further elm creek has experienced three significant changes in its plan view viz i expansion of drainage area through ditches and subsurface pipes ii loss of river length and sinuosity due to channelization at road crossings and iii eradication of headwater channels or sloughs due to plowing burial and draining via deposition from field erosion these observations of lenhart et al 2012 suggest the need to rebuild upland hydrologic storage via wetland restoration and revive the functions of flood plains in incised channels to control sediment discharge in the elm creek corn soybean production is the predominant agricultural activity in the seven mile creek watershed producing tss and nutrients contributing nearly 10 of the total load to the minnesota river dalzell and mulla 2018 downer et al 2020 the most significant stressors in the creek are tile drained land use and streambank erosion adding excess nitrate nitrogen and tss other factors include loss of fish habitat loss of wetlands flow alteration and road crossings perched culverts for connectivity channelization and under drought conditions a loss of baseflow bateman et al 2019 mpca 2020 in addition the removal of riparian vegetation and wooded riparian zones increased stream temperatures in the upper reaches kuehner 2009 bateman et al 2019 kuehner 2009 observed that the re establishment of riparian buffers improved the stream hydrologic cycle and lowered water temperatures and limited sedimentation mpca s 2020 nine element plan suggested ravine stabilization deep and densely rooted riparian vegetation buffer strips and restoration of floodplains to control stream bank erosion reduce downstream pollutant transport bateman et al 2019 observed a lack of wooded debris and refuge areas riparian wetlands with limited fish community and macroinvertebrate movement throughout the system dalzell and mulla 2018 observed that 76 of the sediment in seven mile creek was contributed from ravine stream bank erosion thus riparian vegetation could play a significant role in controlling sediment delivery to the creek the studies outcomes above validate the riparian bmps wetland management revegetation and woody debris suggested by dsf in the riparian zones of the seven mile creek 10 of the examined riparian zones have woody debris as a suggested bmp fig 4 4 3 fuzzy logic based riparian management framework and its universal applicability the hybridized dsf developed in this study allows practitioners to classify riparian zones based on the riparian stream characteristics and desired riparian functions to guide the selection of suitable riparian bmps and their degree of suitability in riparian zones of the mrb it consists of 27 input characteristics 28 bmps and 42 fuzzy rules the outcomes were validated for three tributaries of the minnesota river the dsf lays out a framework for application in other tributaries given the availability of input data the dsf s novelty is adapting a weighting framework to emphasize the results of a prioritization process on the outcome bmps while analyzing the uncertainty associated with critical input data criteria the fuzzy ahp framework ensures that the model accommodates the uncertainty in decision making by considering multiple stakeholders diverse and conflicting opinions towards riparian classes data and bmps fis provides a flexible interface to the practitioners to access the adaptability of a given riparian zone for a set of functions which may be conflicting in nature riparian properties and functionality are characteristic of a region and this variation should be acknowledged before suggesting bmps dsf has been built using primary and secondary datasets table s2 where primary datasets were obtained from studies conducted in mrb and interviews survey of professionals working in mrb while the secondary datasets were from studies conducted in mrb as well as other geographic locations across the globe thus the comprehensive dsf can be adopted to any global geography to suggest bmps for riparian zones in addition the dsf facilitates implementation in other regions by offering a flexible environment to the practitioners in the following aspects a weights of input physical characteristics and desired riparian functions can be modified b if required more criteria can be added removed from the fis c the rules can be modified based on expert recommendation d more bmp choices can be added the dsf requires normalized input values of riparian and stream characteristics for a riparian zone under consideration demanding knowledge of the natural ranges observed for riparian and stream parameters on the broader watershed this presents a challenge in the applicability of the proposed framework in data scarce regions where prior information regarding riparian and stream characteristics may not be available in such remote and economically challenged regions the unavailability of high resolution data is compounded by the inflated cost associated with data acquisition limiting the scope of riparian management analysis to small river reaches betz et al 2018 betz et al 2020 utilized an easily accessible open access data set to delineate riparian zones and riparian vegetation in a data scarce region using a fuzzy logic approach the study was able to satisfactorily identify riparian vegetation by using a linear membership function for a vegetation index and integrating it with riparian zone delineation in a similar study by schmitt et al 2014 remote sensing data was used to classify fluvial systems to develop a framework capable of structuring large scale river hydro morphology data to derive characteristic combinations using clustering based machine learning classification aided by an integrated fuzzy classifier the proposed dsf can be applied to delineate bmps in data scare watersheds by integrating similar frameworks schmitt et al 2014 betz et al 2020 capable of utilizing large scale remote sensing data and obtaining local stream riparian characteristics data it can be developed into a user friendly web mobile application the interface would require the practitioner to input the local riparian and stream characteristics data and select the desired riparian functions the application saves resources and time by suggesting optimal riparian bmps 5 conclusions this study develops a comprehensive riparian management dsf based on fuzzy logic which can help the local watershed users and decision making bodies to select optimized riparian management actions the hybridized model aims at building a user friendly mathematical framework that bridges the gap between understanding the relationship between physical riparian characteristics and desired riparian function the incorporation of fuzzy set theory concepts provides latitude to the model to deal with the uncertainty associated with riparian zone data and experts opinions the scenario assessment shows the applicability of dsf in the three tributaries of different huc sizes the model is flexible and applies to the watershed of any huc size provided there is the availability of data and knowledge about the riparian corridor of the watershed the model helps conservationists move towards better optimized zones and environmentally sound agricultural land use which could control agricultural farm pollution and enhance the riparian zones ecological functions the suggested management actions would contribute with organic material filter the drainage and support the riverine ecosystem with instream wood and bank stability one of the limitations of the dsf is its inability to represent the results in a geospatial environment secondly the dsf depends on the prior knowledge of the stakeholders hence it would need additional inputs such as high resolution lidar images in data scare regions these limitations can be overcome by integrating them with the gis framework watershed models in the past have not dealt comprehensively with the subject of riparian management the proposed model can be coupled with existing watershed models such as agricultural conservation planning framework acpf environmental policy integrated climate agricultural policy environmental extender epic apex better assessment science integrating point and nonpoint sources basins hydrological simulation program fortran hspf prioritize target and measure application ptmapp for better understanding of riparian stream interaction and more effective planning of bmps to achieve tmdl goals it is believed that this study would immensely help watershed managers integrate riparian management with riparian utility and incorporate the aims of riparian management in

3468,microbiomes play fundamental roles in ecological function of peatlands despite the confirmed role of hydrology in the modulation of microbial communities in peatlands its impact on microbial functional groups involved in methane cycle has remained poorly defined particularly at subtropical peatlands to this end prokaryotic communities and methane related functional groups from two peat profiles were investigated in the dajiuhu peatland a subtropical peatland in central china via high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna genes quantitative pcr and clone library construction for functional genes for methanogens mcra and methanotrophs pmoa results showed that depth to water table dwt indicator for water table variation significantly impacted the vertical distribution of prokaryotic communities especially acidobacteria and bathyarchaeota and methane functional groups fenc rc i and rrc i dominated methanogens in middle and bottom samples of the profiles whereas methylocystis dominated methanotrophic communities in surface and middle samples quantitatively methanogens decreased with increasing dwt whereas reverse pattern was seen for methanotrophs aerobic or anaerobic otus clustered into different modules in the co occurrence network indicating a strongly oxygen dependent niche preference collectively our observations demonstrated important ecological regulation of dwt on prokaryotes and ch4 related microbiomes in subtropical peatlands which expanding our understanding of microbial responses and ch4 cycles in the context of environmental changes globally keywords depth to water table microbiomes mcra pmoa the dajiuhu peatland 1 introduction globally peatlands store approximately 1 055 gt carbon with only about 3 of the global land area and play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle amesbury et al 2019 nichols and peteet 2019 global inventories suggest that peatlands are important net methane ch4 sources and microbial ch4 from long term waterlogged anaerobic peat is the dominant biogenic source of ch4 worldwide feng et al 2020 methanogenesis and methanotrophy significantly affect the methane cycling processes from peatland ecosystems mcnicol et al 2020 putkinen et al 2018 both processes are impacted by changes in the microenvironment and global climate hutchins et al 2019 wang et al 2017 it has been estimated that methanogenesis is one of the anaerobic terminal pathways carried out by methanogens that belong to the euryarchaeota in anaerobic zones in peatlands godin et al 2012 about 30 of biogenic ch4 is subsequently consumed in aerobic zones by methanotrophy especially the methanotrophs affiliated with proteobacteria thus lessening ch4 release into the atmosphere deng et al 2013 therefore methane emission from peatlands mainly depends on the balance between methane production and oxidation this delicate balance is mediated by the composition abundance and activity of methanogens and methanotrophs under various environmental conditions yrjälä et al 2011 methanogenic and methanotrophic communities in natural peatlands are mainly impacted by temperature and the depth to water table segers 1998 increasing temperature can enhance the ch4 flux and modulate methanogenesis and methanogenic communities and meanwhile ch4 oxidation potential also displays a strong response to temperature in diverse northern peatlands drollinger et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 nevertheless methane metabolism in tropical peatlands is more sensitive to variations in the depth to water table rather than temperature gauges of low depth to water table may promote ch4 production and hinder ch4 oxidation furukawa et al 2005 or vice versa inubushi et al 2005 high saturation of tropical peatlands driven by hydrological dynamics can cause anaerobiosis thus triggers methanogenesis and suppresses methanotrophy bridgham et al 2013 girkin et al 2018 habitats modulating the microbial ch4 cycle have been extensively documented in the tropical sakabe et al 2018 and northern 40 north latitude rinne et al 2018 peat ecosystems but considerably less attention has been paid to subtropical peatlands due to their limited development under subtropical climate condition nevertheless in consideration of the special geographic location and climate conditions of subtropical peatlands the primary environmental driver and the driving mechanism of the methane cycle may differ from those in other climatic zones insights of the above mentioned issues in subtropical peatland will help us to better understand the microbial mediated methane cycle in peatland ecosystems globally the site of this study the subtropical dajiuhu peatland is subject to the east asian summer monsoon with temperature and precipitation maximizing in the summer the primary impact of the temperature or dwt variation on methane cycle or how they impacting on methane related microbial functional groups still remain unresolved to explore potential environmental responses of microbial functional groups involved in the methane cycle the structures and abundances of the methane functional communities were investigated via functional marker genes for methanogens mcra methylcoenzyme m reductase enzyme luton et al 2002 and methanotrophs pmoa particulate methane monooxygenase enzyme theisen and murrell 2005 additionally bacterial and archaeal communities were characterized by high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene and the relationships between microbial communities and environmental factors were also examined our results demonstrate microbial response particularly microbial functional groups involving in methane cycling to hydrological variation in the subtropical peatland

negative correlation with dwt whereas actinobacteria acidobacteria α proteobacteria nitrospirae and spirochaetes were positively correlated with dwt p 0 05 these trends showed a good consistency with microbial clusters in relation to the dwt fig s2 moreover the relative abundance of obligate anaerobes and aerobes showed reverse correlations with dwt and do along the profiles fig 2 specifically obligate anaerobes decreased with the increase of dwt fig 2a and do fig 2c and this trend was reversed for obligate aerobic groups fig 2b 2d furthermore the predicted microbial functions also showed a fundamental vertical variation pattern fig 3 specifically the methanogenesis sulfur respiration manganese respiration and fumarate respiration increased with the decreased dwt fig 3a2 3a7 3a8 3a9 whereas aerobic metabolism such as nitrification nitrite oxidation and methanotrophy showed an opposite tendency fig 3a3 3a4 3a5 3 3 methanogenic and methanotrophic communities along the profiles a total of 16 clone libraries of the mcra and pmoa genes were constructed and 1 156 clone sequences table s3 s4 were analyzed after quality control and chimeric removal the rice cluster i rc i dominated methanogenic communities along the profiles 29 49 followed by fen cluster fc and related rice cluster i rrc i which accounted for 25 76 and 18 19 of mcra clone sequences respectively fig 4 a table s3 other groups methanoregulaceae unknown methanogens methanosaetaceae unknown family of methanomicrobiales and methanocellaceae contributed 9 21 5 81 5 81 3 07 and 2 65 of methanogenic communities respectively dominant groups in methanogenic communities clearly shifted from fc methanoregulaceae unknown family of methanomicrobiales and unknown methanogens in surface samples pa1 and pb1 to rc i rrc i and fc in the middle and bottom samples type ii methanotrophs affiliated with α proteobacteria contributed 66 84 of pmoa clones especially in the surface 88 67 and middle 75 86 samples methylocystis was the major member of type ii with a relative abundance of 98 67 methanotroph type i affiliated with γ proteobacteria mainly occurred in the subsurface 80 65 methylospira accounted for

of methanogens significantly decreased with increase of dwt and do fig 5 a 5c whereas reverse patterns were observed in methanotrophs fig 5b 5d 3 4 microbial co occurrence networks along the profiles three co occurrence networks were constructed based on correlation relationships among otu relative abundances microbial network of the prokaryotic communities average degree 6 25 clustering coefficient 0 57 and average path length 6 24 table s6 contained 126 nodes linked by 394 edges fig 6 a which was dominated by proteobacteria bathyarchaeota acidobacteria and euryarchaeota network showed a high structural modularity 0 75 which included 9 modules interestingly the nodes in modules 2 3 6 and 9 were mostly anaerobic whereas those in modules 1 4 5 7 and 8 were mainly aerobic groups fig 6d further analysis showed that most nodes in anaerobic modules were related to the deep samples with 14 cm dwt whereas those in aerobic nodes mainly related to the surface samples with 63 cm dwt fig 6e occurrence networks of methanogens and methanotrophs with network diameter 3 1 network density 0 11 0 11 average degree 3 47 2 5 clustering coefficient 0 93 1 and average path length 1 78 1 table s6 contained 34 and 24 nodes linked by 59 and 30 edges fig 6b 6c respectively which were consistent with the distribution of methanogenic and methanotrophic communities along the profiles fig 4a 4b specifically methanogenic otus affiliated with fenc rc i and rrc i from pa b3 6 10 samples dominated the mcra network fig 6b whereas methanotrophic otus in pa b10 samples separated completely from the pmoa network affiliated with methylocystis fig 6c 3 5 correlation between microbial communities and environmental variables rda analysis indicated that dwt was the only factor among all the environmental variables investigated which significantly controlling the distribution of total microbial communities p 0 006 f 4 4 with an explanation of 42 60 of the variance fig 7 a in total 74 33 variance in microbial communities was explained by pc1 and pc2 fig 7a as for the methanogenic communities cca result showed that 39 62 of the variance was explained by pc1 and pc2 fig 7b again dwt was the unique factor that significantly impacted on methanogens p 0 002 f 1 4 with an explanation of 19 10 fig 7b in contrast the concentration of ch4 exclusively shaped methanotrophs p 0 034 f 2 0 significantly with an explanation of 25 00 fig 7c pc1 and pc2 explained 30 68 and 25 44 of the variance in methanotrophic communities respectively fig 7c 4 discussion 4 1 the impact of hydrological variations on microbiomes at the subtropical peatland environmental variables play fundamental roles in the selection of microorganisms across different peat microhabitats jackson et al 2008 in particular hydrological variation controlled by fluctuation of the dwt directly results in changes in dissolved oxygen concentration in peat sediments which subsequently massively impact the composition structure and succession of microbiomes mäkiranta et al 2009 low dissolved o2 concentration under high water level results in anoxic anaerobic conditions which inhibits obligate aerobes gao et al 2011 via suppressing aerobic respiration growth and replication jaatinen et al 2008 raymond and segrè 2006 in contrast high dissolved o2 concentrations under low water table conditions can stop anaerobic metabolism and cause inactivation of obligate anaerobes lu et al 2011 increased relative abundance of anaerobic bathyarchaeota yu et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 from o2 rich to o2 poor peat layers in pa b samples confirmed their adaptation to anoxic habitats whereas the relative abundance of aerobic actinobacteria den hengst and buttner 2008 showed an opposite pattern these observations further corroborated the fundamental control of the dwt on prokaryotic communities by regulating oxygen concentration of peat and tally with the variation pattern of the relative abundance of aerobes and anaerobes to total prokaryotes fig 2 the rda results fig 7a showed that dwt was the only factor that significantly controlled the prokaryotes in the dajiuhu peatland this finding strongly supported the fundamental role of dwt in shaping the structure and distribution of prokaryotic communities in peatland furthermore the network analysis demonstrated prokaryotic communities divided into anaerobic and aerobic modules with their relative abundance responding to variations of dwt basically among the anaerobic modules methanobacteriales geobacter koribacteraceae bathyarchaeota and syntrophobacterales all adapted to anaerobic microhabitats under flooded peat layers morrison et al 2020 treby et al 2020 occupied the dominant network nodes and increased in abundance below the water table at decreasing dwt values for aerobic modules burkholderiales methylophilales methylocystaceae methylosinus pseudomonadales and pseudonocardiaceae mainly active in dry peat kip et al 2012 dominated the aerobic nodes consistent with high proportion of aerobic modules above the water table therefore oxygen dependent network also suggested that the water table shaped the distribution of prokaryotic communities 4 2 vertical distribution pattern of microbial functional groups involving in methane cycling as typical anaerobic and aerobic representatives methanogens and methanotrophs play the important roles in methane cycling in the peatland ecosystem peltoniemi et al 2016 decreased mcra abundance upward peat profiles showed a negative correlation with dwt and dissolved o2 concentration fig 5a 5c in keeping with the results in northern peatlands martí et al 2015 a clear vertical variation in methanogenic composition and pathway was also observed along our profiles which echoed results in northern peatlands cadillo quiroz et al 2006 sun et al 2012 methanogens in the middle and bottom samples were mainly affiliated with rc i rrc i and fenc fig 4a which have a h2 co2 dependent pathway for ch4 production galand et al 2005 and are widespread in siberian and arctic peatlands høj et al 2008 kotsyurbenko et al 2004 in anaerobic peat layers h2 and hcooh formic acid are formed in glucose xylose or n acetylglucosamine supplemented microcosms and they concurrently contribute to acetogenesis and methanogenesis hamberger et al 2008 hunger et al 2011 schmidt et al 2016 long term stability of anaerobic conditions in waterlogged habitats favors for the dominance of rc i rrc i and fc groups however methanogenic communities in the surface samples differed remarkably from those in subsurface peat which were dominated by methanocellales methanoregulaceae and fenc these shifts in the composition are attributed to varying conditions in the upper micro habitats which can be seriously disturbed by hydrological fluctuations the cca result demonstrated that dwt controlled the vertical distribution of methanogens which has been confirmed in a study of rewetting peat recovery process emsens et al 2020 contrary to methanogens the methanotrophic pmoa abundance decreased downward in the profiles and coincided with the decrease in dwt and dissolved o2 concentration fig 5b 5d similar trends have also been found in a temperate highland swamp christiansen et al 2019 and constructed wetland zhang et al 2020 as to the composition and distribution of methanotrophic communities the surface and middle samples were dominated by methylocystis type ii methanotroph whereas the bottom samples were predominated by type i methanotrophs fig 4b type ii methanotrophs are believed to prefer high concentration of methane and low dissolved o2 content arai et al 2014 belova et al 2011 which is consistent with our results of ch4 and o2 concentrations along the peat profiles the concentration of ch4 peaked in the middle samples pa b3 and pa b6 with low dissolved o2 concentrations favoring the type ii methanotrophs down to the bottom of the profiles microbial activities decreased as confirmed by the low concentration of ch4 produced by methanogens the low concentration of methane subsequently selected for type i methanotrophs arai et al 2014 chen et al 2008 which agreed with the cca result that methane concentration shaped the distribution of methanotrophic communities in the dajiuhu peatland similar distribution patterns of methanotrophic communities have been also found in the zoige peatland deng et al 2013 bakchar bog and sphagnum peat from northeastern germany dedysh et al 2003 the dominance of type ii methanotrophs in surface samples did not coincide with the low ch4 concentration and high o2 concentration this discrepancy may result from the endosymbiotic methanotrophs with sphagnum dominated by type ii methanotrophs putkinen et al 2014 surface peat samples were the most recent decaying sphagnum at the dajiuhu peatland which may keep the dominance of the symbiotic microbiomes to some extent further confirmation of this observation will benefit our understanding on the vertical distribution of methanotroph and their contribution of methane consumption 4 3 implication for the construction of palaeo hydrological variation as discussed above dwt is of significance in shaping prokaryotes involved in methane cycling in peatland ecosystems as well as modulating responses of obligate aerobes and anaerobes to the variation of dwt these relationships may endow microorganisms to serve as indicators to oxic anoxic conditions related to low high water table for example the increased abundances of α proteobacteria γ proteobacteria and actinobacteria suggest ingress of oxygen and decreased water table level mishra et al 2014 tian et al 2019 whereas δ proteobacteria and chloroflexi are specific indicators for anoxic conditions and high water table level tian et al 2019 urbanová and bárta 2016 in peatland ecosystems microbial hopanoid biomarkers can track the palaeohydrological variations relevant to hopanoid fluxes in peatland ecosystems pearson et al 2009 wang and huang 2019 xie et al 2013 these biomarkers are mainly 90 to 94 from aerobic microbes and can be preserved over geological time scale hopanoid lipids cannot provide taxonomic information on microbiomes and their metabolic functions in peat ecosystems combination of hopanoid biomarker lipids for obligate aerobes anaerobes with ancient dna for microbial indicators of aerobic anaerobic conditions would open a new window to decipher the variation in the water table peatland development and evolution of microbial functions our efforts build up a bridge which links microbial functional groups and specific environmental conditions and offer us a great opportunity to reconstruct the variation of paleo environmental condition over the geological history 5 conclusions in summary we confirmed the fundamental role of the water table in establishing and sustaining the microbiomes as well as microbial functional groups in a subtropical peatland ecosystem dwt exclusively shaped total microbial communities and methanogenic communities whereas ch4 concentrations contributed more in the construction of methanotrophic communities both dissolved oxygen and dwt impacted on the absolute abundances of methanogens methanotrophs negatively positively microbial niche differentiation based on aerobic anaerobic conditions was also confirmed by aerobic anaerobic modules in the co occurrence network coupled with variations of the relative abundances of obligate aerobes anaerobes our results for the first time decipher the environmental driver controlling different microbial functional groups in the dajiuhu peatland furthermore the identification of the relationship between dwt and aerobes anaerobes may offer a new

3468,microbiomes play fundamental roles in ecological function of peatlands despite the confirmed role of hydrology in the modulation of microbial communities in peatlands its impact on microbial functional groups involved in methane cycle has remained poorly defined particularly at subtropical peatlands to this end prokaryotic communities and methane related functional groups from two peat profiles were investigated in the dajiuhu peatland a subtropical peatland in central china via high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna genes quantitative pcr and clone library construction for functional genes for methanogens mcra and methanotrophs pmoa results showed that depth to water table dwt indicator for water table variation significantly impacted the vertical distribution of prokaryotic communities especially acidobacteria and bathyarchaeota and methane functional groups fenc rc i and rrc i dominated methanogens in middle and bottom samples of the profiles whereas methylocystis dominated methanotrophic communities in surface and middle samples quantitatively methanogens decreased with increasing dwt whereas reverse pattern was seen for methanotrophs aerobic or anaerobic otus clustered into different modules in the co occurrence network indicating a strongly oxygen dependent niche preference collectively our observations demonstrated important ecological regulation of dwt on prokaryotes and ch4 related microbiomes in subtropical peatlands which expanding our understanding of microbial responses and ch4 cycles in the context of environmental changes globally keywords depth to water table microbiomes mcra pmoa the dajiuhu peatland 1 introduction globally peatlands store approximately 1 055 gt carbon with only about 3 of the global land area and play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle amesbury et al 2019 nichols and peteet 2019 global inventories suggest that peatlands are important net methane ch4 sources and microbial ch4 from long term waterlogged anaerobic peat is the dominant biogenic source of ch4 worldwide feng et al 2020 methanogenesis and methanotrophy significantly affect the methane cycling processes from peatland ecosystems mcnicol et al 2020 putkinen et al 2018 both processes are impacted by changes in the microenvironment and global climate hutchins et al 2019 wang et al 2017 it has been estimated that methanogenesis is one of the anaerobic terminal pathways carried out by methanogens that belong to the euryarchaeota in anaerobic zones in peatlands godin et al 2012 about 30 of biogenic ch4 is subsequently consumed in aerobic zones by methanotrophy especially the methanotrophs affiliated with proteobacteria thus lessening ch4 release into the atmosphere deng et al 2013 therefore methane emission from peatlands mainly depends on the balance between methane production and oxidation this delicate balance is mediated by the composition abundance and activity of methanogens and methanotrophs under various environmental conditions yrjälä et al 2011 methanogenic and methanotrophic communities in natural peatlands are mainly impacted by temperature and the depth to water table segers 1998 increasing temperature can enhance the ch4 flux and modulate methanogenesis and methanogenic communities and meanwhile ch4 oxidation potential also displays a strong response to temperature in diverse northern peatlands drollinger et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 nevertheless methane metabolism in tropical peatlands is more sensitive to variations in the depth to water table rather than temperature gauges of low depth to water table may promote ch4 production and hinder ch4 oxidation furukawa et al 2005 or vice versa inubushi et al 2005 high saturation of tropical peatlands driven by hydrological dynamics can cause anaerobiosis thus triggers methanogenesis and suppresses methanotrophy bridgham et al 2013 girkin et al 2018 habitats modulating the microbial ch4 cycle have been extensively documented in the tropical sakabe et al 2018 and northern 40 north latitude rinne et al 2018 peat ecosystems but considerably less attention has been paid to subtropical peatlands due to their limited development under subtropical climate condition nevertheless in consideration of the special geographic location and climate conditions of subtropical peatlands the primary environmental driver and the driving mechanism of the methane cycle may differ from those in other climatic zones insights of the above mentioned issues in subtropical peatland will help us to better understand the microbial mediated methane cycle in peatland ecosystems globally the site of this study the subtropical dajiuhu peatland is subject to the east asian summer monsoon with temperature and precipitation maximizing in the summer the primary impact of the temperature or dwt variation on methane cycle or how they impacting on methane related microbial functional groups still remain unresolved to explore potential environmental responses of microbial functional groups involved in the methane cycle the structures and abundances of the methane functional communities were investigated via functional marker genes for methanogens mcra methylcoenzyme m reductase enzyme luton et al 2002 and methanotrophs pmoa particulate methane monooxygenase enzyme theisen and murrell 2005 additionally bacterial and archaeal communities were characterized by high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene and the relationships between microbial communities and environmental factors were also examined our results demonstrate microbial response particularly microbial functional groups involving in methane cycling to hydrological variation in the subtropical peatland ecosystems and thus contribute new knowledge to ch4 cycles of global peatlands 2 experimental procedures 2 1 site description and sample collection the dajiuhu peatland 31 28 50 n 110 00 09 e locates

the pa and pb profiles acidobacteria 17 50 and bathyarchaeota 14 40 showed obvious changes with dwt as also same other phyla with a relative abundance over 1 which included actinobacteria euryarchaeota α proteobacteria unassigned groups nitrospirae and spirochaetes fig 1 to be noted bathyarchaeota r 0 92 p 0 01 fig 1a1 and euryarchaeota r 0 71 p 0 01 fig 1a9 showed significantly negative correlation with dwt whereas actinobacteria acidobacteria α proteobacteria nitrospirae and spirochaetes were positively correlated with dwt p 0 05 these trends showed a good consistency with microbial clusters in relation to the dwt fig s2 moreover the relative abundance of obligate anaerobes and aerobes showed reverse correlations with dwt and do along the profiles fig 2 specifically obligate anaerobes decreased with the increase of dwt fig 2a and do fig 2c and this trend was reversed for obligate aerobic groups fig 2b 2d furthermore the predicted microbial functions also showed a fundamental vertical variation pattern fig 3 specifically the methanogenesis sulfur respiration manganese respiration and fumarate respiration increased with the decreased dwt fig 3a2 3a7 3a8 3a9 whereas aerobic metabolism such as nitrification nitrite oxidation and methanotrophy showed an opposite tendency fig 3a3 3a4 3a5 3 3 methanogenic and methanotrophic communities along the profiles a total of 16 clone libraries of the mcra and pmoa genes were constructed and 1 156 clone sequences table s3 s4 were analyzed after quality control and chimeric removal the rice cluster i rc i dominated methanogenic communities along the profiles 29 49 followed by fen cluster fc and related rice cluster i rrc i which accounted for 25 76 and 18 19 of mcra clone sequences respectively fig 4 a table s3 other groups methanoregulaceae unknown methanogens methanosaetaceae unknown family of methanomicrobiales and methanocellaceae contributed 9 21 5 81 5 81 3 07 and 2 65 of methanogenic communities respectively dominant groups in methanogenic communities clearly shifted from fc methanoregulaceae unknown family of methanomicrobiales and unknown methanogens in surface samples pa1 and pb1 to rc i rrc i and fc in the middle and bottom samples type ii methanotrophs affiliated with α proteobacteria contributed 66 84 of pmoa clones especially in the surface 88 67 and middle 75 86 samples methylocystis was the major member of type ii with a relative abundance of 98 67 methanotroph type i affiliated with γ proteobacteria mainly occurred in the subsurface 80 65 methylospira accounted for 55 61 of type i methanotrophs followed by methylobacter methylomonas unknown type i and unknown genus in methylococcaceae with a relative abundance of 19 25 14 44 5 88 and 4 81 respectively fig 4b table s4 the mcra and pmoa gene copy numbers varied from 6 10 104 to 1 30 106 and 1 20 107 to 1 93 104 copies per ng dna from surface to bottom along profiles respectively table s5 gene copy numbers of methanogens significantly decreased with increase of dwt and do fig 5 a 5c whereas reverse patterns were observed in methanotrophs fig 5b 5d 3 4 microbial co occurrence networks along the profiles three co occurrence networks were constructed based on correlation relationships among otu relative abundances microbial network of the prokaryotic communities average degree 6 25 clustering coefficient 0 57 and average path length 6 24 table s6 contained 126 nodes linked by 394 edges fig 6 a which was dominated by proteobacteria bathyarchaeota acidobacteria and euryarchaeota network showed a high structural modularity 0 75 which included 9 modules interestingly the nodes in modules 2 3 6 and 9 were mostly anaerobic whereas those in modules 1 4 5 7 and 8 were mainly aerobic groups fig 6d further analysis showed that most nodes in anaerobic modules were related to the deep samples with 14 cm dwt whereas those in aerobic nodes mainly related to the surface samples with 63 cm dwt fig 6e occurrence networks of methanogens and methanotrophs with network diameter 3 1 network density 0 11 0 11 average degree 3 47 2 5 clustering coefficient 0 93 1 and average path length 1 78 1 table s6 contained 34 and 24 nodes linked by 59 and 30 edges fig 6b 6c respectively which were consistent with the distribution of methanogenic and methanotrophic communities along the profiles fig 4a 4b specifically methanogenic otus affiliated with fenc rc i and rrc i from pa b3 6 10 samples dominated the mcra network fig 6b whereas methanotrophic otus in pa b10 samples separated completely from the pmoa network affiliated with methylocystis fig 6c 3 5 correlation between microbial communities and environmental variables rda analysis indicated that dwt was the only factor among all the environmental variables investigated which significantly controlling the distribution of total microbial communities p 0 006 f 4 4 with an explanation of 42 60 of the variance fig 7 a in total 74 33 variance in microbial communities was explained by pc1 and pc2 fig 7a as for the methanogenic communities cca result showed that 39 62 of the variance was explained by pc1 and pc2 fig 7b again dwt was the unique factor that significantly impacted on methanogens p 0 002 f 1 4 with an explanation of 19 10 fig 7b in contrast the concentration of ch4 exclusively shaped methanotrophs p 0 034 f 2 0 significantly with an explanation of 25 00 fig 7c pc1 and pc2 explained 30 68 and 25 44 of the variance in methanotrophic communities respectively fig 7c 4 discussion 4 1 the impact of hydrological variations on microbiomes at the subtropical peatland environmental variables play fundamental roles in the selection of microorganisms across different peat microhabitats jackson et al 2008 in particular hydrological variation controlled by fluctuation of the dwt directly results in changes in dissolved oxygen concentration in peat sediments which subsequently massively impact the composition structure and succession of microbiomes mäkiranta et al 2009 low dissolved o2 concentration under high water level results in anoxic anaerobic conditions which inhibits obligate aerobes gao et al 2011 via suppressing aerobic respiration growth and replication jaatinen et al 2008 raymond and segrè 2006 in contrast high dissolved o2 concentrations under low water table conditions can stop anaerobic metabolism and cause inactivation of obligate anaerobes lu et al 2011 increased relative abundance of anaerobic bathyarchaeota yu et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 from o2 rich to o2 poor peat layers in pa b samples confirmed their adaptation to anoxic habitats whereas the relative abundance of aerobic actinobacteria den hengst and buttner 2008 showed an opposite pattern these observations further corroborated the fundamental control of the dwt on prokaryotic communities by regulating oxygen concentration of peat and tally with the variation pattern of the relative abundance of aerobes and anaerobes to total prokaryotes fig 2 the rda results fig 7a showed that dwt was the only factor that significantly controlled the prokaryotes in the dajiuhu peatland this finding strongly supported the fundamental role of dwt in shaping the structure and distribution of prokaryotic communities in peatland furthermore the network analysis demonstrated prokaryotic communities divided into anaerobic and aerobic modules with their relative abundance responding to variations of dwt basically among the anaerobic modules methanobacteriales geobacter koribacteraceae bathyarchaeota and syntrophobacterales all adapted to anaerobic microhabitats under flooded peat layers morrison et al 2020 treby et al 2020 occupied the dominant network nodes and increased in abundance below the water table at decreasing dwt values for aerobic modules burkholderiales methylophilales methylocystaceae methylosinus pseudomonadales and pseudonocardiaceae mainly active in dry peat kip et al 2012 dominated the aerobic nodes consistent with high proportion of aerobic modules above the water table therefore oxygen dependent network also suggested that the water table shaped the distribution of prokaryotic communities 4 2 vertical distribution pattern of microbial functional groups involving in methane cycling as typical anaerobic and aerobic representatives methanogens and methanotrophs play the important roles in methane cycling in the peatland ecosystem peltoniemi et al 2016 decreased mcra abundance upward peat profiles showed a negative correlation with dwt and dissolved o2 concentration fig 5a 5c in keeping with the results in northern peatlands martí et al 2015 a clear vertical variation in methanogenic composition and pathway was also observed along our profiles which echoed results in northern peatlands cadillo quiroz et al 2006 sun et al 2012 methanogens in the middle and bottom samples were mainly affiliated with rc i rrc i and fenc fig 4a which have a h2 co2 dependent pathway for ch4 production galand et al 2005 and are widespread in siberian and arctic peatlands høj et al 2008 kotsyurbenko et al 2004 in anaerobic peat layers h2 and hcooh formic acid are formed in glucose xylose or n acetylglucosamine supplemented microcosms and they concurrently contribute to acetogenesis and methanogenesis hamberger et al 2008 hunger et al 2011 schmidt et al 2016 long term stability of anaerobic conditions in waterlogged habitats favors for the dominance of rc i rrc i and fc groups however methanogenic communities in the surface samples differed remarkably from those in subsurface peat which were dominated by methanocellales methanoregulaceae and fenc these shifts in the composition are attributed to varying conditions in the upper micro habitats which can be seriously disturbed by hydrological fluctuations the cca result demonstrated that dwt controlled the vertical distribution of methanogens which has been confirmed in a study of rewetting peat recovery process emsens et al 2020 contrary to methanogens the methanotrophic pmoa abundance decreased downward in the profiles and coincided with the decrease in dwt and dissolved o2 concentration fig 5b 5d similar trends have also been found in a temperate highland swamp christiansen et al 2019 and constructed wetland zhang et al 2020 as to the composition and distribution of methanotrophic communities the surface and middle samples were dominated by methylocystis type ii methanotroph whereas the bottom samples were predominated by type i methanotrophs fig 4b type ii methanotrophs are believed to prefer high concentration of methane and low dissolved o2 content arai et al 2014 belova et al 2011 which is consistent with our results of ch4 and o2 concentrations along the peat profiles the concentration of ch4 peaked in the middle samples pa b3 and pa b6 with low dissolved o2 concentrations favoring the type ii methanotrophs down to the bottom of the profiles microbial activities decreased as confirmed by the low concentration of ch4 produced by methanogens the low concentration of methane subsequently selected for type i methanotrophs arai et al 2014 chen et al 2008 which agreed with the cca result that methane concentration shaped the distribution of methanotrophic communities in the dajiuhu peatland similar distribution patterns of methanotrophic communities have been also found in the zoige peatland deng et al 2013 bakchar bog and sphagnum peat from northeastern germany dedysh et al 2003 the dominance of type ii methanotrophs in surface samples did not coincide with the low ch4 concentration and high o2 concentration this discrepancy may result from the endosymbiotic methanotrophs with sphagnum dominated by type ii methanotrophs putkinen et al 2014 surface peat samples were the most recent decaying sphagnum at the dajiuhu peatland which may keep the dominance of the symbiotic microbiomes to some extent further confirmation of this observation will benefit our understanding on the vertical distribution of methanotroph and their contribution of methane consumption 4 3 implication for the construction of palaeo hydrological variation as discussed above dwt is of significance in shaping prokaryotes involved in methane cycling in peatland ecosystems as well as modulating responses of obligate aerobes and anaerobes to the variation of dwt these relationships may endow microorganisms to serve as indicators to oxic anoxic conditions related to low high water table for example the increased abundances of α proteobacteria γ proteobacteria and actinobacteria suggest ingress of oxygen and decreased water table level mishra et al 2014 tian et al 2019 whereas δ proteobacteria and chloroflexi are specific indicators for anoxic conditions and high water table level tian et al 2019 urbanová and bárta 2016 in peatland ecosystems microbial hopanoid biomarkers can track the palaeohydrological variations relevant to hopanoid fluxes in peatland ecosystems pearson et al 2009 wang and huang 2019 xie et al 2013 these biomarkers are mainly 90 to 94 from aerobic microbes and can be preserved over geological time scale hopanoid lipids cannot provide taxonomic information on microbiomes and their metabolic functions in peat ecosystems combination of hopanoid biomarker lipids for obligate aerobes anaerobes with ancient dna for microbial indicators of aerobic anaerobic conditions would open a new window to decipher the variation in the water table peatland development and evolution of microbial functions our efforts build up a bridge which links microbial functional groups and specific environmental conditions and offer us a great opportunity to reconstruct the variation of paleo environmental condition over the geological history 5 conclusions in summary we confirmed the fundamental role of the water table in establishing and sustaining the microbiomes as well as microbial functional groups in a subtropical peatland ecosystem dwt exclusively shaped total microbial communities and methanogenic communities whereas ch4 concentrations contributed more in the construction of methanotrophic communities both dissolved oxygen and dwt impacted on the absolute abundances of methanogens methanotrophs negatively positively microbial niche differentiation based on aerobic anaerobic conditions was also confirmed by aerobic anaerobic modules in the co occurrence network coupled with variations of the relative abundances of obligate aerobes anaerobes our results for the first time decipher the environmental driver controlling different microbial functional groups in the dajiuhu peatland furthermore the identification of the relationship between dwt and aerobes anaerobes may offer a new

in chief with the assistance of andres iroume associate editor partitioning evapotranspiration et into evaporation e and plant transpiration t is key to understanding ecosystem responses to rainfall variability resulting from climate change the goal of this study was to quantify t and e using eddy covariance ec flux measurements in a tallgrass prairie in consecutive growing seasons with contrasting rainfall regimes the field measurements were conducted at the national ecological observatory network neon konz site in kansas u s during the growing seasons of 2017 2018 and 2019 the et partitioning was performed using an approach based on the concept of the underlying water use efficiency uwue to evaluate the uwue approach we compared daily e estimates obtained from the uwue with e observations provided by microlysimeters ml green chromatic coordinate gcc was used to monitor the vegetation dynamics in the 2017 growing season the total rainfall was 23 1 below the site s long term average cumulative precipitation on the other hand in 2018 and 2019 the accumulated growing season precipitations were 7 2 and 40 2 respectively above the long term precipitation average the relationship between uwue approach and ml e measurements showed a pearson correlation coefficient r of 0 42 and a root mean square error rmse of 0 58 mm d 1 the lowest t et average value 0 50 was observed in the 2017 growing season while the largest t et average 0 65 was observed in 2018 the correlations between gcc and t et were reduced during the growing seasons that experienced drought periods air temperature was the main environmental driver of t et during the wet growing seasons r 0 49 and 0 72 the subsurface soil moisture 0 45 m was the main environmental driver of t et during a dry growing season r 0 41 these results demonstrate that the precipitation variability not only has a direct impact on the et components but also modulates the response of those components to other environmental drivers since et partitioning studies at the ecosystem scale are still scarce our results can improve t et and water use efficiency estimates in long term modelling studies this will help to better understand how et in ecosystems will respond to global warming and increased co2 concentration during wet and dry growing seasons keywords evapotranspiration partitioning rainfall variability underlying water use efficiency eddy covariance grasslands 1 introduction the grasslands in the u s great plains are subject to highly variable precipitation jones et al 2016 o connor et al 2020 recent studies report an increase in the frequency of large rainfall events 25 4 mm for the period of 1979 2009 over the central u s groisman et al 2012 and forecast an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events due to climate change kirchmeier young and zhang 2020 since rainfall variability has been identified as the main environmental driver of water and carbon fluxes in grasslands chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 predicted changes in the rainfall regime will likely lead to significant changes in grassland structure and function especially during dry years felton et al 2020 evapotranspiration et is a key variable linking the carbon water and energy cycles in ecosystems fisher et al 2017 as well as a leading indicator of ecosystem responses to rainfall variability and flash droughts rajan et al 2015 yue et al 2019 anderson et al 2013 however the magnitude of et primary components abiotic evaporation e and leaf transpiration t has distinct responses to biophysical variables berg and sheffield 2019 for instance e is inversely proportional to canopy cover which reduces surface wind speed and attenuates the incoming solar radiation reaching the soil surface song et al 2018 conversely the contribution of t to et t et tends to increase with canopy cover and is also governed by plant phenology wang et al 2014 rigden et al 2018 scott et al 2021 furthermore the responses of the et components to rainfall are dependent on the frequency and magnitude of rain events for example small and frequent rain events that increase soil surface moisture favors e losses while large rainfall events usually increase t et sun et al 2020 zou et al 2015 cavanaugh et al 2011 in the long term climate change is expected to affect the contributions of e and t to the total et differently niu et al 2019 model simulations performed by zhang et al 2016 indicate that the global et trended upwards in the period from 1981 to 2012 the researchers also reported a positive trend in t and a negative trend in e which they attribute to an increase of vegetation leaf area index lai credited to the effect of co2 fertilization in their simulations in addition cmip5 model simulations for the 2071 to 2100 period predict an increase in t et in middle and high latitudes due to the increase in air temperature and reduction in t et in humid tropical regions due to plant responses to higher co2 atmospheric levels berg and sheffield 2019 despite the importance long term global scale et predictions still contain major uncertainties lian et al 2018 field scale et partitioning studies are needed to improve global scale et modeling and to provide insights into the effect of climate change on global water and carbon cycles ecosystem level et partitioning remains challenging given the limitations inherent to the various methods kool et al 2014 for example the sap flow method has been commonly used to measure t at the plant level nelson et al 2020 but this method is impractical in ecosystems with large plant diversity and herbaceous plants williams et al 2004 microlysimeters ml have been used as a standard approach to validate e estimates from other methods or models moran et al 2009 florentin and agam 2017 this method has the advantage of directly measuring changes in soil mass due to evaporation but ml measurements represent a small area 1 m2 and are labor intensive limiting their use in ecosystem studies partitioning et using micrometeorological measurements has the advantage of allowing continuous flux monitoring at scales relevant for ecosystem studies micrometeorological approaches based on the coupling between carbon and water fluxes have been used as an alternative for partitioning et sun et al 2019 stoy et al 2019 these methods are often based on the water use efficiency wue gpp et often determined as the ratio of gross primary productivity gpp to et scott and biederman 2017 proposed a statistical approach to partition monthly et using multi year co2 and water fluxes derived from eddy covariance ec measurements likewise skaggs et al 2018 developed the fluxpart model to partition et and carbon fluxes simultaneously using high frequency ec data however the fluxpart model requires a priori knowledge of wue at the leaf scale which is challenging to obtain in ecosystems with mixed c3 and c4 vegetation such as grasslands zhou et al 2016 developed an et partitioning approach using ec data based on the concept of underlying wue uwue the uwue concept emerged as a modification of the inherent wue approach which considers the non linear effect of vapor pressure deficit vpd on et for the daily wue calculation beer et al 2009 although the correlation between gpp and et is improved by introducing vpd in daily wue calculations zhou et al 2014 still observed a time lag between et and gpp especially at sub daily time scales to correct this time lag zhou et al 2014 developed the uwue model uwue gpp vpd0 5 et in which vpd is corrected by an exponent from the concept of uwue zhou et al 2016 distinguished an apparent uwue uwuea and a potential uwue uwuep which differ by the presence and absence of e respectively hence t et can be estimated by the uwuea uwuep ratio this relatively simple approach has the advantage of allowing the et partitioning at different temporal scales half hourly to annual and has shown satisfactory results when compared to microlysimeters stable isotopes and sap flow zhou et al 2018 bai et al 2019 nelson et al 2020 xu et al 2021 in this study we use a unique flux dataset in three consecutive growing seasons with distinct precipitation totals and distributions to investigate the response of t et to environmental drivers in a tallgrass prairie we hypothesize that grassland t et responses to environmental drivers will vary during wet and dry years to test this hypothesis ec fluxes and the uwue approach were used for partitioning et into e and t the performance of the uwue approach was evaluated by comparing its e estimates with the ones provided by ml 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the field measurements were conducted at the national ecological observatory network neon konz site loescher et al 2014 located at the konza prairie biological station kpbs during the growing seasons may to october of years 2017 2018 and 2019 the kpbs is a 3 487 ha native tallgrass prairie located in the flint hills region in kansas u s 39 05 55 n 96 34 02 w elevation 415 m a s l the region is characterized by a mid continental climate o connor et al 2020 with mean annual air temperature of 13 c and monthly average air temperature ranging from 3 c in january to 27 c in july the mean annual rainfall is 845 mm with about 73 of total annual precipitation occurring between april and september during the growing season towne et al 2014 the predominant vegetation across the kpbs consists of warm season c4 grasses such as andropogon gerardii sorghastrum nutans and schizachyrium scoparium however forbs represent 75 of the species richness towne 2002 the soil at the konz site is classified as fine smectitic mesic pachic udertic argiustolls consisting of 39 0 clay and 4 4 sand and a bulk density of 1 0 g cm 3 at the 0 to 66 cm depth neon 2020 the kpbs is divided into 55 plots or watersheds that include different fire and

maximization fan et al 1990 and spectral corrections for high moncrieff et al 1997 and low moncrieff et al 2005 frequency losses the flux data were screened using quality flags based on the steady state test proposed by mauder and foken 2004 with flag values of 0 1 and 2 corresponding to high moderate and low quality data respectively in this study flux data associated with flag values equal to

values of u thresholds were 0 21 ms 1 for 2017 and 0 24 m s 1 for 2018 and 2019 the quality of the ec data was also assessed by the energy budget closure ebc determined using a linear regression

gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration reco were performed using the reddyproc tool developed by the max planck institute for biogeochemistry wutzler et al 2018 nighttime nee and air temperature measurements were used to parameterize an exponential regression model and extrapolate the reco values to daytime air temperature reichstein et al 2005 so that gpp was calculated by subtracting reco from nee 2 3 flux footprint calculations at the konz site surrounding watersheds under different fire and grazing management practices likely contribute to the observed fluxes fire frequency and grazing can lead to differences in c3 and c4 plant composition in the tallgrass prairie collins and calabrese 2012 and consequently on ecosystem uwue to investigate the influence of each watershed surrounding the tower on the measured fluxes a two dimensional flux footprint parameterization kljun et al 2015 was used to compute the contribution of different watersheds to the measured

a gpp vpd 0 5 et where vpd is the vapor pressure deficit et is the evapotranspiration and t is the transpiration in an ecosystem with uniform vegetation uwuep is identical to the uwue at the leaf scale and assumed to be almost constant under steady state conditions zhou et al 2016 on the other hand uwuea represents the uwue affected by e thus when e is negligible t approximates et t et 1 and uwuea is equal to uwuep under field conditions values of t et are close to unity when the ecosystem vegetation has a high lai and the soil water content in the upper soil layer is low zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 based on the uwuep and uwuea concepts t et and t at the ecosystem level were determined as follows zhou et al 2016 3 t et uwue a uwue p 4 t uwue a uwue p e t following zhou et al 2016 the long term average uwuep was estimated by the 95th quantile regression between half hourly et and gpp vpd0 5 data collected during this study in addition individual uwuep values were estimated for each growing season to test the assumption that uwuep is relatively constant over the years values of uwuea at different timescales daily monthly and seasonal were determined by the linear regression analysis slope between et and gpp vpd0 5 to ensure that gpp is equal to zero when the stomata are closed all regression analysis were performed forcing the regression line through origin in this study values of uwuea and uwuep were determined under daytime conditions incoming solar radiation 20 w m 2 to identify the main environmental elements that drive t et a partial correlation analysis was used to remove the interactions between variables the significance of the partial correlation coefficients was verified by a student s t test at a significance level of 5 li et al 2016 2 6 soil evaporation measurements to evaluate the uwue method daily e was measured using ml during the 2018 growing season the ml were built from polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe with an internal diameter of 10 2 cm and cut at 20 cm in length the bottom edge of the ml was beveled to facilitate insertion into the soil profile a total of 21 ml were inserted in advance between grassland plants to the south of the tower prevailing wind direction with the aid of a rubber mallet to minimize the impact of minor soil disturbances generated during the installation process of the ml in our e measurements the ml were left inserted in the soil for about two weeks that included couple rainfall events rainfall events help restoring the soil surface conditions that may have been disturbed as a consequence of vibrations during the installation process rainfall also helps sealing small gaps between the wall of the ml and the surrounding soil three measurement campaigns were carried out on days without rainfall during august september and october of 2018 at the beginning of each sampling campaign a total of seven ml were carefully excavated using a shovel to minimize disturbances to the soil column inside the ml the ml bottoms were sealed with a plastic film to eliminate drainage losses and to retain the soil column inside the ml for daily weighting seven ml were monitored during each campaign for a period no longer than five days per campaign to maintain soil moisture conditions within the ml similar to its surroundings evett et al 1995 the august 2018 campaign was shortened due the occurrence of rainfall during the seven day sampling period the ml were weighed daily using a digital scale with resolution of 1 g v11p6 ohau usa which translates to an e resolution of 0 13 mm d 1 soil evaporation e mm d 1 was calculated as follows wang and wang 2017 5 e 10 δ w ρ π d 2 2 where δw g is the change in mass of the ml between two measurements ρ is the density of water 1 0 g cm 3 and d is the diameter of the ml cm the relationship between e measured by ml and derived from the uwue approach was evaluated using the root mean square error rmse and pearson s correlation coefficient r 2 7 vegetation dynamics the vegetation dynamics was monitored using the green chromatic coordinate gcc obtained from the phenocam dataset 2 0 seyednasrollah et al 2019 the vegetation images were acquired every 15 min using a digital camera cam sec5ir stardot usa and converted to a three layer rgb array corresponding to red r green g and blue b channels during the image processing a digital number dn associated to each color channel was extracted from a region of interest roi that excludes portions of road and sky richardson 2019 the gcc values for each image was determined from the following equation richardson et al 2007 6 gcc g dn r dn g dn b dn where rdn gdn and bdn are the average red green and blue dn extracted from roi to minimize noise due to the effects of clouds aerosols and fog in scene illumination only 90th percentile values of gcc were used to calculate a 3 day moving average in this study with the daily gcc value attributed to the center of the 3 day moving window sonnentag et al 2012 3 results 3 1 weather conditions over the growing seasons evaluated the highest average tair was observed in 2018 22 1 c followed by 2017 21 7 c and 2019 20 8 c fig 3 a c the mean vpd values were higher in 2017 10 7 hpa and 2018 10 2 hpa compared to the average vpd 8 4 hpa for 2019 fig 3a c the long term 1994 2013 average accumulated precipitation at kpbs during the growing season may to october is 612 mm nippert 2020 in 2017 the total rainfall 470 4 mm was 23 1 below the long term average precipitation and four dry periods with length ranging from 11 to 21 days were recorded fig 3d the dry conditions during the 2017 growing season maintained θ15 and θ 45 close to 0 10 and 0 20 m3 m 3 fig 3d respectively despite the occurrence of two rainfall events above 50 mm d 1 at end of june julian day 180 and early august julian day 217 during 2018 the accumulated growing season precipitation 656 3 mm was 7 2 above the long term average rainfall and the 2018 longest dry period 11 days occurred at the end of growing season fig 3e the 2018 growing season was marked by smaller rainfall events from may to mid august resulting in θ 15 and θ 45 close to 0 10 m3 m 3 during this period fig 3e from mid august 2018 julian day 231 large rainfall events higher than 70 mm raised θ 15 and θ 45 to about 0 40 m3 m 3 in contrast the accumulated growing season precipitation in 2019 858 3 mm was 40 2 above the long term average and the frequent large rainfall events 25 4 mm resulted in θ 15 and θ 45 above or close to 0 40 m3 m 3 throughout the entire growing season fig 3f 3 2 flux footprint and potential uwuep and apparent uwuea underlying water use efficiencies the footprint climatology or aggregated flux footprint estimated for the three growing seasons was overlaid on the watershed map fig 4 most of the measured 30 min fluxes 82 7 originated from the k2a watershed followed by the c3sa 12 5 k20a 2 8 and c3sb 1 1 and k1b 0 5 with a total contribution of 99 6 to the ec fluxes table 2 the overall uwuep throughout all growing seasons was 14 31 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 considering individual growing seasons the largest uwuep was observed in 2018 16 30 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 followed by 2019 13 81 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 and the lowest uwuep was recorded in 2017 11 36 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 the mean uwuea showed a similar pattern as uwuep with yearly values of 7 10 2017 9 33 2018 and 8 86 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 2019 to investigate the effect of the surround watersheds to the estimated uwue the mean uwuep and yearly uwuea were estimated using only 30 min data in which 100 of the measured fluxes originated from the k2a watershed the mean uwuep was 14 57 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 and uwuea values were 7 56 9 55 and 9 37 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 for 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the uwue estimates using only k2a data were similar to the ones obtained using the full ec flux dataset indicating that differences in source area had minor impact on uwuep and uwuea therefore in this study the et partitioning was performed using the entire flux dataset the seasonal dynamics of uwuea was distinct among the growing seasons evaluated fig 5 in 2018 uwuea decreased from the beginning of the growing season until the month of august on the other hand in 2017 and 2019 an opposite trend was observed with an increase of monthly uwuea values from may to july the uwuea for the month of august was similar for all years the end of growing season september and october uwuea values were higher for 2018 in comparison to 2017 and 2019 values 3 3 comparison between uwue and microlysimeter soil evaporation estimates the comparison of daily e values derived from the uwue method and measured by ml is shown in fig 6 the overall average e standard deviation estimated by uwue was 0 73 0 18 mm d 1 while measured e using ml resulted in 1 21 0 36 mm d 1 the relationship between uwue and ml estimates showed a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 42 and rmse of 0 58 mm d 1 in general the uwue method underestimated e rate compared to ml estimates 3 4 seasonal variations of carbon and water fluxes and t et the seasonal variation of carbon and water vapor fluxes was driven by the vegetation phenology and soil moisture conditions at the beginning of the 2017 growing season t and gpp varied widely and reached values close to zero fig 7 a and 7d due to the low rainfall amounts during the 2017 early growing season the grassland alternated from being a carbon source nee 0 and a carbon sink nee 0 at the end of june 2017 days after two large consecutives rainfall events totaling 62 7 mm t gpp and reco peaked at 3 28 mm d 1 10 61 g c m 2 d 1 and 7 38 g c m 2 d 1 respectively in 2018 t gpp and reco were very low during the early growing season but increased rapidly by the end of may fig 7b and 7e reaching the maximum values of 4 40 mm d 1 13 80 g c m 2 d 1 and 9 02 g c m 2 d 1 respectively the ecosystem was a carbon sink until the end of june after that t gpp and reco decreased and the ecosystem alternated from being a carbon sink and a carbon source due to the dry conditions in mid august the ecosystem became a carbon sink after large rainfall events in contrast to 2017 and 2018 growing seasons water and carbon fluxes were closely coupled with the vegetation phenology in 2019 t gpp and reco increased from may to mid july showing maximum values of 4 74 mm d 1 17 01 and 13 18 g c m 2 d 1 respectively fig 7c and f and decreased from mid july until the end of the growing season during 2019 the grassland was mostly a carbon sink from early may until the first half of september the cumulative water vapor and carbon fluxes increased as a function of total rainfall during growing seasons table 3 the grassland acted as a carbon sink during the three years evaluated despite the 2017 growing season drought the lowest and highest cumulative gpp reco nee et and t occurred during 2017 and 2019 respectively while the lowest e was recorded during 2018 the seasonal variation of t et followed the gcc dynamics increasing from early to mid growing seasons and decreasing at the end of growing seasons despite oscillations due to rainfall variability fig 8 a c in the 2017 growing season the gcc showed the lower values fig 8a ranging from 0 33 to 0 39 which resulted in the lowest t et average 0 50 among the years evaluated fig 8a and table 3 the highest t et average 0 65 among the years evaluated occurred in 2018 fig 8b which exhibited gcc values fig 8b between 0 33 and 0 44 the gcc values during 2019 fig 8c were similar to the ones observed in 2018 ranging from 0 32 to 0 44 however the 2019t et average 0 62 was slightly lower than that observed in 2018 the t et peaks were recorded in may 2017 0 95 july 2018 0 97 and july 2019 0 95 while the gcc peaks were observed in may for the three growing seasons fig 8a c the linear regressions analysis between 3 day moving averages of gcc and t et indicated that gcc explained between 34 0 2017 and 58 0 2019 of the t et variability fig 8d f the partial correlation coefficients between t et and several environmental variables are shown in fig 9 in general t et showed higher positive correlations with tair correlation coefficients between t et and tair were all statistically significant p 0 01 and equal to 0 35 2017 0 49 2018 and 0 72 2019 t et was negatively correlated with θ 15 during the 2017 0 32 and 2018 0 20 growing seasons and positively correlated with θ 45 with statistically significant p 0 01 correlation coefficients of 0 41 2017 and 0 25 2018 on the other hand there were no significant correlations between t et and θ 15 and θ 45 during the 2019 growing season rn and vpd did not show significant correlation with t et during the growing seasons evaluated 4 discussion 4 1 annual uwuep and uwuea variation the long term average uwuep value and inter annual uwuep variations found in our study were within the range of values reported for other grassland ecosystems han et al 2018 hu et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 han et al 2018 observed a 10 year uwuep of 14 70 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 with an inter annual maximum difference of 10 1 in relation to mean uwuep for a grassland in inner mongolia china hu et al 2018 evaluated uwuep during three years in a grassland in northern china they found an average uwuep equal to 12 34 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 and an inter annual maximum difference with respect to the mean of 13 5 zhou et al 2016 estimated uwuep for five grassland types using flux datasets ranging from two and six years in different regions of usa they observed that the long term average uwuep ranged between 11 57 and 14 28 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 with an inter annual maximum difference close to 20 0 in our study the relative differences between the annual uwuep and the three year uwuep ranged between 3 5 2019 and 20 6 2017 indicating that except for 2017 which was a dry year uwuep was relatively constant in addition the long term average uwuep estimated excluding the 2017 data 15 10 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 was slightly higher than that estimated using the entire dataset 14 31c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 showing that the 2017 data had a small influence on long term average uwuep previous studies in grasslands showed that uwuea increases during wetter years han et al 2018 and decreases under severe drought hu et al 2018 however a direct relationship between uwuea and drought is not observed for all grassland ecosystems for instance yang et al 2016 showed that in arid ecosystems where wue is controlled by e wue generally increases under drought conditions conversely in semiarid sub humid ecosystems wue increases as function of water availability due to its greater sensitivity of gpp in our study the accumulated gpp during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons were respectively 39 1 and 95 5 higher than the accumulated gpp observed in 2017 on the other hand the accumulated et values during 2018 and 2019 were 8 2 and 59 6 higher than the one recorded in 2017 respectively these results show that wue at the konz site is mainly controlled by gpp however despite gpp in 2019 being the largest among the years evaluated uwuea was higher in 2018 two peculiarities of the 2018 growing season should be considered when interpreting these results the uneven rainfall distribution and spring prescribed burn 03 21 2018 in 2018 lower rainfall values were observed from may to mid august and larger precipitation was recorded after the second half of august fig 3e this distribution of rainfall resulted in a slight increase in gcc fig 8b t fig 7b gpp fig 7e and uwuea fig 5 close to the end of growing season conversely gcc t gpp and uwuea had already declined in 2017 and 2019 at that point of the growing season these results show that not only the rainfall amount but also the timing of the rainfall is important to explain inter annual variability of uwuea in grasslands in addition previous research conducted at kpbs bremer and ham 2010 knapp 1985 johnson and matchett 2001 and other grasslands feldman et al 2004 fischer et al 2012 wagle et al 2019 showed that fire increases the green lai green biomass accumulation and photosynthesis rates these changes are more apparent at the beginning of the growing season in this study uwuea gpp and gcc at the beginning of 2018 figs 5 7e and 8b prescribed burning year were higher than the ones observed in 2019 figs 5 7f and 8c even though the soil water content was much higher in 2019 fig 3f than in the spring of 2018 fig 3e this occurs due to the reduction in shading and the greater solar radiation reaching the soil surface favoring a fast emergence of new shoots knapp and seastedt 1986 moreover prescribed fires result in an increase in the c4 grasses abundance collins and calabrese 2012 which in turn have higher photosynthetic rates and wue nippert et al 2007 4 2 comparison between uwue and microlysimeter soil evaporation estimates previous comparisons between e estimates obtained using the uwue approach and ml conducted in northwest china showed that both methods are capable of capturing e seasonal variability in croplands zhou et al 2018 bai et al 2019 tong et al 2019 however better agreement between these two methods was observed at the peak of the growing season while large differences at the beginning and end of the growing season were observed zhou et al 2018 bai et al 2019 tong et al 2019 according to hirschi et al 2017 there are large differences between daily et estimated using ml and ec measurements yet these methods tend to show greater agreement at the annual scale the rmse of 0 58 mm d 1 for the relationship between e using ml and uwue found in our study is similar to that reported by nelson et al 2020 who estimated t using the uwue approach for several forest ecosystems and obtained rmse ranging from 0 28 to 0 67 mm d 1 for the relationship between uwue estimates and sap flow measurements our results show that the e values measured by ml were usually higher than the uwue approach e estimates fig 6 one explanation for these discrepancies was the fact that we did not consider the plant basal area in our ml e estimates the adjustment for the basal area would reduce the ml daily e values since the effective area undergoing evaporation would be lower than the cross section area of the ml however we estimated the plant basal to be approximately 1 because the plant stems measure around 0 5 to 1 mm in diameter at the site furthermore the ml have a small diameter 10 2 cm and were installed between plants minimizing the number of steams inside the ml therefore using plant basal area to scale ml e estimates would not lead to a significant change in our results another explanation for the discrepancies between the two methods is the spatial variability of e in this ecosystem differences between e estimates from the two methods are expected due to discrepancies in spatial scales of ml and the ec approach kool et al 2014 furthermore variations in the flux footprint size and location over the day may also contribute to differences between e estimated by the two methods evett et al 2012 moorhead et al 2017 the spatial variability of e in complex ecosystem such as the kpbs is difficult to capture using ml nevertheless we believe to be important to report the discrepancies between the two methods since validation studies of et partitioning methods are scarce the e values estimated from the uwue approach can also be influenced by the uncertainty in gpp estimates wohlfahrt and galvagno 2017 previous study conducted with stable isotopes measurements showed that daytime reco and gpp extrapolated from nighttime measurements are overestimated by 10 and 13 respectively oikawa et al 2017 these overestimations occur because daytime reco is lower than nighttime reco at the same temperature since light inhibits the foliar mitochondrial respiration kok effect heskel et al 2013 values of uwuea and uwuep are both proportional to gpp eqs 1 and 2 so they are both affected by biases in gpp therefore t et eq 3 is not expected to be very sensitive to biases in gpp 4 3 effect of the rainfall and fire on fluxes and t et despite the dry conditions in 2017 and part of the 2018 growing season the tallgrass prairie was still a carbon sink during these years table 3 according to fay et al 2000 the reduction in aboveground net primary productivity at kpbs is not associated with a reduction in rainfall amounts but with the increase in the interval between rainfall events in addition during dry years the ecosystem functioning can be affected by the increase in rainfall variability and the occurrence of large rainfall events reducing the rain use efficiency rue while during wetter years these impacts are reduced felton et al 2020 the rue expressed as the ratio of monthly accumulated gpp and rainfall was 2 31 g c m 2 mm 1 in 2017 on the other hand the average rue values were 1 87 and 2 26 g c m 2 mm 1 for the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons respectively the small rainfall events recorded during 2017 in comparison to the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons may have contributed to the larger rue for that year and to net co2 uptake by the ecosystem table 3 conversely the occurrence of large rainfall events from mid august 2018 and throughout 2019 likely increased water losses to deep soil layers knapp et al 2008 reducing rue our t et values ranging from 0 50 to 0 65 are within the range of values 0 57 0 19 reported by schlesinger and jasechko 2014 for various temperate grasslands worldwide the highest t et observed during 2018 is related to the higher uwuea resulting likely from the rainfall distribution and prescribed burning section 4 1 the removal of vegetation biomass and litter can increase e especially at the beginning of the growing season fig 8b however prescribed burning also reduces the rainfall interception by litter and biomass which may enable greater soil water storage at kpbs it was demonstrated that the average rainfall interception by canopy is 19 0 and 38 0 for burned and unburned plots respectively gilliam et al 1987 likewise rainfall interception ranging between 20 0 and 60 0 over the growing season was reported for an unburned tallgrass prairie in oklahoma zou et al 2015 conversely during growing seasons without prescribed burning the higher litter accumulated can result in higher soil water availability craine and nippert 2014 yet the water from small rainfall events is more likely to be intercepted by canopy and dead biomass preventing it from reaching the soil surface wang et al 2016 zou et al 2015 thus the predominance of small rainfall events in 2017 and greater above ground biomass may have contributed to increase water losses from e reducing uwuea and t et in addition to the increase in e of intercepted water from canopy and litter the reduction in t et during 2019 compared to 2018 was probably related to the high near surface soil moisture over 2019 fig 3f which can increase e and reduce t et wagle et al 2020 wei et al 2018 4 4 effect of vegetation growth and environment variables on t et previous studies show that the weekly variation in t et derived from uwue approach is strongly correlated with vegetation indexes such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi zhou et al 2016 hu et al 2018 in our study the relationship between gcc and t et evaluated using 3 day time moving averages increased as a function of water availability fig 8d f our results show that the t et temporal dynamics is better explained by gcc when the physiological variables gpp and t are mainly driven by phenology migliavacca et al 2011 on the other hand t et variability is not completely captured by gcc for short time intervals under drought conditions this decoupling between gcc and t et can be explained by the lag between variations in soil moisture and vegetation responses to soil water deficits moreover et and gpp variability is larger in response to environment conditions compared to gcc yan et al 2019 positive correlations between vegetation indexes and t et in grasslands are expected due the strong influence of lai on t et scott et al 2021 xu et al 2021 previous studies show that tair tong et al 2019 and θ cui et al 2020 are important drivers of t et at the seasonal time scale the highest partial correlation between tair and t et can be explained by tair influence on lai and photosynthesis wagle et al 2014 sun et al 2020 on the other hand the negative correlations between t et and θ 15 observed in 2017 and 2018 might be related to the higher e contribution from soil upper layers especially right after rainfalls sun et al 2020 wagle et al 2020 in 2017 and 2018 the positive correlations between t et and θ 45 is related to the water uptake by plant roots from subsurface soil layers especially during drought conditions nippert et al 2012 maxwell and condon 2016 sun et al 2021 in 2019 the lack of correlation between θ and t et can be explained by the high θ values during all growing season compared to previous years our results agree with those observed by scott et al 2021 for a grassland in arizona u s in which t et was positively correlated with the subsurface soil moisture and tair likewise negative correlation between t et and upper layer soil moisture was observed by xu et al 2021 for an alpine meadow in northwest china 4 5 impact of precipitation variability on et components and research needs previous studies have reported trends of wet regions becoming wetter and dry regions becoming drier in response to global warming chou et al 2013 liu and allan 2013 these changes in precipitation patterns will intensity with the increase in extreme precipitation events donat et al 2016 our dataset provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate that precipitation variability has a strong influence on the seasonality of et components in a grassland ecosystem the response of t et to other environmental drivers was modulated by the growing season precipitation patterns for example in a rainy year 2019 t et and tair showed higher correlation values while in a dry year 2017 the variation of t et is mostly explained by θ45 fig 9 in addition in wet year t et showed higher correlation to gcc than in dry year therefore future et partitioning studies should consider not only the total precipitation but also the timing size and frequency of rain events especially during dry years further comparative studies using techniques with spatial and temporal representativeness similar to the ec technique are still needed in addition to the uwue several et partitioning approaches based on ec measurements have been developed scott and biederman 2017 nelson et al 2018 perez priego et al 2018 and can be used to confirm our findings about the effect of rainfall variability on et components in grasslands even so considering that t et derived from the uwue approach was able to capture the effects of rainfall variability and fire our results indicate that this simple approach could be an invaluable tool to better understand ecosystem responses to climate variability and change and management practices given the various combinations of fire and grazing regimes and the variability of precipitation at kpbs t et derived from the uwue approach could be useful to quantify the effects of the interactions between these management practices and water availability the long term quantification of t et using the uwue approach may be used to monitor the woody and shrub plant encroachment in grasslands since t et has been shown to be more sensitive than et to capture changes in the canopy structure wang et al 2018 5 conclusions in this study we used the ec technique and uwue approach for partitioning et in a tallgrass prairie under growing seasons with contrasting rainfall regimes the lowest t et average value 0 50 was observed in the dry growing season while the largest t et averages 0 62 and 0 65 were observed in the wet growing seasons a stronger relationship between gcc and t et occurred during wet growing seasons but this relationship was weakened for growing seasons with drought periods air temperature was the main environmental driver of t et during the wet growing seasons on the other hand the soil water content at 0 45 m was the main environmental driver of t et during a dry growing season these results demonstrate that the precipitation variability not only has a direct impact on the et components but also modulates the response of those components to other environmental drivers since et partitioning studies at the ecosystem scale are still scarce our results can improve t et and water use efficiency estimates in long term modelling studies this will help to better understand how et in ecosystems will respond to global warming and increased co2 concentration during wet and dry growing seasons furthermore our results revealed that the use of gcc as a predictor of t et should be used with caution during growing seasons that experience drought periods credit authorship

in chief with the assistance of andres iroume associate editor partitioning evapotranspiration et into evaporation e and plant transpiration t is key to understanding ecosystem responses to rainfall variability resulting from climate change the goal of this study was to quantify t and e using eddy covariance ec flux measurements in a tallgrass prairie in consecutive growing seasons with contrasting rainfall regimes the field measurements were conducted at the national ecological observatory network neon konz site in kansas u s during the growing seasons of 2017 2018 and 2019 the et partitioning was performed using an approach based on the concept of the underlying water use efficiency uwue to evaluate the uwue approach we compared daily e estimates obtained from the uwue with e observations provided by microlysimeters ml green chromatic coordinate gcc was used to monitor the vegetation dynamics in the 2017 growing season the total rainfall was 23 1 below the site s long term average cumulative precipitation on the other hand in 2018 and 2019 the accumulated growing season precipitations were 7 2 and 40 2 respectively above the long term precipitation average the relationship between uwue approach and ml e measurements showed a pearson correlation coefficient r of 0 42 and a root mean square error rmse of 0 58 mm d 1 the lowest t et average value 0 50 was observed in the 2017 growing season while the largest t et average 0 65 was observed in 2018 the correlations between gcc and t et were reduced during the growing seasons that experienced drought periods air temperature was the main environmental driver of t et during the wet growing seasons r 0 49 and 0 72 the subsurface soil moisture 0 45 m was the main environmental driver of t et during a dry growing season r 0 41 these results demonstrate that the precipitation variability not only has a direct impact on the et components but also modulates the response of those components to other environmental drivers since et partitioning studies at the ecosystem scale are still scarce our results can improve t et and water use efficiency estimates in long term modelling studies this will help to better understand how et in ecosystems will respond to global warming and increased co2 concentration during wet and dry growing seasons keywords evapotranspiration partitioning rainfall variability underlying water use efficiency eddy covariance grasslands 1 introduction the grasslands in the u s great plains are subject to highly variable precipitation jones et al 2016 o connor et al 2020 recent studies report an increase in the frequency of large rainfall events 25 4 mm for the period of 1979 2009 over the central u s groisman et al 2012 and forecast an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events due to climate change kirchmeier young and zhang 2020 since rainfall variability has been identified as the main environmental driver of water and carbon fluxes in grasslands chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 predicted changes in the rainfall regime will likely lead to significant changes in grassland structure and function especially during dry years felton et al 2020 evapotranspiration et is a key variable linking the carbon water and energy cycles in ecosystems fisher et al 2017 as well as a leading indicator of ecosystem responses to rainfall variability and flash droughts rajan et al 2015 yue et al 2019 anderson et al 2013 however the magnitude of et primary components abiotic evaporation e and leaf transpiration t has distinct responses to biophysical variables berg and sheffield 2019 for instance e is inversely proportional to canopy cover which reduces surface wind speed and attenuates the incoming solar radiation reaching the soil surface song et al 2018 conversely the contribution of t to et t et tends to increase with canopy cover and is also governed by plant phenology wang et al 2014 rigden et al 2018 scott et al 2021 furthermore the responses of the et components to rainfall are dependent on the frequency and magnitude of rain events for example small and frequent rain events that increase soil surface moisture favors e losses while large rainfall events usually increase t et sun et al 2020 zou et al 2015 cavanaugh et al 2011 in the long term climate change is expected to affect the contributions of e and t to the total et differently niu et al 2019 model simulations performed by zhang et al 2016 indicate that the global et trended upwards in the period from 1981 to 2012 the researchers also reported a positive trend in t and a negative trend in e which they attribute to an increase of vegetation leaf area index lai credited to the effect of co2 fertilization in their simulations in addition cmip5 model simulations for the 2071 to 2100 period predict an increase in t et in middle and high latitudes due to the increase in air temperature and reduction in t et in humid tropical regions due to plant responses to higher co2 atmospheric levels berg and sheffield 2019 despite the importance long term global scale et predictions still contain major uncertainties lian et al 2018 field scale et partitioning studies are needed to improve global scale et modeling and to provide insights into the effect of climate change on global water and carbon cycles ecosystem level et partitioning remains challenging given the limitations inherent to the various methods kool et al 2014 for example the sap flow method has been commonly used to measure t at the plant level nelson et al 2020 but this method is impractical in ecosystems with large plant diversity and herbaceous plants williams et al 2004 microlysimeters ml have been used as a standard approach to validate e estimates from other methods or models moran et al 2009 florentin and agam 2017 this method has the advantage of directly measuring changes in soil mass due to evaporation but ml measurements represent a small area 1 m2 and are labor intensive limiting their use in ecosystem studies partitioning et using micrometeorological measurements has the advantage of allowing continuous flux monitoring at scales relevant for ecosystem studies micrometeorological approaches based on the coupling between carbon and water fluxes have been used as an alternative for partitioning et sun et al 2019 stoy et al 2019 these methods are often based on the water use efficiency wue gpp et often determined as the ratio of gross primary productivity gpp to et scott and biederman 2017 proposed a statistical approach to partition monthly et using multi year co2 and water fluxes derived from eddy covariance ec measurements likewise skaggs et al 2018 developed the fluxpart model to partition et and carbon fluxes simultaneously using high frequency ec data however the fluxpart model requires a priori knowledge of wue at the leaf scale which is challenging to obtain in ecosystems with mixed c3 and c4 vegetation such as grasslands zhou et al 2016 developed an et partitioning approach using ec data based on the concept of underlying wue uwue the uwue concept emerged as a modification of the inherent wue approach which considers the non linear effect of vapor pressure deficit vpd on et for the daily wue calculation beer et al 2009 although the correlation between gpp and et is improved by introducing vpd in daily wue calculations zhou et al 2014 still observed a time lag between et and gpp especially at sub daily time scales to correct this time lag zhou et al 2014 developed the uwue model uwue gpp vpd0 5 et in which vpd is corrected by an exponent from the concept of uwue zhou et al 2016 distinguished an apparent uwue uwuea and a potential uwue uwuep which differ by the presence and absence of e respectively hence t et can be estimated by the uwuea uwuep ratio this relatively simple approach has the advantage of allowing the et partitioning at different temporal scales half hourly to annual and has shown satisfactory results when compared to microlysimeters stable isotopes and sap flow zhou et al 2018 bai et al 2019 nelson et al 2020 xu et al 2021 in this study we use a unique flux dataset in three consecutive growing seasons with distinct precipitation totals and distributions to investigate the response of t et to environmental drivers in a tallgrass prairie we hypothesize that grassland t et responses to environmental drivers will vary during wet and dry years to test this hypothesis ec fluxes and the uwue approach were used for partitioning et into e and t the performance of the uwue approach was evaluated by comparing its e estimates with the ones provided by ml 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the field measurements were conducted at the national ecological observatory network neon konz site loescher et al 2014 located at the konza prairie biological station kpbs during the growing seasons may to october of years 2017 2018 and 2019 the kpbs is a 3 487 ha native tallgrass prairie located in the flint hills region in kansas u s 39 05 55 n 96 34 02 w elevation 415 m a s l the region is characterized by a mid continental climate o connor et al 2020 with mean annual air temperature of 13 c and monthly average air temperature ranging from 3 c in january to 27 c in july the mean annual rainfall is 845 mm with about 73 of total annual precipitation occurring between april and september during the growing season towne et al 2014 the predominant vegetation across the kpbs consists of warm season c4 grasses such as andropogon gerardii sorghastrum nutans and schizachyrium scoparium however forbs represent 75 of the species richness towne 2002 the soil at the konz site is classified as fine smectitic mesic pachic udertic argiustolls consisting of 39 0 clay and 4 4 sand and a bulk density of 1 0 g cm 3 at the 0 to 66 cm depth neon 2020 the kpbs is divided into 55 plots or watersheds that include different fire and grazing regimes briggs et al 2016 fig 1 table 1 shows the management practices in the watersheds surrounding the measurement tower on k2a 66 1 ha 2 2 flux measurements fluxes of co2 and energy were measured using the ec technique the ec system was mounted on a tower at 7 9 m above the ground wind velocity orthogonal components and sonic temperature fluctuations were measured using a 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa an enclosed path co2 h2o infrared gas analyzer li 7200 li cor usa was used to measure carbon dioxide and water vapor mixing ratios all ec system

maximization fan et al 1990 and spectral corrections for high moncrieff et al 1997 and low moncrieff et al 2005 frequency losses the flux data were screened using quality flags based on the steady state test proposed by mauder and foken 2004 with flag values of 0 1 and 2 corresponding to high moderate and low quality data respectively in this study flux data associated with flag values equal to 2 were discarded in addition friction velocity u thresholds were calculated for each growing season to identity and remove carbon flux measured under low turbulence conditions papale et al 2006 the values of u thresholds were 0 21 ms 1 for 2017 and 0 24 m s 1 for 2018 and 2019 the quality of the ec data was also assessed by the energy budget closure ebc determined using a linear regression analysis between available energy and turbulent energy fluxes le h the slopes of the ebc linear regression ranged between 0 64 2018 and 0 73 2017 fig 2 the flux gap filling and nee partitioning into gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration reco were performed using the reddyproc tool developed by the max planck institute for biogeochemistry wutzler et al 2018 nighttime nee and air temperature measurements were used to parameterize an exponential regression model and extrapolate the reco values to daytime air temperature reichstein et al 2005 so that gpp was calculated by subtracting reco from nee 2 3 flux footprint calculations at the konz site surrounding watersheds under different fire and grazing management practices likely contribute to the observed fluxes fire frequency and grazing can lead to differences in c3 and c4 plant composition in the tallgrass prairie collins and calabrese 2012 and consequently on ecosystem uwue to investigate the influence of each watershed surrounding the tower on the measured fluxes a two dimensional flux footprint parameterization kljun et al 2015 was used to compute the contribution of different watersheds to the measured ec fluxes then the relative contribution of each watershed to the 30 min ec fluxes was estimated by overlaying half hourly flux footprints with polygons representing each watershed neftel et al 2008 prajapati and santos 2018 2 4 complementary measurements complementary measurements included incoming solar radiation rg and net radiation rn which were measured by a four component net radiometer

loescher et al 2014 half hourly meteorological variables were obtained from the neon portal neon 2020 detailed information on the instrumentation at neon sites is given by metzger et al 2019 daily precipitation p data were obtained from the ashland bottoms station of the kansas mesonet patrignani et al 2020 2 5 evapotranspiration partitioning et was partitioned using the approach developed by zhou et al 2016 which is based on the uwue concept based on this approach the potential uwue uwuep and the apparent uwue uwuea were calculated as follows zhou et al 2016 1 uwue p gpp vpd 0 5 t 2 uwue a gpp vpd 0 5 et where vpd is the vapor pressure deficit et is the evapotranspiration and t is the transpiration in an ecosystem with uniform vegetation uwuep is identical to the uwue at the leaf scale and assumed to be almost constant under steady state conditions zhou et al 2016 on the other hand uwuea represents the uwue affected by e thus when e is negligible t approximates et t et 1 and uwuea is equal to uwuep under field conditions values of t et are close to unity when the ecosystem vegetation has a high lai and the soil water content in the upper soil layer is low zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 based on the uwuep and uwuea concepts t et and t at the ecosystem level were determined as follows zhou et al 2016 3 t et uwue a uwue p 4 t uwue a uwue p e t following zhou et al 2016 the long term average uwuep was estimated by the 95th quantile regression between half hourly et and gpp vpd0 5 data collected during this study in addition individual uwuep values were estimated for each growing season to test the assumption that uwuep is relatively constant over the years values of uwuea at different timescales daily monthly and seasonal were determined by the linear regression analysis slope between et and gpp vpd0 5 to ensure that gpp is equal to zero when the stomata are closed all regression analysis were performed forcing the regression line through origin in this study values of uwuea and uwuep were determined under daytime conditions incoming solar radiation 20 w m 2 to identify the main environmental elements that drive t et a partial correlation analysis was used to remove the interactions between variables the significance of the partial correlation coefficients was verified by a student s t test at a significance level of 5 li et al 2016 2 6 soil evaporation measurements to evaluate the uwue method daily e was measured using ml during the 2018 growing season the ml were built from polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe with an internal diameter of 10 2 cm and cut at 20 cm in length the bottom edge of the ml was beveled to facilitate insertion into the soil profile a total of 21 ml were inserted in advance between grassland plants to the south of the tower prevailing wind direction with the aid of a rubber mallet to minimize the impact of minor soil disturbances generated during the installation process of the ml in our e measurements the ml were left inserted in the soil for about two weeks that included couple rainfall events rainfall events help restoring the soil surface conditions that may have been disturbed as a consequence of vibrations during the installation process rainfall also helps sealing small gaps between the wall of the ml and the surrounding soil three measurement campaigns were carried out on days without rainfall during august september and october of 2018 at the beginning of each sampling campaign a total of seven ml were carefully excavated using a shovel to minimize disturbances to the soil column inside the ml the ml bottoms were sealed with a plastic film to eliminate drainage losses and to retain the soil column inside the ml for daily weighting seven ml were monitored during each campaign for a period no longer than five days per campaign to maintain soil moisture conditions within the ml similar to its surroundings evett et al 1995 the august 2018 campaign was shortened due the occurrence of rainfall during the seven day sampling period the ml were weighed daily using a digital scale with resolution of 1 g v11p6 ohau usa which translates to an e resolution of 0 13 mm d 1 soil evaporation e mm d 1 was calculated as follows wang and wang 2017 5 e 10 δ w ρ π d 2 2 where δw g is the change in mass of the ml between two measurements ρ is the density of water 1 0 g cm 3 and d is the diameter of the ml cm the relationship between e measured by ml and derived from the uwue approach was evaluated using the root mean square error rmse and pearson s correlation coefficient r 2 7 vegetation dynamics the vegetation dynamics was monitored using the green chromatic coordinate gcc obtained from the phenocam dataset 2 0 seyednasrollah et al 2019 the vegetation images were acquired every 15 min using a digital camera cam sec5ir stardot usa and converted to a three layer rgb array corresponding to red r green g and blue b channels during the image processing a digital number dn associated to each color channel was extracted from a region of interest roi that excludes portions of road and sky richardson 2019 the gcc values for each image was determined from the following equation richardson et al 2007 6 gcc g dn r dn g dn b dn where rdn gdn and bdn are the average red green and blue dn extracted from roi to minimize noise due to the effects of clouds aerosols and fog in scene illumination only 90th percentile values of gcc were used to calculate a 3 day moving average in this study with the daily gcc value attributed to the center of the 3 day moving window sonnentag et al 2012 3 results 3 1 weather conditions over the growing seasons evaluated the highest average tair was observed in 2018 22 1 c followed by 2017 21 7 c and 2019 20 8 c fig 3 a c the mean vpd values were higher in 2017 10 7 hpa and 2018 10 2 hpa compared to the average vpd 8 4 hpa for 2019 fig 3a c the long term 1994 2013 average accumulated precipitation at kpbs during the growing season may to october is 612 mm nippert 2020 in 2017 the total rainfall 470 4 mm was 23 1 below the long term average precipitation and four dry periods with length ranging from 11 to 21 days were recorded fig 3d the dry conditions during the 2017 growing season maintained θ15 and θ 45 close to 0 10 and 0 20 m3 m 3 fig 3d respectively despite the occurrence of two rainfall events above 50 mm d 1 at end of june julian day 180 and early august julian day 217 during 2018 the accumulated growing season precipitation 656 3 mm was 7 2 above the long term average rainfall and the 2018 longest dry period 11 days occurred at the end of growing season fig 3e the 2018 growing season was marked by smaller rainfall events from may to mid august resulting in θ 15 and θ 45 close to 0 10 m3 m 3 during this period fig 3e from mid august 2018 julian day 231 large rainfall events higher than 70 mm raised θ 15 and θ 45 to about 0 40 m3 m 3 in contrast the accumulated growing season precipitation in 2019 858 3 mm was 40 2 above the long term average and the frequent large rainfall events 25 4 mm resulted in θ 15 and θ 45 above or close to 0 40 m3 m 3 throughout the entire growing season fig 3f 3 2 flux footprint and potential uwuep and apparent uwuea underlying water use efficiencies the footprint climatology or aggregated flux footprint estimated for the three growing seasons was overlaid on the watershed map fig 4 most of the measured 30 min fluxes 82 7 originated from the k2a watershed followed by the c3sa 12 5 k20a 2 8 and c3sb 1 1 and k1b 0 5 with a total contribution of 99 6 to the ec fluxes table 2 the overall uwuep throughout all growing seasons was 14 31 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 considering individual growing seasons the largest uwuep was observed in 2018 16 30 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 followed by 2019 13 81 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 and the lowest uwuep was recorded in 2017 11 36 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 the mean uwuea showed a similar pattern as uwuep with yearly values of 7 10 2017 9 33 2018 and 8 86 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 2019 to investigate the effect of the surround watersheds to the estimated uwue the mean uwuep and yearly uwuea were estimated using only 30 min data in which 100 of the measured fluxes originated from the k2a watershed the mean uwuep was 14 57 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 and uwuea values were 7 56 9 55 and 9 37 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 for 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the uwue estimates using only k2a data were similar to the ones obtained using the full ec flux dataset indicating that differences in source area had minor impact on uwuep and uwuea therefore in this study the et partitioning was performed using the entire flux dataset the seasonal dynamics of uwuea was distinct among the growing seasons evaluated fig 5 in 2018 uwuea decreased from the beginning of the growing season until the month of august on the other hand in 2017 and 2019 an opposite trend was observed with an increase of monthly uwuea values from may to july the uwuea for the month of august was similar for all years the end of growing season september and october uwuea values were higher for 2018 in comparison to 2017 and 2019 values 3 3 comparison between uwue and microlysimeter soil evaporation estimates the comparison of daily e values derived from the uwue method and measured by ml is shown in fig 6 the overall average e standard deviation estimated by uwue was 0 73 0 18 mm d 1 while measured e using ml resulted in 1 21 0 36 mm d 1 the relationship between uwue and ml estimates showed a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 42 and rmse of 0 58 mm d 1 in general the uwue method underestimated e rate compared to ml estimates 3 4 seasonal variations of carbon and water fluxes and t et the seasonal variation of carbon and water vapor fluxes was driven by the vegetation phenology and soil moisture conditions at the beginning of the 2017 growing season t and gpp varied widely and reached values close to zero fig 7 a and 7d due to the low rainfall amounts during the 2017 early growing season the grassland alternated from being a carbon source nee 0 and a carbon sink nee 0 at the end of june 2017 days after two large consecutives rainfall events totaling 62 7 mm t gpp and reco peaked at 3 28 mm d 1 10 61 g c m 2 d 1 and 7 38 g c m 2 d 1 respectively in 2018 t gpp and reco were very low during the early growing season but increased rapidly by the end of may fig 7b and 7e reaching the maximum values of 4 40 mm d 1 13 80 g c m 2 d 1 and 9 02 g c m 2 d 1 respectively the ecosystem was a carbon sink until the end of june after that t gpp and reco decreased and the ecosystem alternated from being a carbon sink and a carbon source due to the dry conditions in mid august the ecosystem became a carbon sink after large rainfall events in contrast to 2017 and 2018 growing seasons water and carbon fluxes were closely coupled with the vegetation phenology in 2019 t gpp and reco increased from may to mid july showing maximum values of 4 74 mm d 1 17 01 and 13 18 g c m 2 d 1 respectively fig 7c and f and decreased from mid july until the end of the growing season during 2019 the grassland was mostly a carbon sink from early may until the first half of september the cumulative water vapor and carbon fluxes increased as a function of total rainfall during growing seasons table 3 the grassland acted as a carbon sink during the three years evaluated despite the 2017 growing season drought the lowest and highest cumulative gpp reco nee et and t occurred during 2017 and 2019 respectively while the lowest e was recorded during 2018 the seasonal variation of t et followed the gcc dynamics increasing from early to mid growing seasons and decreasing at the end of growing seasons despite oscillations due to rainfall variability fig 8 a c in the 2017 growing season the gcc showed the lower values fig 8a ranging from 0 33 to 0 39 which resulted in the lowest t et average 0 50 among the years evaluated fig 8a and table 3 the highest t et average 0 65 among the years evaluated occurred in 2018 fig 8b which exhibited gcc values fig 8b between 0 33 and 0 44 the gcc values during 2019 fig 8c were similar to the ones observed in 2018 ranging from 0 32 to 0 44 however the 2019t et average 0 62 was slightly lower than that observed in 2018 the t et peaks were recorded in may 2017 0 95 july 2018 0 97 and july 2019 0 95 while the gcc peaks were observed in may for the three growing seasons fig 8a c the linear regressions analysis between 3 day moving averages of gcc and t et indicated that gcc explained between 34 0 2017 and 58 0 2019 of the t et variability fig 8d f the partial correlation coefficients between t et and several environmental variables are shown in fig 9 in general t et showed higher positive correlations with tair correlation coefficients between t et and tair were all statistically significant p 0 01 and equal to 0 35 2017 0 49 2018 and 0 72 2019 t et was negatively correlated with θ 15 during the 2017 0 32 and 2018 0 20 growing seasons and positively correlated with θ 45 with statistically significant p 0 01 correlation coefficients of 0 41 2017 and 0 25 2018 on the other hand there were no significant correlations between t et and θ 15 and θ 45 during the 2019 growing season rn and vpd did not show significant correlation with t et during the growing seasons evaluated 4 discussion 4 1 annual uwuep and uwuea variation the long term average uwuep value and inter annual uwuep variations found in our study were within the range of values reported for other grassland ecosystems han et al 2018 hu et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 han et al 2018 observed a 10 year uwuep of 14 70 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 with an inter annual maximum difference of 10 1 in relation to mean uwuep for a grassland in inner mongolia china hu et al 2018 evaluated uwuep during three years in a grassland in northern china they found an average uwuep equal to 12 34 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 and an inter annual maximum difference with respect to the mean of 13 5 zhou et al 2016 estimated uwuep for five grassland types using flux datasets ranging from two and six years in different regions of usa they observed that the long term average uwuep ranged between 11 57 and 14 28 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 with an inter annual maximum difference close to 20 0 in our study the relative differences between the annual uwuep and the three year uwuep ranged between 3 5 2019 and 20 6 2017 indicating that except for 2017 which was a dry year uwuep was relatively constant in addition the long term average uwuep estimated excluding the 2017 data 15 10 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 was slightly higher than that estimated using the entire dataset 14 31c hpa0 5 kg h2o 1 showing that the 2017 data had a small influence on long term average uwuep previous studies in grasslands showed that uwuea increases during wetter years han et al 2018 and decreases under severe drought hu et al 2018 however a direct relationship between uwuea and drought is not observed for all grassland ecosystems for instance yang et al 2016 showed that in arid ecosystems where wue is controlled by e wue generally increases under drought conditions conversely in semiarid sub humid ecosystems wue increases as function of water availability due to its greater sensitivity of gpp in our study the accumulated gpp during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons were respectively 39 1 and 95 5 higher than the accumulated gpp observed in 2017 on the other hand the accumulated et values during 2018 and 2019 were 8 2 and 59 6 higher than the one recorded in 2017 respectively these results show that wue at the konz site is mainly controlled by gpp however despite gpp in 2019 being the largest among the years evaluated uwuea was higher in 2018 two peculiarities of the 2018 growing season should be considered when interpreting these results the uneven rainfall distribution and spring prescribed burn 03 21 2018 in 2018 lower rainfall values were observed from may to mid august and larger precipitation was recorded after the second half of august fig 3e this distribution of rainfall resulted in a slight increase in gcc fig 8b t fig 7b gpp fig 7e and uwuea fig 5 close to the end of growing season conversely gcc t gpp and uwuea had already declined in 2017 and 2019 at that point of the growing season these results show that not only the rainfall amount but also the timing of the rainfall is important to explain inter annual variability of uwuea in grasslands in addition previous research conducted at kpbs bremer and ham 2010 knapp 1985 johnson and matchett 2001 and other grasslands feldman et al 2004 fischer et al 2012 wagle et al 2019 showed that fire increases the green lai green biomass accumulation and photosynthesis rates these changes are more apparent at the beginning of the growing season in this study uwuea gpp and gcc at the beginning of 2018 figs 5 7e and 8b prescribed burning year were higher than the ones observed in 2019 figs 5 7f and 8c even though the soil water content was much higher in 2019 fig 3f than in the spring of 2018 fig 3e this occurs due to the reduction in shading and the greater solar radiation reaching the soil surface favoring a fast emergence of new shoots knapp and seastedt 1986 moreover prescribed fires result in an increase in the c4 grasses abundance collins and calabrese 2012 which in turn have higher photosynthetic rates and wue nippert et al 2007 4 2 comparison between uwue and microlysimeter soil evaporation estimates previous comparisons between e estimates obtained using the uwue approach and ml conducted in northwest china showed that both methods are capable of capturing e seasonal variability in croplands zhou et al 2018 bai et al 2019 tong et al 2019 however better agreement between these two methods was observed at the peak of the growing season while large differences at the beginning and end of the growing season were observed zhou et al 2018 bai et al 2019 tong et al 2019 according to hirschi et al 2017 there are large differences between daily et estimated using ml and ec measurements yet these methods tend to show greater agreement at the annual scale the rmse of 0 58 mm d 1 for the relationship between e using ml and uwue found in our study is similar to that reported by nelson et al 2020 who estimated t using the uwue approach for several forest ecosystems and obtained rmse ranging from 0 28 to 0 67 mm d 1 for the relationship between uwue estimates and sap flow measurements our results show that the e values measured by ml were usually higher than the uwue approach e estimates fig 6 one explanation for these discrepancies was the fact that we did not consider the plant basal area in our ml e estimates the adjustment for the basal area would reduce the ml daily e values since the effective area undergoing evaporation would be lower than the cross section area of the ml however we estimated the plant basal to be approximately 1 because the plant stems measure around 0 5 to 1 mm in diameter at the site furthermore the ml have a small diameter 10 2 cm and were installed between plants minimizing the number of steams inside the ml therefore using plant basal area to scale ml e estimates would not lead to a significant change in our results another explanation for the discrepancies between the two methods is the spatial variability of e in this ecosystem differences between e estimates from the two methods are expected due to discrepancies in spatial scales of ml and the ec approach kool et al 2014 furthermore variations in the flux footprint size and location over the day may also contribute to differences between e estimated by the two methods evett et al 2012 moorhead et al 2017 the spatial variability of e in complex ecosystem such as the kpbs is difficult to capture using ml nevertheless we believe to be important to report the discrepancies between the two methods since validation studies of et partitioning methods are scarce the e values estimated from the uwue approach can also be influenced by the uncertainty in gpp estimates wohlfahrt and galvagno 2017 previous study conducted with stable isotopes measurements showed that daytime reco and gpp extrapolated from nighttime measurements are overestimated by 10 and 13 respectively oikawa et al 2017 these overestimations occur because daytime reco is lower than nighttime reco at the same temperature since light inhibits the foliar mitochondrial respiration kok effect heskel et al 2013 values of uwuea and uwuep are both proportional to gpp eqs 1 and 2 so they are both affected by biases in gpp therefore t et eq 3 is not expected to be very sensitive to biases in gpp 4 3 effect of the rainfall and fire on fluxes and t et despite the dry conditions in 2017 and part of the 2018 growing season the tallgrass prairie was still a carbon sink during these years table 3 according to fay et al 2000 the reduction in aboveground net primary productivity at kpbs is not associated with a reduction in rainfall amounts but with the increase in the interval between rainfall events in addition during dry years the ecosystem functioning can be affected by the increase in rainfall variability and the occurrence of large rainfall events reducing the rain use efficiency rue while during wetter years these impacts are reduced felton et al 2020 the rue expressed as the ratio of monthly accumulated gpp and rainfall was 2 31 g c m 2 mm 1 in 2017 on the other hand the average rue values were 1 87 and 2 26 g c m 2 mm 1 for the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons respectively the small rainfall events recorded during 2017 in comparison to the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons may have contributed to the larger rue for that year and to net co2 uptake by the ecosystem table 3 conversely the occurrence of large rainfall events from mid august 2018 and throughout 2019 likely increased water losses to deep soil layers knapp et al 2008 reducing rue our t et values ranging from 0 50 to 0 65 are within the range of values 0 57 0 19 reported by schlesinger and jasechko 2014 for various temperate grasslands worldwide the highest t et observed during 2018 is related to the higher uwuea resulting likely from the rainfall distribution and prescribed burning section 4 1 the removal of vegetation biomass and litter can increase e especially at the beginning of the growing season fig 8b however prescribed burning also reduces the rainfall interception by litter and biomass which may enable greater soil water storage at kpbs it was demonstrated that the average rainfall interception by canopy is 19 0 and 38 0 for burned and unburned plots respectively gilliam et al 1987 likewise rainfall interception ranging between 20 0 and 60 0 over the growing season was reported for an unburned tallgrass prairie in oklahoma zou et al 2015 conversely during growing seasons without prescribed burning the higher litter accumulated can result in higher soil water availability craine and nippert 2014 yet the water from small rainfall events is more likely to be intercepted by canopy and dead biomass preventing it from reaching the soil surface wang et al 2016 zou et al 2015 thus the predominance of small rainfall events in 2017 and greater above ground biomass may have contributed to increase water losses from e reducing uwuea and t et in addition to the increase in e of intercepted water from canopy and litter the reduction in t et during 2019 compared to 2018 was probably related to the high near surface soil moisture over 2019 fig 3f which can increase e and reduce t et wagle et al 2020 wei et al 2018 4 4 effect of vegetation growth and environment variables on t et previous studies show that the weekly variation in t et derived from uwue approach is strongly correlated with vegetation indexes such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi zhou et al 2016 hu et al 2018 in our study the relationship between gcc and t et evaluated using 3 day time moving averages increased as a function of water availability fig 8d f our results show that the t et temporal dynamics is better explained by gcc when the physiological variables gpp and t are mainly driven by phenology migliavacca et al 2011 on the other hand t et variability is not completely captured by gcc for short time intervals under drought conditions this decoupling between gcc and t et can be explained by the lag between variations in soil moisture and vegetation responses to soil water deficits moreover et and gpp variability is larger in response to environment conditions compared to gcc yan et al 2019 positive correlations between vegetation indexes and t et in grasslands are expected due the strong influence of lai on t et scott et al 2021 xu et al 2021 previous studies show that tair tong et al 2019 and θ cui et al 2020 are important drivers of t et at the seasonal time scale the highest partial correlation between tair and t et can be explained by tair influence on lai and photosynthesis wagle et al 2014 sun et al 2020 on the other hand the negative correlations between t et and θ 15 observed in 2017 and 2018 might be related to the higher e contribution from soil upper layers especially right after rainfalls sun et al 2020 wagle et al 2020 in 2017 and 2018 the positive correlations between t et and θ 45 is related to the water uptake by plant roots from subsurface soil layers especially during drought conditions nippert et al 2012 maxwell and condon 2016 sun et al 2021 in 2019 the lack of correlation between θ and t et can be explained by the high θ values during all growing season compared to previous years our results agree with those observed by scott et al 2021 for a grassland in arizona u s in which t et was positively correlated with the subsurface soil moisture and tair likewise negative correlation between t et and upper layer soil moisture was observed by xu et al 2021 for an alpine meadow in northwest china 4 5 impact of precipitation variability on et components and research needs previous studies have reported trends of wet regions becoming wetter and dry regions becoming drier in response to global warming chou et al 2013 liu and allan 2013 these changes in precipitation patterns will intensity with the increase in extreme precipitation events donat et al 2016 our dataset provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate that precipitation variability has a strong influence on the seasonality of et components in a grassland ecosystem the response of t et to other environmental drivers was modulated by the growing season precipitation patterns for example in a rainy year 2019 t et and tair showed higher correlation values while in a dry year 2017 the variation of t et is mostly explained by θ45 fig 9 in addition in wet year t et showed higher correlation to gcc than in dry year therefore future et partitioning studies should consider not only the total precipitation but also the timing size and frequency of rain events especially during dry years further comparative studies using techniques with spatial and temporal representativeness similar to the ec technique are still needed in addition to the uwue several et partitioning approaches based on ec measurements have been developed scott and biederman 2017 nelson et al 2018 perez priego et al 2018 and can be used to confirm our findings about the effect of rainfall variability on et components in grasslands even so considering that t et derived from the uwue approach was able to capture the effects of rainfall variability and fire our results indicate that this simple approach could be an invaluable tool to better understand ecosystem responses to climate variability and change and management practices given the various combinations of fire and grazing regimes and the variability of precipitation at kpbs t et derived from the uwue approach could be useful to quantify the effects of the interactions between these management practices and water availability the long term quantification of t et using the uwue approach may be used to monitor the woody and shrub plant encroachment in grasslands since t et has been shown to be more sensitive than et to capture changes in the canopy structure wang et al 2018 5 conclusions in this study we used the ec technique and uwue approach for partitioning et in a tallgrass prairie under growing seasons with contrasting rainfall regimes the lowest t et average value 0 50 was observed in the dry growing season while the largest t et averages 0 62 and 0 65 were observed in the wet growing seasons a stronger relationship between gcc and t et occurred during wet growing seasons but this relationship was weakened for growing seasons with drought periods air temperature was the main environmental driver of t et during the wet growing seasons on the other hand the soil water content at 0 45 m was the main environmental driver of t et during a dry growing season these results demonstrate that the precipitation variability not only has a direct impact on the et components but also modulates the response of those components to other environmental drivers since et partitioning studies at the ecosystem scale are still scarce our results can improve t et and water use efficiency estimates in long term modelling studies this will help to better understand how et in ecosystems will respond to global warming and increased co2 concentration during wet and dry growing seasons furthermore our results revealed that the use of gcc as a predictor of t et should be used with caution during growing seasons that experience drought periods credit authorship
