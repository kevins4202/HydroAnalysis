9215,the main focus of this study is to develop a multi scale surrogate model for the fao 56 penman monteith pm evapotranspiration et o using hargreaves samani hs equation which uses only temperature as a hydrometeorological variable to estimate et this feature is particularly useful for scarce data regions and climate change impact assessment studies where the direct estimation of et o from the pm equation can be problematic as the parameters of the hs equation may vary across space a bayesian approach was adopted to estimate or recalibrate them rather than relying on the fixed values as suggested in the traditional model the bayesian approach allows a sound development of our model in a multi scale temporal framework where the et o at daily monthly and annual scales are jointly used to estimate the hs equation parameters the proposed and reference models are applied and tested using meteorological data from 17 stations located across the han river basin in south korea the results indicate that the traditional hs equation with fixed parameters and without recalibration tends to overestimate the reference et for all stations the locally recalibrated approach to the hs equation at a daily temporal scale can effectively reduce the systematic bias associated with the use of the traditional hs equation but fails to reproduce the underlying distribution of et o at different temporal scales e g monthly and annual this leads to a large systematic bias in et o at these scales in contrast the proposed multi scale surrogate model offers a more precise estimation of the reference et at a daily timescale as well as at the aggregated monthly and annual temporal scales this is particularly useful to minimize the systematic bias often observed when using traditional surrogate models for the reference et in hydrological studies such as rainfall runoff modeling and assessment of climate change impact on water resources keywords evapotranspiration hargreaves samani equation multiscale model bayesian model penman monteith equation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the hydrological cycle involves the continuous process of water fluxes across their reservoirs land oceans and atmosphere among the hydrologic flux components evapotranspiration et responds to a substantial transport of water over in the hydrological cycle kim et al 2018a kwon et al 2012 mccoll and rigden 2020 novák 2012 zhao et al 2013 in terms of the hydrological cycle et represents the key process of removing water from the surface to the atmosphere which is the opposite process of precipitation the land surface returns approximately 60 of precipitation to the atmosphere annually via the et process l vovich et al 1990 therefore accurate estimation of et is often required to establish effective management plans for water resources e g demand analysis of water irrigation management drought monitoring etc zhao et al 2013 the main concepts of et can be divided into potential evapotranspiration et p and reference evapotranspiration et o the et p refers to the maximum moisture loss from the surface which is strongly affected by meteorological conditions and the surface type assuming conditions of unlimited moisture supply lhomme 1997 on the other hand the reference evapotranspiration et o can be defined as the hypothetical evapotranspiration rate of an extensive green grass surface allen et al 1998 et o is routinely estimated through the physically based fao56 penman monteith fao56 pm equation which is recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao and has been used by various organizations e g wmo and icid however the fao56 pm method requires a set of meteorological data i e wind speed radiation air temperature and relative humidity to estimate et o that are not readily available and therefore limit the use of the fao56 pm in data sparse parts of the world especially in developing countries such a problem arises in the study of the impact of climate change on water resources due to difficulties in obtaining reliable meteorological forcing data from climate change scenarios required for estimating et o through the fao56 pm equation in this context the hargreaves samani hs equation hargreaves and samani 1982 1985 using daily air temperature data was proposed as a surrogate model to the fao56 pm for the et o the hs equation has been widely applied for the estimation of et o due to its accuracy consistency and parsimonious nature the hs formula has a physical interpretation and the temperature range tmax tmin between the maximum and minimum temperature is aiming to represent atmospheric transparency the air temperature used in the hs equation is one of the most widely observed meteorological data permitting easy implementation with long term temperature data mendicino and senatore 2013 however the hs equation relies on model coefficients which in turn can be linked to the local climate conditions and topographical characteristics therefore recalibration of the hs equation is required to minimize systematic error several studies have been proposed to improve the accuracy of the estimated et o by recalibrating the parameters of the hs equation in particular the pattern of et o appears to be different due to various meteorological factors affecting evapotranspiration thus the hs equation has been evaluated under various climate regimes e g arid and semiarid and regions e g inland and coast most studies focused on the assessment of et o estimated from the hs equation in a particular climate zone gavilán et al 2006 martínez cob and tejero juste 2004 raziei and pereira 2013 todorovic et al 2013 yang et al 2021 almorox et al 2015 evaluated 11 representative temperature based models for estimating et o in different climate zones across the world more specifically the applicability of the different temperature based models was explored in the context of the koppen climate classification as a benchmark for the fao56 pm method on a monthly timescale the study concluded that the hs equation could provide satisfactory performance in different climate regimes i e arid semiarid temperate cold and polar climates an alternative approach was proposed for regional adjustment of the hargreaves samani coefficient by examining its relationship with temperature vanderlinden et al 2004 presented the adjusted hargreaves samani coefficient ahc and evaluated the estimated daily et o against the et o obtained from fao56 pm at meteorological stations located inland and in coastal areas the adjusted hargreaves samani coefficient ahc which is obtained through regression analysis appears to increase at coastal stations and decrease across inland stations su et al 2022 provided a comparison between several temperature and radiation based evapotranspiration methods for the evaluation of regional irrigation water demand the calibrated hargreaves samani and priestley taylor methods can greatly increase efficiency and accuracy in estimating regional or worldwide irrigation water demand shirmohammadi aliakbarkhani and saberali 2020 presented a reliable alternative et o models requiring fewer input data compared with the fao penman monteith method in iran in the study area the temperature based methods typically outperformed the radiation based methods more specifically the jensen haise method showed better performance for the warm growing season while the hargreaves samani method was the best performance for the cool growing season in recent studies machine learning i e artificial neural network ann extreme learning machine elm wavelet neural network wnn and bayesian theory have been used to estimate parameters of the hs equation and forecast the et 0 falamarzi et al 2014 feng et al 2017 2016 kang et al 2022 traore et al 2016 traore et al 2016 employed an ann for short term forecasting of et o using climate information retrieved from climate forecast products in the public domain feng et al 2017 calibrated the hs equation using bayesian theory in the sichuan basin of southwest china the study concluded that the calibrated hs equation still overestimated et o at different temporal scales although the calibrated hs equation provided a better fit for the penman monteith equation than that of the traditional hs equation since the hs equation was empirically developed based on data from arid to sub humid conditions it may not fit well in areas far different from those considered for its calibration as is the case for humid climates raziei and pereira 2013 almorox et al 2015 evaluated the temperature based evapotranspiration equation for each köppen climate zone and found that the hs equation performed best in most climatic zones including temperate climates in which the study area i e south korea was located here a surrogate model based on the hs equation is developed considering both daily et o and monthly and annual et o which was referred to as the multi scale surrogate model most studies locally recalibrated parameters of the hs equation using daily temperature data as input the existing studies consider only a single temporal scale for estimating et o named the single scale surrogate model since the single scale surrogate model solely uses temperature data as an independent variable there may be a limitation in capturing the complex mechanism of the whole et process using the hs equation in this context a modest difference in the daily estimates of et o may lead to a significant increase in the et o bias when estimated at aggregated monthly and annual scales in this case the estimated et o from a single scale surrogate model can be difficult to use for water resource management therefore our goal in this study was to develop a novel approach to the hs equation for a better fit for the et o obtained from the fao56 pm method at multi scale context as discussed above a bayesian modeling framework is also employed for parameter estimation the proposed model was fit and tested using meteorological data obtained for the han river watershed in south korea to the best of our knowledge simultaneous parameter estimation at multiple time scales i e daily monthly and annual scales in a surrogate model for the et o has not been properly explored in the literature this study explores the following types of surrogate models in terms of estimating model parameters for improving the existing surrogate model for the et o model 1 single scale surrogate model using daily temperature data as a baseline model model 2 multi scale surrogate model using daily and monthly temperature data model 3 multi scale surrogate model using daily and annual temperature data model 4 multi scale surrogate model using daily monthly and annual temperature data given the four different models this study sought to explore the following questions by comparing the performance in terms of reproducing the underlying characteristics of the et o estimated from the fao56 pm equation over the han river watershed in south korea 1 how effective is a locally recalibrated approach for the hs equation in terms of minimizing systematic error at different time scales 2 can the hs model coefficients for the local daily et o be simultaneously estimated by considering aggregated et o at multiple time scales 3 can a multi scale surrogate modeling approach accurately reproduce the underlying distribution of the et o at different time scales this paper is organized as follows this section provides a brief background and the main purpose of this study in section 2 the study area and data used in this study are provided the methodology for multi scale surrogate models within a bayesian modeling framework is described in section 3 the results and discussion are presented with a comparison between models in section 4 and the summary and conclusions for this study are finally given in section 5 2 study area and meteorological data this study was carried out on the basis of 17 asos automated synoptic observing service stations operated by the kma korea meteorological administration over the han river basin in south korea the daily solar radiation air temperature i e average maximum and minimum temperature humidity and wind speed data were collected from asos stations through the website https data kma go kr the et o was then obtained from the fao56 pm method using a set of meteorological data listed above the han river is a major river in south korea which originates from the north and south han rivers in the central part of the korean peninsula latitude 36 30 38 55 n longitude 126 24 129 02 e and flows through the capital seoul the basin area is about 25 594 km2 covering a quarter of the land area of south korea the han river receives annual average precipitation of about 1253 mm and approximately 71 of the annual precipitation occurs during the summer season from june to september so et al 2017 fig 1 illustrates the location of the asos stations over the han river basin and the stations selected for the study are described in table 1 3 methodology among the temperature based models for the et o the hs equation was considered as a surrogate model for the fao56 pm method the parameters of the hs equation were estimated through a bayesian theory to improve inference and better handle uncertainties in model parameters the optimal model and its performance evaluation were carried out using the deviance information criterion dic value within a hierarchical bayesian modeling framework a detailed procedure of the modeling process for the multi scale surrogate model for et o is illustrated in fig 2 as seen in fig 1 the et o was obtained using the meteorological data in the han river basin as input to both the fao56 pm method and the traditional hs equation with fixed coefficients here the et o estimated by the fao56 pm method et o pm was used for locally recalibrating the hs equation in a regression framework the et o pm can be regarded as a dependent variable in this study the surrogate models can be classified as single scale and multi scale models in terms of temporal scale in the final step the results obtained from the different models are then demonstrated through goodness of fit measures and are compared with et o pm and et o hg traditional 3 1 evapotranspiration equations the evapotranspiration equations for estimating the et i e et o and et p were empirically derived by considering physical relationships between et and meteorological input variables xiang et al 2020 provided details on the concepts equations and applications of reference evapotranspiration et o and potential evapotranspiration et p the et p equations can be categorized into four groups based on key concepts and variables i dalton ii temperature iii radiation and iv combination similarly the et o equations can be categorized into four types i temperature ii radiation iii pan evaporation and iv combination xiang et al 2020 various approaches to et o have been widely applied in the field of hydrology including fao56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1985 1982 asce pm allen et al 2005 this study mainly utilizes the physically based fao56 pm method and the temperature based hs equation as a surrogate model for the fao56 pm estimates 3 1 1 fao56 penman monteith methods the fao56 pm method has been demonstrated in many studies and many institutions have recommended it as a representative approach for estimating the et o the fao56 pm is a physics based et estimation method informed by various meteorological factors i e temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed etc and it can be written as follows 1 et o pm 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et o is the reference evapotranspiration mm day r n is the net radiation mj m 2 day g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa e s e a is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa δ is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa and finally the γ is the psychrometric constant kpa allen et al 1998 zotarelli et al 2010 3 1 2 hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 proposed the hs equation which is based mainly on temperature for the estimation of et the hs equation consists of four terms the maximum temperature t max minimum temperature t min average temperature and radiant energy 2 et o hs traditional 0 0023 ra t 17 8 tr 0 50 where ra is the extraterrestrial radiation in mm day tr is the temperature range or difference between the maximum and minimum temperature in and t is the average temperature in there are three fixed parameters to define the relationship between the et o and the extraterrestrial radiation ra and air temperature t hargreaves 1994 presented radiant energy according to latitude and month allen et al 1998 recommended the hs equation as an alternative method when the input data of the fao56 pm method is insufficient since only observed temperature data are required the hs equation has been widely used for estimating and predicting et o in worldwide locations where the fao56 pm method is not feasible due to insufficient and unreliable meteorological data hargreaves and allen 2003 it is also desirable to calibrate or re estimate the associated parameters in eq 2 for the specific region of interest lee and park 2008 moon et al 2013 as the evapotranspiration might be influenced by geographical features and local characteristics e g land use altitude and so on the hs equation is generally calibrated using daily data which might be insufficient to reproduce underlying characteristics at aggregated time scales i e monthly and annual scales as the parameter estimates are subject to the daily variations of the input meteorological data moreover the most common approach to estimating the regression coefficients is the least square method where parameter uncertainties may not be sufficiently addressed in this regard this study offers a model within a bayesian inference modeling framework to better quantify the uncertainty associated with parameters in the hs equation the bayesian approach to the hs equation is presented in the following section 3 2 bayesian approach to the hs equation the bayesian inference is a statistical tool to update the model parameters with observed data from a prior distribution p θ to the posterior distribution p θ y gelman et al 2004 the bayesian inference which presents the parameters in the form of a probability distribution can be used to quantitatively evaluate the uncertainty associated with the model parameters to make probability statements about parameter θ given data y a joint probability distribution p θ y for θ and y is used the joint probability density function can be written as a product of two probability densities that are often referred to as the prior distribution p θ and the likelihood p y θ 3 p θ y p θ p y θ the posterior distribution p θ y can be defined as a conditional distribution by adopting bayes rule gelman et al 2004 given a prior distribution p y and a likelihood p y θ with observations y 4 p θ y p θ y p y p θ p y θ p y a general form of the hs equation based surrogated model for estimating evapotranspiration can be found in eq 5 there are three parameters to be estimated with the observed temperature and the et o obtained from the fao 56 pm method several publications have presented improved parameters for hs equation in the different climatic zone gavilán et al 2006 martínez cob and tejero juste 2004 raziei and pereira 2013 todorovic et al 2013 yang et al 2021 among many others the parameters suggested in the traditional hs equation hargreaves and samani 1985 are 0 0023 17 8 and 0 5 for α β and γ respectively 5 et o hs α ra t β t max t min γ the bayesian information criterion bic is used to select the best fitted distribution among various probability distributions in this study the et o follows a lognormal distribution ln with mean μ and standard deviation σ as shown in eq 6 the bic values for each distribution is illustrated in the supplementary material table s1 the models with lower bic are generally preferred in eq 7 y obs i j k day denotes the et o value i e et o pm for the day i month j and year k estimated from the fao56 pm method and it is assumed to be a log normal distribution with a mean of μ day i j k and standard deviation of σ here the mean μ day i j k is a function of the temperature range between the maximum and minimum temperature and the average temperature t in bayesian inference it is critical to choose a reasonable prior distribution for parameters when sufficient data is available but prior information about parameters is weak a non informative prior distribution can be used the prior distributions of each parameter i e α β γ σ are defined in eqs 8 to 11 the α β and γ represent parameters of the hs equation to be estimated with prior distributions e g normal distribution n and gamma distribution γ sufficient data i e 40 year 365 days 14 600 days are available to estimate the four parameters furthermore one can adopt non informative prior distributions for the parameters as proposed in gelman et al 2004 considering our vague information about the parameters 6 ln μ σ 1 y σ

1 1 where i j represents the number of days in month j at some stations the relatively low daily average temperature can lead to a negative term t t β in eq 5 resulting in a negative et o in this regard as shown in eq 9 this study adopts a truncated normal distribution for the parameter β to be sampled from a constraint on the daily minimum temperature t min the joint posterior distribution of the set of parameters θ α β γ σ can be formulated as the product of the likelihood eq 12 and priors as shown in eq 13 12 p y θ k 1 n j 1 12 i 1 i j ln μ day i j k α ra j t i j k β t max i j k t min i

comparison with the multi scale models developed in this study the set of parameters θ are estimated by maximizing the joint posterior distribution as illustrated in eq 13 through the gibbs sampling approach gilkst et al 1995 kim et al 2015 kwon et al 2008 lima et al 2018 so et al 2017 which is a special case of the markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach the primary competitive advantage of gibbs sampling is that it can provide an efficient way to deal with multidimensional data of the complex problem compared to other approaches such as the metropolis hastings mh algorithm 3 3 multi scale surrogate model the main purpose of this study is to improve the accuracy of et o estimation at multiple temporal scales i e daily monthly and annual by recalibrating the single scale model and its extension to the multi scale model more specifically the multi scale model is designed to better reproduce the et o across different temporal scales by simultaneously maximizing the likelihood function associated with the et o at multiple temporal scales the proposed surrogate models for the et o can be classified into 4 models based on the different combinations of temporal scales as summarized in table 2 the key step of this study is to simultaneously maximize the likelihood functions of daily monthly and annual et o as written in eqs 14a 14c in a model of the multi scale model by sequentially summing the monthly and annual evapotranspiration from the estimated daily et o as illustrated in eqs 15a 15c respectively more specifically the monthly and annual et o i e y obs j k month y obs k year are assumed to follow a lognormal distribution with the summed et o as the mean μ month j k μ year k and standard deviation σ month σ year eqs 14b 14c the multi scale models have a different number of parameters according to the temporal scales considered in each model as illustrated in table 2 more specifically the multi scale models consider daily monthly and annual et o when estimating a set of parameters by simultaneously maximizing likelihood functions at three different temporal scales in an integrated manner as summarized in eqs 14a 14c the prior distributions for regression parameters α β and γ including the standard deviation σ day σ month σ year of the lognormal distribution at each temporal scale can be defined as eqs 16 to 21 like the single scale model represented in the previous section there are sufficient data to estimate the regression parameters for the mean and standard deviation of the lognormal distribution thus non informative prior distributions for the parameters were considered as proposed in gelman et al 2004 more specifically normal prior distributions n were used for the regression parameters α β while the gamma prior distribution γ was adopted for the parameter γ for the standard deviation σ day σ month σ year of the lognormal distribution the gamma prior distribution γ which is a conjugate distribution of the lognormal distribution was used the conjugate prior distribution is the case that the prior and posterior distributions are in the same probability distribution family leading to a computational advantage in the process of the parameter estimation gelman et al 2004 14a y obs i j k day ln μ day i j k σ day 2 i 1 i j j 1 12 k 1 n 14b y obs j k month ln μ month j k σ month 2 j 1 12 k 1 n 14c y

information criterion dic was used to explore the model performance the dic value was computed to measure the fitness of a candidate model for a given datum by penalizing the fitness of the model for model complexity defined by the effective number of parameters in other words overfitting may occur as the number of parameters increases so that dic gives a penalty for the number of parameters dic is used to determine the best model among competing models in bayesian inference where the posterior distribution of the model is obtained through the mcmc method 24 d θ 2 log p y θ 25 p d d θ d θ 26 dic p d d θ the deviance d θ expressed in eq 24 is calculated by multiplying the log likelihood by 2 and using the posterior mean of the parameters p d means the effective number of parameters that are calculated as eq 25 dic is calculated as the sum of d θ and p d as in eq 26 the smaller value in the dic value confirmed the improved performance 3 4 goodness of fit measures for model validation statistical goodness of fit measures gof were used to evaluate the et o estimated through the models during the calibration and validation processes here the estimated et o pm obtained from the fao56 pm method approach is used to validate the estimated et o hs traditional i e traditional regression coefficients in hs equation and simulated et omodel i e recalibrated regression coefficients the model performance during the calibration and validation phase was measured using the correlation coefficient cc representing the degree of a linear relationship between observed o and simulated s values a stronger relationship was obtained as cc approaches 1 model performance was also measured using the root mean square error rmse a value representing the difference between the observed and the estimated values rmse values closer to zero indicate the good fitness of the model the third metric to gage model performance was the index of agreement ioa a standardized value of the degree of error in model predictions an ioa of 1 indicates perfect agreement the fourth gof indicator is the percentage bias the percentage bias can show under or over estimation for the model results eqs 27 to

et o data obtained from the fao56 pm method the periods selected for calibration and validation were 1973 2010 and 2011 2020 respectively the model validation was conducted in the out of sample period where data were not used in the calibration process 4 results in this section results from the multi scale model are compared with et o pm calculated by the fao56 pm method at different time scales as indicated the dic values for each model can be the benchmark for choosing the optimal model the multi scale models are fully compared to both the single scale model and the traditional hs equation for the calibration and validation phase in the context of cross validation 4 1 model comparison based on dic values to statistically examine the effectiveness of multi scale models considering multiple temporal scales accounting for model performance and model complexity dic values are computed for the four types of models fit in each gauge station fig 3 the proposed multi scale models model 2 model 3 and model 4 outperform the single scale model in terms of model fitness based on the dic value model 3 which simultaneously includes the evapotranspiration series at daily and annual scales in estimating model parameters can be more effective than model 2 considering the evapotranspiration series at daily and monthly scales the dic value for model 4 including evapotranspiration at three temporal scales i e daily monthly and annual et o for all stations is the smallest making it the superior model compared to the others 4 2 model performance comparison the mean of estimated parameters for the superior model i e model 4 are summarized in table 3 as a representative model moreover the posterior distributions of regression parameters model 4 for all stations can be found in supplementary material table s2 the regression parameters α β γ and the standard deviations σ day σ month σ year are in the ranges 0 0015 0 0028 19 3 36 0 25 0 49 0 2229 0 3085 0 0801 0 1359 and 0 037 0 0567 respectively as obtained from the posterior distribution the estimated parameters β and γ showed distinctive parameter space from that of the traditional hs equation e g 17 8 and 0 50 for β and γ while the parameter α is comparable to that of the traditional hs equation α 0 0023 as proposed by hargreaves and samani 1985 in addition the credible intervals can be presented from the posterior distributions of regression parameters the credible interval of models was obtained by simulating the et o with parameters of the posterior distributions and demonstrated as the boxplots in the supplemental material fig s1 in this section we describe the results of the optimal multi scale model model 4 with a systematic comparison of the existing traditional hs equation and single scale model model 1 the estimated daily average et o series was obtained from the traditional hs equation single scale model and multi scale model in representative stations of the study area these are presented for a comparison with the fao56 pm in fig 4 the effectiveness of the recalibration process for the hs equation as an intervention was confirmed through the distinctive difference in the bias between et o hs traditional i e black solid line and et o s ingle scale i e green solid line for the calibration and validation phases as shown in fig 4 parameter recalibration is clearly desirable to effectively capture the geographical impact on the estimation of evapotranspiration in a specific region of interest similarly the effectiveness of the multi scale model can be explained by the noticeable reduction in the bias between et o single scale i e solid green line and et o multi scale i e solid blue line especially during the summer season for both the calibration and validation phase to be more specific et o h s traditional i e solid black line which uses the fixed parameters without recalibration clearly leads to an overestimation at a daily timescale over all the stations the single scale model et o single scale solid green line reproduces the et o pm i e solid red line fairly well during the dry season while it fails to provide an accurate estimation during the wet season in contrast the multi scale model et o multi scale solid blue line offers an accurate approximation to the et o pm compared to the single scale model at a daily timescale further the aggregated monthly results over the entire period demonstrate a clear difference in model bias for both the calibration and validation phase as shown in fig 5 as already demonstrated in the daily timescale the monthly average value et o hs traditional solid black line obtained from the traditional hs equation showed a tendency to systematically overestimate at a monthly timescale for all stations and years overall the multi scale model results et o multi scale solid blue line present a more accurate estimation of the reference evapotranspiration compared to those of the single scale it was also observed that estimated et o shows a strong decreasing tendency during the monsoon period especially in july the boxplot in fig 5 represents the entire range of et o pm obtained from the entire period for each month and the range becomes larger during the spring and summer season resulting in a relatively larger bias in that season while being smaller during the winter season more specifically the bias of the multi scale model can be more extensive in spring and summer due to the higher variability in temperature and precipitation the enhancement of the efficacy of the recalibration process at multiple temporal scales can be more easily explained and justified through a scatter plot representing the correlation with monthly et o pm as illustrated in fig 6 finally the aggregated annual et o time series over the entire period are illustrated in fig 7 for both the calibration and validation phase the multi scale model for estimating annual et o shows similar efficacy and superior performance as its preceding temporal scales with respect to reduction in the bias but noticeable interannual variation due to climate variability although the temperature based surrogate model for the estimation of the reference evapotranspiration has limitations in reproducing all the associated properties the annual et o multi scale estimated from the multi scale model shows competitive performance compared to the traditional hs equation et o hs traditional and the single scale model et o single scale moreover we found that the multi scale model demonstrates a high correlation between et o multi scale blue filled circle and et o pm indicating that the recalibration of parameters at multiple temporal scales could be primarily responsible for the differences observed in the single scale model green filled circle and the traditional hs equation black filled circle as illustrated in fig 8 4 3 model validation with statistical gof measures it has been acknowledged that daily et o from the hs equation can be strongly affected by the large variabilities in temperature wind and solar radiation leading to an increase in bias thus the smoothed aggregation approach to the hs equation using five day or longer climate variables has been recommended as an alternative method hargreaves and allen 2003 however daily estimates are typically used to simulate daily long term streamflow sequences through a continuous rainfall runoff model as noted this study aims to reproduce the underlying characteristics of the et o across different temporal scales in these contexts the monthly and annual reference evapotranspiration estimates are evaluated using statistical gof measures i e cc rmse ioa percentage bias statistical gof for the calibration 1973 2010 and validation 2011 2020 periods are evaluated in the han river basin as summarized in fig 9 the correlation coefficient cc for the monthly evapotranspiration ranges from 0 967 to 0 992 from 0 976 to 0 994 for the traditional hs equation et o hs traditional black triangles from 0 973 to 0 993 from 0 974 to 0 994 for the single scale model et o single scale green squares and from 0 970 to 0 993 from 0 972 to 0 994 for the multi scale model et o multi scale blue circles describing the calibration period or the validation period respectively as shown in fig 9 the range of the correlation coefficient is relatively narrow and noticeable changes were not observed although the traditional hs equation showed slightly better performance it should be noted that the correlation coefficient is a statistical measure for evaluating a linear relationship so one cannot expect an improvement within the recalibration or bias correction process kim et al 2018b on the other hand both single scale and multi scale models demonstrate better performance in terms of the rmse representing a significant reduction in the rmse more specifically the rmse for the monthly evapotranspiration ranges from 9 01 to 25 65 mm month from 8 19 to 24 80 for the traditional hs equation et o hs traditional black triangles from 6 13 to 9 29 mm month from 7 28 to 12 51 for the single scale model et o single scale green squares and from 5 39 to 7 98 mm month from 5 50 to 9 32 for the multi scale model et o multi scale blue circles describing the calibration period or the validation period respectively there is a significant increase in the degree of reduction in the rmse to between 11 and 69 in addition the index of agreement ioa was evaluated and a similar pattern observed in the rmse was identified finally the percentage bias for models i e hs model the single scale and multi scale model can effectively represent under and over estimation of the simulation results the results illustrated that et o hs traditional black triangles was overestimated and et o single scale green squares was slightly underestimated the et o m ulti scale blue circles was placed almost close to zero for the calibration and validation period further the model performance for the annual evapotranspiration was also explored the correlation coefficient for the annual evapotranspiration is the range of 0 242 0 808 0 408 0 970 for the traditional hs equation et o hs traditional black triangles 0 134 0 805 0 402 0 958 for the single scale model et o single scale green squares and 0 217 0 796 0 436 0 957 for the multi scale model et o multi scale blue circles describing the calibration period or the validation period respectively as already demonstrated in the monthly evapotranspiration the correlation coefficient over the single and multi scale models was not significantly different for the annual scale however the rmse for the annual evapotranspiration is in the range of 52 80 268 36 mm year 53 38 257 76 for the traditional hs equation black triangles 44 86 66 01 mm year 22 35 117 31 for the single scale model green squares and 28 05 50 34 mm year 21 51 78 40 for the multi scale model blue circles describing the calibration period or the validation period respectively more importantly there was a noticeable reduction in the rmse that led to a decrease of about 15 81 for the calibration and validation periods additionally the variability of rmse results for models is presented by the boxplot in supplemental material fig s2 as seen in figure the model performance of the multi scale model is outperformed in all timescales all the gof results over all the stations for different time scales can be found in supplementary material table s3 5 summary and conclusions existing studies have focused on recalibrating the parameters of the hs equation locally to improve the accuracy of the estimation of reference evapotranspiration using daily temperature data feng et al 2017 haslinger and bartsch 2016 mehdizadeh et al 2017 mendicino and senatore 2013 vanderlinden et al 2004 the hs equation provides a systematic framework for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration in the simplest most parsimonious manner as a surrogate model however there is likely to be a limitation in representing the complex mechanism of the evapotranspiration process using the hs equation which solely uses temperature data as an independent variable under these circumstances this study proposed a novel multi scale context i e daily monthly and annual scales approach to the hs equation for a better fit of the reference evapotranspiration obtained from the fao56 pm method the proposed models were evaluated using meteorological data for the han river watershed in south korea this study explored four types of surrogate models in terms of estimating model parameters for improving the existing hs equation for reference evapotranspiration a bayesian modeling framework for the inference of model parameters was further proposed among the models the model performances were compared through the deviance information criterion dic with the single scale model model 1 and the traditional hs equation that is based on fixed parameters finally the models were evaluated by gof measures during the calibration period 1973 2010 and validation period 2011 2020 in the cross validation framework the key findings from this study are as follows 1 the hs equation with the fixed parameters without recalibration clearly leads to an overestimation of the reference et for all stations on one hand the locally recalibrated approach to the hs equation at a daily temporal scale i e single scale model model 1 can effectively reduce the systematic bias associated with the use of the traditional hs equation with fixed parameters reflecting the geographical impact on the estimation of evapotranspiration in a specific region of interest the single scale model can reproduce the reference evapotranspiration fairly well during the dry season while failing to provide an accurate estimation particularly during the wet season on the other hand the recalibrated hs model using only daily evapotranspiration during the parameter estimation process is insufficient to reproduce the underlying distribution of evapotranspiration at different temporal scales e g monthly and annual which may lead to a large systematic bias in the rainfall runoff modeling or assessment of climate change impact on water resources 2 this study developed a novel approach to the hs equation to better reproduce the reference evapotranspiration across different temporal scales by simultaneously maximizing the likelihood function at multiple temporal scales within a bayesian modeling framework more specifically the multi scale model for the hs equation exploits multiple likelihood functions defined at three different temporal scales i e daily monthly and annual in a model by sequentially summing the monthly and annual evapotranspiration from the estimated daily evapotranspiration the regression parameters α β γ of the multi scale model for the model 4 including daily monthly and annual evapotranspiration series were in the ranges of 0 0015 0 0028 19 3 36 0 25 0 49 respectively over all the stations more importantly the estimated parameters β and γ showed somewhat different parameter space from that of the traditional hs equation while the parameter α was similar to that of the traditional hs equation 3 the multi scale model offered an accurate approximation to the reference evapotranspiration compared to the single scale model at a daily timescale overall the multi scale model demonstrated a more precise estimation of the reference evapotranspiration at the aggregated temporal scales i e monthly and annual compared to those of the single scale the enhanced efficacy of the recalibration process at multiple temporal scales can be more easily explained and justified through gof measures such as the rmse and ioa to be more specific the multi scale models showed a significant increase in the degree of reduction in the rmse achieved by up to about 60 and 70 compared to that of the traditional hs equation for the monthly and annual evapotranspiration estimation respectively moreover a similar pattern observed in the rmse was also identified for the index of agreement ioa measure 4 the main limitation of this study is that the hs equation largely relies on the standard pm model which requires a set of meteorological data to estimate et o that are not readily available in many countries data requirements for the standard pm model can hinder the use of the hs equation in a practical application meanwhile the hs equation is still effective as a surrogate model to the standard pm model due to the advantages of accuracy consistency and parsimoniousness thus a regionalization approach to the hs parameters can be alternatively introduced by considering the local climate conditions and topographical characteristics to the best of our knowledge this study is the first attempt to obtain a set of parameters of the hs equation for estimating evapotranspiration by simultaneously considering evapotranspiration at multiple time scales the proposed model still shows limitations in reproducing the inherent characteristics of evapotranspiration during the summer season this may be due to different responses to temperature in estimating evapotranspiration in the hs equation this issue was not fully explored in the current study and time varying parameters on the basis of the seasonality of evapotranspiration will be investigated in future work more formally future work will focus on developing a regional surrogate model within a hierarchical bayesian modeling framework to better characterize the spatio temporal patterns of evapotranspiration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9215,the main focus of this study is to develop a multi scale surrogate model for the fao 56 penman monteith pm evapotranspiration et o using hargreaves samani hs equation which uses only temperature as a hydrometeorological variable to estimate et this feature is particularly useful for scarce data regions and climate change impact assessment studies where the direct estimation of et o from the pm equation can be problematic as the parameters of the hs equation may vary across space a bayesian approach was adopted to estimate or recalibrate them rather than relying on the fixed values as suggested in the traditional model the bayesian approach allows a sound development of our model in a multi scale temporal framework where the et o at daily monthly and annual scales are jointly used to estimate the hs equation parameters the proposed and reference models are applied and tested using meteorological data from 17 stations located across the han river basin in south korea the results indicate that the traditional hs equation with fixed parameters and without recalibration tends to overestimate the reference et for all stations the locally recalibrated approach to the hs equation at a daily temporal scale can effectively reduce the systematic bias associated with the use of the traditional hs equation but fails to reproduce the underlying distribution of et o at different temporal scales e g monthly and annual this leads to a large systematic bias in et o at these scales in contrast the proposed multi scale surrogate model offers a more precise estimation of the reference et at a daily timescale as well as at the aggregated monthly and annual temporal scales this is particularly useful to minimize the systematic bias often observed when using traditional surrogate models for the reference et in hydrological studies such as rainfall runoff modeling and assessment of climate change impact on water resources keywords evapotranspiration hargreaves samani equation multiscale model bayesian model penman monteith equation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the hydrological cycle involves the continuous process of water fluxes across their reservoirs land oceans and atmosphere among the hydrologic flux components evapotranspiration et responds to a substantial transport of water over in the hydrological cycle kim et al 2018a kwon et al 2012 mccoll and rigden 2020 novák 2012 zhao et al 2013 in terms of the hydrological cycle et represents the key process of removing water from the surface to the atmosphere which is the opposite process of precipitation the land surface returns approximately 60 of precipitation to the atmosphere annually via the et process l vovich et al 1990 therefore accurate estimation of et is often required to establish effective management plans for water resources e g demand analysis of water irrigation management drought monitoring etc zhao et al 2013 the main concepts of et can be divided into potential evapotranspiration et p and reference evapotranspiration et o the et p refers to the maximum moisture loss from the surface which is strongly affected by meteorological conditions and the surface type assuming conditions of unlimited moisture supply lhomme 1997 on the other hand the reference evapotranspiration et o can be defined as the hypothetical evapotranspiration rate of an extensive green grass surface allen et al 1998 et o is routinely estimated through the physically based fao56 penman monteith fao56 pm equation which is recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao and has been used by various organizations e g wmo and icid however the fao56 pm method requires a set of meteorological data i e wind speed radiation air temperature and relative humidity to estimate et o that are not readily available and therefore limit the use of the fao56 pm in data sparse parts of the world especially in developing countries such a problem arises in the study of the impact of climate change on water resources due to difficulties in obtaining reliable meteorological forcing data from climate change scenarios required for estimating et o through the fao56 pm equation in this context the hargreaves samani hs equation hargreaves and samani 1982 1985 using daily air temperature data was proposed as a surrogate model to the fao56 pm for the et o the hs equation has been widely applied for the estimation of et o due to its accuracy consistency and parsimonious nature the hs formula has a physical interpretation and the temperature range tmax tmin between the maximum and minimum temperature is aiming to represent atmospheric transparency the air temperature used in the hs equation is one of the most widely observed meteorological data permitting easy implementation with long term temperature data mendicino and senatore 2013 however the hs equation relies on model coefficients which in turn can be linked to the local climate conditions and topographical characteristics therefore recalibration of the hs equation is required to minimize systematic error several studies have been proposed to improve the accuracy of the estimated et o by recalibrating the parameters of the hs equation in particular the pattern of et o appears to be different due to various meteorological factors affecting evapotranspiration thus the hs equation has been evaluated under various climate regimes e g arid and semiarid and regions e g inland and coast most studies focused on the assessment of et o estimated from the hs equation in a particular climate zone gavilán et al 2006 martínez cob and tejero juste 2004 raziei and pereira 2013 todorovic et al 2013 yang et al 2021 almorox et al 2015 evaluated 11 representative temperature based models for estimating et o in different climate zones across the world more specifically the applicability of the different temperature based models was explored in the context of the koppen climate classification as a benchmark for the fao56 pm method on a monthly timescale the study concluded that the hs equation could provide satisfactory performance in different climate regimes i e arid semiarid temperate cold and polar climates an alternative approach was proposed for regional adjustment of the hargreaves samani coefficient by examining its relationship with temperature vanderlinden et al 2004 presented the adjusted hargreaves samani coefficient ahc and evaluated the estimated daily et o against the et o obtained from fao56 pm at meteorological stations located inland and in coastal areas the adjusted hargreaves samani coefficient ahc which is obtained through regression analysis appears to increase at coastal stations and decrease across inland stations su et al 2022 provided a comparison between several temperature and radiation based evapotranspiration methods for the evaluation of regional irrigation water demand the calibrated hargreaves samani and priestley taylor methods can greatly increase efficiency and accuracy in estimating regional or worldwide irrigation water demand shirmohammadi aliakbarkhani and saberali 2020 presented a reliable alternative et o models requiring fewer input data compared with the fao penman monteith method in iran in the study area the temperature based methods typically outperformed the radiation based methods more specifically the jensen haise method showed better performance for the warm growing season while the hargreaves samani method was the best performance for the cool growing season in recent studies machine learning i e artificial neural network ann extreme learning machine elm wavelet neural network wnn and bayesian theory have been used to estimate parameters of the hs equation and forecast the et 0 falamarzi et al 2014 feng et al 2017 2016 kang et al 2022 traore et al 2016 traore et al 2016 employed an ann for short term forecasting of et o using climate information retrieved from climate forecast products in the public domain feng et al 2017 calibrated the hs equation using bayesian theory in the sichuan basin of southwest china the study concluded that the calibrated hs equation still overestimated et o at different temporal scales although the calibrated hs equation provided a better fit for the penman monteith equation than that of the traditional hs equation since the hs equation was empirically developed based on data from arid to sub humid conditions it may not fit well in areas far different from those considered for its calibration as is the case for humid climates raziei and pereira 2013 almorox et al 2015 evaluated the temperature based evapotranspiration equation for each köppen climate zone and found that the hs equation performed best in most climatic zones including temperate climates in which the study area i e south korea was located here a surrogate model based on the hs equation is developed considering both daily et o and monthly and annual et o which was referred to as the multi scale surrogate model most studies locally recalibrated parameters of the hs equation using daily temperature data as input the existing studies consider only a single temporal scale for estimating et o named the single scale surrogate model since the single scale surrogate model solely uses temperature data as an independent variable there may be a limitation in capturing the complex mechanism of the whole et process using the hs equation in this context a modest difference in the daily estimates of et o may lead to a significant increase in the et o bias when estimated at aggregated monthly and annual scales in this case the estimated et o from a single scale surrogate model can be difficult to use for water resource management therefore our goal in this study was to develop a novel approach to the hs equation for a better fit for the et o obtained from the fao56 pm method at multi scale context as discussed above a bayesian modeling framework is also employed for parameter estimation the proposed model was fit and tested using meteorological data obtained for the han river watershed in south korea to the best of our knowledge simultaneous parameter estimation at multiple time scales i e daily monthly and annual scales in a surrogate model for the et o has not been properly explored in the literature this study explores the following types of surrogate models in terms of estimating model parameters for improving the existing surrogate model for the et o model 1 single scale surrogate model using daily temperature data as a baseline model model 2 multi scale surrogate model using daily and monthly temperature data model 3 multi scale surrogate model using daily and annual temperature data model 4 multi scale surrogate model using daily monthly and annual temperature data given the four different models this study sought to explore the following questions by comparing the performance in terms of reproducing the underlying characteristics of the et o estimated from the fao56 pm equation over the han river watershed in south korea 1 how effective is a locally recalibrated approach for the hs equation in terms of minimizing systematic error at different time scales 2 can the hs model coefficients for the local daily et o be simultaneously estimated by considering aggregated et o at multiple time scales 3 can a multi scale surrogate modeling approach accurately reproduce the underlying distribution of the et o at different time scales this paper is organized as follows this section provides a brief background and the main purpose of this study in section 2 the study area and data used in this study are provided the methodology for multi scale surrogate models within a bayesian modeling framework is described in section 3 the results and discussion are presented with a comparison between models in section 4 and the summary and conclusions for this study are finally given in section 5 2 study area and meteorological data this study was carried out on the basis of 17 asos automated synoptic observing service stations operated by the kma korea meteorological administration over the han river basin in south korea the daily solar radiation air temperature i e average maximum and minimum temperature humidity and wind speed data were collected from asos stations through the website https data kma go kr the et o was then obtained from the fao56 pm method using a set of meteorological data listed above the han river is a major river in south korea which originates from the north and south han rivers in the central part of the korean peninsula latitude 36 30 38 55 n longitude 126 24 129 02 e and flows through the capital seoul the basin area is about 25 594 km2 covering a quarter of the land area of south korea the han river receives annual average precipitation of about 1253 mm and approximately 71 of the annual precipitation occurs during the summer season from june to september so et al 2017 fig 1 illustrates the location of the asos stations over the han river basin and the stations selected for the study are described in table 1 3 methodology among the temperature based models for the et o the hs equation was considered as a surrogate model for the fao56 pm method the parameters of the hs equation were estimated through a bayesian theory to improve inference and better handle uncertainties in model parameters the optimal model and its performance evaluation were carried out using the deviance information criterion dic value within a hierarchical bayesian modeling framework a detailed procedure of the modeling process for the multi scale surrogate model for et o is illustrated in fig 2 as seen in fig 1 the et o was obtained using the meteorological data in the han river basin as input to both the fao56 pm method and the traditional hs equation with fixed coefficients here the et o estimated by the fao56 pm method et o pm was used for locally recalibrating the hs equation in a regression framework the et o pm can be regarded as a dependent variable in this study the surrogate models can be classified as single scale and multi scale models in terms of temporal scale in the final step the results obtained from the different models are then demonstrated through goodness of fit measures and are compared with et o pm and et o hg traditional 3 1 evapotranspiration equations the evapotranspiration equations for estimating the et i e et o and et p were empirically derived by considering physical relationships between et and meteorological input variables xiang et al 2020 provided details on the concepts equations and applications of reference evapotranspiration et o and potential evapotranspiration et p the et p equations can be categorized into four groups based on key concepts and variables i dalton ii temperature iii radiation and iv combination similarly the et o equations can be categorized into four types i temperature ii radiation iii pan evaporation and iv combination xiang et al 2020 various approaches to et o have been widely applied in the field of hydrology including fao56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1985 1982 asce pm allen et al 2005 this study mainly utilizes the physically based fao56 pm method and the temperature based hs equation as a surrogate model for the fao56 pm estimates 3 1 1 fao56 penman monteith methods the fao56 pm method has been demonstrated in many studies and many institutions have recommended it as a representative approach for estimating the et o the fao56 pm is a physics based et estimation method informed by various meteorological factors i e temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed etc and it can be written as follows 1 et o pm 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et o is the reference evapotranspiration mm day r n is the net radiation mj m 2 day g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa e s e a is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa δ is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa and finally the γ is the psychrometric constant kpa allen et al 1998 zotarelli et al 2010 3 1 2 hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 proposed the hs equation which is based mainly on temperature for the estimation of et the hs equation consists of four terms the maximum temperature t max minimum temperature t min average temperature and radiant energy 2 et o hs traditional 0 0023 ra t 17 8 tr 0 50 where ra is the extraterrestrial radiation in mm day tr is the temperature range or difference between the maximum and minimum temperature in and t is the average temperature in there are three fixed parameters to define the relationship between the et o and the extraterrestrial radiation ra and air temperature t hargreaves 1994 presented radiant energy according to latitude and month allen et al 1998 recommended the hs equation as an alternative method when the input data of the fao56 pm method is insufficient since only observed temperature data are required the hs equation has been widely used for estimating and predicting et o in worldwide locations where the fao56 pm method is not feasible due to insufficient and unreliable meteorological data hargreaves and allen 2003 it is also desirable to calibrate or re estimate the associated parameters in eq 2 for the specific region of interest lee and park 2008 moon et al 2013 as the evapotranspiration might be influenced by geographical features and local characteristics e g land use altitude and so on the hs equation is generally calibrated using daily data which might be insufficient to reproduce underlying characteristics at aggregated time scales i e monthly and annual scales as the parameter estimates are subject to the daily variations of the input meteorological data moreover the most common approach to estimating the regression coefficients is the least square method where parameter uncertainties may not be sufficiently addressed in this regard this study offers a model within a bayesian inference modeling framework to better quantify the uncertainty associated with parameters in the hs equation the bayesian approach to the hs equation is presented in the following section 3 2 bayesian approach to the hs equation the bayesian inference is a statistical tool to update the model parameters with observed data from a prior distribution p θ to the posterior distribution p θ y gelman et al 2004 the bayesian inference which presents the parameters in the form of a probability distribution can be used to quantitatively evaluate the uncertainty associated with the model parameters to make probability statements about parameter θ given data y a joint probability distribution p θ y for θ and y is used the joint probability density function can be written as a product of two probability densities that are often referred to as the prior distribution p θ and the likelihood p y θ 3 p θ y p θ p y θ the posterior distribution p θ y can be defined as a conditional distribution by adopting bayes rule gelman et al 2004 given a prior distribution p y and a likelihood p y θ with observations y 4 p θ y p θ y p y p θ p y θ p y a general form of the hs equation based surrogated model for estimating evapotranspiration can be found in eq 5 there are three parameters to be estimated with the observed temperature and the et o obtained from the fao 56 pm method several publications have presented improved parameters for hs equation in the different climatic zone gavilán et al 2006 martínez cob and tejero juste 2004 raziei and pereira 2013 todorovic et al 2013 yang et al 2021 among many others the parameters suggested in the traditional hs equation hargreaves and samani 1985 are 0 0023 17 8 and 0 5 for α β and γ respectively 5 et o hs α ra t β t max t min γ the bayesian information criterion bic is used to select the best fitted distribution among various probability distributions in this study the et o follows a lognormal distribution ln with mean μ and standard deviation σ as shown in eq 6 the bic values for each distribution is illustrated in the supplementary material table s1 the models with lower bic are generally preferred in eq 7 y obs i j k day denotes the et o value i e et o pm for the day i month j and year k estimated from the fao56 pm method and it is assumed to be a log normal distribution with a mean of μ day i j k and standard deviation of σ here the mean μ day i j k is a function of the temperature range between the maximum and minimum temperature and the average temperature t in bayesian inference it is critical to choose a reasonable prior distribution for parameters when sufficient data is available but prior information about parameters is weak a non informative prior distribution can be used the prior distributions of each parameter i e α β γ σ are defined in eqs 8 to 11 the α β and γ represent parameters of the hs equation to be estimated with prior distributions e g normal distribution n and gamma distribution γ sufficient data i e 40 year 365 days 14 600 days are available to estimate the four parameters furthermore one can adopt non informative prior distributions for the parameters as proposed in gelman et al 2004 considering our vague information about the parameters 6 ln μ σ 1 y σ

1 1 where i j represents the number of days in month j at some stations the relatively low daily average temperature can lead to a negative term t t β in eq 5 resulting in a negative et o in this regard as shown in eq 9 this study adopts a truncated normal distribution for the parameter β to be sampled from a constraint on the daily minimum temperature t min the joint posterior distribution of the set of parameters θ α β γ σ can be formulated as the product of the likelihood eq 12 and priors as shown in eq 13 12 p y θ k 1 n j 1 12 i 1 i j ln μ day i j k α ra j t i j k β t max i j k t min i

comparison with the multi scale models developed in this study the set of parameters θ are estimated by maximizing the joint posterior distribution as illustrated in eq 13 through the gibbs sampling approach gilkst et al 1995 kim et al 2015 kwon et al 2008 lima et al 2018 so et al 2017 which is a special case of the markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach the primary competitive advantage of gibbs sampling is that it can provide an efficient way to deal with multidimensional data of the complex problem compared to other approaches such as the metropolis hastings mh algorithm 3 3 multi scale surrogate model the main purpose of this study is to improve the accuracy of et o estimation at multiple temporal scales i e daily monthly and annual by recalibrating the single scale model and its extension to the multi scale model more specifically the multi scale model is designed to better reproduce the et o across different temporal scales by simultaneously maximizing the likelihood function associated with the et o at multiple temporal scales the proposed surrogate models for the et o can be classified into 4 models based on the different combinations of temporal scales as summarized in table 2 the key step of this study is to simultaneously maximize the likelihood functions of daily monthly and annual et o as written in eqs 14a 14c in a model of the multi scale model by sequentially summing the monthly and annual evapotranspiration from the estimated daily et o as illustrated in eqs 15a 15c respectively more specifically the monthly and annual et o i e y obs j k month y obs k year are assumed to follow a lognormal distribution with the summed et o as the mean μ month j k μ year k and standard deviation σ month σ year eqs 14b 14c the multi scale models have a different number of parameters according to the temporal scales considered in each model as illustrated in table 2 more specifically the multi scale models consider daily monthly and annual et o when estimating a set of parameters by simultaneously maximizing likelihood functions at three different temporal scales in an integrated manner as summarized in eqs 14a 14c the prior distributions for regression parameters α β and γ including the standard deviation σ day σ month σ year of the lognormal distribution at each temporal scale can be defined as eqs 16 to 21 like the single scale model represented in the previous section there are sufficient data to estimate the regression parameters for the mean and standard deviation of the lognormal distribution thus non informative prior distributions for the parameters were considered as proposed in gelman et al 2004 more specifically normal prior distributions n were used for the regression parameters α β while the gamma prior distribution γ was adopted for the parameter γ for the standard deviation σ day σ month σ year of the lognormal distribution the gamma prior distribution γ which is a conjugate distribution of the lognormal distribution was used the conjugate prior distribution is the case that the prior and posterior distributions are in the same probability distribution family leading to a computational

information criterion dic was used to explore the model performance the dic value was computed to measure the fitness of a candidate model for a given datum by penalizing the fitness of the model for model complexity defined by the effective number of parameters in other words overfitting may occur as the number of parameters increases so that dic gives a penalty for the number of parameters dic is used to determine the best model among competing models in bayesian inference where the posterior distribution of the model is obtained through the mcmc method 24 d θ 2 log p y θ 25 p d d θ d θ 26 dic p d d θ the deviance d θ expressed in eq 24 is calculated by multiplying the log likelihood by 2 and using the posterior mean of the parameters p d means the effective number of parameters that are calculated as eq 25 dic is calculated as the sum of d θ and p d as in eq 26 the smaller value in the dic value confirmed the improved performance 3 4 goodness of fit measures for model validation statistical goodness of fit measures gof were used to evaluate the et o estimated through the models during the calibration and validation processes here the estimated et o pm obtained from the fao56 pm method approach is used to validate the estimated et o hs traditional i e traditional regression coefficients in hs equation and simulated et omodel i e recalibrated regression coefficients the model performance during the calibration and validation phase was measured using the correlation coefficient cc representing the degree of a linear relationship between observed o and simulated s values a stronger relationship was obtained as cc approaches 1 model performance was also measured using the root mean square error rmse a value representing the difference between the observed and the estimated values rmse values closer to zero indicate the good fitness of the model the third metric to gage model performance was the index of agreement ioa a standardized value of the degree of error in model predictions an ioa of 1 indicates perfect agreement the fourth gof indicator is the percentage bias the percentage bias can show under or over estimation for the model results eqs 27 to

et o data obtained from the fao56 pm method the periods selected for calibration and validation were 1973 2010 and 2011 2020 respectively the model validation was conducted in the out of sample period where data were not used in the calibration process 4 results in this section results from the multi scale model are compared with et o pm calculated by the fao56 pm method at different time scales as indicated the dic values for each model can be the benchmark for choosing the optimal model the multi scale models are fully compared to both the single scale model and the traditional hs equation for the calibration and validation phase in the context of cross validation 4 1 model comparison based on dic values to statistically examine the effectiveness of multi scale models considering multiple temporal scales accounting for model performance and model complexity dic values are computed for the four types of models fit in each gauge station fig 3 the proposed multi scale models model 2 model 3 and model 4 outperform the single scale model in terms of model fitness based on the dic value model 3 which simultaneously includes the evapotranspiration series at daily and annual scales in estimating model parameters can be more effective than model 2 considering the evapotranspiration series at daily and monthly scales the dic value for model 4 including evapotranspiration at three temporal scales i e daily monthly and annual et o for all stations is the smallest making it the superior model compared to the others 4 2 model performance comparison the mean of estimated parameters for the superior model i e model 4 are summarized in table 3 as a representative model moreover the posterior distributions of regression parameters model 4 for all stations can be found in supplementary material table s2 the regression parameters α β γ and the standard deviations σ day σ month σ year are in the ranges 0 0015 0 0028 19 3 36 0 25 0 49 0 2229 0 3085 0 0801 0 1359 and 0 037 0 0567 respectively as obtained from the posterior distribution the estimated parameters β and γ showed distinctive parameter space from that of the traditional hs equation e g 17 8 and 0 50 for β and γ while the parameter α is comparable to that of the traditional hs equation α 0 0023 as proposed by hargreaves and samani 1985 in addition the credible intervals can be presented from the posterior distributions of regression parameters the credible interval of models was obtained by simulating the et o with parameters of the posterior distributions and demonstrated as the boxplots in the supplemental material fig s1 in this section we describe the results of the optimal multi scale model model 4 with a systematic comparison of the existing traditional hs equation and single scale model model 1 the estimated daily average et o series was obtained from the traditional hs equation single scale model and multi scale model in representative stations of the study area these are presented for a comparison with the fao56 pm in fig 4 the effectiveness of the recalibration process for the hs equation as an intervention was confirmed through the distinctive difference in the bias between et o hs traditional i e black solid line and et o s ingle scale i e green solid line for the calibration and validation phases as shown in fig 4 parameter recalibration is clearly desirable to effectively capture the geographical impact on the estimation of evapotranspiration in a specific region of interest similarly the effectiveness of the multi scale model can be explained by the noticeable reduction in the bias between et o single scale i e solid green line and et o multi scale i e solid blue line especially during the summer season for both the calibration and validation phase to be more specific et o h s traditional i e solid black line which uses the fixed parameters without recalibration clearly leads to an overestimation at a daily timescale over all the stations the single scale model et o single scale solid green line reproduces the et o pm i e solid red line fairly well during the dry season while it fails to provide an accurate estimation during the wet season in contrast the multi scale model et o multi scale solid blue line offers an accurate approximation to the et o pm compared to the single scale model at a daily timescale further the aggregated monthly results over the entire period demonstrate a clear difference in model bias for both the calibration and validation phase as shown in fig 5 as already demonstrated in the daily timescale the monthly average value et o hs traditional solid black line obtained from the traditional hs equation showed a tendency to systematically overestimate at a monthly timescale for all stations and years overall the multi scale model results et o multi scale solid blue line present a more accurate estimation of the reference evapotranspiration compared to those of the single scale it was also observed that estimated et o shows a strong decreasing tendency during the monsoon period especially in july the boxplot in fig 5 represents the entire range of et o pm obtained from the entire period for each month and the range becomes larger during the spring and summer season resulting in a relatively larger bias in that season while being smaller during the winter season more specifically the bias of the multi scale model can be more extensive in spring and summer due to the higher variability in temperature and precipitation the enhancement of the efficacy of the recalibration process at multiple temporal scales can be more easily explained and justified through a scatter plot representing the correlation with monthly et o pm as illustrated in fig 6 finally the aggregated annual et o time series over the entire period are illustrated in fig 7 for both the calibration and validation phase the multi scale model for estimating annual et o shows similar efficacy and superior performance as its preceding temporal scales with respect to reduction in the bias but noticeable interannual variation due to climate variability although the temperature based surrogate model for the estimation of the reference evapotranspiration has limitations in reproducing all the associated properties the annual et o multi scale estimated from the multi scale model shows competitive performance compared to the traditional hs equation et o hs traditional and the single scale model et o single scale moreover we found that the multi scale model demonstrates a high correlation between et o multi scale blue filled circle and et o pm indicating that the recalibration of parameters at multiple temporal scales could be primarily responsible for the differences observed in the single scale model green filled circle and the traditional hs equation black filled circle as illustrated in fig 8 4 3 model validation with statistical gof measures it has been acknowledged that daily et o from the hs equation can be strongly affected by the large variabilities in temperature wind and solar radiation leading to an increase in bias thus the smoothed aggregation approach to the hs equation using five day or longer climate variables has been recommended as an alternative method hargreaves and allen 2003 however daily estimates are typically used to simulate daily long term streamflow sequences through a continuous rainfall runoff model as noted this study aims to reproduce the underlying characteristics of the et o across different temporal scales in these contexts the monthly and annual reference evapotranspiration estimates are evaluated using statistical gof measures i e cc rmse ioa percentage bias statistical gof for the calibration 1973 2010 and validation 2011 2020 periods are evaluated in the han river basin as summarized in fig 9 the correlation coefficient cc for the monthly evapotranspiration ranges from 0 967 to 0 992 from 0 976 to 0 994 for the traditional hs equation et o hs traditional black triangles from 0 973 to 0 993 from 0 974 to 0 994 for the single scale model et o single scale green squares and from 0 970 to 0 993 from 0 972 to 0 994 for the multi scale model et o multi scale blue circles describing the calibration period or the validation period respectively as shown in fig 9 the range of the correlation coefficient is relatively narrow and noticeable changes were not observed although the traditional hs equation showed slightly better performance it should be noted that the correlation coefficient is a statistical measure for evaluating a linear relationship so one cannot expect an improvement within the recalibration or bias correction process kim et al 2018b on the other hand both single scale and multi scale models demonstrate better performance in terms of the rmse representing a significant reduction in the rmse more specifically the rmse for the monthly evapotranspiration ranges from 9 01 to 25 65 mm month from 8 19 to 24 80 for the traditional hs equation et o hs traditional black triangles from 6 13 to 9 29 mm month from 7 28 to 12 51 for the single scale model et o single scale green squares and from 5 39 to 7 98 mm month from 5 50 to 9 32 for the multi scale model et o multi scale blue circles describing the calibration period or the validation period respectively there is a significant increase in the degree of reduction in the rmse to between 11 and 69 in addition the index of agreement ioa was evaluated and a similar pattern observed in the rmse was identified finally the percentage bias for models i e hs model the single scale and multi scale model can effectively represent under and over estimation of the simulation results the results illustrated that et o hs traditional black triangles was overestimated and et o single scale green squares was slightly underestimated the et o m ulti scale blue circles was placed almost close to zero for the calibration and validation period further the model performance for the annual evapotranspiration was also explored the correlation coefficient for the annual evapotranspiration is the range of 0 242 0 808 0 408 0 970 for the traditional hs equation et o hs traditional black triangles 0 134 0 805 0 402 0 958 for the single scale model et o single scale green squares and 0 217 0 796 0 436 0 957 for the multi scale model et o multi scale blue circles describing the calibration period or the validation period respectively as already demonstrated in the monthly evapotranspiration the correlation coefficient over the single and multi scale models was not significantly different for the annual scale however the rmse for the annual evapotranspiration is in the range of 52 80 268 36 mm year 53 38 257 76 for the traditional hs equation black triangles 44 86 66 01 mm year 22 35 117 31 for the single scale model green squares and 28 05 50 34 mm year 21 51 78 40 for the multi scale model blue circles describing the calibration period or the validation period respectively more importantly there was a noticeable reduction in the rmse that led to a decrease of about 15 81 for the calibration and validation periods additionally the variability of rmse results for models is presented by the boxplot in supplemental material fig s2 as seen in figure the model performance of the multi scale model is outperformed in all timescales all the gof results over all the stations for different time scales can be found in supplementary material table s3 5 summary and conclusions existing studies have focused on recalibrating the parameters of the hs equation locally to improve the accuracy of the estimation of reference evapotranspiration using daily temperature data feng et al 2017 haslinger and bartsch 2016 mehdizadeh et al 2017 mendicino and senatore 2013 vanderlinden et al 2004 the hs equation provides a systematic framework for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration in the simplest most parsimonious manner as a surrogate model however there is likely to be a limitation in representing the complex mechanism of the evapotranspiration process using the hs equation which solely uses temperature data as an independent variable under these circumstances this study proposed a novel multi scale context i e daily monthly and annual scales approach to the hs equation for a better fit of the reference evapotranspiration obtained from the fao56 pm method the proposed models were evaluated using meteorological data for the han river watershed in south korea this study explored four types of surrogate models in terms of estimating model parameters for improving the existing hs equation for reference evapotranspiration a bayesian modeling framework for the inference of model parameters was further proposed among the models the model performances were compared through the deviance information criterion dic with the single scale model model 1 and the traditional hs equation that is based on fixed parameters finally the models were evaluated by gof measures during the calibration period 1973 2010 and validation period 2011 2020 in the cross validation framework the key findings from this study are as follows 1 the hs equation with the fixed parameters without recalibration clearly leads to an overestimation of the reference et for all stations on one hand the locally recalibrated approach to the hs equation at a daily temporal scale i e single scale model model 1 can effectively reduce the systematic bias associated with the use of the traditional hs equation with fixed parameters reflecting the geographical impact on the estimation of evapotranspiration in a specific region of interest the single scale model can reproduce the reference evapotranspiration fairly well during the dry season while failing to provide an accurate estimation particularly during the wet season on the other hand the recalibrated hs model using only daily evapotranspiration during the parameter estimation process is insufficient to reproduce the underlying distribution of evapotranspiration at different temporal scales e g monthly and annual which may lead to a large systematic bias in the rainfall runoff modeling or assessment of climate change impact on water resources 2 this study developed a novel approach to the hs equation to better reproduce the reference evapotranspiration across different temporal scales by simultaneously maximizing the likelihood function at multiple temporal scales within a bayesian modeling framework more specifically the multi scale model for the hs equation exploits multiple likelihood functions defined at three different temporal scales i e daily monthly and annual in a model by sequentially summing the monthly and annual evapotranspiration from the estimated daily evapotranspiration the regression parameters α β γ of the multi scale model for the model 4 including daily monthly and annual evapotranspiration series were in the ranges of 0 0015 0 0028 19 3 36 0 25 0 49 respectively over all the stations more importantly the estimated parameters β and γ showed somewhat different parameter space from that of the traditional hs equation while the parameter α was similar to that of the traditional hs equation 3 the multi scale model offered an accurate approximation to the reference evapotranspiration compared to the single scale model at a daily timescale overall the multi scale model demonstrated a more precise estimation of the reference evapotranspiration at the aggregated temporal scales i e monthly and annual compared to those of the single scale the enhanced efficacy of the recalibration process at multiple temporal scales can be more easily explained and justified through gof measures such as the rmse and ioa to be more specific the multi scale models showed a significant increase in the degree of reduction in the rmse achieved by up to about 60 and 70 compared to that of the traditional hs equation for the monthly and annual evapotranspiration estimation respectively moreover a similar pattern observed in the rmse was also identified for the index of agreement ioa measure 4 the main limitation of this study is that the hs equation largely relies on the standard pm model which requires a set of meteorological data to estimate et o that are not readily available in many countries data requirements for the standard pm model can hinder the use of the hs equation in a practical application meanwhile the hs equation is still effective as a surrogate model to the standard pm model due to the advantages of accuracy consistency and parsimoniousness thus a regionalization approach to the hs parameters can be alternatively introduced by considering the local climate conditions and topographical characteristics to the best of our knowledge this study is the first attempt to obtain a set of parameters of the hs equation for estimating evapotranspiration by simultaneously considering evapotranspiration at multiple time scales the proposed model still shows limitations in reproducing the inherent characteristics of evapotranspiration during the summer season this may be due to different responses to temperature in estimating evapotranspiration in the hs equation this issue was not fully explored in the current study and time varying parameters on the basis of the seasonality of evapotranspiration will be investigated in future work more formally future work will focus on developing a regional surrogate model within a hierarchical bayesian modeling framework to better characterize the spatio temporal patterns of evapotranspiration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9216,the wastewater irrigation is carried out in order to make the nutrients present in the water available to the plants grown but it also possesses potential health hazards due to the accumulation of heavy metals to the soil and plant parts from the wastewater the present research work aimed to check the effect of wastewater and treated wastewater on soil and crop i e bottlegourd and palak spinach the research was conducted from 2014 to 2017 in the 12 c research farm of icar iari new delhi these crops were irrigated with untreated waste water and treated waste water crop and field irrigated with wastewater had shown a large amount of heavy metal deposition compared to treated wastewater in addition the influence of two irrigation systems including drip and flood was studied drip irrigation was found to be effective because there were less amounts of heavy metals deposited in the edible portion of the crop as well as in the soil keywords bottlegourd drip irrigation palak treated water wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is the most vital component for any living being though water is abundant yet most limited through inclined sources which has an assessable limitations and qualitative vulnerability according to khalid et al 2018 by 2025 approximately 60 of the world s population will eventually face water scarcity though the water sources are limited but still modern competitive demands for agricultural output have exponentially increased in urban areas farmers in semi urban and peri urban areas are mostly dependent and are using contaminated water for their agriculture needs this contaminated water can be stated to be a good source for nutrients but also as a carrier of hazardous metals and compounds these contaminants get concentrated in food crops like vegetables through soils which are irrigated from contaminated water sources and get further to urban food chain the heavy metals in the contaminated water are major cause of worry due to their non biodegradable and persistent nature their consumption could get accumulated in our vital organs such as kidneys bones and liver and can cause numerous serious health disorders in addition to this untreated water can also lead to underground water contamination and soil hardening when used as the main source of crop and soil irrigation li et al 2017 urbano and urbano et al 2015 2017 nowadays contamination present in waste water are repressed through application of biological agents pal and vimala 2012a bioremediation of waste water have been done for the treatment of waste water in respect to heavy metals and other chemical pollutants pal and vimala 2011 pal and vimala 2012b upma et al 2019 in addition to this the field and crops are tested with traditional and modern irrigation methods alongside with each other drip irrigation which is a modern irrigation practice has proven to be more water conserving than traditional methods such as flood irrigation and alongside this drip irrigated crop has also shown a significant reduction in the absorption of less pollutant than flood irrigated crops therefore it s pre eminent to undertake a comprehensive study to determine the effect of contaminated and treated wastewater on soil and selected crops quality which is the focus of the current study 2 material and methods 2 1

bioreactor waste water treatment system consists of a motor system to uplift the wastewater into a storage tank 2000 l the collected wastewater was connected to the small 1 hp motor to transfer the wastewater to the pilot plant 1000 l in this pilot plant the consortium was processed so that treatment of water with indigenous microorganisms was performed a compressor was installed with spargers connected to it spargers were installed inside pilot plant for the aeration and mixing initially the wastewater was treated for seven days and afterwards it became a continuous bioreactor it was connected to the settler through the pipes so that the solid waste mass which was coming with the treated water is settled and remaining clean water is stored in a treated water tank the stores treated water then used for the irrigation fig 2 2 3 treatments the 12 c field has been divided in to two main plots of untreated waste water irrigation and treated waste water irrigation with sub

used to apply the three way anova on the treatments 3 result and discussion 3 1 monthly variation of heavy metals in contaminated and treated wastewater on studying the monthly variation from 2014 to 2017 of contaminated and 2015 2017 of treated waste water the metals like chromium 0 10 0 15 mg l 1 was above the permissible limits in most of the months while other metals except nickel 0 21 mg l 1 were not above limits but high in concentrations in wastewater on the other hand in treated wastewater the concentration of all the studied metals was very low and chromium was below the detectable range in the treated water hence the treated wastewater is safe to use over untreated wastewater table 1 fao permissible limits of heavy metals in irrigation water zn 2 mg l 1 cu 0 2 mg l 1 ni 0 2 mg l 1 pb 5 mg l 1 and cr 0 1 mg l 1 3 2 physical properties of soil the percentage of silt clay sand bulk density hydraulic conductivity permanent wilting point and field capacity reveal that the experimental soil texture was sandy loam table 2 the wastewater irrigation applied for three consecutive years had no significant effect on a sandy loam soil in terms of the soil s physical properties it was found that the ph of the soil prior to sowing was normal 7 8 which is ideally suitable for agricultural soil soil extract ph in fields irrigated with waste water slightly decreased from 7 8 to 7 3 7 4 after harvesting in fields irrigated with waste water 3 3 effect of contaminated wastewater on soil the initial concentration of heavy metals should be discussed in detail for better interpretation prior to discussing the impact of contaminated wastewater on soil initially the average level of heavy metals in soil was quite low and far below the permitted limits the concentration was as follows cu ii in palak bottle gourd was 11 3 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field while in flood irrigated field it was 10 89 mg kg 1 cr vi in palak bottle gourd was 2 64 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field while in flood irrigated field it was 1 89 mg kg 1 ni ii in palak bottle gourd was 8 30 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field while in flood irrigated field it was 7 95 mg kg 1 pb ii in palak bottle gourd was 27 02 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field while in flood irrigated field it was 32 12 mg kg 1 zn ii in palak bottle gourd was 21 91 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field while in flood irrigated field it was 9 62 mg kg 1 the effect of the contaminated wastewater was estimated for the same the water was channelized into the field through two processes flood and drip method the amount of metal deposition in the soil at a different level when irrigated with wastewater is depicted in table 3 3 4 metal deposition in field irrigated through flood drip soil samples were taken at 0 15 15 30 and 30 45 cm depth and evaluated for the metal deposition cu cr ni pb and zn levels the study revealed that in untreated wastewater the irrigated field average concentration of cu ii in initial year 2014 2015 was 26 81 mg kg 1 and 13 30 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field of bottlegourd palak cr vi in palak bottle gourd was 22 18 mg kg 1 in flood and 26 83 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field pb ii was 101 29 mg kg 1 in flood and 69 25 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field zn ii was 40 52 mg kg 1 in flood and 36 69 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field ni ii was 40 12 mg kg 1 in flood and 31 71 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field table 3 in final year 2016 2017 cu ii was 36 703 mg kg 1 and 18 2 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field cr vi was 30 36 mg kg 1 and 36 72 mg kg 1 in drip and flood irrigated field pb ii was 94 78 mg kg 1 and 138 64 mg kg 1 in drip and flood irrigated field zn ii was 55 45 mg kg 1 and 50 22 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated fields ni ii was 54 91 mg kg 1 and 43 4 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field respectively table 3 the soil was sampled during the three growth stages of crops i e initial developmental and late the average of these was taken for the analysis in contrast the concentration of the studied heavy metal in the soil increased noticeably with the crop seasons the concentration of lead and nickel was found above the permissible limits in the soil in the final year at different depths of flood irrigated soil the potential cause of an increase in concentration may be due to metal contaminated wastewater contamination of the soil results from the accumulation of heavy metals heavy metals may leach into the ground where they eventually mix with the water and contaminate it 3 5 statistical analysis of untreated waste water irrigated soil through three way analysis of variance form anova test on soil sample from un treated water field we are able to find out that most of metals are significant in soil excepts ni cu pb while irrigations methods shows significant results table 4 hence above result shows are significant result for the conducted test 3 6 effect of treated wastewater on soil the effect of the treated wastewater was estimated for the same the water was channelized into the field through two processes flood and drip method the amount of metal deposition in the soil at a different level when irrigated with treated wastewater is depicted in table 5 3 6 1 metal deposition in field irrigated through flood drip in the initial year 2015 2016 average concentration of metals in palak bottle gourd field cu ii was 15 6 mg kg 1 and 9 21 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field respectively cr vi was 6 57 mg kg 1 and 2 025 mg kg 1 in drip and flood irrigated field respectively pb ii was 2 48 mg kg 1 and 2 02 mg kg 1 in drip and flood irrigated field respectively zn ii was 12 91 mg kg 1 and 11 44 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field respectively ni ii was 5 84 mg kg 1 and 5 293 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field respectively table 5 in final year 2016 2017 in palak bottle gourd field cu ii was 14 28 mg kg 1 and 14 82 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field respectively cr vi was 4 79 mg kg 1 and 3 42 mg kg 1 in drip and flood irrigated field respectively pb ii was 2 72 mg kg 1 and 2 60 mg kg 1 in drip and flood irrigated field respectively zn ii was 11 201 mg kg 1 and 9 42 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field respectively ni ii was 6 893 mg kg 1 and 7 832 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field respectively table 5 the concentration of heavy metals in soil was not significantly affected according to a comparison of the first and last years the concentration of heavy metals did slightly rise with the crop seasons but up until the last year the metal buildup in the soil was far below the permitted limits the amount of heavy metals in treated wastewater may have been reduced which would explain why there was less metal buildup in the soil numerous soil minerals incorporate in the soil for instance carbonates sulphides salts or oxides the concentration of the minerals in any soil is dependent on the soil naturally therefore it is not astounding those soils from a different country or different region with in the country exhibits a substantial range of metals concentration avci and deveci 2013 it can be concluded from tables 4 and 5 and that irrespective of the type of water drip irrigation seems to be an effective irrigation technique as less metal deposition had been deposited through drip irrigation as compared to the flood 3 6 2 statistical analysis of treated waste water irrigated soil through three way analysis of variance form anova test on soil sample from treated water field we are able to find out that most of metals are statistically significant in soil excepts zn cu pb while irrigations methods shows significant results table 6 hence above result shows are significant result for the conducted test as per the above stated results the untreated wastewater had deposited the maximum quantity of the metals in the soil in 2017 the zinc copper chromium nickel and lead levels were high in respect to the treated waste water irrigated soil the above stated results of the present study are in accord with the results presented by singh et al 2012 the authors had demonstrated that the field irrigated with the sewage water had more deposition of the heavy metals zn cu pb and cd as compared to the field irrigated with the ground and domestic water further as per tables and it can be demonstrated that the metal deposition was high in flood irrigation technique as compared to the drip irrigation the same trend is evident with the studies conducted by varallo et al 2012 urbano et al 2015 2017 in support to drip irrigation results as its fact that it is used as modern farming practice where the water is directly feed to plant roots through single or double nozzles attached to pipelines whereas the flood irrigation is one of the earliest forms of watering crops directly feeding the to upper soil the soil when irrigated with drip have been observed to have lower contamination in contrast to flood irrigated field because of lower discharge rates zhu et al 2010 3 7 evaluation of the effect of treated wastewater and wastewater on crop the crop growth stages and crop water requirement per plant has been calculated and mentioned in tables 7 9 respectively 3 7 1 untreated wastewater irrigated crops in the studied crops of untreated wastewater the initial year of study has shown that heavy metals i e ni ii and pb ii were above the permissible limits while cu ii and cr vi were below the permissible limits with this the concentration of metal accumulation by crops was higher in flood irrigation than the drip irrigation the results are given as follows palak ni ii 4 18 mg kg 1 and pb ii 13 75 mg kg 1 in drip irrigation ni ii 2 98 mg kg 1and pb ii 11 73 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation table 10 bottle gourd ni ii 10 71 mg kg 1 pb ii 6 49 mg kg 1 and zn ii 50 18 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation ni ii 4 80 mg kg 1 and pb ii 4 68 mg kg 1 in drip irrigation table 10 in the final year of study the accumulation has been increased and showed the following values palak ni ii 2 45 mg kg 1 and pb ii 9 10 mg kg 1 in drip cr vi 4 37 mg kg 1 ni ii 6 94 mg kg 1 and pb ii 15 45 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation table 10 bottle gourd ni ii 7 16 mg kg 1 pb ii 7 64 mg kg 1 and zn ii 79 78 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation ni ii 6 30 mg kg 1 and pb ii 10 82 mg kg 1 in drip irrigation table 10 here the accumulation has been increased by 20 33 in flood irrigated crops and 1 25 24 in drip irrigated with specific crops also the metal accumulation causes fast degradation of crops then the normal grown although the pattern of metal accumulation was not so specific in both flood and drip irrigations but the crops grown in untreated wastewater with drip irrigation had less metal accumulation than the flood irrigation the drip irrigation system with discharge control via single or dual nozzles have not only proven to control water but also efficient in limiting accumulation in of heavy metal in crops with effective percentage in contrast to traditional methods the less metal accumulation in the edible part of crop is directly related with the metal pollution as it was decreased or accumulated less then the hazardous effects of this will be less in humans or consumers with above observed result in crop it can also be taken an account how drip irrigation could be limiting as well as essential practice to keep pollutant check in final produce in contrast to flood irrigation patel and rajput 2007 3 7 2 statistical analysis of untreated wastewater irrigated crops through three way analysis of variance form anova test on sample of bottle gourd from un treated water field we are able to find that here is a statistically significant interaction between metals irrigation methods and year both irrigation methods shows a statistically significant results for year 2015 2016 and 2017 difference in the mean values among the different levels of metals evaluated within irrigation methods is greater than would be expected by chance and is a statistically significant difference for metals the difference in the mean values among the different levels of metals evaluated within irrigation methods is greater and is statistically significant expect for cu and zn in bottlegourd and cr and ni in palak tables 11 and 12 hence the conducted test are observed to be statistically significant in the case of untreated wastewater irrigated palak and bottle gourd there was a high level of correlation significance in metals studied and irrigation methods applied throughout the study period all the parameters are highly correlated significant p 0 001 with this the interaction between metals with irrigation method applied irrigation methods with studied year and metal with studied year were also significant at level of 95 p 0 050 3 7 3 treated waste water irrigated crops in treated water irrigated crops all the five metals were below the permissible limits also the degradation rate was less than the wastewater irrigated crops these metals had been estimated in the initial year palak cu ii 9 9 mg kg 1 cr vi 1 02 mg kg 1 ni ii 1 1 mg kg 1 pb ii 2 3 mg kg 1 and zn ii 18 3 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation cu ii 5 7 mg kg 1 cr vi 0 78 mg kg 1 ni ii 1 03 mg kg 1 pb ii 2 02 mg kg 1 and zn ii 12 8 mg kg 1 in drip irrigation table 13 bottle gourd cu ii 0 65 mg kg 1 cr vi 0 116 mg kg 1 ni ii 0 231 mg kg 1 pb ii 0 338 mg kg 1 and zn ii 17 6 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation cu ii 0 65 mg kg 1 cr vi 0 116 mg kg 1 ni ii 0 231 mg kg 1 pb ii 0 338 mg kg 1 and zn ii 17 6 mg kg 1 in drip irrigation table 13 in last year the accumulation has been increase but below the permissible limits as follows palak cu ii 10 38 mg kg 1 cr vi 1 03 mg kg 1 ni ii 1 39 mg kg 1 pb ii 2 35 mg kg 1 and zn ii 18 89 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation cu ii 5 mg kg 1 cr vi 0 78 mg kg 1 ni ii 1 06 mg kg 1 pb ii 2 06 mg kg 1 and zn ii 13 36 mg kg 1 in drip irrigation table 13 bottle gourd cu ii 1 98 mg kg 1 cr vi 0 53 mg kg 1 ni ii 0 56 mg kg 1 pb ii 1 89 mg kg 1 and zn ii 2 54 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation cu ii 0 62 mg kg 1 cr vi 0 116 mg kg 1 ni ii 0 25 mg kg 1 pb ii 0 377 mg kg 1 and zn ii 18 65 mg kg 1 in drip irrigation table 13 palak and bottle gourd crops were evaluated for the metal deposition when the field was irrigated through treated and wastewater significantly a metal deposition was more in case of wastewater irrigation the heavy metal deposition was estimated in the edible portion of the crop as per the table 10 the heavy metal deposition was high in both the crop when irrigated with the wastewater furthermore the heavy metal deposition was less in the crops watered with treated wastewater table 13 moreover the zinc lead nickel and chromium levels were higher than their permissible levels in palak treated with wastewater highlighted in table 10 the nickel lead and zinc levels were more than the permissible limits in bottlegourd when watered with wastewater table 10 similar results have been documented from the research conducted by sharma et al 2007 the author had concluded that wastewater used for the irrigation lead to contamination of heavy metals lead and nickel in the edible part of the vegetables further abaidoo et al 2010 and zhuang et al 2009 had concluded from their study that the edible part of the crop which is irrigated with the wastewater have more metal and can lead to deleterious effects on the health of the consumer jan and tiwari et al 2010 2011 3 7 4 statistical analysis of treated waste water irrigated crops through three way analysis of variance form anova test on bottleground field sample from treatyed water field we are able to find the main effects for year cannot be properly interpreted since the size of the factor s effect depends upon the level of another factor the effect of different levels of metals depends on what level of irrigation methods is present and there is a statistically significant interaction between metals and irrigation methods the effect of different levels of metals varies with year and there is a statistically significant interaction between metals and year tables 14 and 15 hence above result shows an significant result for the conducted test in the case of treated wastewater irrigated palak and bottle gourd there was a high level of correlation significance in metal studied irrigation methods applied and studied years other interaction i e metals with irrigation method applied were also significant correlation at level of 95 p 0 050 one interaction i e irrigation methods with studied year was non significant p 0 440 in potato palak and okra while in bottle gourd p 0 825 the nature of non significance may be due to the variations in amount of heavy metals in crop s edible part might be negligible or very less for statistical point of view it could be one of the major reasons that different irrigation methods with studied year does not exhibit any significant correlation during statistical analysis because margin of difference might be beyond the limit of statistics three way anova on different crops with treated wastewater and untreated wastewater was pointed out that the different studied crops were significantly correlated with applied irrigation methods metal concentration and studied time period in overall study of crops with untreated wastewater and treated wastewater the metal accumulation in treated water drip and flood crop was highly reduced and it refer that the treated wastewater with drip and flood was good for the farmers and consumers with this the accumulation of metal in drip was less than the flood irrigated crops 3 8 assessment of crop yield at iari 12 c field irrigated flood and drip with untreated waste water and treated wastewater the use of untreated wastewater has favourably influenced the crop production due to the continuous enrichment of topsoil the yield of palak and bottlegourd was more in drip irrigated wastewater and treated wastewater than the flood irrigated in year 2014 2015 palak was 474 q ht 1 and 440 q ht 1 in drip and flood irrigated untreated waste water and bottlegourd was 370 q ht 1 and 367 q ht 1 in drip and flood irrigated untreated waste water in year 2015 2016 palak in untreated waste water 482 q ht 1 and 449 q ht 1 in drip and flood while bottlegourd 385 q ht 1 and 370 q ht 1 in treated waste water palak in drip and flood was 458 q ht 1 and 444 q ht 1 bottlegourd 365 q ht 1 and 361 q ht 1 respectively in years 2016 2017 palak 490 q ht 1 and 450 q ht 1 in drip and flood of untreated waste water while in treated waste water 459 q ht 1 and 449 q ht 1 in drip and flood bottlegourd was 390 q ht 1 and 374 q ht 1 in drip and flood untreated wastewater and 375 q ht 1 and 369 q ht 1 in drip and flood of treated wastewater figs 7 and 8 continuous wastewater irrigation with drip results in precise irrigation and helps to increase crop production also treated wastewater irrigation with drip helped to increase yield while preventing the buildup of heavy metals in the soil as water was treated and metal loads were reduced or mitigated similar studies done by singh et al 2012 on palak spinach in sewage water and well water the yield of palak was 9 36 and 9 11 q ht 1 the yield was more in sewage water then ground water 4 conclusion wastewater treatment and water pollution is a critical problem that directly and indirectly affects human health and poses a risk of environmental degradation urbanisation is also contributing to a potential possibility of shortages due to the exploitation of natural water supplies farm services in the vicinity of urban areas depend directly or indirectly on shared water resources which are mostly polluted and contaminated and sometimes directly on waste water due to lack of effective treatment for day to day agricultural activities such as irrigation as a result the use of wastewater for irrigation is indirectly promoted the above study concludes that wastewater as an irrigation medium for any crop has various drawbacks and that wastewater carries various toxic metals such as copper nickel mercury lead chromium and zinc it also acts as a support medium for various parasites such as bacteria viruses and worms which may pose serious risks to the environment and human health in addition to the above conclusion traditional and modern irrigation methods such as flood and drip irrigation have been tested with treated and untreated water in flood irrigated crops metal accumulation is above 25 while in drip it was between 1 25 to 20 in untreated waste water it can also be concluded that unlike traditional flood irrigation drip irrigated crops and soil have less heavy metal deposition the yield is also significantly good for drip irrigated crops furthermore wastewater has more heavy metal deposition in both edible parts of the crop and soil compared to treated wastewater and drip

9216,the wastewater irrigation is carried out in order to make the nutrients present in the water available to the plants grown but it also possesses potential health hazards due to the accumulation of heavy metals to the soil and plant parts from the wastewater the present research work aimed to check the effect of wastewater and treated wastewater on soil and crop i e bottlegourd and palak spinach the research was conducted from 2014 to 2017 in the 12 c research farm of icar iari new delhi these crops were irrigated with untreated waste water and treated waste water crop and field irrigated with wastewater had shown a large amount of heavy metal deposition compared to treated wastewater in addition the influence of two irrigation systems including drip and flood was studied drip irrigation was found to be effective because there were less amounts of heavy metals deposited in the edible portion of the crop as well as in the soil keywords bottlegourd drip irrigation palak treated water wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is the most vital component for any living being though water is abundant yet most limited through inclined sources which has an assessable limitations and qualitative vulnerability according to khalid et al 2018 by 2025 approximately 60 of the world s population will eventually face water scarcity though the water sources are limited but still modern competitive demands for agricultural output have exponentially increased in urban areas farmers in semi urban and peri urban areas are mostly dependent and are using contaminated water for their agriculture needs this contaminated water can be stated to be a good source for nutrients but also as a carrier of hazardous metals and compounds these contaminants get concentrated in food crops like vegetables through soils which are irrigated from contaminated water sources and get further to urban food chain the heavy metals in the contaminated water are major cause of worry due to their non biodegradable and persistent nature their consumption could get accumulated in our vital organs such as kidneys bones and liver and can cause numerous serious health disorders in addition to this untreated water can also lead to underground water contamination and soil hardening when used as the main source of crop and soil irrigation li et al 2017 urbano and urbano et al 2015 2017 nowadays contamination present in waste water are repressed through application of biological agents pal and vimala 2012a bioremediation of waste water have been done for the treatment of waste water in respect to heavy metals and other chemical pollutants pal and vimala 2011 pal and vimala 2012b upma et al 2019 in addition to this the field and crops are tested with traditional and modern irrigation methods alongside with each other drip irrigation which is a modern irrigation practice has proven to be more water conserving than traditional methods such as flood irrigation and alongside this drip irrigated crop has also shown a significant reduction in the absorption of less pollutant than flood irrigated crops therefore it s pre eminent to undertake a comprehensive study to determine the effect of contaminated and treated wastewater on soil and selected crops quality which is the focus of the current study 2 material and methods 2 1 site selection installation of micro irrigation and flood irrigation system the site 12 c is situated at indian agricultural research institute new delhi its gps location is 28 38 30 336 n 077 8 59 154 e the site is chosen due to easy availability of waste water i e lohamandi drain throughout the year which ultimately falls in yamuna river fig 1 two different pvc pipe systems i e untreated waste water and treated waste water microbial treated has been installed a power supply and control panel with two 3 hp motors and a 2 hp motor with pump is also installed and connected with 3 inch pipe inlet and 2 inch pipe outlet the headworks and pump house were also constructed at the 12 c site fig 3 and 4 the experimental work was conducted from year 2014 to 2017 2 2 installation of bioreactor bioreactor waste water treatment system consists of a motor system to uplift the wastewater into a storage tank 2000 l the collected wastewater was connected to the small 1 hp motor to transfer the wastewater to the pilot plant 1000 l in this pilot plant the consortium was processed so that treatment of water with indigenous microorganisms was performed a compressor was installed with spargers connected to it spargers were installed inside pilot plant for the aeration and mixing initially the wastewater was treated for seven days and afterwards it became a continuous bioreactor it was connected to the settler through the pipes so that the solid waste mass which was coming with the treated water is settled and remaining clean water is stored in a treated water tank the stores treated water then used for the irrigation fig 2 2 3 treatments the 12 c field has been divided in to two main plots of untreated waste water irrigation and treated waste water irrigation with sub plots of drip irrigated and flood irrigated vegetables i e palak spinach var pusa bharti in winter and bottlegourd var pusa naveen in summer season all the treatments are in triplicates with split plot design each plot is of 24 square meters of size figs 5 and 6 2 4 field layout 2 4 1 geometry of vegetables crop spacing for palak was 60 cm between rows and 30 cm between plants while in bottlegourd the distances between the rows and the plants were 120 cm and 60 cm respectively dripper to dripper spacing and lateral to lateral spacing were respectively 30 cm and 120 cm in palak in bottlegourd the lateral to lateral distance was 120 cm and the dripper to dripper distance was 40 cm the dripper discharge rate in both the bottlegourd and the palak was 1 07 lph 2 4 2 analysis of water soil and vegetables of 12 c 2 4 2 1 water water samples 100 ml used for irrigation were collected monthly in triplicate in a pre acid washed polypropylene bottle and 1 ml of concentrated hno3 was added in the water sample to avoid the microbial activity brhane and pal et al 2014 2015 these samples were brought back to the laboratory and kept in a refrigerator before digestion water samples 100 ml were digested after adding 15 ml of di acid mixture hno3 and hclo4 in ratio 9 4 at 80 c until a transparent solution was obtained apha wef 2005 after cooling the digested sample was filtered using whatman no 42 filter paper and the filtrate was finally maintained to 100 ml with double distil water and analysed with ecil4141 aas table 1 2 4 2 2 soil soil samples were collected from different layers from surface till the soil depth of 100 cm using soil auger to characterize the soil these samples were collected in triplicates and analysed in laboratory for determining the physical properties of soil such as particle size distribution soil texture bulk density field capacity permanent wilting point hydraulic conductivity table 2 for the heavy metals soil samples were collected in triplicate at different depths 0 15 cm 15 30 cm and 30 45 cm the soil was sampled during the three growth stages of crops i e initial developmental and late soil samples were air dried crushed and passed through 2 mm mesh size sieve and stored at ambient temperature before analysis singh et al 2010 soil 1 g was digested after adding 15 ml of tri acid mixture hno3 h2so4 and hclo4 in 5 1 1 ratio at 80 c until a transparent solution was obtained after cooling the digested sample was filtered using whatman no 42 filter paper and the filtrate was finally maintained to 25 ml with distilled water the analysis for heavy metals was conducted using aas4141 ecil atomic absorption spectrophotometer pal et al 2015 2 4 2 3 vegetables those were collected and packed into sterile polythene bags in triplicate the samples were taken from the field during the final stages of fruit development and harvest in the laboratory samples were first cut in to pieces thoroughly washed with tap water following double distil water the edible part were then dried in an oven at 60 c until constant weight obtained and grinded for further analysis plant samples 1 g were digested after adding 15 ml of tri acid mixture hno3 h2so4 and hclo4 in ratio 5 1 1 ratio at 80 c until a transparent solution was obtained after cooling the digested sample was filtered using whatman no 42 filter paper and the filterate was finally maintained to 25 ml with double distil water triplicate digestion of each sample was carried out together the analysis was conducted using aas4141 ecil atomic absorption spectrophotometer islam et al 2014 2 4 3 quality control analysis blank and drift standards sisco research laboratories pvt ltd india were run after five determination to calibrate the instrument the coefficients of variation of replicate analysis were determined for different determinations for the precision of analysis and variations below 10 were considered correct 2 4 4 statistical analysis all the studies were conducted in triplicates and the results are presented as means of the replicates along with standard deviation and correlations a highly advanced software sigmaplot 12 has been used to apply the three way anova on the treatments 3 result and discussion 3 1 monthly variation of heavy metals in contaminated and treated wastewater on studying the monthly variation from 2014 to 2017 of contaminated and 2015 2017 of treated waste water the metals like chromium 0 10 0 15 mg l 1 was above the permissible limits in most of the months while other metals except nickel 0 21 mg l 1 were not above limits but high in concentrations in wastewater on the other hand in treated wastewater the concentration of all the studied metals was very low and chromium was below the detectable range in the treated water hence the treated wastewater is safe to use over untreated wastewater table 1 fao permissible limits of heavy metals in irrigation water zn 2 mg l 1 cu 0 2 mg l 1 ni 0 2 mg l 1 pb 5 mg l 1 and cr 0 1 mg l 1 3 2 physical properties of soil the percentage of silt clay sand bulk density hydraulic conductivity permanent wilting point and field capacity reveal that the experimental soil texture was sandy loam table 2 the wastewater irrigation applied for three consecutive years had no significant effect on a sandy loam soil in terms of the soil s physical properties it was found that the ph of the soil prior to sowing was normal 7 8 which is ideally suitable for agricultural soil soil extract ph in fields irrigated with waste water slightly decreased from 7 8 to 7 3 7 4 after harvesting in fields irrigated with waste water 3 3 effect of contaminated wastewater on soil the initial concentration of heavy metals should be discussed in detail for better interpretation prior to discussing the impact of contaminated wastewater on soil initially the average level of heavy metals in soil was quite low and far below the permitted limits the concentration was as follows cu ii in palak bottle gourd was 11 3 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field while in flood irrigated field it was 10 89 mg kg 1 cr vi in palak bottle gourd was 2 64 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field while in flood irrigated field it was 1 89 mg kg 1 ni ii in palak bottle gourd was 8 30 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field while in flood irrigated field it was 7 95 mg kg 1 pb ii in palak bottle gourd was 27 02 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field while in flood irrigated field it was 32 12 mg kg 1 zn ii in palak bottle gourd was 21 91 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field while in flood irrigated field it was 9 62 mg kg 1 the effect of the contaminated wastewater was estimated for the same the water was channelized into the field through two processes flood and drip method the amount of metal deposition in the soil at a different level when irrigated with wastewater is depicted in table 3 3 4 metal deposition in field irrigated through flood drip soil samples were taken at 0 15 15 30 and 30 45 cm depth and evaluated for the metal deposition cu cr ni pb and zn levels the study revealed that in untreated wastewater the irrigated field average concentration of cu ii in initial year 2014 2015 was 26 81 mg kg 1 and 13 30 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field of bottlegourd palak cr vi in palak bottle gourd was 22 18 mg kg 1 in flood and 26 83 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field pb ii was 101 29 mg kg 1 in flood and 69 25 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field zn ii was 40 52 mg kg 1 in flood and 36 69 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field ni ii was 40 12 mg kg 1 in flood and 31 71 mg kg 1 in drip irrigated field table 3 in final year 2016 2017 cu ii was 36 703 mg kg 1 and 18 2 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field cr vi was 30 36 mg kg 1 and 36 72 mg kg 1 in drip and flood irrigated field pb ii was 94 78 mg kg 1 and 138 64 mg kg 1 in drip and flood irrigated field zn ii was 55 45 mg kg 1 and 50 22 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated fields ni ii was 54 91 mg kg 1 and 43 4 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field respectively table 3 the soil was sampled during the three growth stages of crops i e initial developmental and late the average of these was taken for the analysis in contrast the concentration of the studied heavy metal in the soil increased noticeably with the crop seasons the concentration of lead and nickel was found above the permissible limits in the soil in the final year at different depths of flood irrigated soil the potential cause of an increase in concentration may be due to metal contaminated wastewater contamination of the soil results from the accumulation of heavy metals heavy metals may leach into the ground where they eventually mix with the water and contaminate it 3 5 statistical analysis of untreated waste water irrigated soil through three way analysis of variance form anova test on soil sample from un treated water field we are able to find out that most of metals are significant in soil excepts ni cu pb while irrigations methods shows significant results table 4 hence above result shows are significant result for the conducted test 3 6 effect of treated wastewater on soil the effect of the treated wastewater was estimated for the same the water was channelized into the field through two processes flood and drip method the amount of metal deposition in the soil at a different level when irrigated with treated wastewater is depicted in table 5 3 6 1 metal deposition in field irrigated through flood drip in the initial year 2015 2016 average concentration of metals in palak bottle gourd field cu ii was 15 6 mg kg 1 and 9 21 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field respectively cr vi was 6 57 mg kg 1 and 2 025 mg kg 1 in drip and flood irrigated field respectively pb ii was 2 48 mg kg 1 and 2 02 mg kg 1 in drip and flood irrigated field respectively zn ii was 12 91 mg kg 1 and 11 44 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field respectively ni ii was 5 84 mg kg 1 and 5 293 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field respectively table 5 in final year 2016 2017 in palak bottle gourd field cu ii was 14 28 mg kg 1 and 14 82 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field respectively cr vi was 4 79 mg kg 1 and 3 42 mg kg 1 in drip and flood irrigated field respectively pb ii was 2 72 mg kg 1 and 2 60 mg kg 1 in drip and flood irrigated field respectively zn ii was 11 201 mg kg 1 and 9 42 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field respectively ni ii was 6 893 mg kg 1 and 7 832 mg kg 1 in flood and drip irrigated field respectively table 5 the concentration of heavy metals in soil was not significantly affected according to a comparison of the first and last years the concentration of heavy metals did slightly rise with the crop seasons but up until the last year the metal buildup in the soil was far below the permitted limits the amount of heavy metals in treated wastewater may have been reduced which would explain why there was less metal buildup in the soil numerous soil minerals incorporate in the soil for instance carbonates sulphides salts or oxides the concentration of the minerals in any soil is dependent on the soil naturally therefore it is not astounding those soils from a different country or different region with in the country exhibits a substantial range of metals concentration avci and deveci 2013 it can be concluded from tables 4 and 5 and that irrespective of the type of water drip irrigation seems to be an effective irrigation technique as less metal deposition had been deposited through drip irrigation as compared to the flood 3 6 2 statistical analysis of treated waste water irrigated soil through three way analysis of variance form anova test on soil sample from treated water field we are able to find out that most of metals are statistically significant in soil excepts zn cu pb while irrigations methods shows significant results table 6 hence above result shows are significant result for the conducted test as per the above stated results the untreated wastewater had deposited the maximum quantity of the metals in the soil in 2017 the zinc copper chromium nickel and lead levels were high in respect to the treated waste water irrigated soil the above stated results of the present study are in accord with the results presented by singh et al 2012 the authors had demonstrated that the field irrigated with the sewage water had more deposition of the heavy metals zn cu pb and cd as compared to the field irrigated with the ground and domestic water further as per tables and it can be demonstrated that the metal deposition was high in flood irrigation technique as compared to the drip irrigation the same trend is evident with the studies conducted by varallo et al 2012 urbano et al 2015 2017 in support to drip irrigation results as its fact that it is used as modern farming practice where the water is directly feed to plant roots through single or double nozzles attached to pipelines whereas the flood irrigation is one of the earliest forms of watering crops directly feeding the to upper soil the soil when irrigated with drip have been observed to have lower contamination in contrast to flood irrigated field because of lower discharge rates zhu et al 2010 3 7 evaluation of the effect of treated wastewater and wastewater on crop the crop growth stages and crop water requirement per plant has been calculated and mentioned in tables 7 9 respectively 3 7 1 untreated wastewater irrigated crops in the studied crops of untreated wastewater the initial year of study has shown that heavy metals i e ni ii and pb ii were above the permissible limits while cu ii and cr vi were below the permissible limits with this the concentration of metal accumulation by crops was higher in flood irrigation than the drip irrigation the results are given as follows palak ni ii 4 18 mg kg 1 and pb ii 13 75 mg kg 1 in drip irrigation ni ii 2 98 mg kg 1and pb ii 11 73 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation table 10 bottle gourd ni ii 10 71 mg kg 1 pb ii 6 49 mg kg 1 and zn ii 50 18 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation ni ii 4 80 mg kg 1 and pb ii 4 68 mg kg 1 in drip irrigation table 10 in the final year of study the accumulation has been increased and showed the following values palak ni ii 2 45 mg kg 1 and pb ii 9 10 mg kg 1 in drip cr vi 4 37 mg kg 1 ni ii 6 94 mg kg 1 and pb ii 15 45 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation table 10 bottle gourd ni ii 7 16 mg kg 1 pb ii 7 64 mg kg 1 and zn ii 79 78 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation ni ii 6 30 mg kg 1 and pb ii 10 82 mg kg 1 in drip irrigation table 10 here the accumulation has been increased by 20 33 in flood irrigated crops and 1 25 24 in drip irrigated with specific crops also the metal accumulation causes fast degradation of crops then the normal grown although the pattern of metal accumulation was not so specific in both flood and drip irrigations but the crops grown in untreated wastewater with drip irrigation had less metal accumulation than the flood irrigation the drip irrigation system with discharge control via single or dual nozzles have not only proven to control water but also efficient in limiting accumulation in of heavy metal in crops with effective percentage in contrast to traditional methods the less metal accumulation in the edible part of crop is directly related with the metal pollution as it was decreased or accumulated less then the hazardous effects of this will be less in humans or consumers with above observed result in crop it can also be taken an account how drip irrigation could be limiting as well as essential practice to keep pollutant check in final produce in contrast to flood irrigation patel and rajput 2007 3 7 2 statistical analysis of untreated wastewater irrigated crops through three way analysis of variance form anova test on sample of bottle gourd from un treated water field we are able to find that here is a statistically significant interaction between metals irrigation methods and year both irrigation methods shows a statistically significant results for year 2015 2016 and 2017 difference in the mean values among the different levels of metals evaluated within irrigation methods is greater than would be expected by chance and is a statistically significant difference for metals the difference in the mean values among the different levels of metals evaluated within irrigation methods is greater and is statistically significant expect for cu and zn in bottlegourd and cr and ni in palak tables 11 and 12 hence the conducted test are observed to be statistically significant in the case of untreated wastewater irrigated palak and bottle gourd there was a high level of correlation significance in metals studied and irrigation methods applied throughout the study period all the parameters are highly correlated significant p 0 001 with this the interaction between metals with irrigation method applied irrigation methods with studied year and metal with studied year were also significant at level of 95 p 0 050 3 7 3 treated waste water irrigated crops in treated water irrigated crops all the five metals were below the permissible limits also the degradation rate was less than the wastewater irrigated crops these metals had been estimated in the initial year palak cu ii 9 9 mg kg 1 cr vi 1 02 mg kg 1 ni ii 1 1 mg kg 1 pb ii 2 3 mg kg 1 and zn ii 18 3 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation cu ii 5 7 mg kg 1 cr vi 0 78 mg kg 1 ni ii 1 03 mg kg 1 pb ii 2 02 mg kg 1 and zn ii 12 8 mg kg 1 in drip irrigation table 13 bottle gourd cu ii 0 65 mg kg 1 cr vi 0 116 mg kg 1 ni ii 0 231 mg kg 1 pb ii 0 338 mg kg 1 and zn ii 17 6 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation cu ii 0 65 mg kg 1 cr vi 0 116 mg kg 1 ni ii 0 231 mg kg 1 pb ii 0 338 mg kg 1 and zn ii 17 6 mg kg 1 in drip irrigation table 13 in last year the accumulation has been increase but below the permissible limits as follows palak cu ii 10 38 mg kg 1 cr vi 1 03 mg kg 1 ni ii 1 39 mg kg 1 pb ii 2 35 mg kg 1 and zn ii 18 89 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation cu ii 5 mg kg 1 cr vi 0 78 mg kg 1 ni ii 1 06 mg kg 1 pb ii 2 06 mg kg 1 and zn ii 13 36 mg kg 1 in drip irrigation table 13 bottle gourd cu ii 1 98 mg kg 1 cr vi 0 53 mg kg 1 ni ii 0 56 mg kg 1 pb ii 1 89 mg kg 1 and zn ii 2 54 mg kg 1 in flood irrigation cu ii 0 62 mg kg 1 cr vi 0 116 mg kg 1 ni ii 0 25 mg kg 1 pb ii 0 377 mg kg 1 and zn ii 18 65 mg kg 1 in drip irrigation table 13 palak and bottle gourd crops were evaluated for the metal deposition when the field was irrigated through treated and wastewater significantly a metal deposition was more in case of wastewater irrigation the heavy metal deposition was estimated in the edible portion of the crop as per the table 10 the heavy metal deposition was high in both the crop when irrigated with the wastewater furthermore the heavy metal deposition was less in the crops watered with treated wastewater table 13 moreover the zinc lead nickel and chromium levels were higher than their permissible levels in palak treated with wastewater highlighted in table 10 the nickel lead and zinc levels were more than the permissible limits in bottlegourd when watered with wastewater table 10 similar results have been documented from the research conducted by sharma et al 2007 the author had concluded that wastewater used for the irrigation lead to contamination of heavy metals lead and nickel in the edible part of the vegetables further abaidoo et al 2010 and zhuang et al 2009 had concluded from their study that the edible part of the crop which is irrigated with the wastewater have more metal and can lead to deleterious effects on the health of the consumer jan and tiwari et al 2010 2011 3 7 4 statistical analysis of treated waste water irrigated crops through three way analysis of variance form anova test on bottleground field sample from treatyed water field we are able to find the main effects for year cannot be properly interpreted since the size of the factor s effect depends upon the level of another factor the effect of different levels of metals depends on what level of irrigation methods is present and there is a statistically significant interaction between metals and irrigation methods the effect of different levels of metals varies with year and there is a statistically significant interaction between metals and year tables 14 and 15 hence above result shows an significant result for the conducted test in the case of treated wastewater irrigated palak and bottle gourd there was a high level of correlation significance in metal studied irrigation methods applied and studied years other interaction i e metals with irrigation method applied were also significant correlation at level of 95 p 0 050 one interaction i e irrigation methods with studied year was non significant p 0 440 in potato palak and okra while in bottle gourd p 0 825 the nature of non significance may be due to the variations in amount of heavy metals in crop s edible part might be negligible or very less for statistical point of view it could be one of the major reasons that different irrigation methods with studied year does not exhibit any significant correlation during statistical analysis because margin of difference might be beyond the limit of statistics three way anova on different crops with treated wastewater and untreated wastewater was pointed out that the different studied crops were significantly correlated with applied irrigation methods metal concentration and studied time period in overall study of crops with untreated wastewater and treated wastewater the metal accumulation in treated water drip and flood crop was highly reduced and it refer that the treated wastewater with drip and flood was good for the farmers and consumers with this the accumulation of metal in drip was less than the flood irrigated crops 3 8 assessment of crop yield at iari 12 c field irrigated flood and drip with untreated waste water and treated wastewater the use of untreated wastewater has favourably influenced the crop production due to the continuous enrichment of topsoil the yield of palak and bottlegourd was more in drip irrigated wastewater and treated wastewater than the flood irrigated in year 2014 2015 palak was 474 q ht 1 and 440 q ht 1 in drip and flood irrigated untreated waste water and bottlegourd was 370 q ht 1 and 367 q ht 1 in drip and flood irrigated untreated waste water in year 2015 2016 palak in untreated waste water 482 q ht 1 and 449 q ht 1 in drip and flood while bottlegourd 385 q ht 1 and 370 q ht 1 in treated waste water palak in drip and flood was 458 q ht 1 and 444 q ht 1 bottlegourd 365 q ht 1 and 361 q ht 1 respectively in years 2016 2017 palak 490 q ht 1 and 450 q ht 1 in drip and flood of untreated waste water while in treated waste water 459 q ht 1 and 449 q ht 1 in drip and flood bottlegourd was 390 q ht 1 and 374 q ht 1 in drip and flood untreated wastewater and 375 q ht 1 and 369 q ht 1 in drip and flood of treated wastewater figs 7 and 8 continuous wastewater irrigation with drip results in precise irrigation and helps to increase crop production also treated wastewater irrigation with drip helped to increase yield while preventing the buildup of heavy metals in the soil as water was treated and metal loads were reduced or mitigated similar studies done by singh et al 2012 on palak spinach in sewage water and well water the yield of palak was 9 36 and 9 11 q ht 1 the yield was more in sewage water then ground water 4 conclusion wastewater treatment and water pollution is a critical problem that directly and indirectly affects human health and poses a risk of environmental degradation urbanisation is also contributing to a potential possibility of shortages due to the exploitation of natural water supplies farm services in the vicinity of urban areas depend directly or indirectly on shared water resources which are mostly polluted and contaminated and sometimes directly on waste water due to lack of effective treatment for day to day agricultural activities such as irrigation as a result the use of wastewater for irrigation is indirectly promoted the above study concludes that wastewater as an irrigation medium for any crop has various drawbacks and that wastewater carries various toxic metals such as copper nickel mercury lead chromium and zinc it also acts as a support medium for various parasites such as bacteria viruses and worms which may pose serious risks to the environment and human health in addition to the above conclusion traditional and modern irrigation methods such as flood and drip irrigation have been tested with treated and untreated water in flood irrigated crops metal accumulation is above 25 while in drip it was between 1 25 to 20 in untreated waste water it can also be concluded that unlike traditional flood irrigation drip irrigated crops and soil have less heavy metal deposition the yield is also significantly good for drip irrigated crops furthermore wastewater has more heavy metal deposition in both edible parts of the crop and soil compared to treated wastewater and drip

9217,with the challenges of arid transboundary river water management among central asian countries it is important to evaluate the water stress and propose practicable climate adaptation strategies this study used the syr darya basin sdb in a central asia data scarce region as the study area and conducted the first quantified analysis of the spatiotemporal characteristics of water supply and requirements at the basin and irrigation district scale identified its driving mechanisms based on systematic monitoring data concerning reservoir regulation and complex crop structure from 2000 to 2018 and a climate change scenario combined with a crop restructuring scenario was applied to evaluate water conservation effects and propose a climate adaptation strategy from 2019 to 2030 the results showed that runoff increased by 7 45 billion m3 but the water withdrawal decreased by 3 42 billion m3 after reservoir regulation in the basin during 2000 2018 due to the unified water allocation it was challenging to conduct and usually exceeded the plan by 0 4 8 5 the total crop water requirement tcwr mainly derived from cotton 61 5 winter wheat 12 1 and rice 13 9 increased by 3 15 billion m3 30 7 and the influence of crop area 380 million m3 a was greater than that of climate 130 million m3 a the wind speed 27 5 and rice area 19 2 also significantly contributed to the tcwr variation the contradiction between water supply and requirement resulted in water scarcity in the basin from 2019 2030 the water conservation effect of winter wheat 20 under the restructuring scenarios reached 28 7 mm which helped relieve water stress under the scenario of a 0 51 0 91 c increase thus priority planting of a winter wheat rotation and low water consuming crops is a

asia are highly uneven with abundant water resources upstream available mainly for hydropower generation intensive farming in the midstream area relies on water diversion resulting in a sharp decrease in water release downstream where environmental degradation is prominent reyer et al 2017 gojenko et al 2013 reservoirs play a key role in transboundary river water management but water scarcity is exacerbated by the differences in water supply and requirement patterns among central asian countries due to the politics of transboundary river management there is a low level of sharing of basic meteorological hydrological and agricultural monitoring data ruan and yu 2019 constrained by this data scarcity global scale models and remote sensing products have become alternative methods for understanding the characteristics of the aral sea basin huang et al 2021 hu et al 2021 chen et al 2020 entekhabi et al 1999 however the low spatial resolution and lack of precision validation are limitations for the application of these products in local studies kulmatov et al 2021 ruan et al 2020 furthermore existing water supply studies in central asia have focused on runoff in mountainous regions sanim 2020 zou et al 2019 radchenko et al 2014 chen et al 2011 and the water supply conditions in midstream and downstream regions are still unclear because of reservoir regulation the agricultural water requirement has not yet been accurately quantified in irrigation districts because of data scarcity it is crucial to analyse the characteristics of water supply and requirements in central asia based on detailed monitoring data more than 90 of the water resources in the aral sea basin are used for irrigation and many studies have estimated the crop water requirement cwr through model simulations and remote sensing inversion to analyse water requirements tian and zhang 2020 wu et al 2019 however these studies examined only typical years 2002 and 2007 core irrigation districts kyzylorda fergana or national scales and major crop types cotton and winter wheat khaydar et al 2021 conrad et al 2013 abdullaev and molden 2004 which makes it difficult to accurately reflect the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the water requirement remote sensing inversion based on evapotranspiration is a highly efficient and large scale approach to quantify water requirements abrishamkar and ahmadi 2017 however it is difficult to analyse the driving mechanisms in complex crop structures because of the lack of high resolution crop distribution data moreover the existing studies on cwr drivers focus on the climate but there is a scarcity of analyses on the sensitivity and contribution of crop area lobanova et al 2021 zou et al 2019 bandyopadhyay et al 2009 the cropwat model based on the penman monteith formula integrates cwr calculation and analysis ehsani et al 2012 allen et al 1998 and it is suitable for use in transboundary river water management in central asia because of its low data requirement there is a general trend of increased water requirements under the influence of climate warming and cropland expansion in the future li et al 2020 woodward et al 2014 lovelli et al 2010 the optimization of crop structure can achieve a water conservation effect on the cwr based on the combination of coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 data and the cropwat model to predict future cwr changes a crop restructuring scenario is proposed that increases the proportion of low water consuming crops to decrease the water requirement kobuliev et al 2021 xue et al 2021 gao et al 2019 luo et al 2018 as water management in transboundary rivers is difficult because of the complex political situation this is a practicable approach for coping with water scarcity in changing future environments however relevant future scenario assessments are scarce this study used the syr darya basin sdb the second largest river in the aral sea basin of central asia as the study area to evaluate the water supply and requirements in the irrigation district based on detailed meteorological hydrological and crop area monitoring data from 2000 to 2018 the variation in water supply and its influencing factors were analysed the cropwat model was applied to calculate the total crop water requirement tcwr and analyse its driving mechanism by quantifying the sensitivity and contribution to climate and crop area factors the future cwr was predicted based on cmip6 temperature scenarios during 2019 2030 and the crop structure optimization

central asia 2 data and methods 2 1 study region central asia is an arid and semiarid region in the hinterland of asia and europe located at 35 08 55 25 n 46 28 87 29 e fig 1 the sdb covers an area of approximately 400 000 km2 and spans 3019 km from east to the west wegerich et al 2015 and its irrigation area is approximately 24 000 km2 water resources are shared among four central asian countries with an annual runoff of approximately 37 2 billion m3 of which 27 6 billion m3 are transboundary water resources beglov 2011 the upstream is located in kyrgyzstan where the water consumption is minimal the runoff exits the mountainous region through toktogul reservoir into the midstream valley uzbekistan and flows through the bahri tojik reservoir tajikistan into the midstream plain uzbekistan where farms and settlements are mainly concentrated then the water reaches the downstream desert kazakhstan through the shardara reservoir among these areas both the midstream valley and plain irrigation districts are fed by tributaries controlled by the andijan and charvak reservoirs yegemova et al 2018 bocchiola et al 2017 respectively finally the runoff reaches the north aral sea terminal lakes the sdb has an extreme continental climate and an uneven precipitation distribution with an annual precipitation of approximately 350 mm that reaches up to 1000 1500 mm in the mountainous regions 300 600 mm of precipitation in the midstream foothills and only 100 200 mm of precipitation in the downstream desert the annual temperature is 14 2 c with a range of 15 38 c in

last 10 years of climate change zhang et al 2019 2 2 2 water resource data the interstate commission for water resources coordination of central asia icwc forecasts the water supply and requirement for the next season based on meteorological hydrological and agricultural data and formulates water resource allocation plans for applications such as reservoir regulation water withdrawal along the river and water release to the north aral sea sic icwc 2019 table 2 from 2000 2018 water resource monitoring and simulation data of the sdb were obtained from the icwc http www icwc aral uz and cawater info http www cawater info net including the water inflow storage and release of major reservoirs simulation of the water that reaches midstream water withdrawal midstream and downstream and the inflow of the terminal lakes karateren station the water resource data were used to analyse the characteristics of the water supply and to compare the planned and actual water allocation 2 2 3 cropland data the crop area and structure data at the city scale in the sdb for 2000 2018 were obtained from the water use efficiency monitor in central asia wuemoca online information tool http wuemoca net this tool provides basic information on crop types cropping intensity yield production and irrigation efficiency conrad 2019 the crop area and structure for cotton winter wheat rice alfalfa maize and sunflower were based on modis remote sensing products and were used to estimate the cwr and sensitivity analysis 2 2 4 land cover data the mcd12q1 land cover product had a time series of 2001 2018 and a spatial resolution of 500 m sulla menashe and friedl 2018 the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp land cover classification scheme was chosen to reclassify forestland grassland wetland cropland city snow and ice and bare land 2 3 methods 2 3 1 approach to variation in water supply and its driving factors based on the linear regression analysis method the changing trend slope of the target variable was calculated the time series change trend of climate and water resource factors was analysed chatfield 2009 and the correlation of climate and water factors was calculated by the pearson correlation coefficient method jiang 2020 1 slope n i 1 n i p i i 1 n i i 1 n p i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n 2 where n is the length of the time series i is the i year of the time series p i is the average of the target variable in year i and slope is the linear regression coefficient 2 r x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 where r is the correlation coefficient i is year i in the time series and xi and yi are climate or water resource factors in year i 2 3 2 approach to variation in water requirement and its driving factors 2 3 2 1 estimation of water requirement the cropwat model was developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and is widely used globally for cwr estimation this model is based on the penman monteith formula which is calculated as follows 3 e t c e t 0 k c where et c is the actual crop evapotranspiration et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration which is related only to meteorological factors and k c is the crop coefficient of the different crop types at each growth stage hong et al 2017 conrad et al 2013 smith et al 1998 allen et al 1998 the penman monteith formula calculates the et 0 process as follows 4 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t ment 273 u 2 e x e a δ γ i 0 34 u 2 where g denotes the soil heat flux mj m2 d δ is the slope of the saturated water vapor pressure curve kpa c r n denotes the net crop surface radiation mj m2 d u 2 denotes the 24 h mean wind speed m s at a 2 m height t denotes the mean air temperature c at a 2 m height e a denotes the actual water vapor pressure kpa e d denotes the mean saturated water vapor pressure kpa and γ denotes the dry and wet bulb constants kpa c the determination of k c is related to crop type fertility period and leaf area index and was calculated from the measured water requirements in the field the reference crop evapotranspiration was calculated from the meteorological factors of the same period in this study the fao recommended crop coefficient table 3 was used to select the crop coefficients for cwr estimation in regions with climates similar to those in central asia furthermore the tcwr was calculated by combining the cwr with the area of different crops which is calculated as follows 5 tcwr c w r j a j where tcwr is the total crop water requirement cwr is the crop water requirement of the different crop types a is the crop area of the different crop types and j is crop type 2 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis of water requirement the tcwr is influenced by climate and crop area factors the sensitivity ε of the tcwr to each factor and the contribution ω of each factor can be determined zheng et al 2009 the sensitivity coefficient is calculated as follows 6 ε x q x i x q i q x i x 2 where ε is the sensitivity coefficient which refers to the ε change in tcwr caused by a 1 change in the influencing factors i indicates the i th year of the time series x i is the influencing factors q i is the tcwr x indicates the multiyear average of the influencing factors and q is the multiyear average of the tcwr the contribution of influencing factors to the tcwr was calculated by the following formula hao et al 2021 7 ω δ x ε where ω refers to the contribution of influencing factors to the tcwr and δ x is the amount of multiyear variation of the influencing factors 2 3 3 approach to water conservation strategies under future scenarios a water conservation effect can be achieved by reducing the proportion of high water consuming crops and increasing the proportion of low water consuming crops using the 2018 climate and crop structure as the baseline scenario and considering the range of changes in the crop structure over the past 20 years crop structure scenarios were set with 10 20 and 30 adjustments of a single crop type table 4 adjusting the other crop types accordingly to ensure that the total proportion remained unchanged these factors were used to drive the cropwat model and estimate the water conservation effect in the future climate scenario 3 results 3 1 variation in water supply and its driving factors from the perspective of runoff the variations in upstream water resources and their climatic drivers are analysed and actual water withdrawal in the midstream and downstream irrigation districts under reservoir regulation is used to clarify the water supply of the sdb 3 1 1 variation in water supply 3 1 1 1 variation in basin water resources the sdb has an annual runoff of 45 34 billion m3 from 2000 to 2018 which increases overall by 414 million m3 a fig 2 the runoff from 2010 to 2018 was 48 32 billion m3 which is an increase of 5 65 billion m3 over 2000 2009 the runoff in the midstream valley toltogul andijan and toktogul bahri tojik is 31 26 billion m3 which is a steady increase 0 68 billion m3 a the runoff in the midstream plain charvak and bahri tojik shardara is the greatest 34 43 billion m3 and its increase is the most obvious 339 million m3 a the runoff in the downstream desert shardara is significantly lower than that in other regions and has a decreasing trend 18 92 billion m3 0 61 billion m3 a there is a naturally uneven spatial distribution of water supply in the sdb the water supply midstream is sufficient and tends to expand while it is low and tends to decline downstream 3 1 1 2 variation in agricultural water supply according to the statistical data from 2000 to 2015 the share of water used by the agricultural sector in the sdb is maintained at approximately 86 showing a slight and continuous decreasing trend 0 22 a table 5 while urban expansion and rapid population increases are evident in central asia the share of domestic water use is stable at approximately 4 5 with a significant increase in water use in the industrial sector 3 3 water use in the agricultural sector is still the main water consumption pathway but the proportion of the agricultural sector is decreasing under the trend of cropland expansion the change in water resources and crop structure is an important reason for this phenomenon thus the water supply and requirement situation in the irrigation district needs to be further clarified to counter water scarcity 3 1 2 driving factors of water supply 3 1 2 1 climate the correlation between precipitation and runoff upstream is strong reaching 0 83 0 76 and 0 54 in the toktogul andijan and charvak reservoir catchment basins respectively and both precipitation and runoff increase table 6 the correlation between temperature and runoff in each catchment basin of the reservoir is low r 0 2 glaciers cover a wide area upstream and the change in glacial meltwater has no significant effect on the change in runoff the climate and runoff correlation analysis indicates that the main factor affecting the water supply is precipitation this result is generally consistent with the conclusion of sanim 2020 based on budyko s climate elasticity model that increased precipitation in the sdb is positively correlated with increased runoff while it is negatively correlated with temperature changes 3 1 2 2 reservoir the large reservoirs on the sdb are mostly built near the national boundary to ensure the safety of the national water supply they have an important impact on the pattern of water supply in the irrigation districts the annual reservoir storage in the middle and upper stream is 21 84 billion m3 which maintains an increasing trend 0 73 billion m3 a in the face of increasing water inflow the actual reservoir storage is slightly higher than 1 1 of the planned storage and the deviation from the plan tends to decrease 0 15 a fig 3 the annual cumulative water release of the reservoir is 61 97 billion m3 with a decreasing trend 195 million m3 a and the actual water release is 8 54 higher than that of the plan the deviation tends to increase significantly 1 1 a p 0 05 the reservoir releases are decreasing but they also exceed the plan and show an expanding trend due to the high requirement for agricultural water reservoir regulation is often carried out in excess of the plan the coordinated use of water resources in the sdb is still difficult the water withdrawal between the nodes of the main reservoirs indicated the availability of water resources in the irrigation districts according to the available data from 2002 to 2009 the annual water withdrawal is 32 56 billion m3 with 38 5 of the total water withdrawal in the midstream valley 44 5 in the midstream plain and only 17 0 in the downstream desert fig 4 the 25 98 billion m3 of total water withdrawal in the midstream region during 2000 2018 has a decreasing trend 189 million m3 and its deviation from the plan is low 0 4 and decreasing 1 24 a the decreasing rate of water withdrawal tends to slow down after 2010 and the actual water withdrawal is much lower than the plan in most years after 2009 the water withdrawal usually fails to meet the plan 10 and this problem is most prominent in the midstream plain where farmland is concentrated difficulties in the management of transboundary rivers have exacerbated the problem of the uneven distribution of water supply patterns in the basin 3 2 variation in water requirement and its driving factors based on the climatic and crop area conditions of the irrigation district the variation in the cwr of major crops was estimated and analysed the sensitivity and contribution of driving factors were assessed to reveal the driving mechanism which can provide a scientific basis for future scenario estimation and water conservation analysis 3 2 1 variation in water requirement 3 2 1 1 spatial and temporal distribution of cwr in analysing the characteristics of cwr changes from the unit area the water requirement can be reduced by optimizing the crop structure to cope with water scarcity from 2000 2018 the annual cwr in the sdb was 706 8 mm ranging from 562 7 mm to 816 5 mm rice had the highest cwr of 1168 7 mm followed by alfalfa 976 1 cotton 787 7 mm maize and sunflower 622 0 mm and 492 9 mm respectively and winter wheat had the lowest cwr 358 8 mm fig 5 the overall cwr significantly increased by 7 3 mm a p 0 05 except for that of wheat and alfalfa under current climate change cwrs were significantly higher in 2010 2018 752 7 mm than in 2000 2009 87 3 mm the main impact factors were wind speed r 0 61 p 0 01 and water vapor pressure r 0 52 p 0 01 while temperature r 0 42 and sunshine duration r 0 08 had low correlations the cwr in the downstream desert was the highest 1006 59 mm and its increasing trend rate was the largest 13 64 mm a followed by the midstream plain 761 37 mm 8 06 mm a while the cwr in the midstream valley was the lowest 580 9 mm 4 42 mm a the overall cwr variation in the basin showed an increasing trend from upstream to downstream the spatial distribution and change trend of the cwr at the city scale are shown in fig 6 cwr values above 1000 mm were concentrated in the downstream desert reaching up to 1389 5 mm the cwr in the midstream plain was concentrated between 600 and 900 mm most regions of the midstream valley were below 600 mm cwrs over 1000 mm in 2000 were distributed only in the downstream desert while other areas mostly had cwrs of 600 900 mm by 2018 cwr values above 1000 mm expanded from the downstream desert to the midstream plain while in the midstream valley they were generally lower than 600 mm the cwr increase rates in the downstream desert varied between 10 and 15 mm a while those in the midstream plain ranged from 0 to 20 mm a the overall cwr change rates in the middle valley were low ranging from 0 to 5 mm more than 55 of the sdb irrigation districts showed a significant increase in their cwr and more than 88 of the downstream desert showed a significant increase in cwr while 27 4 and 29 3 of the midstream valley and plain showed significant changes 3 2 1 2 spatial and temporal distribution of tcwr from 2000 2018 the annual tcwr of the major crops was 11 12 billion m3 showing a significant increase of 175 million m3 a p 0 05 which is an increase of 30 7 fig 7 the increasing rate of tcwr from 2000 to 2009 was not obvious 0 4 billion m3 a and the increase was concentrated after 2010 409 million m3 a cotton accounted for 61 5 of the tcwr winter wheat and rice accounted for approximately 12 1 13 9 maize accounted for 6 5 alfalfa accounted for 4 0 and sunflower accounted for only 1 9 the increase in tcwr was mainly from rice 54 million m3 a cotton 37 million m3 a and alfalfa 26 million m3 a there was an increase of approximately 0 3 billion m3 a for maize only 0 19 billion m3 a for winter wheat and no significant change for sunflower 0 09 billion m3 a however the tcwr of maize and sunflower increased by more than 140 while that of alfalfa reached 200 that of rice increased by 89 9 and those of winter wheat and cotton increased by 39 4 and 8 8 respectively among the different irrigation districts the tcwr increase was concentrated in the midstream plain 5 21 billion m3 and valley 4 12 billion m3 and was only 1 78 billion m3 in the downstream desert table 7 cotton dominated the tcwr in the midstream valley 70 4 followed by winter wheat at 14 3 the tcwr of cotton winter wheat and rice in the midstream plain was 64 14 1 and 10 4 respectively and the tcwr in the downstream desert was dominated by rice 46 8 cotton 33 6 and alfalfa 17 7 the tcwr in the midstream valley increased significantly mainly from cotton 0 23 billion m3 a and maize 0 12 billion m3 a the tcwr of all crops in the midstream plain increased to varying degrees 0 11 0 24 billion m3 a except for alfalfa and sunflower in the downstream desert only rice and alfalfa crops showed a significant increase while the other crops did not change significantly 0 03 billion m3 a the spatial distribution of tcwr at the city scale is shown in fig 8 from 2000 2018 the areas with high tcwr values were concentrated in the midstream plain and the downstream desert the tcwr in the midstream plain increased significantly due to the crop planting area and reached 1 14 billion m3 in 2018 the irrigation districts with high growth rates of tcwr were also in accordance with the distribution of tcwr the increasing rate of the tcwr in the downstream desert and midstream plain exceeded 2 million m3 a but in most of the midstream valley it was less than 1 million m3 a while there were also some areas with a decreasing trend 387 3 million m3 a under the influence of climate change and the increase in crop area the tcwr increased significantly with 33 7 of the total area and up to 88 9 of the area in the downstream desert showing a significant increase in the midstream valley and plain the twcr increase was less than 30 the tcwr showed obvious spatial heterogeneity characteristics due to climate change and the increase in crop area climate change has led to an increase in the cwr and although the cropping structure has improved to some extent subject to the significant increase in the crop area the tcwr in the sdb has increased significantly the degree of influence of climate change and crop area on the change in tcwr needs to be further determined 3 2 2 driving factors of water requirement 3 2 2 1 crop area and structure the determination of crop types area and structure is the basis for estimating cwr in irrigation districts from 2000 2018 the major crops included cotton winter wheat rice alfalfa maize and sunflower accounting for 71 1 15 800 km2 of the total cropland with an increase rate of 84 4 km2 a fig 9 the average areas of cotton and winter wheat were 8682 2 km2 38 9 and 3780 9 km2 17 0 respectively both of which exceeded 50 of the cropland however the area shared by cotton and winter wheat decreased from 60 0 to 50 0 from 2000 to 2018 the average area of rice was 1324 0 km2 5 9 followed by maize 1151 3 km2 5 2 alfalfa 467 0 km2 2 1 and sunflower 439 6 km2 2 0 among the major crops except for cotton which showed a significant downwards trend 54 1 km2 a 0 45 a all other crops showed an increasing trend to varying degrees 14 0 36 4 km2 a among them alfalfa 23 7 km2 a p 0 05 and rice 31 6 km2 a p 0 05 showed the most significant increase the average cotton area reached 56 2 and its decline was the most pronounced 0 56 a from 71 2 in 2000 to 43 1 in 2018 the decrease in the cotton area was concentrated in the midstream plain 40 4 km2 a but cotton decreased from 69 to 36 4 0 26 a in the midstream valley and from 79 to 50 4 0 72 a in the midstream plain and its planting proportion remained at 40 in the downstream desert the proportion of winter wheat was 23 increasing from 15 in 2000 to 29 2 33 2 km2 a in 2018 and was concentrated in the midstream plain in both years 25 3 km2 a the percentages of rice and alfalfa were 8 3 and 2 8 respectively rice and alfalfa increased from 38 5 to 43 7 and 12 5 13 0 respectively in the downstream desert their rates of increase were relatively fast 0 32 a 0 51 a maize and sunflower accounted for 7 0 and 2 7 respectively with similar planting structures in the midstream valley and plain and less than 1 in the downstream desert 3 2 2 2 climate meteorological factors directly affect the estimation of the cwr per unit area from 2000 2018 the average wind speed in the irrigation districts was 2 5 m s showing a significant increasing trend 0 06 m s p 0 05 while other meteorological factors showed an overall decreasing trend fig 10 the precipitation reached 313 6 mm showing a decreasing trend 0 98 mm a and generally remained at approximately 260 mm the temperature reached 14 7 c and the water vapor pressure was 0 95 kpa both with slight decreasing trends sunshine duration averaged 7 5 h day with an overall continuous and significant decreasing trend 0 03 h a in different regions wind speed showed a significant increasing trend p 0 05 reaching 3 0 m s in both the midstream plain and downstream desert 0 06 0 07 m s which was significantly higher than that in the midstream valley 1 7 m s the highest precipitation 402 0 mm was observed in the midstream plain which was significantly higher than that in the midstream valley 237 4 mm and downstream desert 275 0 mm the precipitation decreased in all irrigation districts except for the downstream desert where precipitation increased 2 14 mm a the temperatures in the midstream valley and plain were similar approximately 15 and significantly higher than those in the downstream desert 12 9 there was a decreasing trend in the midstream valley 0 06 a and the downstream desert 0 01 a the water vapor pressure decreases sequentially from upstream to downstream 1 05 kpa 0 89 kpa 0 74 kpa with no obvious change trend sunshine duration was between 7 and 8 h day and showed a similar decreasing trend everywhere 0 01 to 0 03 h day 3 2 2 3 analysis of water requirement drivers by assessing the response of tcwr to climate and crop area the driving mechanism of the variation in the tcwr was analysed the variation in tcwr under the influence of climate change was flat but crop area had a significant impact the degree of influence of crop area 380 million m3 a increased faster than that of climate 130 million m3 a fig 11 changes in crop area in the sdb play a dominant role in the tcwr and are strengthening focusing on adjusting the crop structure is important for water conservation in irrigation districts among the meteorological factors the tcwr was sensitive to changes in wind speed water vapor pressure and sunshine duration but the actual contribution of wind speed reached 27 47 followed by that of sunshine duration 11 4 the tcwr was not sensitive to temperature from 2000 to 2018 and its contribution was the lowest because there was no significant change in temperature after 2010 the contributions of wind speed and sunshine duration to tcwr increased significantly both exceeding 40 the sensitivity and contribution of cotton and winter wheat to tcwr were not high mainly due to the effective control of the cotton area and the proportion of its expansion although the winter wheat area expanded significantly the cwr of winter wheat was not sensitive to climate change rice had the highest sensitivity at 0 45 and its contribution was 19 2 which was due to the significant increase in its cwr with climate change table 8 the contribution of alfalfa maize and sunflower was approximately 7 8 and its effect on the change in tcwr was also more obvious this shows that although cotton and winter wheat were the major crops in the basin their contributions to the tcwr decreased and the expansion of rice alfalfa maize and sunflower areas led to a significant increase in the tcwr the contribution of these crop area factors to the tcwr increased significantly after 2010 with the contribution increasing between 40 and 50 among the different irrigation districts the wind speed contributed 43 22 to the tcwr in the downstream desert and approximately 23 00 to that in the midstream plain and valley the contribution of sunshine duration gradually increased from downstream to midstream ranging from 6 05 to 9 22 among the crop area factors cotton and winter wheat contributed less to the tcwr in each irrigation district while the contributions of rice and alfalfa were concentrated in the downstream desert reaching 36 69 and 13 77 respectively the contributions of maize and sunflower were concentrated in the midstream region with contributions ranging from 4 90 to 8 30 the degree of contribution to the tcwr increased significantly after 2010 which was consistent with the overall characteristics of the sdb 3 3 comparing water supply with requirement the water supply was analysed based on the runoff water release and water withdrawal at the basin scale however the water requirement was estimated from the aspect of the main crops there is presence of spatial scale inconsistency thus water supply was compared with requirements from the aspect of trend slope table 9 the runoff increased in midstream valley 0 34 billion m3 a and midstream plain 0 07 billion m3 a but the downstream desert showed a decreasing trend 0 06 billion m3 a after reservoir regulation there is a decreasing trend of water release in different regions 0 05 to 0 1 billion m3 a the water withdrawal in the midstream valley 0 07 billion m3 a and midstream plain 0 12 billion m3 a decreased accordingly but the downstream desert showed an increasing trend 0 11 billion m3 a because of local water shortages however the water requirement showed an increasing trend in different regions 0 05 0 08 billion m3 a although the runoff from upstream increases the water releases decrease after reservoir regulation and the actual water withdrawal decreases accordingly but the water requirement continuously increases thus there is a conflict between the water supply and requirement in the irrigation district water conservation strategies should be further proposed under future scenarios based on crop structure to cope with water scarcity 3 4 water conservation strategy under future scenarios based on crop structure although the variation in wind speed from 2000 to 2018 was the main driver of the increased cwr in the sdb temperature increase was the general trend of future climate change and was still an important driver of increased water requirements the temperature changes in the ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios from 2019 to 2030 were used to predict cwr based on the crop structure in the historical period a variety of crop structure optimization scenarios were applied to evaluate their water conservation effects 3 4 1 trends of cwr under temperature change scenarios the temperature in the sdb from 2019 to 2030 showed a warming trend the average temperature increased by 0 51 c and 0 94 c for the ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios respectively with an average increase of 0 22 c and 0 55 c in 2030 within the different irrigation districts the largest increase in temperature was found in the midstream plain reaching 0 52 c ssp126 and 0 94 c ssp245 followed by the downstream desert with temperature increases of 0 44 c ssp126 and 0 90 c ssp245 the midstream valley had an average temperature increase of 0 53 c under the ssp126 scenario but there was no significant change 0 05 c under the ssp245 scenario the crop area and structure of the basin vary significantly from year to year and its future tcwr is difficult to predict therefore the cwr was predicted the average increase in cwr was 9 mm and 7 mm in 2019 2030 for the ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios with changes ranging from 11 7 25 7 mm and 10 7 21 8 mm respectively fig 12 combining the results of two scenarios winter wheat increased by 11 3 mm followed by cotton at 8 8 mm and maize at 5 3 mm while rice showed a decrease in water requirement 1 97 mm and the water requirement of sunflower increased by only 1 43 mm in terms of trend rates those of winter wheat and rice increased by more than 1 mm a followed by cotton at 0 9 mm a and alfalfa maize and sunflower at 0 5 0 7 mm a the increase in the cwr for cotton and winter wheat was significant under the warming trend of the future decade overall crops with high water consumption rates and high planting proportions were significantly influenced by warming the increase in the midstream valley reached 12 0 mm 0 1 mm a under the ssp126 scenario and only 4 4 mm 1 3 mm a under the ssp245 scenario the midstream valley showed a similar change under both scenarios 9 10 mm 1 1 1 5 mm a the downstream desert showed a decrease under the ssp126 scenario 3 1 mm 1 1 mm a but maintained an increase under the ssp245 scenario 6 3 mm 0 6 mm a fig 13 under the ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios the spatial distribution of the high values of average cwr increased midstream and were generally between 0 and 20 mm in terms of the change trend the slope of the cwr under the ssp126 scenario was highly spatially heterogeneous with the highest increase rate of more than 2 mm a while most regions had change trends that were concentrated between 0 and 2 mm a 3 4 2 cropland structure optimization scenario and water conservation effect the water conservation effects of crop restructuring under the ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios were similar and the results were averaged under crop restructuring scenario 1 10 the most significant water conservation effect was in winter wheat restructuring with an average reduction in the cwr of 14 3 mm followed by cotton and rice with average reductions of 11 9 mm and 5 mm respectively and alfalfa maize and sunflower with reductions of approximately 1 mm table 10 under scenarios 2 and 3 the water conservation effect of crop restructuring for each crop type increased by 10 28 7 mm and 15 2 43 mm respectively based on the projected average increase in cwr by 8 mm and the range of variation between 11 7 and 25 7 mm for 2019 2030 the water conservation effect of crop restructuring under scenario 2 20 reached 10 28 7 mm which can cope with the impact of increased water requirements in irrigation districts due to future climate warming alfalfa maize and sunflower need to be adjusted more intensively to achieve the corresponding water conservation effect due to their low proportions among the different irrigation districts the best water conservation effect was achieved by adjusting the structure of cotton 13 6 30 7 mm and 13 5 48 2 mm and alfalfa 19 51 9 and 8 1 35 mm in the midstream valley and plain respectively the downstream desert with its high proportion of high water consuming crops saved 7 5 94 8 mm by adjusting cotton winter wheat and rice and saved 15 4 19 3 mm by adjusting alfalfa maize and sunflower structures therefore focusing on optimizing the structure of cotton winter wheat rice and alfalfa can achieve the desired water conservation effect 4 discussion climate water resources and crop area monitoring data were used to recognize the new features of water demand and requirements from 2000 to 2018 in the data scarce central asian basin the water supply and requirements at the basin and irrigation district scales in the sdb were analysed for the first time which is more systematic and representative than the existing regional and national scale studies based on model products that with limitations of resolution and precision moreover basin water resource analysis not only concentrates on mountainous runoff but also pays attention to the reservoir regulation among the central asian countries which is crucial to actual water supply in transboundary river water management based on the detailed crop data the major crop water requirements were quantified which can support the analysis of the driving mechanism in complex crop structures compared with previous studies the estimated cwr was slightly lower but the spatial and temporal distribution of cwr was consistent ruan 2020 tian 2020 xin et al 2021 conrad 2019 and 2013 meteorological station and crop area monitoring data were used instead of global scale grid products and the data quality was more reliable and accurate in portraying the change process of water demand this makes up for the lack of understanding of water supply and requirements in central asia a crop restructuring optimized scenario is proposed that increases the proportion of low water consuming crops to evaluate the water conservation strategies for coping with water scarcity as water management in transboundary rivers is difficult because of the complex political situation this is a practicable approach for coping with water scarcity in changing future environments from the perspective of countries themselves however the economic issues of crop restructuring also need to be considered there is a limitation of the study of water supply and requirement stress analysis the water supply was analysed based on the runoff water release and water withdrawal at the basin scale however the water requirement was estimated from the aspect of major crops there is presence of spatial scale inconsistency due to the inconsistency in the spatial scales of water supply and requirement data in the sdb the qualitative analysis of water supply and requirement stress was more suitable thus water supply was compared with requirements from the aspect of trend slope in future research further improvement of the basin water requirement estimation to support the water supply and requirement stress evaluation is necessary this study enhances the understanding of the water supply and requirement characteristics of the arid transboundary river of central asia but the contradiction between supply and requirement environmental impacts and agricultural development strategies in water utilization deserves in depth discussion 4 1 the contradiction between water supply and requirement the water resources in the sdb have increased significantly but the water withdrawal and agricultural sector water use after reservoir regulation is decreasing this result contradicts the significant increase in tcwr platonov et al 2008 mapped the water productivity of irrigated districts in the sdb based on etm imagery and showed that an increased crop yield improved the water use efficiency and reduced water stress to some extent conrad et al 2019 measured the irrigation efficiency midstream of the sdb from 2000 to 2017 based on remote sensing data and showed that the irrigation efficiency coefficient was 0 67 this was clearly higher than the irrigation efficiency 0 566 estimated by rost et al 2008 and the significant increase indicated that the water use efficiency had improved despite the conflict between the decreasing water supply and increasing requirement in the basin the improvement in water use efficiency such as irrigation efficiency fig 14 and water production efficiency eased the stress on water supply and requirement 4 2 environmental restoration helps relieve water stress land cover changes reflect the ecological security in central asia during 2001 2018 the sdb was dominated by grassland 298 400 km2 76 5 with less than 2 of its area made up of wetlands snow and ice water bodies and cities 9 4 made up farmland and 10 5 made up of bare land the increase in farmland mainly came from grassland 4600 6 km2 the area of forest 34 5 wetland 25 6 and water bodies 4 6 increased and bare land downstream decreased significantly 8 14 wu et al 2020 combined remote sensing and geographic information technology to determine that the ecological carrying capacity of the aral sea basin tended to improve during 2001 2018 the overall environment of the basin tended to improve compared to the historical period mainly due to the climate and the ecological water requirement did not negatively affect the agricultural water requirement in turn the ecological water requirement became less dependent on the water resources of the basin thus environmental restoration helps relieve water stress the state of the terminal lakes in an arid inland river basin is a direct representation of the ecological impact of agricultural water use the reduced water release in the downstream desert and significant increase in water requirement led to a decreasing trend in the water inflow of the north aral sea during 2000 2018 101 million m3 fig 15 the annual water inflow of the north aral sea is 6 billion m3 and after 2010 it stayed at a relatively low level 5 36 billion m3 despite the decrease in water inflow the north aral sea showed a continuous increasing trend in water level 0 16 m a area 36 4 km2 a and storage volume 400 million m3 a but after 2010 each parameter showed a decreasing trend in this period the water requirement of the sdb irrigation district reached its highest level therefore a large amount of water resources is still needed to flow downstream and into terminal lakes to maintain ecological and environmental security the utilization of water resources in the basin still needs to consider the balance between agricultural development and ecological restoration 4 3 priority development of winter wheat rotation the effective precipitation is the part of precipitation that directly meets the water requirement of crop growth and the shortage is supplemented by irrigation the effective precipitation plays an important role in the water supply especially during the growing period of winter wheat from 2000 2018 the annual effective precipitation in the irrigation districts was 240 1 mm and reached 130 6 mm from october to march table 11 the coupling degree between effective precipitation and tcwr was 11 7 during the growing period of major crops from april to september however the coupling degree between effective precipitation and tcwr reached 79 8 from october to march when winter wheat was planted karimov et al 2018 showed that the use of winter wheat instead of alfalfa cultivation in the irrigation district of the midstream valley released a large amount of water resources while the use of crop rotation could effectively reduce evaporation losses it is feasible to develop a crop rotation of winter wheat with other crops in the sdb and reduce the proportion of high water consuming crops such as cotton rice and alfalfa cotton has good economic value and reducing the cotton proportion will inevitably reduce the total productivity based on the statistical data the productivity per unit area of cotton and winter wheat rice are 2136 ha 1124 ha respectively table 12 combined with the cropland structure optimization scenario the adjustment of cotton structure 10 30 caused the obvious decline in total productivity 2 8 8 8 under scenarios 1 3 the adjustment of winter wheat structure 10 30 caused the decline of 1 6 and 3 2 in total productivity under scenarios 1 and 2 but the total productivity decline reached 4 7 under scenario 3 thus focusing on the winter wheat restructuring 20 and loss of acceptable productivity that can be solved by gradually improving water use efficiency to relief of water stress is practical and useful under water resource constraints priority development of winter wheat rotation is a practicable approach for improving water resource utilization efficiency and can be used to cope with the adverse impact on the relationship between water supply and requirements due to future climate change 5 conclusion based on the detailed meteorological hydrological and agricultural monitoring data in the data scarce arid transboundary river of central asia from 2000 to 2018 a systematic analysis of the spatial and temporal characteristics of water supply and requirements at basin and irrigation district scales in the sdb was conducted to identify the driving mechanisms apply climate and crop restructuring scenarios to predict water requirements and evaluate water conservation effects from 2019 to 2030 and propose an practical climate adaptation strategies based on crop structure to relieve water stress the main conclusions were as follows the runoff of the sdb increased by 7 45 billion m3 from 2000 to 2018 but the water supply after reservoir regulation decreased by 3 42 billion m3 unified water management is currently challenging to conduct and usually exceeds the water allocation plan that exacerbates the stress between water supply and requirement the tcwr was mainly derived from cotton winter wheat and rice and increased significantly by 3 15 billion m3 which was most sensitive to wind speed 27 5 and rice area 19 2 the contradiction of water supply and requirement caused water scarcity in the basin from 2019 2030 the water conservation effects of winter wheat 20 under the crop restructuring scenario reached 28 7 mm which helped relieve water stress under the scenario of a 0 51 0 91 c increase thus priority planting of a winter wheat rotation and low water consuming crops is a practicable approach for coping with water scarcity and adapting to climate change in arid transboundary rivers of central asia credit authorship contribution statement hongwei

9217,with the challenges of arid transboundary river water management among central asian countries it is important to evaluate the water stress and propose practicable climate adaptation strategies this study used the syr darya basin sdb in a central asia data scarce region as the study area and conducted the first quantified analysis of the spatiotemporal characteristics of water supply and requirements at the basin and irrigation district scale identified its driving mechanisms based on systematic monitoring data concerning reservoir regulation and complex crop structure from 2000 to 2018 and a climate change scenario combined with a crop restructuring scenario was applied to evaluate water conservation effects and propose a climate adaptation strategy from 2019 to 2030 the results showed that runoff increased by 7 45 billion m3 but the water withdrawal decreased by 3 42 billion m3 after reservoir regulation in the basin during 2000 2018 due to the unified water allocation it was challenging to conduct and usually exceeded the plan by 0 4 8 5 the total crop water requirement tcwr mainly derived from cotton 61 5 winter wheat 12 1 and rice 13 9 increased by 3 15 billion m3 30 7 and the influence of crop area 380 million m3 a was greater than that of climate 130 million m3 a the wind speed 27 5 and rice area 19 2 also significantly contributed to the tcwr variation the contradiction between water supply and requirement resulted in water scarcity in the basin from 2019 2030 the water conservation effect of winter wheat 20 under the restructuring scenarios reached 28 7 mm which helped relieve water stress under the scenario of a 0 51 0 91 c increase thus priority planting of a winter wheat rotation and low water consuming crops is a

conservation strategies to adapt the climate change and achieve the 2030 sustainable development goals sdgs in central asia bleischwitz et al 2018 pradhan et al 2017 the water resources in central asia are highly uneven with abundant water resources upstream available mainly for hydropower generation intensive farming in the midstream area relies on water diversion resulting in a sharp decrease in water release downstream where environmental degradation is prominent reyer et al 2017 gojenko et al 2013 reservoirs play a key role in transboundary river water management but water scarcity is exacerbated by the differences in water supply and requirement patterns among central asian countries due to the politics of transboundary river management there is a low level of sharing of basic meteorological hydrological and agricultural monitoring data ruan and yu 2019 constrained by this data scarcity global scale models and remote sensing products have become alternative methods for understanding the characteristics of the aral sea basin huang et al 2021 hu et al 2021 chen et al 2020 entekhabi et al 1999 however the low spatial resolution and lack of precision validation are limitations for the application of these products in local studies kulmatov et al 2021 ruan et al 2020 furthermore existing water supply studies in central asia have focused on runoff in mountainous regions sanim 2020 zou et al 2019 radchenko et al 2014 chen et al 2011 and the water supply conditions in midstream and downstream regions are still unclear because of reservoir regulation the agricultural water requirement has not yet been accurately quantified in irrigation districts because of data scarcity it is crucial to analyse the characteristics of water supply and requirements in central asia based on detailed monitoring data more than 90 of the water resources in the aral sea basin are used for irrigation and many studies have estimated the crop water requirement cwr through model simulations and remote sensing inversion to analyse water requirements tian and zhang 2020 wu et al 2019 however these studies examined only typical years 2002 and 2007 core irrigation districts kyzylorda fergana or national scales and major crop types cotton and winter wheat khaydar et al 2021 conrad et al 2013 abdullaev and molden 2004 which makes it difficult to accurately reflect the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the water requirement remote sensing inversion based on evapotranspiration is a highly efficient and large scale approach to quantify water requirements abrishamkar and ahmadi 2017 however it is difficult to analyse the driving mechanisms in complex crop structures because of the lack of high resolution crop distribution data moreover the existing studies on cwr drivers focus on the climate but there is a scarcity of analyses on the sensitivity and contribution of crop area lobanova et al 2021 zou et al 2019 bandyopadhyay et al 2009 the cropwat model based on the penman monteith formula integrates cwr calculation and analysis ehsani et al 2012 allen et al 1998 and it is suitable for use in transboundary river water management in central asia because of its low data requirement there is a general trend of increased water requirements under the influence of climate warming and cropland expansion in the future li et al 2020 woodward et al 2014 lovelli et al 2010 the optimization of crop structure can achieve a water conservation effect on the cwr based on the combination of coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 data and the cropwat model to predict future cwr changes a crop restructuring scenario is proposed that increases the proportion of low water consuming crops to decrease the water requirement kobuliev et al 2021 xue et al 2021 gao et al 2019 luo et al 2018 as water management in transboundary rivers is difficult because of the complex political situation this is a practicable approach for coping with water scarcity in changing future environments however relevant future scenario assessments are scarce this study used the syr darya basin sdb the second largest river in the aral sea basin of central asia as the study area to evaluate the water supply and requirements in the irrigation district based on detailed meteorological hydrological and crop area monitoring data from 2000 to 2018 the variation in water supply and its influencing factors were analysed the cropwat model was applied to calculate the total crop water requirement tcwr and analyse its driving mechanism by quantifying the sensitivity and contribution to climate and crop area factors the future cwr was predicted based on cmip6 temperature scenarios during 2019 2030 and the crop structure optimization scenarios were set up and proposed water conservation strategies it is important to adapt to the climate change and achieve the 2030 sustainable development goals sdgs in arid transboundary rivers of central asia 2 data and methods 2 1 study region central asia is an arid and semiarid region in the hinterland of asia and europe located at 35 08 55 25 n 46 28 87 29 e fig 1 the sdb covers an area of approximately 400 000 km2 and spans 3019 km from east to the west wegerich et al 2015 and its irrigation area is approximately 24 000 km2 water resources are shared among four central asian countries with an annual runoff of approximately 37 2 billion m3 of which 27 6 billion m3 are transboundary water resources beglov 2011 the upstream is located in kyrgyzstan where the water consumption is minimal the runoff exits the mountainous region through toktogul reservoir into the midstream valley uzbekistan and flows through the bahri tojik reservoir tajikistan into the midstream plain uzbekistan where farms and settlements are mainly concentrated then the water reaches the downstream desert kazakhstan through the shardara reservoir among these areas both the midstream valley and

scenario radiative forcing stabilized at 2 6 w m2 in 2100 and the ssp245 medium forcing scenario radiative forcing stabilized at 4 5 w m2 in 2100 were used to predict future cwr changes based on the last 10 years of climate change zhang et al 2019 2 2 2 water resource data the interstate commission for water resources coordination of central asia icwc forecasts the water supply and requirement for the next season based on meteorological hydrological and agricultural data and formulates water resource allocation plans for applications such as reservoir regulation water withdrawal along the river and water release to the north aral sea sic icwc 2019 table 2 from 2000 2018 water resource monitoring and simulation data of the sdb were obtained from the icwc http www icwc aral uz and cawater info http www cawater info net including the water inflow storage and release of major reservoirs simulation of the water that reaches midstream water withdrawal midstream and downstream and the inflow of the terminal lakes karateren station the water resource data were used to analyse the characteristics of the water supply and to compare the planned and actual water allocation 2 2 3 cropland data the crop area and structure data at the city scale in the sdb for 2000 2018 were obtained from the water use efficiency monitor in central asia wuemoca online information tool http wuemoca net this tool provides basic information on crop types cropping intensity yield production and irrigation efficiency conrad 2019 the crop area and structure for cotton winter wheat rice alfalfa maize and sunflower were based on modis remote sensing products and were used to estimate the cwr and sensitivity analysis 2 2 4 land cover data the mcd12q1 land cover product had a time series of 2001 2018 and a spatial resolution of 500 m sulla menashe and friedl 2018 the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp land cover classification scheme was chosen to reclassify forestland grassland wetland cropland city snow and ice and bare land 2 3 methods 2 3 1 approach to variation in water supply and its driving factors based on the linear regression analysis method the changing trend slope of the target variable was calculated the time series change trend of climate and water resource factors was analysed chatfield 2009 and the correlation of climate and water factors was calculated by the pearson correlation coefficient method jiang 2020 1 slope n i 1 n i p i i 1 n i i 1 n p i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n 2 where n is the length of the time series i is the i year of the time series p i is the average of the target variable in year i and slope is the linear regression coefficient 2 r x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 where r is the correlation coefficient i is year i in the time series and xi and yi are climate or water resource factors in year i 2 3 2 approach to variation in water requirement and its driving factors 2 3 2 1 estimation of water requirement the cropwat model was developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and is widely used globally for cwr estimation this model is based on the penman monteith formula which is calculated as follows 3 e t c e t 0 k c where et c is the actual crop evapotranspiration et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration which is related only to meteorological factors and k c is the crop coefficient of the different crop types at each growth stage hong et al 2017 conrad et al 2013 smith et al 1998 allen et al 1998 the penman monteith formula calculates the et 0 process as follows 4 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t ment 273 u 2 e x e a δ γ i 0 34 u 2 where g denotes the soil heat flux mj m2 d δ is the slope of the saturated water vapor pressure curve kpa c r n denotes the net crop surface radiation mj m2 d u 2 denotes the 24 h mean wind speed m s at a 2 m height t denotes the mean air temperature c at a 2 m height e a denotes the actual water vapor pressure kpa e d denotes the mean saturated water vapor pressure kpa and γ denotes the dry and wet bulb constants kpa c the determination of k c is related to crop type fertility period and leaf area index and was calculated from the measured water requirements in the field the reference crop evapotranspiration was calculated from the meteorological factors of the same period in this study the fao recommended crop coefficient table 3 was used to select the crop coefficients for cwr estimation in regions with climates similar to those in central asia furthermore the tcwr was calculated by combining the cwr with the area of different crops which is calculated as follows 5 tcwr c w r j a j where tcwr is the total crop water requirement cwr is the crop water requirement of the different crop types a is the crop area of the different crop types and j is crop type 2 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis of water requirement the tcwr is influenced by climate and crop area factors the sensitivity ε of the tcwr to each factor and the contribution ω of each factor can be determined zheng et al 2009 the sensitivity coefficient is calculated as follows 6 ε x q x i x q i q x i x 2 where ε is the sensitivity coefficient which refers to the ε change in tcwr caused by a 1 change in the influencing factors i indicates the i th year of the time series x i is the influencing factors q i is the tcwr x indicates the multiyear average of the influencing factors and q is the multiyear average of the tcwr the contribution of influencing factors to the tcwr was calculated by the following formula hao et al 2021 7 ω δ x ε where ω refers to the contribution of influencing factors to the tcwr and δ x is the amount of multiyear variation of the influencing factors 2 3 3 approach to water conservation strategies under future scenarios a water conservation effect can be achieved by reducing the proportion of high water consuming crops and increasing the proportion of low water consuming crops using the 2018 climate and crop structure as the baseline scenario and considering the range of changes in the crop structure over the past 20 years crop structure scenarios were set with 10 20 and 30 adjustments of a single crop type table 4 adjusting the other crop types accordingly to ensure that the total proportion remained unchanged these factors were used to drive the cropwat model and estimate the water conservation effect in the future climate scenario 3 results 3 1 variation in water supply and its driving factors from the perspective of runoff the variations in upstream water resources and their climatic drivers are analysed and actual water withdrawal in the midstream and downstream irrigation districts under reservoir regulation is used to clarify the water supply of the sdb 3 1 1 variation in water supply 3 1 1 1 variation in basin water resources the sdb has an annual runoff of 45 34 billion m3 from 2000 to 2018 which increases overall by 414 million m3 a fig 2 the runoff from 2010 to 2018 was 48 32 billion m3 which is an increase of 5 65 billion m3 over 2000 2009 the runoff in the midstream valley toltogul andijan and toktogul bahri tojik is 31 26 billion m3 which is a steady increase 0 68 billion m3 a the runoff in the midstream plain charvak and bahri tojik shardara is the greatest 34 43 billion m3 and its increase is the most obvious 339 million m3 a the runoff in the downstream desert shardara is significantly lower than that in other regions and has a decreasing trend 18 92 billion m3 0 61 billion m3 a there is a naturally uneven spatial distribution of water supply in the sdb the water supply midstream is sufficient and tends to expand while it is low and tends to decline downstream 3 1 1 2 variation in agricultural water supply according to the statistical data from 2000 to 2015 the share of water used by the agricultural sector in the sdb is maintained at approximately 86 showing a slight and continuous decreasing trend 0 22 a table 5 while urban expansion and rapid population increases are evident in central asia the share of domestic water use is stable at approximately 4 5 with a significant increase in water use in the industrial sector 3 3 water use in the agricultural sector is still the main water consumption pathway but the proportion of the agricultural sector is decreasing under the trend of cropland expansion the change in water resources and crop structure is an important reason for this phenomenon thus the water supply and requirement situation in the irrigation district needs to be further clarified to counter water scarcity 3 1 2 driving factors of water supply 3 1 2 1 climate the correlation between precipitation and runoff upstream is strong reaching 0 83 0 76 and 0 54 in the toktogul andijan and charvak reservoir catchment basins respectively and both precipitation and runoff increase table 6 the correlation between temperature and runoff in each catchment basin of the reservoir is low r 0 2 glaciers cover a wide area upstream and the change in glacial meltwater has no significant effect on the change in runoff the climate and runoff correlation analysis indicates that the main factor affecting the water supply is precipitation this result is generally consistent with the conclusion of sanim 2020 based on budyko s climate elasticity model that increased precipitation in the sdb is positively correlated with increased runoff while it is negatively correlated with temperature changes 3 1 2 2 reservoir the large reservoirs on the sdb are mostly built near the national boundary to ensure the safety of the national water supply they have an important impact on the pattern of water supply in the irrigation districts the annual reservoir storage in the middle and upper stream is 21 84 billion m3 which maintains an increasing trend 0 73 billion m3 a in the face of increasing water inflow the actual reservoir storage is slightly higher than 1 1 of the planned storage and the deviation from the plan tends to decrease 0 15 a fig 3 the annual cumulative water release of the reservoir is 61 97 billion m3 with a decreasing trend 195 million m3 a and the actual water release is 8 54 higher than that of the plan the deviation tends to increase significantly 1 1 a p 0 05 the reservoir releases are decreasing but they also exceed the plan and show an expanding trend due to the high requirement for agricultural water reservoir regulation is often carried out in excess of the plan the coordinated use of water resources in the sdb is still difficult the water withdrawal between the nodes of the main reservoirs indicated the availability of water resources in the irrigation districts according to the available data from 2002 to 2009 the annual water withdrawal is 32 56 billion m3 with 38 5 of the total water withdrawal in the midstream valley 44 5 in the midstream plain and only 17 0 in the downstream desert fig 4 the 25 98 billion m3 of total water withdrawal in the midstream region during 2000 2018 has a decreasing trend 189 million m3 and its deviation from the plan is low 0 4 and decreasing 1 24 a the decreasing rate of water withdrawal tends to slow down after 2010 and the actual water withdrawal is much lower than the plan in most years after 2009 the water withdrawal usually fails to meet the plan 10 and this problem is most prominent in the midstream plain where farmland is concentrated difficulties in the management of transboundary rivers have exacerbated the problem of the uneven distribution of water supply patterns in the basin 3 2 variation in water requirement and its driving factors based on the climatic and crop area conditions of the irrigation district the variation in the cwr of major crops was estimated and analysed the sensitivity and contribution of driving factors were assessed to reveal the driving mechanism which can provide a scientific basis for future scenario estimation and water conservation analysis 3 2 1 variation in water requirement 3 2 1 1 spatial and temporal distribution of cwr in analysing the characteristics of cwr changes from the unit area the water requirement can be reduced by optimizing the crop structure to cope with water scarcity from 2000 2018 the annual cwr in the sdb was 706 8 mm ranging from 562 7 mm to 816 5 mm rice had the highest cwr of 1168 7 mm followed by alfalfa 976 1 cotton 787 7 mm maize and sunflower 622 0 mm and 492 9 mm respectively and winter wheat had the lowest cwr 358 8 mm fig 5 the overall cwr significantly increased by 7 3 mm a p 0 05 except for that of wheat and alfalfa under current climate change cwrs were significantly higher in 2010 2018 752 7 mm than in 2000 2009 87 3 mm the main impact factors were wind speed r 0 61 p 0 01 and water vapor pressure r 0 52 p 0 01 while temperature r 0 42 and sunshine duration r 0 08 had low correlations the cwr in the downstream desert was the highest 1006 59 mm and its increasing trend rate was the largest 13 64 mm a followed by the midstream plain 761 37 mm 8 06 mm a while the cwr in the midstream valley was the lowest 580 9 mm 4 42 mm a the overall cwr variation in the basin showed an increasing trend from upstream to downstream the spatial distribution and change trend of the cwr at the city scale are shown in fig 6 cwr values above 1000 mm were concentrated in the downstream desert reaching up to 1389 5 mm the cwr in the midstream plain was concentrated between 600 and 900 mm most regions of the midstream valley were below 600 mm cwrs over 1000 mm in 2000 were distributed only in the downstream desert while other areas mostly had cwrs of 600 900 mm by 2018 cwr values above 1000 mm expanded from the downstream desert to the midstream plain while in the midstream valley they were generally lower than 600 mm the cwr increase rates in the downstream desert varied between 10 and 15 mm a while those in the midstream plain ranged from 0 to 20 mm a the overall cwr change rates in the middle valley were low ranging from 0 to 5 mm more than 55 of the sdb irrigation districts showed a significant increase in their cwr and more than 88 of the downstream desert showed a significant increase in cwr while 27 4 and 29 3 of the midstream valley and plain showed significant changes 3 2 1 2 spatial and temporal distribution of tcwr from 2000 2018 the annual tcwr of the major crops was 11 12 billion m3 showing a significant increase of 175 million m3 a p 0 05 which is an increase of 30 7 fig 7 the increasing rate of tcwr from 2000 to 2009 was not obvious 0 4 billion m3 a and the increase was concentrated after 2010 409 million m3 a cotton accounted for 61 5 of the tcwr winter wheat and rice accounted for approximately 12 1 13 9 maize accounted for 6 5 alfalfa accounted for 4 0 and sunflower accounted for only 1 9 the increase in tcwr was mainly from rice 54 million m3 a cotton 37 million m3 a and alfalfa 26 million m3 a there was an increase of approximately 0 3 billion m3 a for maize only 0 19 billion m3 a for winter wheat and no significant change for sunflower 0 09 billion m3 a however the tcwr of maize and sunflower increased by more than 140 while that of alfalfa reached 200 that of rice increased by 89 9 and those of winter wheat and cotton increased by 39 4 and 8 8 respectively among the different irrigation districts the tcwr increase was concentrated in the midstream plain 5 21 billion m3 and valley 4 12 billion m3 and was only 1 78 billion m3 in the downstream desert table 7 cotton dominated the tcwr in the midstream valley 70 4 followed by winter wheat at 14 3 the tcwr of cotton winter wheat and rice in the midstream plain was 64 14 1 and 10 4 respectively and the tcwr in the downstream desert was dominated by rice 46 8 cotton 33 6 and alfalfa 17 7 the tcwr in the midstream valley increased significantly mainly from cotton 0 23 billion m3 a and maize 0 12 billion m3 a the tcwr of all crops in the midstream plain increased to varying degrees 0 11 0 24 billion m3 a except for alfalfa and sunflower in the downstream desert only rice and alfalfa crops showed a significant increase while the other crops did not change significantly 0 03 billion m3 a the spatial distribution of tcwr at the city scale is shown in fig 8 from 2000 2018 the areas with high tcwr values were concentrated in the midstream plain and the downstream desert the tcwr in the midstream plain increased significantly due to the crop planting area and reached 1 14 billion m3 in 2018 the irrigation districts with high growth rates of tcwr were also in accordance with the distribution of tcwr the increasing rate of the tcwr in the downstream desert and midstream plain exceeded 2 million m3 a but in most of the midstream valley it was less than 1 million m3 a while there were also some areas with a decreasing trend 387 3 million m3 a under the influence of climate change and the increase in crop area the tcwr increased significantly with 33 7 of the total area and up to 88 9 of the area in the downstream desert showing a significant increase in the midstream valley and plain the twcr increase was less than 30 the tcwr showed obvious spatial heterogeneity characteristics due to climate change and the increase in crop area climate change has led to an increase in the cwr and although the cropping structure has improved to some extent subject to the significant increase in the crop area the tcwr in the sdb has increased significantly the degree of influence of climate change and crop area on the change in tcwr needs to be further determined 3 2 2 driving factors of water requirement 3 2 2 1 crop area and structure the determination of crop types area and structure is the basis for estimating cwr in irrigation districts from 2000 2018 the major crops included cotton winter wheat rice alfalfa maize and sunflower accounting for 71 1 15 800 km2 of the total cropland with an increase rate of 84 4 km2 a fig 9 the average areas of cotton and winter wheat were 8682 2 km2 38 9 and 3780 9 km2 17 0 respectively both of which exceeded 50 of the cropland however the area shared by cotton and winter wheat decreased from 60 0 to 50 0 from 2000 to 2018 the average area of rice was 1324 0 km2 5 9 followed by maize 1151 3 km2 5 2 alfalfa 467 0 km2 2 1 and sunflower 439 6 km2 2 0 among the major crops except for cotton which showed a significant downwards trend 54 1 km2 a 0 45 a all other crops showed an increasing trend to varying degrees 14 0 36 4 km2 a among them alfalfa 23 7 km2 a p 0 05 and rice 31 6 km2 a p 0 05 showed the most significant increase the average cotton area reached 56 2 and its decline was the most pronounced 0 56 a from 71 2 in 2000 to 43 1 in 2018 the decrease in the cotton area was concentrated in the midstream plain 40 4 km2 a but cotton decreased from 69 to 36 4 0 26 a in the midstream valley and from 79 to 50 4 0 72 a in the midstream plain and its planting proportion remained at 40 in the downstream desert the proportion of winter wheat was 23 increasing from 15 in 2000 to 29 2 33 2 km2 a in 2018 and was concentrated in the midstream plain in both years 25 3 km2 a the percentages of rice and alfalfa were 8 3 and 2 8 respectively rice and alfalfa increased from 38 5 to 43 7 and 12 5 13 0 respectively in the downstream desert their rates of increase were relatively fast 0 32 a 0 51 a maize and sunflower accounted for 7 0 and 2 7 respectively with similar planting structures in the midstream valley and plain and less than 1 in the downstream desert 3 2 2 2 climate meteorological factors directly affect the estimation of the cwr per unit area from 2000 2018 the average wind speed in the irrigation districts was 2 5 m s showing a significant increasing trend 0 06 m s p 0 05 while other meteorological factors showed an overall decreasing trend fig 10 the precipitation reached 313 6 mm showing a decreasing trend 0 98 mm a and generally remained at approximately 260 mm the temperature reached 14 7 c and the water vapor pressure was 0 95 kpa both with slight decreasing trends sunshine duration averaged 7 5 h day with an overall continuous and significant decreasing trend 0 03 h a in different regions wind speed showed a significant increasing trend p 0 05 reaching 3 0 m s in both the midstream plain and downstream desert 0 06 0 07 m s which was significantly higher than that in the midstream valley 1 7 m s the highest precipitation 402 0 mm was observed in the midstream plain which was significantly higher than that in the midstream valley 237 4 mm and downstream desert 275 0 mm the precipitation decreased in all irrigation districts except for the downstream desert where precipitation increased 2 14 mm a the temperatures in the midstream valley and plain were similar approximately 15 and significantly higher than those in the downstream desert 12 9 there was a decreasing trend in the midstream valley 0 06 a and the downstream desert 0 01 a the water vapor pressure decreases sequentially from upstream to downstream 1 05 kpa 0 89 kpa 0 74 kpa with no obvious change trend sunshine duration was between 7 and 8 h day and showed a similar decreasing trend everywhere 0 01 to 0 03 h day 3 2 2 3 analysis of water requirement drivers by assessing the response of tcwr to climate and crop area the driving mechanism of the variation in the tcwr was analysed the variation in tcwr under the influence of climate change was flat but crop area had a significant impact the degree of influence of crop area 380 million m3 a increased faster than that of climate 130 million m3 a fig 11 changes in crop area in the sdb play a dominant role in the tcwr and are strengthening focusing on adjusting the crop structure is important for water conservation in irrigation districts among the meteorological factors the tcwr was sensitive to changes in wind speed water vapor pressure and sunshine duration but the actual contribution of wind speed reached 27 47 followed by that of sunshine duration 11 4 the tcwr was not sensitive to temperature from 2000 to 2018 and its contribution was the lowest because there was no significant change in temperature after 2010 the contributions of wind speed and sunshine duration to tcwr increased significantly both exceeding 40 the sensitivity and contribution of cotton and winter wheat to tcwr were not high mainly due to the effective control of the cotton area and the proportion of its expansion although the winter wheat area expanded significantly the cwr of winter wheat was not sensitive to climate change rice had the highest sensitivity at 0 45 and its contribution was 19 2 which was due to the significant increase in its cwr with climate change table 8 the contribution of alfalfa maize and sunflower was approximately 7 8 and its effect on the change in tcwr was also more obvious this shows that although cotton and winter wheat were the major crops in the basin their contributions to the tcwr decreased and the expansion of rice alfalfa maize and sunflower areas led to a significant increase in the tcwr the contribution of these crop area factors to the tcwr increased significantly after 2010 with the contribution increasing between 40 and 50 among the different irrigation districts the wind speed contributed 43 22 to the tcwr in the downstream desert and approximately 23 00 to that in the midstream plain and valley the contribution of sunshine duration gradually increased from downstream to midstream ranging from 6 05 to 9 22 among the crop area factors cotton and winter wheat contributed less to the tcwr in each irrigation district while the contributions of rice and alfalfa were concentrated in the downstream desert reaching 36 69 and 13 77 respectively the contributions of maize and sunflower were concentrated in the midstream region with contributions ranging from 4 90 to 8 30 the degree of contribution to the tcwr increased significantly after 2010 which was consistent with the overall characteristics of the sdb 3 3 comparing water supply with requirement the water supply was analysed based on the runoff water release and water withdrawal at the basin scale however the water requirement was estimated from the aspect of the main crops there is presence of spatial scale inconsistency thus water supply was compared with requirements from the aspect of trend slope table 9 the runoff increased in midstream valley 0 34 billion m3 a and midstream plain 0 07 billion m3 a but the downstream desert showed a decreasing trend 0 06 billion m3 a after reservoir regulation there is a decreasing trend of water release in different regions 0 05 to 0 1 billion m3 a the water withdrawal in the midstream valley 0 07 billion m3 a and midstream plain 0 12 billion m3 a decreased accordingly but the downstream desert showed an increasing trend 0 11 billion m3 a because of local water shortages however the water requirement showed an increasing trend in different regions 0 05 0 08 billion m3 a although the runoff from upstream increases the water releases decrease after reservoir regulation and the actual water withdrawal decreases accordingly but the water requirement continuously increases thus there is a conflict between the water supply and requirement in the irrigation district water conservation strategies should be further proposed under future scenarios based on crop structure to cope with water scarcity 3 4 water conservation strategy under future scenarios based on crop structure although the variation in wind speed from 2000 to 2018 was the main driver of the increased cwr in the sdb temperature increase was the general trend of future climate change and was still an important driver of increased water requirements the temperature changes in the ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios from 2019 to 2030 were used to predict cwr based on the crop structure in the historical period a variety of crop structure optimization scenarios were applied to evaluate their water conservation effects 3 4 1 trends of cwr under temperature change scenarios the temperature in the sdb from 2019 to 2030 showed a warming trend the average temperature increased by 0 51 c and 0 94 c for the ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios respectively with an average increase of 0 22 c and 0 55 c in 2030 within the different irrigation districts the largest increase in temperature was found in the midstream plain reaching 0 52 c ssp126 and 0 94 c ssp245 followed by the downstream desert with temperature increases of 0 44 c ssp126 and 0 90 c ssp245 the midstream valley had an average temperature increase of 0 53 c under the ssp126 scenario but there was no significant change 0 05 c under the ssp245 scenario the crop area and structure of the basin vary significantly from year to year and its future tcwr is difficult to predict therefore the cwr was predicted the average increase in cwr was 9 mm and 7 mm in 2019 2030 for the ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios with changes ranging from 11 7 25 7 mm and 10 7 21 8 mm respectively fig 12 combining the results of two scenarios winter wheat increased by 11 3 mm followed by cotton at 8 8 mm and maize at 5 3 mm while rice showed a decrease in water requirement 1 97 mm and the water requirement of sunflower increased by only 1 43 mm in terms of trend rates those of winter wheat and rice increased by more than 1 mm a followed by cotton at 0 9 mm a and alfalfa maize and sunflower at 0 5 0 7 mm a the increase in the cwr for cotton and winter wheat was significant under the warming trend of the future decade overall crops with high water consumption rates and high planting proportions were significantly influenced by warming the increase in the midstream valley reached 12 0 mm 0 1 mm a under the ssp126 scenario and only 4 4 mm 1 3 mm a under the ssp245 scenario the midstream valley showed a similar change under both scenarios 9 10 mm 1 1 1 5 mm a the downstream desert showed a decrease under the ssp126 scenario 3 1 mm 1 1 mm a but maintained an increase under the ssp245 scenario 6 3 mm 0 6 mm a fig 13 under the ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios the spatial distribution of the high values of average cwr increased midstream and were generally between 0 and 20 mm in terms of the change trend the slope of the cwr under the ssp126 scenario was highly spatially heterogeneous with the highest increase rate of more than 2 mm a while most regions had change trends that were concentrated between 0 and 2 mm a 3 4 2 cropland structure optimization scenario and water conservation effect the water conservation effects of crop restructuring under the ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios were similar and the results were averaged under crop restructuring scenario 1 10 the most significant water conservation effect was in winter wheat restructuring with an average reduction in the cwr of 14 3 mm followed by cotton and rice with average reductions of 11 9 mm and 5 mm respectively and alfalfa maize and sunflower with reductions of approximately 1 mm table 10 under scenarios 2 and 3 the water conservation effect of crop restructuring for each crop type increased by 10 28 7 mm and 15 2 43 mm respectively based on the projected average increase in cwr by 8 mm and the range of variation between 11 7 and 25 7 mm for 2019 2030 the water conservation effect of crop restructuring under scenario 2 20 reached 10 28 7 mm which can cope with the impact of increased water requirements in irrigation districts due to future climate warming alfalfa maize and sunflower need to be adjusted more intensively to achieve the corresponding water conservation effect due to their low proportions among the different irrigation districts the best water conservation effect was achieved by adjusting the structure of cotton 13 6 30 7 mm and 13 5 48 2 mm and alfalfa 19 51 9 and 8 1 35 mm in the midstream valley and plain respectively the downstream desert with its high proportion of high water consuming crops saved 7 5 94 8 mm by adjusting cotton winter wheat and rice and saved 15 4 19 3 mm by adjusting alfalfa maize and sunflower structures therefore focusing on optimizing the structure of cotton winter wheat rice and alfalfa can achieve the desired water conservation effect 4 discussion climate water resources and crop area monitoring data were used to recognize the new features of water demand and requirements from 2000 to 2018 in the data scarce central asian basin the water supply and requirements at the basin and irrigation district scales in the sdb were analysed for the first time which is more systematic and representative than the existing regional and national scale studies based on model products that with limitations of resolution and precision moreover basin water resource analysis not only concentrates on mountainous runoff but also pays attention to the reservoir regulation among the central asian countries which is crucial to actual water supply in transboundary river water management based on the detailed crop data the major crop water requirements were quantified which can support the analysis of the driving mechanism in complex crop structures compared with previous studies the estimated cwr was slightly lower but the spatial and temporal distribution of cwr was consistent ruan 2020 tian 2020 xin et al 2021 conrad 2019 and 2013 meteorological station and crop area monitoring data were used instead of global scale grid products and the data quality was more reliable and accurate in portraying the change process of water demand this makes up for the lack of understanding of water supply and requirements in central asia a crop restructuring optimized scenario is proposed that increases the proportion of low water consuming crops to evaluate the water conservation strategies for coping with water scarcity as water management in transboundary rivers is difficult because of the complex political situation this is a practicable approach for coping with water scarcity in changing future environments from the perspective of countries themselves however the economic issues of crop restructuring also need to be considered there is a limitation of the study of water supply and requirement stress analysis the water supply was analysed based on the runoff water release and water withdrawal at the basin scale however the water requirement was estimated from the aspect of major crops there is presence of spatial scale inconsistency due to the inconsistency in the spatial scales of water supply and requirement data in the sdb the qualitative analysis of water supply and requirement stress was more suitable thus water supply was compared with requirements from the aspect of trend slope in future research further improvement of the basin water requirement estimation to support the water supply and requirement stress evaluation is necessary this study enhances the understanding of the water supply and requirement characteristics of the arid transboundary river of central asia but the contradiction between supply and requirement environmental impacts and agricultural development strategies in water utilization deserves in depth discussion 4 1 the contradiction between water supply and requirement the water resources in the sdb have increased significantly but the water withdrawal and agricultural sector water use after reservoir regulation is decreasing this result contradicts the significant increase in tcwr platonov et al 2008 mapped the water productivity of irrigated districts in the sdb based on etm imagery and showed that an increased crop yield improved the water use efficiency and reduced water stress to some extent conrad et al 2019 measured the irrigation efficiency midstream of the sdb from 2000 to 2017 based on remote sensing data and showed that the irrigation efficiency coefficient was 0 67 this was clearly higher than the irrigation efficiency 0 566 estimated by rost et al 2008 and the significant increase indicated that the water use efficiency had improved despite the conflict between the decreasing water supply and increasing requirement in the basin the improvement in water use efficiency such as irrigation efficiency fig 14 and water production efficiency eased the stress on water supply and requirement 4 2 environmental restoration helps relieve water stress land cover changes reflect the ecological security in central asia during 2001 2018 the sdb was dominated by grassland 298 400 km2 76 5 with less than 2 of its area made up of wetlands snow and ice water bodies and cities 9 4 made up farmland and 10 5 made up of bare land the increase in farmland mainly came from grassland 4600 6 km2 the area of forest 34 5 wetland 25 6 and water bodies 4 6 increased and bare land downstream decreased significantly 8 14 wu et al 2020 combined remote sensing and geographic information technology to determine that the ecological carrying capacity of the aral sea basin tended to improve during 2001 2018 the overall environment of the basin tended to improve compared to the historical period mainly due to the climate and the ecological water requirement did not negatively affect the agricultural water requirement in turn the ecological water requirement became less dependent on the water resources of the basin thus environmental restoration helps relieve water stress the state of the terminal lakes in an arid inland river basin is a direct representation of the ecological impact of agricultural water use the reduced water release in the downstream desert and significant increase in water requirement led to a decreasing trend in the water inflow of the north aral sea during 2000 2018 101 million m3 fig 15 the annual water inflow of the north aral sea is 6 billion m3 and after 2010 it stayed at a relatively low level 5 36 billion m3 despite the decrease in water inflow the north aral sea showed a continuous increasing trend in water level 0 16 m a area 36 4 km2 a and storage volume 400 million m3 a but after 2010 each parameter showed a decreasing trend in this period the water requirement of the sdb irrigation district reached its highest level therefore a large amount of water resources is still needed to flow downstream and into terminal lakes to maintain ecological and environmental security the utilization of water resources in the basin still needs to consider the balance between agricultural development and ecological restoration 4 3 priority development of winter wheat rotation the effective precipitation is the part of precipitation that directly meets the water requirement of crop growth and the shortage is supplemented by irrigation the effective precipitation plays an important role in the water supply especially during the growing period of winter wheat from 2000 2018 the annual effective precipitation in the irrigation districts was 240 1 mm and reached 130 6 mm from october to march table 11 the coupling degree between effective precipitation and tcwr was 11 7 during the growing period of major crops from april to september however the coupling degree between effective precipitation and tcwr reached 79 8 from october to march when winter wheat was planted karimov et al 2018 showed that the use of winter wheat instead of alfalfa cultivation in the irrigation district of the midstream valley released a large amount of water resources while the use of crop rotation could effectively reduce evaporation losses it is feasible to develop a crop rotation of winter wheat with other crops in the sdb and reduce the proportion of high water consuming crops such as cotton rice and alfalfa cotton has good economic value and reducing the cotton proportion will inevitably reduce the total productivity based on the statistical data the productivity per unit area of cotton and winter wheat rice are 2136 ha 1124 ha respectively table 12 combined with the cropland structure optimization scenario the adjustment of cotton structure 10 30 caused the obvious decline in total productivity 2 8 8 8 under scenarios 1 3 the adjustment of winter wheat structure 10 30 caused the decline of 1 6 and 3 2 in total productivity under scenarios 1 and 2 but the total productivity decline reached 4 7 under scenario 3 thus focusing on the winter wheat restructuring 20 and loss of acceptable productivity that can be solved by gradually improving water use efficiency to relief of water stress is practical and useful under water resource constraints priority development of winter wheat rotation is a practicable approach for improving water resource utilization efficiency and can be used to cope with the adverse impact on the relationship between water supply and requirements due to future climate change 5 conclusion based on the detailed meteorological hydrological and agricultural monitoring data in the data scarce arid transboundary river of central asia from 2000 to 2018 a systematic analysis of the spatial and temporal characteristics of water supply and requirements at basin and irrigation district scales in the sdb was conducted to identify the driving mechanisms apply climate and crop restructuring scenarios to predict water requirements and evaluate water conservation effects from 2019 to 2030 and propose an practical climate adaptation strategies based on crop structure to relieve water stress the main conclusions were as follows the runoff of the sdb increased by 7 45 billion m3 from 2000 to 2018 but the water supply after reservoir regulation decreased by 3 42 billion m3 unified water management is currently challenging to conduct and usually exceeds the water allocation plan that exacerbates the stress between water supply and requirement the tcwr was mainly derived from cotton winter wheat and rice and increased significantly by 3 15 billion m3 which was most sensitive to wind speed 27 5 and rice area 19 2 the contradiction of water supply and requirement caused water scarcity in the basin from 2019 2030 the water conservation effects of winter wheat 20 under the crop restructuring scenario reached 28 7 mm which helped relieve water stress under the scenario of a 0 51 0 91 c increase thus priority planting of a winter wheat rotation and low water consuming crops is a practicable approach for coping with water scarcity and adapting to climate change in arid transboundary rivers of central asia credit authorship contribution statement hongwei

9218,designing an efficient irrigation system on the farmland is a challenging issue which is dependent on many characteristics of the farmland in this paper the topographical and geometrical characteristics of the land are analyzed for designing an efficient furrow surface irrigation system the topographical characteristics of the farmland can be changed in the cultivation process so designing an efficient irrigation system requires modeling the last state of the topographical and geometrical characteristics of the land the proposed method uses the digital elevation model aspect of the slope and slope model of the land as topographical information and geometrical shape of the land as geometrical information it designs the irrigation system at the field level for delivering water from the inlet of the land to the plants and uses a two steps designing strategy first the algorithm segments the land based on the topographical characteristics and geometrical shape into some plots then the ditches network is designed based on the topographical data and the geometrical shape of the land for providing water to the head ditch of each plot the proposed method designs an efficient furrow irrigation system based on many well known metrics it was evaluated in an experimental field and compared with the traditional farmer designed irrigation system and two other normal irrigation systems the evaluation shows that the proposed method can improve efficiency by decreasing the used water and irrigation time by about 50 graphical abstract ga1 keywords furrow surface irrigation design topographical and geometrical information efficient irrigation system ditches network design data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the irrigation system has an important effect on agricultural productivity soil erosion and sustainability jorgensen 2015 usually to improve the quality of the irrigation system only the design parameters of the irrigation system are used for optimizing and designing akbari et al 2018 smith et al 2018 however the data of geographic information system gis such as topographical information is very effective and in many researches augmenting land data with gis data improves the results and efficiency faux 1997 jorgensen 2015 farmlands are usually wide areas and some important parameters of the land and soil can vary on different parts of them while these parameters are assumed fixed in irrigation design and simulation pazouki 2021a 2021b slope soil type and hydraulic coefficients of the land are some samples of these parameters pazouki 2021a jorgensen 2015 these parameters have important effect on quality of the irrigation system so using real non uniform value of these parameters on all parts of the land for designing an irrigation system can improve the quality of irrigation the simulation optimization models are convenient methods to provide optimal irrigation systems in the researches which use simulation optimization models usually the topographical and geometrical characteristics of the farmland are assumed uniform and fixed values are used for analyzing and designing pazouki 2021a 2021b akbari et al 2018 smith et al 2018 in akbari et al 2018 a simulation optimization model is proposed as edosim for designing and evaluating the surface irrigation system using the volume balance model in the edosim slope which is a topographical characteristic of the land is used as a fixed value in saberi et al 2020 a simulation optimization framework is proposed for designing a furrow surface irrigation in this paper flow rate furrow length and cut off time are given as decision variables and slope is used as an input variable which is fixed some software programs are developed for simulating the surface irrigation systems such as winsrfr bautista et al 2009b sirmod walker 2003 and surdev garcia 2014 also some studies use these software programs for analyzing and designing the irrigation system salahou et al 2018 bautista et al 2009a fadul et al 2020 mazarei et al 2020 in these studies the topographical and geometrical characteristics of the land are assumed uniform and a fixed value is used for these parameters in this paper a novel algorithm is proposed for designing an optimal irrigation system based on the topographical information of the land such as some digital surface models dsm of the land the proposed method uses the slope value map slope aspect map and digital elevation model of the whole land as topographical data it partitions the land to some plots where the topographical characteristics of each plot are fairly uniform the proposed method uses important parameters of the land and irrigation system for partitioning and designing an optimal irrigation system so land partitioning is one of the main parts of the proposed method land partitioning is used in some agricultural practices such as consolidation and land use overall land partitioning is performed by four methods in researches the previous researches use a region growing method which initializes some small regions in the land s block and then grow the initial regions to make partitions brookes 1997 touriño et al 2003 in some researches cell based and gis raster method is used for land partitioning which segments the land block to many small equal cells and merges cells for making partitions li and parrott 2016 demetriou et al 2013 in another method of the land partitioning the land block is divided by drawing some delimiter lines which are perpendicular of a predefined primary designed axis rosman 2012 hakli et al 2016 hakli and uğuz 2017 bijandi et al 2021 the last category of the land partitioning method uses some polygon segmentation algorithms such as thiessen or voronoi diagrams as demonstrated in demetriou et al 2013 also different searching algorithms are used to find best partitioning in researches such as binary search hakli et al 2016 genetic algorithm hakli and uğuz 2017 stewart and janssen 2014 li and parrott 2016 demetriou et al 2013 expert system demetriou et al 2012 heuristic algorithm touriño et al 2003 brookes 1997 and artificial bee colony bijandi et al 2021 each method has special characteristics region growing and cell raster methods are slow and time consuming while they can make smooth and freestyle shape partitions delimiter lines drawing method is fast but the shape of the partitions is restricted and polygon partitioning method has medium speed and can make a desirable freestyle shape in this proposed method polygon partitioning method based on the voronoi diagrams is used one of the similar and closed researches to this research is provided in the paper of bijandi et al 2021 in this paper a method is proposed for land consolidation which uses geometric topography shape irrigation efficiency of the land irrigation discharge crop pattern and soil type in this research the range of the dimensions of each subspace of the land which is called parcel are calculated based on the optimal irrigation efficiency the optimal irrigation is analyzed by winsrfr software based on the soil characteristics slope of the land and other required inputs of the winsrfr for analyzing after obtaining dimension range of the optimal parcels the land is partitioned based on the shape accessibility and topography of the parcels the topography is used to reduce erosion and earthwork volume of the land also in this research the cut and fill ratio is used as an objective to reduce earthwork in this research the rectangularity of the shape of the parcels is evaluated by the proposed index and an artificial bee colony algorithm is used for making optimal parcels based on all objectives the provided results of the experiments show that the proposed land partitioning method provides good quality the proposed method in this paper partitions the land to some plots for improving the irrigation efficiency and uses the elevation slope value and slope direction as a topographical data of the land also it simultaneously couples the optimal irrigation design of each plot while partitioning but the proposed method in the paper of bijandi et al 2021 partitions the land to some parcels for consolidating and uses the optimal irrigation design of the parcels sequentially after the partitioning process and uses value and direction of the slope indirectly for analyzing the irrigation efficiency as presented above in this paper a new method is provided for designing the optimal irrigation system the main innovation of the method is assuming that the topographical characteristics of the land are not uniform and then designing an irrigation system using three dsm models of the land other contribution of the method is partitioning the land to some plots based on the aspect direction slope of the land optimizing the irrigation system of each plot parallel to partitioning is another innovation of the method finally based on the digital elevation model of the land obtained plots and aspect direction of the slope of the land an optimal network of ditches from inlet of the land to the head ditch of each plot is designed this research shows that the effect of using actual topographical characteristics of the land on efficiency of the irrigation system is drastic and provides a novel algorithm for using this effective information in this paper a new method is proposed for designing an optimal irrigation system based on the differences of the topographical characteristics of the land the proposed method and the procedure of the designing are presented in section 2 then for evaluating the quality of the proposed method some experiments are performed on a real experimental field using the proposed method and two other methods and the obtained results are provided and analyzed in section 3 limitations and strengths of the proposed method are provided in section 3 2 and section 3 3 the summary of the proposed method quality evaluation results and future proposal are given in section 4 2 material and methods in this paper a method is proposed for designing an optimal irrigation system based on the high resolution topographical characteristics of the land the proposed method uses the slope of the land direction of the slope and the elevation of the land as topographical characteristics the method designs the irrigation system in two steps and just based on the furrow irrigation system first the land is partitioned to some plots based on the topographical characteristics irrigation efficiency and geometric constraints also an optimal furrow irrigation system is designed for each plot separately then an optimal ditches network is designed for distributing water between plots also the proposed algorithm is implemented by python language and using many packages such as django celery numpy deap fortin et al 2012 pymoo blank and deb 2020 lir fuzzylite rada vilela 2018 opencv shapely gillies et al 2007 pandas networkx hagberg et al 2008 multiprocessing and so on for overcoming the computational complexity problem of the algorithm a multi process and parallel process architecture is used for decreasing response time the details of the proposed method are given in the following 2 1 conceptual framework the overview of the proposed method is provided in fig 1 as mentioned above the main objective of the research is designing an optimal irrigation system based on the geometrical and topographical information of the land as shown in fig 1 the method has two main steps and a prerequisite step in which just required geometrical and topographical information of the land are extracted by a mobile app the main input variables of the proposed method as shown in fig 1 are slope value aspect of slope border of the land and elevation map of the land there is not any important threshold on spatial resolution of the used topographical models in this research but no need to mention that the better the spatial resolution the better the quality of the irrigation system also plots and the inlet input of each plot of the land are calculated in the first step of the algorithm and used as inputs in the second step and output variables of the proposed method are land partitioning plan to some plots and ditches network for delivering water to plots which are shown in fig 1 besides the goals which are considered for optimizing in the proposed method are reducing the used water and the total time of the irrigation also the proposed method should guarantee that the obtained irrigation system has desirable efficiency based on the common irrigation quality metrics such as application efficiency deep percolation ratio and tail water ratio as provided in pazouki 2021b the details of each step are provided in the following 2 2 land partitioning the topographical characteristics of the farmland have many important effects on the quality of the land s irrigation however the topographical characteristics of the farmland usually are not uniform in all parts of it and solving this problem is not typical among farmer as it requires especial tools time and money so in the proposed method an algorithm is introduced for partitioning the land to some plots which have fairly uniform topographical characteristics in this step of the method direction and value of the slope of the land are used as topographical characteristics the required topographical characteristics of the land are obtained using provided tools and method which is given in the paper of pazouki 2022 pazouki 2022 provides a smart app that uses global positioning system gps and other spatial sensors of the smartphone for calculating the high resolution topographical information of the land the proposed app has usable applicable and easy graphical user interface gui that guides farmer for grabbing some sample points of the land and then calculating three dsm models as the slope map the aspect of the slope map and the elevation map of the land this app is designed in such a way that its usage does not require a lot of specialized knowledge and farmers with the least knowledge about gis systems can use it partitioning starts by calculating number of preferred partitions number of the partitions is calculated based on the direction of the slope the map of aspect of slope which shows the direction slope of each point of the land is quantized by predefined resolution the coarse discretized aspect is clustered based on the value of the aspect for removing small clusters and making larger clusters a dilation morphological operation is performed on the clustered aspect map then connected components of the clustered aspect are extracted and number of obtained connected components is used as the number of plot for partitioning also the land points of each connected component are extracted which are used on the following of the algorithm an evolutionary algorithm based on the polygon partitioning algorithm which is called voronoi diagrams is used for extracting optimal plots as shown in fig 2 the genotype of the algorithm is an array of integer with length equal to the number of plots so each gen of the chromosome is related to one plot and one cluster of the aspect of the slope which is described above and value of the gen shows the index of a point of the related cluster so each chromosome shows list of points of obtained clusters from the aspect of the slope and these points are used as input points to the voronoi diagram and polygons which are made using voronoi diagram are plots of the land partitioning also the value of the gen start from 1 which means some clusters can be ignored in partitioning some objectives are important for evaluating plots and obtaining optimal plots so in the proposed method a multi objective evolutionary algorithm is used the method uses a well known multi object optimization algorithm non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga2 which is provided by deb et al 2002 for extracting optimal plots the method uses four objectives for evaluating partitioning to obtain optimal plots as geometric shape aspect uniformity irrigation efficiency and total irrigation time the details of these objectives are provided in the following the geometric shape objective is used as a rectangularity criteria which is calculated using eq 1 1 r e c t c r b r a r e a p l a r e a where br area is the area of the largest interior rectangle in polygon and pl area is the area of the polygon for finding the largest interior rectangle the provided algorithm by marzeh et al 2019 is used the rectcr is between 0 and 1 and should be maximized for optimizing partitioning the aspect uniformity is obtained by calculating in three steps first the list of unique aspect values which exist on the obtained polygon is extracted as asp u second the percentage of each unique aspect value based on the whole aspect values of the polygon is calculated as asppercent third the maximum of the percentage of the aspect value is calculated as maxasppercent then the aspect uniformity is calculated by eq 2 2 a s p c o h i 1 a s p u c m a x a s p p e r c e n t a s p p e r c e n t i a s p u c where asp uc is the number of unique aspects which are exist on the obtained plot the aspcoh is between 0 and 100 and should be maximized for optimizing partitioning the irrigation efficiency of the plot is obtained using the single objective mode of the method which is proposed in the paper of pazouki 2021a and the objective value of the best obtained irrigation system for each plot is used as an irrigation efficiency this objective should be maximized for optimizing partitioning the total irrigation time is calculated by adding the total irrigation time of each plot which is obtained based on the best irrigation system of that plot using provided method by pazouki 2021a this objective should be minimized for optimizing partitioning as mentioned above the proposed partitioning algorithm which uses a multi objective optimization algorithm provides some partitioning solutions of the land to the plots as a pareto front of the problem each obtained solution provides some plots of the land as an irrigation system for completing the design of the irrigation system a network of ditches is needed for distributing water between plots so in the following of the method an efficient ditches network is designed for each provided solution and the final irrigation system is selected based on the quality of the partitioning solution and ditches network design the proposed algorithm for designing ditches network is provided in the following 2 3 ditches network design after extracting plots in the first step of the proposed method in the second step an optimal ditches network is designed for delivering water from land inlet to the ditch head of the plots for starting this section of the proposed method a list of the inlet points of the plots head ditch should be extracted the head ditch of each plot is obtained by extracting the largest interior rectangle of the plot s polygon and then using the mean aspect of the slope of the plot for extracting cross and main slope based on the obtained main and cross slope the side of the interior rectangle of the plot which is usable for head ditch is obtained then based on the elevation map of the land which is used as a topographical data of the land the inlet point of the obtained head ditch is determined the inlet point of all plots which are given in partitioning is extracted and used as an input for designing the ditches network for designing optimal ditches network of plots a directed graph data structure is used as a model of the solution the obtained inlet points of the head ditches and inlet point of the land are used as nodes of the graph and edges show the topology of the network for finding optimal ditches network four objectives and two constraints are introduced so the defined optimization problem is a constrained multi objective optimization problem with complex data structure the evolutionary algorithm is an effective tool for solving this problem eiben and smith 2015 in this section of the proposed method a multi objective evolutionary algorithm is introduced for solving the problem as mentioned a directed graph data structure is used as a phenotype of the solutions regarding some requirements of the ditches network the inlet point of the land only delivers the water to the plots and should not receive any water from other plots and each inlet head ditch can receive only one input but can deliver many outputs the genotype of the problem is designed as an array of integer the length of the chromosome is equal to the number of plots and each gen corresponds to one plot where the value of the gen shows the index of the plot that deliver water to the corresponding plot of the gen the value of each gen is an integer between zero to the number of plots the detail representation of the proposed algorithm is shows in fig 3 for decoding each chromosome to the network s graph first one node is made for inlet of the land then same as the number of plots new nodes are inserted to the graph finally based on the value of gens in the chromosome the edges between nodes are inserted and the ditches network is obtained as mentioned above the proposed optimization algorithm has two constraints and four objectives two constraints control that the network s graph does not have loop and also does not contain sub graph the first objective counts the sum of the out degree of all nodes and should be minimized the second objective calculates the shortest path between inlet node of the land and each inlet node of the plots as meter which should be minimized the third objective calculates sum of difference of the elevation between start point and end point of each edge and should be maximized the fourth objective calculates the sum of fewest angle between each edge of the graph and the aspect of the main or cross slope of the plot and should be minimized in the fourth objective the angle between the direction of the ditch which is corresponding of each edge of the network s graph and the aspect of the main slope and the aspect of the cross slope are calculated and the least value is used in the proposed algorithm a well known multi object optimization algorithms nsga2 is used for extracting optimal ditches network the result of the proposed algorithm is the list of solutions as a pareto front of the multi objective problems the best solution from this list is obtained by first using user defined weights for objectives then calculating single objective value and finally selecting the best solution of the list based on this single objective value as an optimal ditches network for each partitioning 2 4 experimental field for evaluating the proposed method an experiment is performed on the real field the information of the experimental field is provided in table 1 as location area

and effectiveness of the proposed method are examined by some experiments in this section the obtained results and the detailed analysis of findings are provided 3 1 results the topographical and geometrical models of the experimental field are presented in fig 5 as shown in the figures the experimental field has a rectangular geometric shape the aspect of the slope model of the field which is provided in fig 5a shows that the experimental field has divers aspect of slope on different parts of the land the color bar legend of the figure provides the main aspect of each part of the land the figure shows that main aspects of the land are south and south west also the elevation model of the land which is provided in fig 5c shows that the land has some problems when it comes to efficient irrigation and needs a suitable irrigation system the statistical characteristics of the topographical information of the land are provided in table 3 as shown the land has great standard deviation on the elevation and aspect value which shows the critical characteristics of the land for irrigating in the following the proposed algorithm is used for designing a suitable irrigation system for this land in the first step of the proposed method the aspect of the slope of the land is quantized and clustered based on the introduced algorithm as shown in table 2 the quantization is performed by five bin numbers and four clusters are obtained which are shown in fig 6 based on the obtained clusters and max area of each plot the candidate plot number is obtained as 10 plots where the first cluster contains six candidate plots fourth cluster contains two candidate plots and others contain one candidate plot therefore in the first step of the proposed algorithm 10 candidate plots are obtained for land partitioning and the points of each plot are extracted which are used in the second step of the method in the second step of the method the plots of the land are obtained as mentioned above a multi objective evolutionary algorithm is used for extracting the optimal plots the parameters of the plot extraction algorithm are provided in table 2 as shown in rows 8 17 of table 2 different parameters are used for designing the irrigation system for analyzing the irrigation efficiency of plots in the plot design algorithm low values are used for decreasing time and computational complexity however somewhat the quality of efficiency analysis reduce after obtaining the final plots for evaluating precise efficiency of the irrigation system of the plots the greater values are used for parameters in table 4 the statistical analysis of the objectives of the last generation of the partitioning algorithm are provided the partitioning algorithm uses four objectives as shape rectangularity aspect uniformity irrigation efficiency and irrigation s total time the shape rectangularity controls the shape of each plot which is created in partitioning and is between 0 not rectangular shape and 1 rectangular shape the shape rectangularity provides minimum shape rectangularity value of plots for each partitioning so the statistical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm finds a partitioning that its plots have at least 0 53 rectangularity the drawings of these partitioning are provided in fig 7a and fig 8a as shown in fig 8a the largest interior rectangles which is found for each plot have the maximum coverage of plots also the high standard deviation of the shape rectangularity shows that the final solution of the multi objective algorithm provides a partitioning by a wide variety rectangularity the statistical analysis of the aspect uniformity shows that all provided partitioning have the same aspect uniformity as 23 33 aspect uniformity shows the average uniformity of the aspect of the slope of plots for each partitioning the statistical analysis of the irrigation efficiency shows that the obtained results have good irrigation efficiency and the low standard deviation shows high irrigation efficiency of all partitioning solutions the total irrigation time of the obtained solutions have wide variety from 12 59 h to 578 402 h also high standard deviation shows diverse irrigation time of the solutions in the fig 7 partitioning of the land based on four different objectives are provided in fig 7a obtained partitioning based on the aspect rectangularity is shown in fig 7b a partitioning for reducing total time of the irrigation is provided as shown in this figure the long side of the plots the furrow of the irrigation system is designed on long side direction is designed in the main slope of the land so the total irrigation time is reduced in fig 7d the partitioning is obtained based on an uniform fusion of all objectives as shown in drawings the plots have rectangular shape and the direction of the long side of the plots and the size of the plots are optimized based on all objectives in the third and last step of the method the optimal ditches network is designed for distributing water on the designed plots the parameters of this step of the algorithm are provided on table 2 in fig 8 the structure of the head ditches of the obtained plots which are shown in fig 7 are provided the start point of the head ditches are inputs of the ditches network design algorithm in each plot top or left side of the largest interior rectangle is selected as the head ditch after selecting head ditch the inlet point of the head ditch is selected based on the elevation information of the land in fig 9 the red points are inlet points of the plots these points are input of the ditches network design algorithm in table 5 the statistical analysis of the objective values of the last generation of the ditches network design algorithm is provided this algorithm uses four objectives to find the optimal ditches network the first objective is out degree which shows sum of the number of output ditch from each distribution point of the network the statistical analysis shows that the final obtained networks have 71 67 average output ditches and high standard deviation shows that the final networks have wide variety of the output ditch numbers from distribution points second objective is the sum of shortest distance between the inlet point of the land and the inlet point of the head ditches which should be minimized for increasing efficiency of the network the statistical analysis shows that the provided networks have about 168 m distance averagely which is desirable for a land with 240 m length and 160 m width third objective is the average of the elevation difference between end point and start point of each ditch which should be minimized and have a negative value to optimize the network the statistical analysis shows that averagely the end point of each ditch is 0 55 m deeper than the start point of the ditch as provided in table 5 the average length of the ditches is about 168 m and the average height difference between the start point and the end point of the ditches is 0 55 m so the average slope of the ditches is about 0 33 and based on the advice of the farmer this slope is desirable for ditches in this land fourth objective is angle difference between the direction of the ditch and the aspect direction of the main or cross slope of the land which should be minimized for improving the flow of the water in the ditches the statistical analysis shows that averagely the obtained networks have about 98 degrees difference which is not desirable and the expected value is less than 45 degrees however the high standard deviation and the value of the minimum which is about 31 degrees show that the resulted networks have a wide variety of angle difference so the desirable network can be found in the obtained results in fig 9 the best designed ditches networks for plot partitioning which are provided in fig 7 are shown the provided ditches network of each partitioning is selected by weighted fusing of the four objectives the weights are 0 2 0 3 0 3 and 0 2 for four objectives respectively the inlet point of the land is shown in fig 9 the inlet point of each plot is represented by a red circle and end point of each head ditch is shown by a blue circle the ditches which start from land inlet point are shown by a red line and the ditches which start from other plots are shown by a blue line and the flow direction of the water of each ditch is shown by an arrow on the ditch line as shown in these figures the proposed algorithm uses all topographical information of the land for designing optimal ditches network as an example in fig 9d a central plot is used for distributing the water between other plots and the direction of the ditches are designed based on the aspect and elevation model of the land which are provided in fig 5 also comparing this figure by fig 10 which is the farmer designed ditches network shows that using central region of the land is an appropriate strategy for designing ditches network of the experimental land for comparing the efficiency of the irrigation system which is designed by the proposed method with other methods some experiments are performed on a real experimental field using the proposed method and two other methods and the obtained results are provided in table 6 in fig 10 the irrigation ditches network of the experimental field which is designed by the farmer in the field and used for irrigating the land is provided as shown in the figure the land is partitioned into four plots which are similar nearly the farmer uses eight main ditches for distributing water on the land as the land has complex topography the farmer uses some ditches in two opposite direction for reaching the water on the plots as provided in table 6 the farmer designed irrigation system needs 1522 minutes time and 3015 7 cubic meter water for irrigating the land thoroughly the water inlet of the land which is used by the farmer in first irrigation practice of the land is about 1 91 m 3 m i n which is calculated by the proposed procedure in the paper of peterson and cromwell 1993 in this method as shown in fig 11 two points in the main intake channel are selected something that can float on the water is put in the start point and time of its travel to the end point is measured then based on the distance of the two points cross sectional area of the channel and the time of the traveling the discharge of the water to the land is calculated this measurement is repeated three times in irrigation interval then based on the discharge value and the irrigation time the used water in the real field is calculated for evaluating the efficiency of the proposed method the efficiency of the designed irrigation system using proposed method is compared with two other models and real irrigation system which is used by the farmer these two methods are provided in pazouki 2021a and pazouki 2021b these methods use a simulation optimization algorithm for designing an efficient irrigation system but these methods assume that the land has regular surface and use some parameters such as width and length of the land soil characteristics of the land water discharge to the land the slope of the land and so on in this research the parameters of the real experimental field where it is assumed that the land had regular surface and an average value of the slope of the real field is used as the global slope of the land are given to these methods and two irrigation systems are obtained then the efficiency of the provided irrigation systems by these methods are compared with the obtained irrigation system by proposed method this comparison shows that the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to two effective methods in the regular fields the main goal of this comparison is showing that the proposed method can reach the efficiency of the irrigation system in the regular surface lands the efficiency of the irrigation systems are analyzed by seven metrics which consider many aspects of the irrigation system in table 6 the results of comparison are provided the practical model and fuzzy model use normal common and uniform topographical model of the land and design a normal irrigation system for the land the real system is designed by the farmer based on the historical knowledge about the experimental land the proposed model uses real topographical model of the land the obtained results show that the proposed algorithm provides an efficient irrigation system based on the efficiency metrics such as e a dpr twr fuzzyobjective and labor which is desirable based on the optimal designs of the practical and fuzzy models the efficiency metrics show that the proposed algorithm can provide an irrigation system fairly close to the design of the normal land by similar geometric soil and water resource and requirements the comparison results based on the total used water and total time of the irrigation show that the proposed method improves by about 50 the quality of the irrigation system based on the resource usage the proposed method uses the topographical information beside other required information such as soil geometric water needs and input resources characteristics for designing irrigation system and obtained improvement is the result of this extra information which has critical effect on the irrigation system efficiency this information is used for calculating objectives in each partitioning plan by a simulation algorithm which is provided in pazouki 2021a this simulation algorithm uses effective characteristics of the land and irrigation system for simulating the performance of the irrigation system and calculating two important objectives as irrigation efficiency and total irrigation time the characteristics which are used are provided in table 2 such as kostiakov coefficients that are obtained based on the soil type of the land and using well known references such as walker 1989 and walker and skogerboe 1987 3 2 discussion the main goal of the proposed method is using topographical and geometrical information for designing an optimal irrigation system so for showing the efficiency of the proposed method in the experiment a land is selected that has a drastic surface irregularity the farmer of the selected land had many problems for irrigating the land in the last 15 years the obtained results as shown in table 3 show that the land has critical characteristics for irrigating and it is suitable for showing the efficiency of the proposed method first finding concluded from obtained results is the effectiveness and usefulness of the spatial topographical and geometrical information for designing the irrigation system this finding supports the importance of the uniformity which is considered in the theories and models of the surface irrigation design walker 2003 1989 walker and skogerboe 1987 second finding is the quality of the proposed method for using the topographical and geometrical information for designing an irrigation system the two steps design algorithm that optimized the partitioning and ditches network simultaneously is a good strategy for designing an irrigation system also the proposed objectives such as the sum of the out degree of ditches network s graph the shortest path between inlet of the land and inlet of each plot geometrical shape aspect uniformity irrigation efficiency and total irrigation time use the fusion of geometrical and topographical information for designing an optimal irrigation system perfectly as mention above the proposed method focuses on two types of surface irregularity as changing the slope value and changing the aspect of the slope of the land and it also provides a partitioning plan that partitions land to the plots with regular surface characteristics also the method uses two thresholds as a maximum and a minimum area of the provided plot which are presented in table 2 so if the land has some regular segments while its area is between these thresholds the proposed method provides a better irrigation system however if the land has complex irregularity that includes small regular segments the performance of the proposed method decreases on the other hand the farmer has an important issue to address which is non uniformity of the depth of the infiltration and its effects on plants growth and yield the main factor of this issue is the diversity of the slope in one plot the advance time and the velocity of the water change by change of the slope in different part of one furrow which causes non uniform infiltration but in the proposed method by partitioning based on the topographical information the obtained plots have a small diversity of slope so the infiltration becomes more uniform the dpr and e a values of the proposed method which are shown in table 6 represent this claim as these values are very closed to the values of these metrics for two other practical and fuzzy methods that assume the land has uniform slope also the proposed method can be coupled with the topographical extracting app which is used in this research and provides an useful easy and economical method for solving or reducing surface irregularity effects beside other methods such as laser land leveling 3 3 limitations and strengths the proposed method has some limitations that can be addressed in next researches the main limitation of the proposed method is applicability of the obtained irrigation system in a real field as mentioned above the provided ditches network which is designed by the proposed method just provides the connectivity sequence of the head ditches of different plots while the exact route of the water supply ditches that connect the plots is not given and the proposed algorithm doesn t use agricultural machinery considerations thoroughly so the first extending of this research could be proposing a geometric and spatial algorithm that design a detail route of ditches that support provided sequences by this research and machinery considerations as in this research the machinery considerations and detail route of the ditches network are not focused so the drainage network is overlooked while it has important effect on efficiency of the irrigation system so another important extending could be designing the drainage of each plot and also providing optimal drainage network for managing runoff perfectly by introducing other geometric characteristics of the plots plots with more regular shapes are provided the main strength of the proposed method which is its main difference with similar ones such as akbari et al 2018 smith et al 2018 saberi et al 2020 pazouki 2021a and pazouki 2021b is uniformity assumption of topographical characteristics of the farmland in other methods the topographical characteristics such as slope are assumed uniformed and fixed and the irrigation system is designed based on this assumption but in the proposed method the topographical characteristics are dynamic and the irrigation system is designed using precise topographical information another strength of the proposed method is designing a ditches network that distributes water between plots of the land in the same time of designing the irrigation system of the land other considerable strength of the proposed method is providing a sequence of algorithms and procedures that can solve the defined problem of this research which has a large search space in an acceptable time and provide optimal results 4 conclusion in this paper a method is proposed for designing an optimal surface irrigation system for delivering water from inlet of the land to the plants based on the topographical and geometrical characteristics of the land in the proposed method value and aspect of the slope and the elevation model of the land are used as topographical characteristics and the shape of the land is used as a geometrical characteristic this research proposes a method for fusing geometrical topographical and common factors of an irrigation system for designing an optimal irrigation system the main concept of this research is designing an efficient irrigation system for lands that have drastic irregular surface by using extra information of the topographical state of the land the experiments show that the proposed method can design an irrigation system better than the farmer that has about 15 years of farming experience on the land also the importance of the topographical and geometrical information for improving the quality of the irrigation system is shown by this research the proposed method uses a two steps designing strategy that optimizes partitioning and ditches network simultaneously obtained results show the efficiency of this strategy findings of this study show that the topographical uniformity of the land has a drastic effect on the performance of the irrigation system which is supported by theories and models of the irrigation system design so using the topographical information of the land for designing an efficient irrigation system is very important but usually this type of information is not accessible by the farmers based on this study where the farmland has drastic irregularity if applicable the farmer should correct the topographical irregularities of the land using common land leveling methods and if inapplicable the farmer should take into account intuitive considerations of the topographical characteristics of the land in partitioning the land into different plots in this way the performance of the irrigation system can be significantly improved also the proposed method is included in an app that extracts the topographical characteristics of the land and the obtained smart app can be used for designing an optimal irrigation system by general audiences through just a smartphone and a brief tutorial in the future this smart app will be accessible on the general app stores the quality of the proposed method is analyzed by some experiments in the experiments the topographical and geometrical characteristics of the land are extracted after land leveling stage of the soil cultivation then the efficiency of the designed irrigation system by the proposed method and the irrigation system which is used by the farmer as the historical and experimental knowledge are compared also two other irrigation design methods which use common information of the land are used for evaluating the proposed algorithm the comparison shows that the proposed method can improve the efficiency of the irrigation system by reducing the used water and the total time of irrigation by about 50 relative to the traditional designed irrigation system and normal designed irrigation system which don t use topographical information however the proposed method has some limitations the main ones is applicability of the obtained irrigation system in the real land in other words some spatial geometrical and machinery considerations should be taken in to account for improving applicability of the output of the proposed method that can be considered in the future researches declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9218,designing an efficient irrigation system on the farmland is a challenging issue which is dependent on many characteristics of the farmland in this paper the topographical and geometrical characteristics of the land are analyzed for designing an efficient furrow surface irrigation system the topographical characteristics of the farmland can be changed in the cultivation process so designing an efficient irrigation system requires modeling the last state of the topographical and geometrical characteristics of the land the proposed method uses the digital elevation model aspect of the slope and slope model of the land as topographical information and geometrical shape of the land as geometrical information it designs the irrigation system at the field level for delivering water from the inlet of the land to the plants and uses a two steps designing strategy first the algorithm segments the land based on the topographical characteristics and geometrical shape into some plots then the ditches network is designed based on the topographical data and the geometrical shape of the land for providing water to the head ditch of each plot the proposed method designs an efficient furrow irrigation system based on many well known metrics it was evaluated in an experimental field and compared with the traditional farmer designed irrigation system and two other normal irrigation systems the evaluation shows that the proposed method can improve efficiency by decreasing the used water and irrigation time by about 50 graphical abstract ga1 keywords furrow surface irrigation design topographical and geometrical information efficient irrigation system ditches network design data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the irrigation system has an important effect on agricultural productivity soil erosion and sustainability jorgensen 2015 usually to improve the quality of the irrigation system only the design parameters of the irrigation system are used for optimizing and designing akbari et al 2018 smith et al 2018 however the data of geographic information system gis such as topographical information is very effective and in many researches augmenting land data with gis data improves the results and efficiency faux 1997 jorgensen 2015 farmlands are usually wide areas and some important parameters of the land and soil can vary on different parts of them while these parameters are assumed fixed in irrigation design and simulation pazouki 2021a 2021b slope soil type and hydraulic coefficients of the land are some samples of these parameters pazouki 2021a jorgensen 2015 these parameters have important effect on quality of the irrigation system so using real non uniform value of these parameters on all parts of the land for designing an irrigation system can improve the quality of irrigation the simulation optimization models are convenient methods to provide optimal irrigation systems in the researches which use simulation optimization models usually the topographical and geometrical characteristics of the farmland are assumed uniform and fixed values are used for analyzing and designing pazouki 2021a 2021b akbari et al 2018 smith et al 2018 in akbari et al 2018 a simulation optimization model is proposed as edosim for designing and evaluating the surface irrigation system using the volume balance model in the edosim slope which is a topographical characteristic of the land is used as a fixed value in saberi et al 2020 a simulation optimization framework is proposed for designing a furrow surface irrigation in this paper flow rate furrow length and cut off time are given as decision variables and slope is used as an input variable which is fixed some software programs are developed for simulating the surface irrigation systems such as winsrfr bautista et al 2009b sirmod walker 2003 and surdev garcia 2014 also some studies use these software programs for analyzing and designing the irrigation system salahou et al 2018 bautista et al 2009a fadul et al 2020 mazarei et al 2020 in these studies the topographical and geometrical characteristics of the land are assumed uniform and a fixed value is used for these parameters in this paper a novel algorithm is proposed for designing an optimal irrigation system based on the topographical information of the land such as some digital surface models dsm of the land the proposed method uses the slope value map slope aspect map and digital elevation model of the whole land as topographical data it partitions the land to some plots where the topographical characteristics of each plot are fairly uniform the proposed method uses important parameters of the land and irrigation system for partitioning and designing an optimal irrigation system so land partitioning is one of the main parts of the proposed method land partitioning is used in some agricultural practices such as consolidation and land use overall land partitioning is performed by four methods in researches the previous researches use a region growing method which initializes some small regions in the land s block and then grow the initial regions to make partitions brookes 1997 touriño et al 2003 in some researches cell based and gis raster method is used for land partitioning which segments the land block to many small equal cells and merges cells for making partitions li and parrott 2016 demetriou et al 2013 in another method of the land partitioning the land block is divided by drawing some delimiter lines which are perpendicular of a predefined primary designed axis rosman 2012 hakli et al 2016 hakli and uğuz 2017 bijandi et al 2021 the last category of the land partitioning method uses some polygon segmentation algorithms such as thiessen or voronoi diagrams as demonstrated in demetriou et al 2013 also different searching algorithms are used to find best partitioning in researches such as binary search hakli et al 2016 genetic algorithm hakli and uğuz 2017 stewart and janssen 2014 li and parrott 2016 demetriou et al 2013 expert system demetriou et al 2012 heuristic algorithm touriño et al 2003 brookes 1997 and artificial bee colony bijandi et al 2021 each method has special characteristics region growing and cell raster methods are slow and time consuming while they can make smooth and freestyle shape partitions delimiter lines drawing method is fast but the shape of the partitions is restricted and polygon partitioning method has medium speed and can make a desirable freestyle shape in this proposed method polygon partitioning method based on the voronoi diagrams is used one of the similar and closed researches to this research is provided in the paper of bijandi et al 2021 in this paper a method is proposed for land consolidation which uses geometric topography shape irrigation efficiency of the land irrigation discharge crop pattern and soil type in this research the range of the dimensions of each subspace of the land which is called parcel are calculated based on the optimal irrigation efficiency the optimal irrigation is analyzed by winsrfr software based on the soil characteristics slope of the land and other required inputs of the winsrfr for analyzing after obtaining dimension range of the optimal parcels the land is partitioned based on the shape accessibility and topography of the parcels the topography is used to reduce erosion and earthwork volume of the land also in this research the cut and fill ratio is used as an objective to reduce earthwork in this research the rectangularity of the shape of the parcels is evaluated by the proposed index and an artificial bee colony algorithm is used for making optimal parcels based on all objectives the provided results of the experiments show that the proposed land partitioning method provides good quality the proposed method in this paper partitions the land to some plots for improving the irrigation efficiency and uses the elevation slope value and slope direction as a topographical data of the land also it simultaneously couples the optimal irrigation design of each plot while partitioning but the proposed method in the paper of bijandi et al 2021 partitions the land to some parcels for consolidating and uses the optimal irrigation design of the parcels sequentially after the partitioning process and uses value and direction of the slope indirectly for analyzing the irrigation efficiency as presented above in this paper a new method is provided for designing the optimal irrigation system the main innovation of the method is assuming that the topographical characteristics of the land are not uniform and then designing an irrigation system using three dsm models of the land other contribution of the method is partitioning the land to some plots based on the aspect direction slope of the land optimizing the irrigation system of each plot parallel to partitioning is another innovation of the method finally based on the digital elevation model of the land obtained plots and aspect direction of the slope of the land an optimal network of ditches from inlet of the land to the head ditch of each plot is designed this research shows that the effect of using actual topographical characteristics of the land on efficiency of the irrigation system is drastic and provides a novel algorithm for using this effective information in this paper a new method is proposed for designing an optimal irrigation system based on the differences of the topographical characteristics of the land the proposed method and the procedure of the designing are presented in section 2 then for evaluating the quality of the proposed method some experiments are performed on a real experimental field using the proposed method and two other methods and the obtained results are provided and analyzed in section 3 limitations and strengths of the proposed method are provided in section 3 2 and section 3 3 the summary of the proposed method quality evaluation results and future proposal are given in section 4 2 material and methods in this paper a method is proposed for designing an optimal irrigation system based on the high resolution topographical characteristics of the land the proposed method uses the slope of the land direction of the slope and the elevation of the land as topographical characteristics the method designs the irrigation system in two steps and just based on the furrow irrigation system first the land is partitioned to some plots based on the topographical characteristics irrigation efficiency and geometric constraints also an optimal furrow irrigation system is designed for each plot separately then an optimal ditches network is designed for distributing water between plots also the proposed algorithm is implemented by python language and using many packages such as django celery numpy deap fortin et al 2012 pymoo blank and deb 2020 lir fuzzylite rada vilela 2018 opencv shapely gillies et al 2007 pandas networkx hagberg et al 2008 multiprocessing and so on for overcoming the computational complexity problem of the algorithm a multi process and parallel process architecture is used for decreasing response time the details of the proposed method are given in the following 2 1 conceptual framework the overview of the proposed method is provided in fig 1 as mentioned above the main objective of the research is designing an optimal irrigation system based on the geometrical and topographical information of the land as shown in fig 1 the method has two main steps and a prerequisite step in which just required geometrical and topographical information of the land are extracted by a mobile app the main input variables of the proposed method as shown in fig 1 are slope value aspect of slope border of the land and elevation map of the land there is not any important threshold on spatial resolution of the used topographical models in this research but no need to mention that the better the spatial resolution the better the quality of the irrigation system also plots and the inlet input of each plot of the land are calculated in the first step of the algorithm and used as inputs in the second step and output variables of the proposed method are land partitioning plan to some plots and ditches network for delivering water to plots which are shown in fig 1 besides the goals which are considered for optimizing in the proposed method are reducing the used water and the total time of the irrigation also the proposed method should guarantee that the obtained irrigation system has desirable efficiency based on the common irrigation quality metrics such as application efficiency deep percolation ratio and tail water ratio as provided in pazouki 2021b the details of each step are provided in the following 2 2 land partitioning the topographical characteristics of the farmland have many important effects on the quality of the land s irrigation however the topographical characteristics of the farmland usually are not uniform in all parts of it and solving this problem is not typical among farmer as it requires especial tools time and money so in the proposed method an algorithm is introduced for partitioning the land to some plots which have fairly uniform topographical characteristics in this step of the method direction and value of the slope of the land are used as topographical characteristics the required topographical characteristics of the land are obtained using provided tools and method which is given in the paper of pazouki 2022 pazouki 2022 provides a smart app that uses global positioning system gps and other spatial sensors of the smartphone for calculating the high resolution topographical information of the land the proposed app has usable applicable and easy graphical user interface gui that guides farmer for grabbing some sample points of the land and then calculating three dsm models as the slope map the aspect of the slope map and the elevation map of the land this app is designed in such a way that its usage does not require a lot of specialized knowledge and farmers with the least knowledge about gis systems can use it partitioning starts by calculating number of preferred partitions number of the partitions is calculated based on the direction of the slope the map of aspect of slope which shows the direction slope of each point of the land is quantized by predefined resolution the coarse discretized aspect is clustered based on the value of the aspect for removing small clusters and making larger clusters a dilation morphological operation is performed on the clustered aspect map then connected components of the clustered aspect are extracted and number of obtained connected components is used as the number of plot for partitioning also the land points of each connected component are extracted which are used on the following of the algorithm an evolutionary algorithm based on the polygon partitioning algorithm which is called voronoi diagrams is used for extracting optimal plots as shown in fig 2 the genotype of the algorithm is an array of integer with length equal to the number of plots so each gen of the chromosome is related to one plot and one cluster of the aspect of the slope which is described above and value of the gen shows the index of a point of the related cluster so each chromosome shows list of points of obtained clusters from the aspect of the slope and these points are used as input points to the voronoi diagram and polygons which are made using voronoi diagram are plots of the land partitioning also the value of the gen start from 1 which means some clusters can be ignored in partitioning some objectives are important for evaluating plots and obtaining optimal plots so in the proposed method a multi objective evolutionary algorithm is used the method uses a well known multi object optimization algorithm non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga2 which is provided by deb et al 2002 for extracting optimal plots the method uses four objectives for evaluating partitioning to obtain optimal plots as geometric shape aspect uniformity irrigation efficiency and total irrigation time the details of these objectives are provided in the following the geometric shape objective is used as a rectangularity criteria which is calculated using eq 1 1 r e c t c r b r a r e a p l a r e a where br area is the area of the largest interior rectangle in polygon and pl area is the area of the polygon for finding the largest interior rectangle the provided algorithm by marzeh et al 2019 is used the rectcr is between 0 and 1 and should be maximized for optimizing partitioning the aspect uniformity is obtained by calculating in three steps first the list of unique aspect values which exist on the obtained polygon is extracted as asp u second the percentage of each unique aspect value based on the whole aspect values of the polygon is calculated as asppercent third the maximum of the percentage of the aspect value is calculated as maxasppercent then the aspect uniformity is calculated by eq 2 2 a s p c o h i 1 a s p u c m a x a s p p e r c e n t a s p p e r c e n t i a s p u c where asp uc is the number of unique aspects which are exist on the obtained plot the aspcoh is between 0 and 100 and should be maximized for optimizing partitioning the irrigation efficiency of the plot is obtained using the single objective mode of the method which is proposed in the paper of pazouki 2021a and the objective value of the best obtained irrigation system for each plot is used as an irrigation efficiency this objective should be maximized for optimizing partitioning the total irrigation time is calculated by adding the total irrigation time of each plot which is obtained based on the best irrigation system of that plot using provided method by pazouki 2021a this objective should be minimized for optimizing partitioning as mentioned above the proposed partitioning algorithm which uses a multi objective optimization algorithm provides some partitioning solutions of the land to the plots as a pareto front of the problem each obtained solution provides some plots of the land as an irrigation system for completing the design of the irrigation system a network of ditches is needed for distributing water between plots so in the following of the method an efficient ditches network is designed for each provided solution and the final irrigation system is selected based on the quality of the partitioning solution and ditches network design the proposed algorithm for designing ditches network is provided in the following 2 3 ditches network design after extracting plots in the first step of the proposed method in the second step an optimal ditches network is designed for delivering water from land inlet to the ditch head of the plots for starting this section of the proposed method a list of the inlet points of the plots head ditch should be extracted the head ditch of each plot is obtained by extracting the largest interior rectangle of the plot s polygon and then using the mean aspect of the slope of the plot for extracting cross and main slope based on the obtained main and cross slope the side of the interior rectangle of the plot which is usable for head ditch is obtained then based on the elevation map of the land which is used as a topographical data of the land the inlet point of the obtained head ditch is determined the inlet point of all plots which are given in partitioning is extracted and used as an input for designing the ditches network for designing optimal ditches network of plots a directed graph data structure is used as a model of the solution the obtained inlet points of the head ditches and inlet point of the land are used as nodes of the graph and edges show the topology of the network for finding optimal ditches network four objectives and two constraints are introduced so the defined optimization problem is a constrained multi objective optimization problem with complex data structure the evolutionary algorithm is an effective tool for solving this problem eiben and smith 2015 in this section of the proposed method a multi objective evolutionary algorithm is introduced for solving the problem as mentioned a directed graph data structure is used as a phenotype of the solutions regarding some requirements of the ditches network the inlet point of the land only delivers the water to the plots and should not receive any water from other plots and each inlet head ditch can receive only one input but can deliver many outputs the genotype of the problem is designed as an array of integer the length of the chromosome is equal to the number of plots and each gen corresponds to one plot where the value of the gen shows the index of the plot that deliver water to the corresponding plot of the gen the value of each gen is an integer between zero to the number of plots the detail representation of the proposed algorithm is shows in fig 3 for decoding each chromosome to the network s graph first one node is made for inlet of the land then same as the number of plots new nodes are inserted to the graph finally based on the value of gens in the chromosome the edges between nodes are inserted and the ditches network is obtained as mentioned above the proposed optimization algorithm has two constraints and four objectives two constraints control that the network s graph does not have loop and also does not contain sub graph the first objective counts the sum of the out degree of all nodes and should be minimized the second objective calculates the shortest path between inlet node of the land and each inlet node of the plots as meter which should be minimized the third objective calculates sum of difference of the elevation between start point and end point of each edge and should be maximized the fourth objective calculates the sum of fewest angle between each edge of the graph and the aspect of the main or cross slope of the plot and should be minimized in the fourth objective the angle between the direction of the ditch which is corresponding of each edge of the network s graph and the aspect of the main slope and the aspect of the cross slope are calculated and the least value is used in the proposed algorithm a well known multi object optimization algorithms nsga2 is used for extracting optimal ditches network the result of the proposed algorithm is the list of solutions as a pareto front of the multi objective problems the best solution from this list is obtained by first using user defined weights for objectives then calculating single objective value and finally selecting the best solution of the list based on this single objective value as an optimal ditches network for each partitioning 2 4 experimental field for evaluating the proposed method an experiment is performed on the real field the information of the experimental field is provided in table 1 as location area

and effectiveness of the proposed method are examined by some experiments in this section the obtained results and the detailed analysis of findings are provided 3 1 results the topographical and geometrical models of the experimental field are presented in fig 5 as shown in the figures the experimental field has a rectangular geometric shape the aspect of the slope model of the field which is provided in fig 5a shows that the experimental field has divers aspect of slope on different parts of the land the color bar legend of the figure provides the main aspect of each part of the land the figure shows that main aspects of the land are south and south west also the elevation model of the land which is provided in fig 5c shows that the land has some problems when it comes to efficient irrigation and needs a suitable irrigation system the statistical characteristics of the topographical information of the land are provided in table 3 as shown the land has great standard deviation on the elevation and aspect value which shows the critical characteristics of the land for irrigating in the following the proposed algorithm is used for designing a suitable irrigation system for this land in the first step of the proposed method the aspect of the slope of the land is quantized and clustered based on the introduced algorithm as shown in table 2 the quantization is performed by five bin numbers and four clusters are obtained which are shown in fig 6 based on the obtained clusters and max area of each plot the candidate plot number is obtained as 10 plots where the first cluster contains six candidate plots fourth cluster contains two candidate plots and others contain one candidate plot therefore in the first step of the proposed algorithm 10 candidate plots are obtained for land partitioning and the points of each plot are extracted which are used in the second step of the method in the second step of the method the plots of the land are obtained as mentioned above a multi objective evolutionary algorithm is used for extracting the optimal plots the parameters of the plot extraction algorithm are provided in table 2 as shown in rows 8 17 of table 2 different parameters are used for designing the irrigation system for analyzing the irrigation efficiency of plots in the plot design algorithm low values are used for decreasing time and computational complexity however somewhat the quality of efficiency analysis reduce after obtaining the final plots for evaluating precise efficiency of the irrigation system of the plots the greater values are used for parameters in table 4 the statistical analysis of the objectives of the last generation of the partitioning algorithm are provided the partitioning algorithm uses four objectives as shape rectangularity aspect uniformity irrigation efficiency and irrigation s total time the shape rectangularity controls the shape of each plot which is created in partitioning and is between 0 not rectangular shape and 1 rectangular shape the shape rectangularity provides minimum shape rectangularity value of plots for each partitioning so the statistical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm finds a partitioning that its plots have at least 0 53 rectangularity the drawings of these partitioning are provided in fig 7a and fig 8a as shown in fig 8a the largest interior rectangles which is found for each plot have the maximum coverage of plots also the high standard deviation of the shape rectangularity shows that the final solution of the multi objective algorithm provides a partitioning by a wide variety rectangularity the statistical analysis of the aspect uniformity shows that all provided partitioning have the same aspect uniformity as 23 33 aspect uniformity shows the average uniformity of the aspect of the slope of plots for each partitioning the statistical analysis of the irrigation efficiency shows that the obtained results have good irrigation efficiency and the low standard deviation shows high irrigation efficiency of all partitioning solutions the total irrigation time of the obtained solutions have wide variety from 12 59 h to 578 402 h also high standard deviation shows diverse irrigation time of the solutions in the fig 7 partitioning of the land based on four different objectives are provided in fig 7a obtained partitioning based on the aspect rectangularity is shown in fig 7b a partitioning for reducing total time of the irrigation is provided as shown in this figure the long side of the plots the furrow of the irrigation system is designed on long side direction is designed in the main slope of the land so the total irrigation time is reduced in fig 7d the partitioning is obtained based on an uniform fusion of all objectives as shown in drawings the plots have rectangular shape and the direction of the long side of the plots and the size of the plots are optimized based on all objectives in the third and last step of the method the optimal ditches network is designed for distributing water on the designed plots the parameters of this step of the algorithm are provided on table 2 in fig 8 the structure of the head ditches of the obtained plots which are shown in fig 7 are provided the start point of the head ditches are inputs of the ditches network design algorithm in each plot top or left side of the largest interior rectangle is selected as the head ditch after selecting head ditch the inlet point of the head ditch is selected based on the elevation information of the land in fig 9 the red points are inlet points of the plots these points are input of the ditches network design algorithm in table 5 the statistical analysis of the objective values of the last generation of the ditches network design algorithm is provided this algorithm uses four objectives to find the optimal ditches network the first objective is out degree which shows sum of the number of output ditch from each distribution point of the network the statistical analysis shows that the final obtained networks have 71 67 average output ditches and high standard deviation shows that the final networks have wide variety of the output ditch numbers from distribution points second objective is the sum of shortest distance between the inlet point of the land and the inlet point of the head ditches which should be minimized for increasing efficiency of the network the statistical analysis shows that the provided networks have about 168 m distance averagely which is desirable for a land with 240 m length and 160 m width third objective is the average of the elevation difference between end point and start point of each ditch which should be minimized and have a negative value to optimize the network the statistical analysis shows that averagely the end point of each ditch is 0 55 m deeper than the start point of the ditch as provided in table 5 the average length of the ditches is about 168 m and the average height difference between the start point and the end point of the ditches is 0 55 m so the average slope of the ditches is about 0 33 and based on the advice of the farmer this slope is desirable for ditches in this land fourth objective is angle difference between the direction of the ditch and the aspect direction of the main or cross slope of the land which should be minimized for improving the flow of the water in the ditches the statistical analysis shows that averagely the obtained networks have about 98 degrees difference which is not desirable and the expected value is less than 45 degrees however the high standard deviation and the value of the minimum which is about 31 degrees show that the resulted networks have a wide variety of angle difference so the desirable network can be found in the obtained results in fig 9 the best designed ditches networks for plot partitioning which are provided in fig 7 are shown the provided ditches network of each partitioning is selected by weighted fusing of the four objectives the weights are 0 2 0 3 0 3 and 0 2 for four objectives respectively the inlet point of the land is shown in fig 9 the inlet point of each plot is represented by a red circle and end point of each head ditch is shown by a blue circle the ditches which start from land inlet point are shown by a red line and the ditches which start from other plots are shown by a blue line and the flow direction of the water of each ditch is shown by an arrow on the ditch line as shown in these figures the proposed algorithm uses all topographical information of the land for designing optimal ditches network as an example in fig 9d a central plot is used for distributing the water between other plots and the direction of the ditches are designed based on the aspect and elevation model of the land which are provided in fig 5 also comparing this figure by fig 10 which is the farmer designed ditches network shows that using central region of the land is an appropriate strategy for designing ditches network of the experimental land for comparing the efficiency of the irrigation system which is designed by the proposed method with other methods some experiments are performed on a real experimental field using the proposed method and two other methods and the obtained results are provided in table 6 in fig 10 the irrigation ditches network of the experimental field which is designed by the farmer in the field and used for irrigating the land is provided as shown in the figure the land is partitioned into four plots which are similar nearly the farmer uses eight main ditches for distributing water on the land as the land has complex topography the farmer uses some ditches in two opposite direction for reaching the water on the plots as provided in table 6 the farmer designed irrigation system needs 1522 minutes time and 3015 7 cubic meter water for irrigating the land thoroughly the water inlet of the land which is used by the farmer in first irrigation practice of the land is about 1 91 m 3 m i n which is calculated by the proposed procedure in the paper of peterson and cromwell 1993 in this method as shown in fig 11 two points in the main intake channel are selected something that can float on the water is put in the start point and time of its travel to the end point is measured then based on the distance of the two points cross sectional area of the channel and the time of the traveling the discharge of the water to the land is calculated this measurement is repeated three times in irrigation interval then based on the discharge value and the irrigation time the used water in the real field is calculated for evaluating the efficiency of the proposed method the efficiency of the designed irrigation system using proposed method is compared with two other models and real irrigation system which is used by the farmer these two methods are provided in pazouki 2021a and pazouki 2021b these methods use a simulation optimization algorithm for designing an efficient irrigation system but these methods assume that the land has regular surface and use some parameters such as width and length of the land soil characteristics of the land water discharge to the land the slope of the land and so on in this research the parameters of the real experimental field where it is assumed that the land had regular surface and an average value of the slope of the real field is used as the global slope of the land are given to these methods and two irrigation systems are obtained then the efficiency of the provided irrigation systems by these methods are compared with the obtained irrigation system by proposed method this comparison shows that the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to two effective methods in the regular fields the main goal of this comparison is showing that the proposed method can reach the efficiency of the irrigation system in the regular surface lands the efficiency of the irrigation systems are analyzed by seven metrics which consider many aspects of the irrigation system in table 6 the results of comparison are provided the practical model and fuzzy model use normal common and uniform topographical model of the land and design a normal irrigation system for the land the real system is designed by the farmer based on the historical knowledge about the experimental land the proposed model uses real topographical model of the land the obtained results show that the proposed algorithm provides an efficient irrigation system based on the efficiency metrics such as e a dpr twr fuzzyobjective and labor which is desirable based on the optimal designs of the practical and fuzzy models the efficiency metrics show that the proposed algorithm can provide an irrigation system fairly close to the design of the normal land by similar geometric soil and water resource and requirements the comparison results based on the total used water and total time of the irrigation show that the proposed method improves by about 50 the quality of the irrigation system based on the resource usage the proposed method uses the topographical information beside other required information such as soil geometric water needs and input resources characteristics for designing irrigation system and obtained improvement is the result of this extra information which has critical effect on the irrigation system efficiency this information is used for calculating objectives in each partitioning plan by a simulation algorithm which is provided in pazouki 2021a this simulation algorithm uses effective characteristics of the land and irrigation system for simulating the performance of the irrigation system and calculating two important objectives as irrigation efficiency and total irrigation time the characteristics which are used are provided in table 2 such as kostiakov coefficients that are obtained based on the soil type of the land and using well known references such as walker 1989 and walker and skogerboe 1987 3 2 discussion the main goal of the proposed method is using topographical and geometrical information for designing an optimal irrigation system so for showing the efficiency of the proposed method in the experiment a land is selected that has a drastic surface irregularity the farmer of the selected land had many problems for irrigating the land in the last 15 years the obtained results as shown in table 3 show that the land has critical characteristics for irrigating and it is suitable for showing the efficiency of the proposed method first finding concluded from obtained results is the effectiveness and usefulness of the spatial topographical and geometrical information for designing the irrigation system this finding supports the importance of the uniformity which is considered in the theories and models of the surface irrigation design walker 2003 1989 walker and skogerboe 1987 second finding is the quality of the proposed method for using the topographical and geometrical information for designing an irrigation system the two steps design algorithm that optimized the partitioning and ditches network simultaneously is a good strategy for designing an irrigation system also the proposed objectives such as the sum of the out degree of ditches network s graph the shortest path between inlet of the land and inlet of each plot geometrical shape aspect uniformity irrigation efficiency and total irrigation time use the fusion of geometrical and topographical information for designing an optimal irrigation system perfectly as mention above the proposed method focuses on two types of surface irregularity as changing the slope value and changing the aspect of the slope of the land and it also provides a partitioning plan that partitions land to the plots with regular surface characteristics also the method uses two thresholds as a maximum and a minimum area of the provided plot which are presented in table 2 so if the land has some regular segments while its area is between these thresholds the proposed method provides a better irrigation system however if the land has complex irregularity that includes small regular segments the performance of the proposed method decreases on the other hand the farmer has an important issue to address which is non uniformity of the depth of the infiltration and its effects on plants growth and yield the main factor of this issue is the diversity of the slope in one plot the advance time and the velocity of the water change by change of the slope in different part of one furrow which causes non uniform infiltration but in the proposed method by partitioning based on the topographical information the obtained plots have a small diversity of slope so the infiltration becomes more uniform the dpr and e a values of the proposed method which are shown in table 6 represent this claim as these values are very closed to the values of these metrics for two other practical and fuzzy methods that assume the land has uniform slope also the proposed method can be coupled with the topographical extracting app which is used in this research and provides an useful easy and economical method for solving or reducing surface irregularity effects beside other methods such as laser land leveling 3 3 limitations and strengths the proposed method has some limitations that can be addressed in next researches the main limitation of the proposed method is applicability of the obtained irrigation system in a real field as mentioned above the provided ditches network which is designed by the proposed method just provides the connectivity sequence of the head ditches of different plots while the exact route of the water supply ditches that connect the plots is not given and the proposed algorithm doesn t use agricultural machinery considerations thoroughly so the first extending of this research could be proposing a geometric and spatial algorithm that design a detail route of ditches that support provided sequences by this research and machinery considerations as in this research the machinery considerations and detail route of the ditches network are not focused so the drainage network is overlooked while it has important effect on efficiency of the irrigation system so another important extending could be designing the drainage of each plot and also providing optimal drainage network for managing runoff perfectly by introducing other geometric characteristics of the plots plots with more regular shapes are provided the main strength of the proposed method which is its main difference with similar ones such as akbari et al 2018 smith et al 2018 saberi et al 2020 pazouki 2021a and pazouki 2021b is uniformity assumption of topographical characteristics of the farmland in other methods the topographical characteristics such as slope are assumed uniformed and fixed and the irrigation system is designed based on this assumption but in the proposed method the topographical characteristics are dynamic and the irrigation system is designed using precise topographical information another strength of the proposed method is designing a ditches network that distributes water between plots of the land in the same time of designing the irrigation system of the land other considerable strength of the proposed method is providing a sequence of algorithms and procedures that can solve the defined problem of this research which has a large search space in an acceptable time and provide optimal results 4 conclusion in this paper a method is proposed for designing an optimal surface irrigation system for delivering water from inlet of the land to the plants based on the topographical and geometrical characteristics of the land in the proposed method value and aspect of the slope and the elevation model of the land are used as topographical characteristics and the shape of the land is used as a geometrical characteristic this research proposes a method for fusing geometrical topographical and common factors of an irrigation system for designing an optimal irrigation system the main concept of this research is designing an efficient irrigation system for lands that have drastic irregular surface by using extra information of the topographical state of the land the experiments show that the proposed method can design an irrigation system better than the farmer that has about 15 years of farming experience on the land also the importance of the topographical and geometrical information for improving the quality of the irrigation system is shown by this research the proposed method uses a two steps designing strategy that optimizes partitioning and ditches network simultaneously obtained results show the efficiency of this strategy findings of this study show that the topographical uniformity of the land has a drastic effect on the performance of the irrigation system which is supported by theories and models of the irrigation system design so using the topographical information of the land for designing an efficient irrigation system is very important but usually this type of information is not accessible by the farmers based on this study where the farmland has drastic irregularity if applicable the farmer should correct the topographical irregularities of the land using common land leveling methods and if inapplicable the farmer should take into account intuitive considerations of the topographical characteristics of the land in partitioning the land into different plots in this way the performance of the irrigation system can be significantly improved also the proposed method is included in an app that extracts the topographical characteristics of the land and the obtained smart app can be used for designing an optimal irrigation system by general audiences through just a smartphone and a brief tutorial in the future this smart app will be accessible on the general app stores the quality of the proposed method is analyzed by some experiments in the experiments the topographical and geometrical characteristics of the land are extracted after land leveling stage of the soil cultivation then the efficiency of the designed irrigation system by the proposed method and the irrigation system which is used by the farmer as the historical and experimental knowledge are compared also two other irrigation design methods which use common information of the land are used for evaluating the proposed algorithm the comparison shows that the proposed method can improve the efficiency of the irrigation system by reducing the used water and the total time of irrigation by about 50 relative to the traditional designed irrigation system and normal designed irrigation system which don t use topographical information however the proposed method has some limitations the main ones is applicability of the obtained irrigation system in the real land in other words some spatial geometrical and machinery considerations should be taken in to account for improving applicability of the output of the proposed method that can be considered in the future researches declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9219,changes in rainfall patterns and increases in ambient air temperature i e warming are expected with climate change yet little information is available on how plant water status will respond to the combination of water deficit and increased air temperature in fruit tree species the objective of this study was to evaluate the individual responses of deficit irrigation and warming and their combination on plant water status during the late winter and spring in young olive trees two temperature and two irrigation levels were applied in open top chambers during the late winter and spring of 2018 and 2019 to two or three year old potted trees cv arbequina in 2018 coratina in 2019 the temperature levels were a near ambient control and a warming treatment that was 4 c above the control while the two irrigation levels were 100 and 50 of irrigation needs midday stem water potential ψs stomatal conductance net leaf photosynthesis transpiration and leaf temperature were measured periodically and the difference between leaf and air temperature δt was calculated the ψs generally decreased due to irrigation deficit and warming when applied individually when both treatments were combined an additive response was observed in contrast stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis were consistently decreased by deficit irrigation but were less affected by warming irrigation deficit did not affect leaf temperature under our experimental conditions as was expected warming most often increased leaf temperature but it also significantly decreased δt early in the season when leaf transpiration appeared to be greater due to warming the results indicate that modifications in water management with global warming will likely be required given the mostly negative individual or additive effects of irrigation deficit and air temperature on ψs and other variables keywords global warming irrigation olea europaea stem water potential stomatal conductance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change is expected to increase temperature and change rainfall patterns in many semi arid regions ipcc 2021 such changes will likely affect irrigation management in olive orchards and may negatively influence yields fereres et al 2011 furthermore the expansion of olive production towards regions with different climates from those of the mediterranean basin represents a challenge that requires a greater understanding of crop physiological and agronomic responses to the environment torres et al 2017 currently predictions on how carbon and water economy in olive orchards will be affected by multiple global change variables are based mostly on models used to simulate different climate scenarios in the mediterranean basin rather than experimental field studies e g tanasijevic et al 2014 lorite et al 2018 fraga et al 2020 mairech et al 2021 such models have often indicated that the potentially negative effects of higher temperatures and less rainfall on photosynthesis and yield may be ameliorated by a beneficial response to the rising global co2 concentration and by increasing irrigation amounts nevertheless a need to develop more sophisticated temperature sub models has been identified mairech et al 2021 thus far physiological leaf and whole plant responses to prolonged temperature increases have received little attention in olive trees the available experimental evidence under well watered conditions suggests some potential for maintaining leaf photosynthesis through thermal acclimation i e physiological and biochemical adjustments but less fruit and oil yield due to a change in carbon partitioning towards more vegetative growth miserere et al 2019a 2021 additionally water is a scarce resource in most olive growing regions and likely will not always be available in greater amounts for irrigation due to other water demands due to such concerns about water availability deficit irrigation has often been evaluated in olive trees see reviews by fernández 2014 brito et al 2019 deficit irrigation consists of applying less than 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc during certain phenological stages or throughout the growing season and often allows for reducing irrigation without important decreases in yields e g iniesta et al 2009 correa tedesco et al 2010 agüero alcaras et al 2021 for deficit irrigation to be implemented crop water status should be carefully measured to monitor the level of water stress direct methods for determining plant water status may include manual measurements of midday stem water potential ψs and stomatal conductance or continuous automatic measurements of sap flow and trunk diameter fluctuations fernández et al 2011 moriana et al 2012 agüero alcaras et al 2016 ahumada orellana et al 2019 additionally more indirect indicators of water status involving leaf temperature are often related to plant water status berni et al 2009 ben gal et al 2009 garcía tejero et al 2017 at the end of the winter and early spring large increases in evapotranspiration occur which requires either the start of irrigation or an increase in irrigation amount and frequency in the main olive growing regions of argentina most annual rainfall 100 400 mm occurs in the summer months and irrigation throughout the entire year is a common management practice rousseaux et al 2008 pierantozzi et al 2014 additionally average winter and spring temperatures in these growing regions are most often higher than those of the mediterranean basin searles et al 2011 torres et al 2017 finally although irrigation in the spring is important for avoiding reductions in flowering and fruit set hueso et al 2021 studies in the warm growing regions of argentina suggest that some level of deficit irrigation can be appropriate in the spring in order to reduce excessive vegetative growth and pruning costs without incurring yield reductions trentacoste et al 2019 pierantozzi et al 2020 compared to water deficit less information is available about the plant water status responses of olive trees to air temperature under field conditions some studies have provided estimations by taking measurements over the course of the season as temperature changes or comparing locations with different temperature regimes when the sap flow was measured at different times of the season it was found to increase strongly above an average daily air temperature of 13 c rousseaux et al 2009 in addition ψs showed a negative linear relationship with daily maximum temperature across several locations in southern spain corell et al 2016 to date whole plant warming experiments in olive trees have only been conducted at a limited number of locations in the mediterranean basin vuletin selak et al 2013 2014 benlloch gonzález et al 2018 2019 and in argentina miserere et al 2019a b 2021 2022 when warming the air by several degrees either earlier or reduced flowering intensity has been found depending on the location as well as reduced fruit size oil concentration and oil yield per tree at the leaf level photosynthesis was not affected by warming 4 c during the oil accumulation phase although increases in transpiration led to a decreased water use efficiency in warmed trees miserere et al 2021 sap flow of whole olive trees was greater after several months of warming than in control olive trees and there was some evidence of thermal acclimation over the course of the season in that sap flow was greater in warmed trees when measured at the same temperature as control trees towards the end of the season miserere et al 2019a unfortunately ψs was not measured in any of these previous studies given the complexities of climatic change there is a need for the simultaneous evaluation of multiple factors such as water deficit and warming under controlled experimental conditions suzuki et al 2014 jagadish et al 2021 a short heat shock exposure 2 h at 40 c under controlled conditions strongly reduced leaf relative water content in both young well irrigated and non irrigated olive trees while leaf photosynthesis was decreased more in the well irrigated trees araújo et al 2019 similarly although plant water status was not measured a natural heat wave of several days in italy with maximum daily temperature increasing from 31 c to 41 c decreased stomatal conductance and leaf photosynthesis in well irrigated potted olive trees but not in trees receiving a water deficit haworth et al 2018 nevertheless longer term warming studies with more moderate temperature increases that emulate the average temperature increase expected with global warming 2 4 c are still not available under different irrigation levels thus the objective of this study was to determine the individual and combined responses of plant water status related variables to deficit irrigation and moderate warming during the late winter and spring in young olive trees open top chambers otcs were used for warming 3 4 c with two irrigation and two temperature levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material the study was conducted during the late winter and spring of 2018 and 2019 i e mid august to late november at the experimental field station of crilar conicet in la rioja argentina 28 48 s latitude 66 56 w longitude 1325 m above sea level two year old olive trees of cv arbequina were used in 2018 and three year old trees of cv coratina were used in 2019 based on tree availability leaf gas exchange and biomass of these two cultivars have been previously shown to respond similarly to warming under our experimental conditions miserere et al 2021 2022 the trees were provided by a commercial nursery san gabriel la rioja argentina and they were transplanted at the field station into white 30 l plastic pots during the spring of 2017 the trees were then grown outdoors in their own nursery until used in the experiment the soil substrate was composed of sand peat and perlite 1 1 0 1 v v to obtain high water retention the trees were watered daily in the nursery using drip irrigation to meet their water requirements based on previously reported sap flow and soil evaporation estimates rousseaux et al 2009 precipitation is uncommon during the winter and spring in this region fertilization was carried out manually once a month with macronutrients 15 n 15 p 15 k 0 6 s and once a week from flowering to harvest with micronutrients 0 02 b by weight 0 01 cu 3 fe 1 mn 1 zn 0 007 mo nitrogen 2 8 magnesium 0 5 aminoquelant minors brometan spain the leaf area per tree was approximately 0 35 and 0 60 m2 at the beginning and end of the experiment in 2018 respectively in 2019 leaf area was 1 05 m2 at the beginning and 1 25 m2 at the end of the experiment flowering and thus fruit number was minimal the first year in the cv arbequina trees but was greater the second season in cv coratina flowering occurred in early october and pit hardening did not take place during the experimental periods 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experimental design was a completely randomized design with two levels of both irrigation equivalent to 100 and 50 of water consumed and air temperature a near ambient control and a warming treatment of 4 c there were four replicates n 4 of each of the following four treatment combinations 1 100 irrigation near ambient temperature control 100 tc 2 100 irrigation warming treatment 100 t 3 50 irrigation near ambient temperature control 50 tc and 4 50 irrigation warming treatment 50 t the entire experiment was conducted within 16 otcs including four otcs for each combination of irrigation and temperature each otc contained two potted olive trees that were placed within 30 cm deep wells to reduce soil heating one of the two temperature levels was assigned to each otc on approximately august 10 each year which coincided with the start of new leaf growth in late winter the near ambient controls tc had a target temperature of no more than 1 c above the ambient outdoor temperature while the warming treatment t had a target of 4 c above tc the chambers were cube shaped with dimensions of 2 0 m x 1 5 m x 1 5 m and the side walls were covered by 150 µm thick polyethylene premium thermal agrotileno pldt221510 agroredes argentina the structure and plastic walls of the otcs provided a similar microenvironment for both temperature levels including wind speed and light level miserere et al 2019b the tc otcs were passively heated by the polyethylene sidewalls to some degree and were ventilated from outside the chamber by air that was released 20 cm above ground level under an air baffle in the center of each otc the top of the tc otcs was completely open while the top of the t otcs was partially covered with clear acetate 80 µm thick to reduce the opening from 2 2 m2 to 0 8 m2 and increase heat retention as described in miserere et al 2019b two complementary heating systems were used for each t otc including 1 an external 6 m long plastic sleeve containing black painted stones that pulled heated air into each t otc and 2 an external electric heater with its own air ventilation system the air temperature inside each otc was recorded every 15 min with a data logger cavadevices buenos aires argentina by placing one temperature sensor tc1047s microchip inc china inside a protective solar radiation shield at tree canopy mid height 1 0 m the ambient outdoor air temperature was also measured in the neighboring tree nursery located 30 m from the otcs every 15 min at the same height lastly data from an on site weather station were used to determine absolute water vapor content in the air g m 3 and subsequently to calculate the relative air humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa for the given air temperature of each otc these values were verified by measuring rh every 15 min within one tc otc and one t otc on some days using humidity sensors honeywell model hih 4000 usa after determining that the heating systems were functioning properly the two irrigation levels were established on august 20 10 days after the start of warming irrigation of the two trees within each otc was applied using a pressurized drip irrigation system with a programmable electronic controller there were two drip emitters per tree with a drip rate of 1 2 l h 1 each for the otcs receiving 100 of water consumed and one emitter 1 2 l h 1 per tree for the otcs receiving deficit irrigation 50 of water consumed bubble wrap insulation covered with aluminum foil aislamax 10 mm thick buenos aires argentina was placed over both the soil surface and the drip emitters to reduce water loss and largely exclude any precipitation to determine the daily amount of water consumed two pots from each of the 100 tc and 100 t temperature levels were weighed in the morning on two consecutive days twice a week using a precision balance 10 g moretti model mpf buenos aires argentina irrigation was performed every 3 days to replace the water consumed the 50 tc and 50 t combinations received one half of the irrigation of their respective 100 irrigation counterparts 100 tc or 100 t in the second year the irrigation applied to each pot was increased by 4 in october 2019 to account for the increased plant weight associated with spring growth 2 3 volumetric soil water content ten cm long capacitance sensors echo 10 decagon devices usa were calibrated using two pots containing young olive trees before the start of the experiment two sensors per pot were inserted vertically at a depth of 5 15 cm and the pots were then watered to excess without any further irrigation soil samples of a known volume were then taken periodically and dried in a forced air oven at 105 c to obtain volumetric soil water content these water content values were compared against sensor voltage output to obtain a linear calibration relationship r2 0 81 field capacity 45 was determined 24 h after the watering and permanent wilting point 5 was approximated when the leaves of the potted trees became completely dry rapoport et al 2012 during the experiment one soil moisture sensor was installed in each pot and the sensors were connected to two 16 channel data loggers that recorded data hourly cavadevices buenos aires argentina the sensors were inserted vertically into the pots at a distance of 10 cm from the drip emitters at a depth between 5 and 15 cm from the soil data relative extractable water rew was calculated using the formula rew r rmin rmax rmin where r is the current volumetric water content rmin is the soil water content at the permanent wilting point and rmax is the soil water content at field capacity gómez del campo and fernández 2007 2 4 stem water potential midday stem water potential ψs was measured on five days during 2018 and seven days during 2019 the measurements were performed two days after irrigation on sunny days starting at solar noon 12 00 13 30 h solar time using a scholander type pressure chamber biocontrol model 0 8 mpa buenos aires argentina one young stem located near the main trunk was selected per otc n 16 and covered with a plastic bag and aluminum foil at least 60 min before the measurement to obtain an equilibrium between the water potential of the stem and that of the trunk additionally the water stress integral sψ mpa day during the treatment period was calculated this integral provides an estimation of cumulative water stress in each treatment combination compared to the maximum ψs which was measured near the beginning of spring the formula is sψ ψs c n where ψs is the average of midday stem water potential between two consecutive measurement dates c is the maximum ψs measured during the season and n is the number of days between measurements dates myers 1988 2 5 leaf gas exchange stomatal conductance gs was measured on the same dates as ψs using a porometer delta t devices model ap4 cambridge uk the measurements were performed during the morning 2 3 h before solar noon on three fully expanded leaves per otc the measured leaves were formed the previous growing season for the august september and early october measurements while leaves from the current season that formed during the treatment period were used in all subsequent measurements the gs values on each date were measured in four tc otcs followed by all 8 t otcs and then the last four tc otcs separate calibrations of the porometer were performed for the tc and t otcs briefly the procedure involved fitting a curve of water vapor diffusion through six sets of holes of increasing diameter contained on a standardized calibration plate for the given relative humidity and air temperature conditions of the tc or t otcs net leaf photosynthesis at light saturation amax and transpiration e were also measured using a portable photosynthesis system adc bioscientific model lcpro sd hoddesdon uk on three dates during the treatment period in 2018 and 2019 along with one date each year after the treatment period the measurements were performed during the morning 2 3 h before solar noon on one fully expanded leaf per otc the air temperature in the leaf chamber was maintained similar to that of the otc air temperature using a peltier cooling system and the measurement sequence was the same as that of the porometer each reading was taken on a known leaf area of 1 75 cm2 after reaching stable amax and e values about 1 min after placing the leaf in the chamber the flow rate in the system was 200 µmol s 1 and the photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd was greater than 1400 µmol m 2 s 1 for all measurements using natural ambient ppfd from amax and e the instantaneous water use efficiency wue was calculated as wue amax e although the portable photosynthesis system also calculates gs the porometer values are reported for this study because gs with the porometer was measured on a greater number of measurement dates and using more leaves to obtain more robust averages with lower variability both instruments recorded similar average gs values on most measurement dates 2 6 thermal imaging midday leaf temperature tleaf was determined on the same days and at approximately the same time 12 30 13 30 h solar time as the ψs measurements using images taken with an infrared thermal camera flir i40 flir systems usa 7 13 µm spectral range 120 120 pixels one image per otc was taken of well illuminated foliage on the west facing side of the tree canopy with a field of view of approximately 12 5 12 5 cm the temperature of 20 leaves per image was analyzed with each pixel corresponding to an effective temperature reading with an emissivity ε of 0 96 flir tools software version 5 13 17214 2001 based on tleaf and simultaneous measurements of air temperature in each otc the difference between leaf and air temperature was calculated δt tleaf tair the tair provided a reference for each image and was measured with a portable digital temperature unit hygropalm 2 rotronic ag ny usa 2 7 statistical analyses the potential effects of irrigation temperature and their interactions were determined for most variables ψs sψ gs amax e wue tleaf δt using standard factorial two way analyses of variance agricolae package r core team 2020 when statistically significant effects were detected differences among treatment means were assessed by tukey tests p 0 05 daily values of relative extractable water were evaluated using linear mixed effects anova models with irrigation temperature and their interactions as fixed factors and plot as a random factor nlme package r core team 2020 potential relationships between ψs as a function of tair variables were assessed using linear regression graphpad prism software lajolla ca usa 3 results 3 1 air temperature and irrigation the average daily air temperature for the treatment period was 3 9 c greater in the actively heated otcs t than in the control otcs tc in 2018 with averages of 23 9 c and 19 9 c respectively fig 1a similarly the air temperature was 3 2 c greater in the t otcs than in the tc otcs in 2019 22 3 c in t 19 1 c in tc fig 1b in both years the daily temperature within the tc otcs was within 1 0 c of the ambient outdoor temperature depending on the day the average air temperature in the tc otcs during the various plant measurements 09 30 13 30 solar time ranged from 21 5 to 34 2 c in 2018 and from 22 7 to 35 5 c in 2019 table 1 the temperature in the t otcs during the measurements was 4 3 and 4 4 c higher on average than in the tc otcs in 2018 and 2019 respectively relative air humidity was generally low 15 44 and was about 5 points lower in the t than the tc otcs the vpd was 2 91 and 4 00 kpa in the tc and t otcs respectively during the measurements in 2018 with slightly higher values 3 60 kpa in tc 4 9 kpa in t in 2019 there was a 36 difference in vpd between the tc and t otcs while the difference in air temperature was lower 15 the irrigation applied was 7 and 27 greater in 2018 and 2019 respectively in 100 t than in 100 tc based on the measurements of water consumed between consecutive days fig 2 the 50 t and 50 tc irrigation values were merely one half of each corresponding 100 irrigation level 3 2 soil relative extractable water and stem water potential as would be expected the rew for the entire treatment period during 2018 in cv arbequina was significantly lower in the 50 irrigation treatment combinations 50 tc 50 t than in the 100 irrigation combinations 100 tc 100 t with averages of 58 7 and 77 3 respectively p 0 05 table 2 similar average differences in rew between the 50 and 100 irrigation treatment combinations were found during 2019 in cv coratina for the entire period although there was high variability in daily rew values the lowest daily values 40 during the two years were generally recorded in the 50 irrigation treatment combinations fig 3 the rew values for the dates on which plant measurements were conducted were also significantly lower in the 50 irrigation treatment combinations in 2018 51 1 for 50 irrigation 69 2 for 100 irrigation p 0 05 with a similar tendency in 2019 61 1 for 50 irrigation 75 3 for 100 irrigation p 0 08 the water stress integral sψ for the entire treatment period showed significant responses to both irrigation and temperature in 2018 and 2019 table 2 the control combination 100 tc had the lowest sψ and the two t treatments 100 t 50 t had the highest sψ in both years as expected no decrease in midday stem water potential ψs due to irrigation was apparent at the beginning of the treatment period but a decrease in ψs occurred on most measurement dates under the 50 irrigation level under both temperature conditions tc t in 2018 and 2019 fig 4 both warming treatments 100 t 50 t had the most negative ψs values during most of 2018 and 2019 after the treatments finished no statistically significant differences in ψs were observed when measured either two months after the treatments in 2018 or 8 days after in 2019 the recovery measurements were delayed in 2018 due to an unexpected torrential downpour and flooding event that saturated the soil of many pots 3 3 stomatal conductance the 50 irrigation level had consistently lower gs values than the 100 irrigation level under both temperature regimes during the latter part of the treatment period in both years fig 5 when the air temperature was low early in the season sept 13 table 1 in 2019 gs was greater under the warmed treatments 100 t 50 t than under tc conditions fig 5b no consistent response to warming was observed when air temperature was higher the 100 t treatment showed significantly higher gs values compared to the other treatments on one date in 2018 fig 5a and t treatment combinations had lower gs values than their corresponding tc counterparts at each irrigation level on two dates in 2019 including the last date of the experimental period before recuperation was evaluated fig 5b in contrast to ψs gs was significantly lower at the 50 irrigation level than the 100 irrigation level when measured 8 days after full irrigation was restored in 2019 while gs showed no remaining effect of the temperature treatments 3 4 net photosynthesis and transpiration amax was also lower at the 50 irrigation level than the 100 level during the second half of the treatment period in both 2018 and 2019 fig 6a b decreases in e were not detected due to water deficit in 2018 but e was lower at the 50 irrigation level when measured on nov 15 and nov 29 in 2019 fig 6c d similar to gs both amax and e remained lower at the 50 irrigation level in 2019 when measured 8 days after irrigation was restored fig 6b d no significant effect of warming was observed on amax in 2018 fig 6a but e was higher in late winter due to warming fig 6c the t treatments also showed higher e as well as amax than the tc treatments early in the season in 2019 when air temperatures were fairly low fig 6b d as was observed for gs later in the season nov 29 at higher temperatures both amax and e decreased significantly under t compared to tc conditions but they were mostly recovered under t when measured 8 days after the treatment period in 2019 p 0 10 the wue amax e was not affected by irrigation in either year during the treatment period fig 6e f in contrast the wue was lower in t than in tc for the first three measurement dates of 2018 fig 6e although no significant differences were found for wue due to temperature in 2019 fig 6f 3 5 midday leaf and air temperature irrigation level did not significantly affect either midday tleaf or δt during the treatment period in either year fig 7 the tleaf showed no differences between tc and t at the beginning of the season but higher tleaf was observed in t for the remaining measurement dates during the treatment period in both years fig 7a b in contrast δt was significantly lower in t than in tc for both irrigation levels early in the season while statistical differences were most often not detected later in the season fig 7c d after the treatment period midday tleaf was similar in all treatments when determining the relationship between midday tair and tleaf during the treatment period the tleaf was lower for a given tair in the t treatments than in tc in both years fig 8 this difference was especially apparent at lower tair in 2018 fig 8a 3 6 relationships between stem water potential and air temperature the ψs was negatively related to midday air temperature with ψs decreasing as air temperature increased fig 9a b all of the treatment combinations were best fit to a single linear relationship in 2018 in cv arbequina r2 0 48 fig 9a in 2019 the relationship between midday air temperature and 100 tc r2 0 54 had a similar y intercept but a lower slope than the other three treatment combinations fig 9c in addition ψs was negatively related to midday leaf temperature in both years data not shown 4 discussion this is the first experimental study to assess the combination of deficit irrigation and warming in olive trees under natural temperature fluctuations over a prolonged period as has been reported previously for this otc design miserere et al 2019b active heating successfully increased daily tair by 3 4 c fig 1 which was accompanied by a moderate increase in vapor pressure deficit of about 35 in our continental andean region air temperatures are already higher than most olive growing regions searles et al 2011 hamze et al 2022 and regional climate models predict that aridity will increase by mid century zaninelli et al 2019 cabré and nuñez 2020 the cumulative irrigation applied was 7 and 27 greater during the experimental period in 2018 and 2019 respectively in the t otcs than in the near ambient control otcs based on measurements of water consumed in the pots fig 2 this confirms the postulated approach of nissim et al 2020 where young olive trees were irrigated one third more at a high temperature site than at a moderate temperature site with a daily average temperatures difference of about 7 c based on known evapotranspiration values at the two sites additionally reducing the irrigation by 50 of the water consumed in the well watered t and tc pots was sufficient enough to obtain a moderate decrease in soil rew table 2 fig 3 midday ψs is considered to be a good tool for monitoring plant water status and scheduling irrigation in olive and other fruit trees when the soil plant atmosphere continuum is properly considered moriana et al 2012 garcía tejera et al 2021 shackel et al 2021 in this study deficit irrigation and warming combined to reduce ψs fig 4 the lower ψs of the trees with deficit irrigation reflected the lower soil rew in the 50 treatments and warming further decreased ψs the decrease with the warming treatments is likely to be a function of the increased temperature accompanied by higher vpd in the t treatments experimental warming during the summer at our field location has previously been shown to increase whole tree sap flow and leaf transpiration on some measurement dates in young olive trees miserere et al 2019a 2021 which would lead to lower ψs once the irrigation was restored and trees were returned to ambient temperature conditions the ψs recovered to control values as has been observed in several studies agüero alcaras et al 2016 ahumada orellana et al 2017 martín palomo et al 2021 when expressed as water stress integral sψ the greatest sψ tended to be found in the 50 t treatment combination with about two thirds of the greater sψ being due to warming and only about one third being due to deficit irrigation table 2 the large response of sψ to warming shows the potential importance of warming 4 c with climate change under both well watered and water deficit conditions stomatal control regulates both water and co2 exchange in plants damour et al 2010 chaves et al 2016 and reductions in gs and amax have often been shown in olive leaves under deficit irrigation fernández et al 1997 moriana et al 2002 ahumada orellana et al 2019 as expected the gs and amax were consistently reduced in the latter half of the treatment period in both years at the 50 irrigation level fig 6 interestingly warming appeared to increase gs as well as amax and e near the beginning of spring on days with moderate ambient temperatures fig 5b 6 at this time it is likely that the air temperature in tc of slightly above 20 c was sub optimal for photosynthesis bongi et al 1987 diaz espejo et al 2006 later in the spring under higher temperatures the responses to warming showed both an increase in gs on one date in 2018 and some lower values in gs and amax in 2019 using gs values for an entire experimental period gs was not significantly related to air temperature in either year in the summer at our field location gs also did not show a consistent response to warming 4 c and amax was little affected miserere et al 2021 in contrast gs decreased in cv coratina above 30 c under controlled laboratory conditions but little decrease even up to 40 c was found in some other cultivars bongi et al 1987 a natural heat wave in italy with maximum temperatures about 10 c above normal drastically reduced gs and net photosynthesis under well watered conditions however they were not reduced when already low due to severe water stress haworth et al 2018 these results emphasize that the magnitude and duration of temperature increases as well as cultivar characteristics are likely to strongly affect plant responses as suggested by jagadish et al 2021 leaf age should also be carefully considered in further studies lastly in contrast to ψs the recovery of the gas exchange variables in 2019 eight days after irrigation and ambient temperature were restored was not complete for the water deficit trees which has also been reported by other authors see review by fernández et al 2014 ahumada orellana et al 2022 the use of thermal imagery as an indirect measurement of stress in olive trees is of considerable interest because of its potential use to monitor olive orchards by remote sensing sepulcre cantó et al 2006 berni et al 2009 when deficit irrigation leads to severe reductions in gs in olive leaves stomatal closure has been shown to result in an increase of about 2 c in the tree canopy temperature relative to the air temperature because leaf cooling is reduced garcía tejero et al 2017 in our study no significant increases in tleaf tair were found when moderate reductions in gs occurred in the 50 irrigation treatments fig 7c d the fairly small size of olive leaves and their lanceolate leaf shape have been suggested to strongly contribute to coupling with the surrounding air villalobos and lópez bernal 2017 thus detecting a moderate level of water stress may prove difficult in olive trees compared to some deciduous fruit trees with larger leaves in contrast the warmed treatments showed a lower tleaf tair than the near ambient temperature level in late winter and early spring when gs and e were sometimes greater in t fig 5b 6c d which could have contributed to leaf cooling in t later in the spring no clear differences between treatments in tleaf tair were apparent in either year understanding the relationships between environmental variables such as air temperature and plant water status is critical for crop water management in mediterranean spain a significant negative relationship was found between maximum daily air temperature and midday ψs in two out of three experimental orchards corell et al 2016 a recent study using a survey approach with data from several continents observed a similar negative relationship between midday vpd and ψs when soil moisture was not limiting shackel et al 2021 such relationships allow for scheduling irrigation based on atmospheric conditions in our study midday tair and ψs were also negatively related in both years fig 9 although different ψs vs tair relationships were not detected between temperature levels in 2018 fig 9a the t treatments had more negative values of ψs than the well watered temperature control 100 tc for a given midday tair in 2019 furthermore the tleaf of the warmed treatments was less than that of tc for the same tair in both years fig 8 these results suggest some degree of thermal acclimation to warming during the treatment period it may be that greater leaf cooling occurred for a given tair via leaf level or other adjustments which led to more negative ψs physiological variables have often been reported to acclimate to a new growth temperature in a number of species way et al 2013 vico et al 2019 whole tree sap flow previously showed some degree of thermal acclimation in warmed olive trees at our location with greater sap flow occurring in warmed than in control trees at a given tair after several months of warming in the summer and early fall miserere et al 2019a however it is recognized that increases in leaf transpiration were only detected in this study towards the beginning of spring when air temperatures were still fairly low fig 6b d the simultaneous evaluation of multiple factors such as water deficit and warming under experimental conditions can provide insight into crop function under climate change suzuki et al 2014 jagadish et al 2021 it is important to determine what plant response variables are affected by each factor and what the combined response is for example in our study gs was consistently reduced by a moderate water deficit while warming appeared to have a less pronounced effect on gs in contrast both water deficit and the 4 c warming during the spring combined additively to reduce ψs even though water deficit reduced transpiring plant leaf area in cv arbequina in 2018 in 2019 water deficit did not affect leaf area in cv coratina and warming did not significantly affect leaf area in either year in our study data not shown a temperature increase of 4 c could occur by 2100 if co2 emissions are little controlled ipcc 2021 increased irrigation could be used to mitigate the negative effects of water stress and warming on plant water status fraga et al 2020 but supplemental irrigation is unlikely to be available in all cases the combined responses to water deficit and warming may be most felt in small traditional orchards that are rain fed and do not have the possibility of obtaining supplemental irrigation increasing atmospheric co2 could ameliorate such effects through stomatal closure mairech et al 2021 and experimental studies combining co2 with other climate factors are urgently needed for olive trees 5 conclusions this is the first experimental study to assess the responses of olive trees during the spring to the combination of moderate deficit irrigation and warming 4 c under natural temperature fluctuations the results indicate that modifications in water management with global warming will likely be required given the mostly negative individual or additive effects of irrigation deficit and increased air temperature on ψs and other variables further

9219,changes in rainfall patterns and increases in ambient air temperature i e warming are expected with climate change yet little information is available on how plant water status will respond to the combination of water deficit and increased air temperature in fruit tree species the objective of this study was to evaluate the individual responses of deficit irrigation and warming and their combination on plant water status during the late winter and spring in young olive trees two temperature and two irrigation levels were applied in open top chambers during the late winter and spring of 2018 and 2019 to two or three year old potted trees cv arbequina in 2018 coratina in 2019 the temperature levels were a near ambient control and a warming treatment that was 4 c above the control while the two irrigation levels were 100 and 50 of irrigation needs midday stem water potential ψs stomatal conductance net leaf photosynthesis transpiration and leaf temperature were measured periodically and the difference between leaf and air temperature δt was calculated the ψs generally decreased due to irrigation deficit and warming when applied individually when both treatments were combined an additive response was observed in contrast stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis were consistently decreased by deficit irrigation but were less affected by warming irrigation deficit did not affect leaf temperature under our experimental conditions as was expected warming most often increased leaf temperature but it also significantly decreased δt early in the season when leaf transpiration appeared to be greater due to warming the results indicate that modifications in water management with global warming will likely be required given the mostly negative individual or additive effects of irrigation deficit and air temperature on ψs and other variables keywords global warming irrigation olea europaea stem water potential stomatal conductance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change is expected to increase temperature and change rainfall patterns in many semi arid regions ipcc 2021 such changes will likely affect irrigation management in olive orchards and may negatively influence yields fereres et al 2011 furthermore the expansion of olive production towards regions with different climates from those of the mediterranean basin represents a challenge that requires a greater understanding of crop physiological and agronomic responses to the environment torres et al 2017 currently predictions on how carbon and water economy in olive orchards will be affected by multiple global change variables are based mostly on models used to simulate different climate scenarios in the mediterranean basin rather than experimental field studies e g tanasijevic et al 2014 lorite et al 2018 fraga et al 2020 mairech et al 2021 such models have often indicated that the potentially negative effects of higher temperatures and less rainfall on photosynthesis and yield may be ameliorated by a beneficial response to the rising global co2 concentration and by increasing irrigation amounts nevertheless a need to develop more sophisticated temperature sub models has been identified mairech et al 2021 thus far physiological leaf and whole plant responses to prolonged temperature increases have received little attention in olive trees the available experimental evidence under well watered conditions suggests some potential for maintaining leaf photosynthesis through thermal acclimation i e physiological and biochemical adjustments but less fruit and oil yield due to a change in carbon partitioning towards more vegetative growth miserere et al 2019a 2021 additionally water is a scarce resource in most olive growing regions and likely will not always be available in greater amounts for irrigation due to other water demands due to such concerns about water availability deficit irrigation has often been evaluated in olive trees see reviews by fernández 2014 brito et al 2019 deficit irrigation consists of applying less than 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc during certain phenological stages or throughout the growing season and often allows for reducing irrigation without important decreases in yields e g iniesta et al 2009 correa tedesco et al 2010 agüero alcaras et al 2021 for deficit irrigation to be implemented crop water status should be carefully measured to monitor the level of water stress direct methods for determining plant water status may include manual measurements of midday stem water potential ψs and stomatal conductance or continuous automatic measurements of sap flow and trunk diameter fluctuations fernández et al 2011 moriana et al 2012 agüero alcaras et al 2016 ahumada orellana et al 2019 additionally more indirect indicators of water status involving leaf temperature are often related to plant water status berni et al 2009 ben gal et al 2009 garcía tejero et al 2017 at the end of the winter and early spring large increases in evapotranspiration occur which requires either the start of irrigation or an increase in irrigation amount and frequency in the main olive growing regions of argentina most annual rainfall 100 400 mm occurs in the summer months and irrigation throughout the entire year is a common management practice rousseaux et al 2008 pierantozzi et al 2014 additionally average winter and spring temperatures in these growing regions are most often higher than those of the mediterranean basin searles et al 2011 torres et al 2017 finally although irrigation in the spring is important for avoiding reductions in flowering and fruit set hueso et al 2021 studies in the warm growing regions of argentina suggest that some level of deficit irrigation can be appropriate in the spring in order to reduce excessive vegetative growth and pruning costs without incurring yield reductions trentacoste et al 2019 pierantozzi et al 2020 compared to water deficit less information is available about the plant water status responses of olive trees to air temperature under field conditions some studies have provided estimations by taking measurements over the course of the season as temperature changes or comparing locations with different temperature regimes when the sap flow was measured at different times of the season it was found to increase strongly above an average daily air temperature of 13 c rousseaux et al 2009 in addition ψs showed a negative linear relationship with daily maximum temperature across several locations in southern spain corell et al 2016 to date whole plant warming experiments in olive trees have only been conducted at a limited number of locations in the mediterranean basin vuletin selak et al 2013 2014 benlloch gonzález et al 2018 2019 and in argentina miserere et al 2019a b 2021 2022 when warming the air by several degrees either earlier or reduced flowering intensity has been found depending on the location as well as reduced fruit size oil concentration and oil yield per tree at the leaf level photosynthesis was not affected by warming 4 c during the oil accumulation phase although increases in transpiration led to a decreased water use efficiency in warmed trees miserere et al 2021 sap flow of whole olive trees was greater after several months of warming than in control olive trees and there was some evidence of thermal acclimation over the course of the season in that sap flow was greater in warmed trees when measured at the same temperature as control trees towards the end of the season miserere et al 2019a unfortunately ψs was not measured in any of these previous studies given the complexities of climatic change there is a need for the simultaneous evaluation of multiple factors such as water deficit and warming under controlled experimental conditions suzuki et al 2014 jagadish et al 2021 a short heat shock exposure 2 h at 40 c under controlled conditions strongly reduced leaf relative water content in both young well irrigated and non irrigated olive trees while leaf photosynthesis was decreased more in the well irrigated trees araújo et al 2019 similarly although plant water status was not measured a natural heat wave of several days in italy with maximum daily temperature increasing from 31 c to 41 c decreased stomatal conductance and leaf photosynthesis in well irrigated potted olive trees but not in trees receiving a water deficit haworth et al 2018 nevertheless longer term warming studies with more moderate temperature increases that emulate the average temperature increase expected with global warming 2 4 c are still not available under different irrigation levels thus the objective of this study was to determine the individual and combined responses of plant water status related variables to deficit irrigation and moderate warming during the late winter and spring in young olive trees open top chambers otcs were used for warming 3 4 c with two irrigation and two temperature levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material the study was conducted during the late winter and spring of 2018 and 2019 i e mid august to late november at the experimental field station of crilar conicet in la rioja argentina 28 48 s latitude 66 56 w longitude 1325 m above sea level two year old olive trees of cv arbequina were used in 2018 and three year old trees of cv coratina were used in 2019 based on tree availability leaf gas exchange and biomass of these two cultivars have been previously shown to respond similarly to warming under our experimental conditions miserere et al 2021 2022 the trees were provided by a commercial nursery san gabriel la rioja argentina and they were transplanted at the field station into white 30 l plastic pots during the spring of 2017 the trees were then grown outdoors in their own nursery until used in the experiment the soil substrate was composed of sand peat and perlite 1 1 0 1 v v to obtain high water retention the trees were watered daily in the nursery using drip irrigation to meet their water requirements based on previously reported sap flow and soil evaporation estimates rousseaux et al 2009 precipitation is uncommon during the winter and spring in this region fertilization was carried out manually once a month with macronutrients 15 n 15 p 15 k 0 6 s and once a week from flowering to harvest with micronutrients 0 02 b by weight 0 01 cu 3 fe 1 mn 1 zn 0 007 mo nitrogen 2 8 magnesium 0 5 aminoquelant minors brometan spain the leaf area per tree was approximately 0 35 and 0 60 m2 at the beginning and end of the experiment in 2018 respectively in 2019 leaf area was 1 05 m2 at the beginning and 1 25 m2 at the end of the experiment flowering and thus fruit number was minimal the first year in the cv arbequina trees but was greater the second season in cv coratina flowering occurred in early october and pit hardening did not take place during the experimental periods 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experimental design was a completely randomized design with two levels of both irrigation equivalent to 100 and 50 of water consumed and air temperature a near ambient control and a warming treatment of 4 c there were four replicates n 4 of each of the following four treatment combinations 1 100 irrigation near ambient temperature control 100 tc 2 100 irrigation warming treatment 100 t 3 50 irrigation near ambient temperature control 50 tc and 4 50 irrigation warming treatment 50 t the entire experiment was conducted within 16 otcs including four otcs for each combination of irrigation and temperature each otc contained two potted olive trees that were placed within 30 cm deep wells to reduce soil heating one of the two temperature levels was assigned to each otc on approximately august 10 each year which coincided with the start of new leaf growth in late winter the near ambient controls tc had a target temperature of no more than 1 c above the ambient outdoor temperature while the warming treatment t had a target of 4 c above tc the chambers were cube shaped with dimensions of 2 0 m x 1 5 m x 1 5 m and the side walls were covered by 150 µm thick polyethylene premium thermal agrotileno pldt221510 agroredes argentina the structure and plastic walls of the otcs provided a similar microenvironment for both temperature levels including wind speed and light level miserere et al 2019b the tc otcs were passively heated by the polyethylene sidewalls to some degree and were ventilated from outside the chamber by air that was released 20 cm above ground level under an air baffle in the center of each otc the top of the tc otcs was completely open while the top of the t otcs was partially covered with clear acetate 80 µm thick to reduce the opening from 2 2 m2 to 0 8 m2 and increase heat retention as described in miserere et al 2019b two complementary heating systems were used for each t otc including 1 an external 6 m long plastic sleeve containing black painted stones that pulled heated air into each t otc and 2 an external electric heater with its own air ventilation system the air temperature inside each otc was recorded every 15 min with a data logger cavadevices buenos aires argentina by placing one temperature sensor tc1047s microchip inc china inside a protective solar radiation shield at tree canopy mid height 1 0 m the ambient outdoor air temperature was also measured in the neighboring tree nursery located 30 m from the otcs every 15 min at the same height lastly data from an on site weather station were used to determine absolute water vapor content in the air g m 3 and subsequently to calculate the relative air humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa for the given air temperature of each otc these values were verified by measuring rh every 15 min within one tc otc and one t otc on some days using humidity sensors honeywell model hih 4000 usa after determining that the heating systems were functioning properly the two irrigation levels were established on august 20 10 days after the start of warming irrigation of the two trees within each otc was applied using a pressurized drip irrigation system with a programmable electronic controller there were two drip emitters per tree with a drip rate of 1 2 l h 1 each for the otcs receiving 100 of water consumed and one emitter 1 2 l h 1 per tree for the otcs receiving deficit irrigation 50 of water consumed bubble wrap insulation covered with aluminum foil aislamax 10 mm thick buenos aires argentina was placed over both the soil surface and the drip emitters to reduce water loss and largely exclude any precipitation to determine the daily amount of water consumed two pots from each of the 100 tc and 100 t temperature levels were weighed in the morning on two consecutive days twice a week using a precision balance 10 g moretti model mpf buenos aires argentina irrigation was performed every 3 days to replace the water consumed the 50 tc and 50 t combinations received one half of the irrigation of their respective 100 irrigation counterparts 100 tc or 100 t in the second year the irrigation applied to each pot was increased by 4 in october 2019 to account for the increased plant weight associated with spring growth 2 3 volumetric soil water content ten cm long capacitance sensors echo 10 decagon devices usa were calibrated using two pots containing young olive trees before the start of the experiment two sensors per pot were inserted vertically at a depth of 5 15 cm and the pots were then watered to excess without any further irrigation soil samples of a known volume were then taken periodically and dried in a forced air oven at 105 c to obtain volumetric soil water content these water content values were compared against sensor voltage output to obtain a linear calibration relationship r2 0 81 field capacity 45 was determined 24 h after the watering and permanent wilting point 5 was approximated when the leaves of the potted trees became completely dry rapoport et al 2012 during the experiment one soil moisture sensor was installed in each pot and the sensors were connected to two 16 channel data loggers that recorded data hourly cavadevices buenos aires argentina the sensors were inserted vertically into the pots at a distance of 10 cm from the drip emitters at a depth between 5 and 15 cm from the soil data relative extractable water rew was calculated using the formula rew r rmin rmax rmin where r is the current volumetric water content rmin is the soil water content at the permanent wilting point and rmax is the soil water content at field capacity gómez del campo and fernández 2007 2 4 stem water potential midday stem water potential ψs was measured on five days during 2018 and seven days during 2019 the measurements were performed two days after irrigation on sunny days starting at solar noon 12 00 13 30 h solar time using a scholander type pressure chamber biocontrol model 0 8 mpa buenos aires argentina one young stem located near the main trunk was selected per otc n 16 and covered with a plastic bag and aluminum foil at least 60 min before the measurement to obtain an equilibrium between the water potential of the stem and that of the trunk additionally the water stress integral sψ mpa day during the treatment period was calculated this integral provides an estimation of cumulative water stress in each treatment combination compared to the maximum ψs which was measured near the beginning of spring the formula is sψ ψs c n where ψs is the average of midday stem water potential between two consecutive measurement dates c is the maximum ψs measured during the season and n is the number of days between measurements dates myers 1988 2 5 leaf gas exchange stomatal conductance gs was measured on the same dates as ψs using a porometer delta t devices model ap4 cambridge uk the measurements were performed during the morning 2 3 h before solar noon on three fully expanded leaves per otc the measured leaves were formed the previous growing season for the august september and early october measurements while leaves from the current season that formed during the treatment period were used in all subsequent measurements the gs values on each date were measured in four tc otcs followed by all 8 t otcs and then the last four tc otcs separate calibrations of the porometer were performed for the tc and t otcs briefly the procedure involved fitting a curve of water vapor diffusion through six sets of holes of increasing diameter contained on a standardized calibration plate for the given relative humidity and air temperature conditions of the tc or t otcs net leaf photosynthesis at light saturation amax and transpiration e were also measured using a portable photosynthesis system adc bioscientific model lcpro sd hoddesdon uk on three dates during the treatment period in 2018 and 2019 along with one date each year after the treatment period the measurements were performed during the morning 2 3 h before solar noon on one fully expanded leaf per otc the air temperature in the leaf chamber was maintained similar to that of the otc air temperature using a peltier cooling system and the measurement sequence was the same as that of the porometer each reading was taken on a known leaf area of 1 75 cm2 after reaching stable amax and e values about 1 min after placing the leaf in the chamber the flow rate in the system was 200 µmol s 1 and the photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd was greater than 1400 µmol m 2 s 1 for all measurements using natural ambient ppfd from amax and e the instantaneous water use efficiency wue was calculated as wue amax e although the portable photosynthesis system also calculates gs the porometer values are reported for this study because gs with the porometer was measured on a greater number of measurement dates and using more leaves to obtain more robust averages with lower variability both instruments recorded similar average gs values on most measurement dates 2 6 thermal imaging midday leaf temperature tleaf was determined on the same days and at approximately the same time 12 30 13 30 h solar time as the ψs measurements using images taken with an infrared thermal camera flir i40 flir systems usa 7 13 µm spectral range 120 120 pixels one image per otc was taken of well illuminated foliage on the west facing side of the tree canopy with a field of view of approximately 12 5 12 5 cm the temperature of 20 leaves per image was analyzed with each pixel corresponding to an effective temperature reading with an emissivity ε of 0 96 flir tools software version 5 13 17214 2001 based on tleaf and simultaneous measurements of air temperature in each otc the difference between leaf and air temperature was calculated δt tleaf tair the tair provided a reference for each image and was measured with a portable digital temperature unit hygropalm 2 rotronic ag ny usa 2 7 statistical analyses the potential effects of irrigation temperature and their interactions were determined for most variables ψs sψ gs amax e wue tleaf δt using standard factorial two way analyses of variance agricolae package r core team 2020 when statistically significant effects were detected differences among treatment means were assessed by tukey tests p 0 05 daily values of relative extractable water were evaluated using linear mixed effects anova models with irrigation temperature and their interactions as fixed factors and plot as a random factor nlme package r core team 2020 potential relationships between ψs as a function of tair variables were assessed using linear regression graphpad prism software lajolla ca usa 3 results 3 1 air temperature and irrigation the average daily air temperature for the treatment period was 3 9 c greater in the actively heated otcs t than in the control otcs tc in 2018 with averages of 23 9 c and 19 9 c respectively fig 1a similarly the air temperature was 3 2 c greater in the t otcs than in the tc otcs in 2019 22 3 c in t 19 1 c in tc fig 1b in both years the daily temperature within the tc otcs was within 1 0 c of the ambient outdoor temperature depending on the day the average air temperature in the tc otcs during the various plant measurements 09 30 13 30 solar time ranged from 21 5 to 34 2 c in 2018 and from 22 7 to 35 5 c in 2019 table 1 the temperature in the t otcs during the measurements was 4 3 and 4 4 c higher on average than in the tc otcs in 2018 and 2019 respectively relative air humidity was generally low 15 44 and was about 5 points lower in the t than the tc otcs the vpd was 2 91 and 4 00 kpa in the tc and t otcs respectively during the measurements in 2018 with slightly higher values 3 60 kpa in tc 4 9 kpa in t in 2019 there was a 36 difference in vpd between the tc and t otcs while the difference in air temperature was lower 15 the irrigation applied was 7 and 27 greater in 2018 and 2019 respectively in 100 t than in 100 tc based on the measurements of water consumed between consecutive days fig 2 the 50 t and 50 tc irrigation values were merely one half of each corresponding 100 irrigation level 3 2 soil relative extractable water and stem water potential as would be expected the rew for the entire treatment period during 2018 in cv arbequina was significantly lower in the 50 irrigation treatment combinations 50 tc 50 t than in the 100 irrigation combinations 100 tc 100 t with averages of 58 7 and 77 3 respectively p 0 05 table 2 similar average differences in rew between the 50 and 100 irrigation treatment combinations were found during 2019 in cv coratina for the entire period although there was high variability in daily rew values the lowest daily values 40 during the two years were generally recorded in the 50 irrigation treatment combinations fig 3 the rew values for the dates on which plant measurements were conducted were also significantly lower in the 50 irrigation treatment combinations in 2018 51 1 for 50 irrigation 69 2 for 100 irrigation p 0 05 with a similar tendency in 2019 61 1 for 50 irrigation 75 3 for 100 irrigation p 0 08 the water stress integral sψ for the entire treatment period showed significant responses to both irrigation and temperature in 2018 and 2019 table 2 the control combination 100 tc had the lowest sψ and the two t treatments 100 t 50 t had the highest sψ in both years as expected no decrease in midday stem water potential ψs due to irrigation was apparent at the beginning of the treatment period but a decrease in ψs occurred on most measurement dates under the 50 irrigation level under both temperature conditions tc t in 2018 and 2019 fig 4 both warming treatments 100 t 50 t had the most negative ψs values during most of 2018 and 2019 after the treatments finished no statistically significant differences in ψs were observed when measured either two months after the treatments in 2018 or 8 days after in 2019 the recovery measurements were delayed in 2018 due to an unexpected torrential downpour and flooding event that saturated the soil of many pots 3 3 stomatal conductance the 50 irrigation level had consistently lower gs values than the 100 irrigation level under both temperature regimes during the latter part of the treatment period in both years fig 5 when the air temperature was low early in the season sept 13 table 1 in 2019 gs was greater under the warmed treatments 100 t 50 t than under tc conditions fig 5b no consistent response to warming was observed when air temperature was higher the 100 t treatment showed significantly higher gs values compared to the other treatments on one date in 2018 fig 5a and t treatment combinations had lower gs values than their corresponding tc counterparts at each irrigation level on two dates in 2019 including the last date of the experimental period before recuperation was evaluated fig 5b in contrast to ψs gs was significantly lower at the 50 irrigation level than the 100 irrigation level when measured 8 days after full irrigation was restored in 2019 while gs showed no remaining effect of the temperature treatments 3 4 net photosynthesis and transpiration amax was also lower at the 50 irrigation level than the 100 level during the second half of the treatment period in both 2018 and 2019 fig 6a b decreases in e were not detected due to water deficit in 2018 but e was lower at the 50 irrigation level when measured on nov 15 and nov 29 in 2019 fig 6c d similar to gs both amax and e remained lower at the 50 irrigation level in 2019 when measured 8 days after irrigation was restored fig 6b d no significant effect of warming was observed on amax in 2018 fig 6a but e was higher in late winter due to warming fig 6c the t treatments also showed higher e as well as amax than the tc treatments early in the season in 2019 when air temperatures were fairly low fig 6b d as was observed for gs later in the season nov 29 at higher temperatures both amax and e decreased significantly under t compared to tc conditions but they were mostly recovered under t when measured 8 days after the treatment period in 2019 p 0 10 the wue amax e was not affected by irrigation in either year during the treatment period fig 6e f in contrast the wue was lower in t than in tc for the first three measurement dates of 2018 fig 6e although no significant differences were found for wue due to temperature in 2019 fig 6f 3 5 midday leaf and air temperature irrigation level did not significantly affect either midday tleaf or δt during the treatment period in either year fig 7 the tleaf showed no differences between tc and t at the beginning of the season but higher tleaf was observed in t for the remaining measurement dates during the treatment period in both years fig 7a b in contrast δt was significantly lower in t than in tc for both irrigation levels early in the season while statistical differences were most often not detected later in the season fig 7c d after the treatment period midday tleaf was similar in all treatments when determining the relationship between midday tair and tleaf during the treatment period the tleaf was lower for a given tair in the t treatments than in tc in both years fig 8 this difference was especially apparent at lower tair in 2018 fig 8a 3 6 relationships between stem water potential and air temperature the ψs was negatively related to midday air temperature with ψs decreasing as air temperature increased fig 9a b all of the treatment combinations were best fit to a single linear relationship in 2018 in cv arbequina r2 0 48 fig 9a in 2019 the relationship between midday air temperature and 100 tc r2 0 54 had a similar y intercept but a lower slope than the other three treatment combinations fig 9c in addition ψs was negatively related to midday leaf temperature in both years data not shown 4 discussion this is the first experimental study to assess the combination of deficit irrigation and warming in olive trees under natural temperature fluctuations over a prolonged period as has been reported previously for this otc design miserere et al 2019b active heating successfully increased daily tair by 3 4 c fig 1 which was accompanied by a moderate increase in vapor pressure deficit of about 35 in our continental andean region air temperatures are already higher than most olive growing regions searles et al 2011 hamze et al 2022 and regional climate models predict that aridity will increase by mid century zaninelli et al 2019 cabré and nuñez 2020 the cumulative irrigation applied was 7 and 27 greater during the experimental period in 2018 and 2019 respectively in the t otcs than in the near ambient control otcs based on measurements of water consumed in the pots fig 2 this confirms the postulated approach of nissim et al 2020 where young olive trees were irrigated one third more at a high temperature site than at a moderate temperature site with a daily average temperatures difference of about 7 c based on known evapotranspiration values at the two sites additionally reducing the irrigation by 50 of the water consumed in the well watered t and tc pots was sufficient enough to obtain a moderate decrease in soil rew table 2 fig 3 midday ψs is considered to be a good tool for monitoring plant water status and scheduling irrigation in olive and other fruit trees when the soil plant atmosphere continuum is properly considered moriana et al 2012 garcía tejera et al 2021 shackel et al 2021 in this study deficit irrigation and warming combined to reduce ψs fig 4 the lower ψs of the trees with deficit irrigation reflected the lower soil rew in the 50 treatments and warming further decreased ψs the decrease with the warming treatments is likely to be a function of the increased temperature accompanied by higher vpd in the t treatments experimental warming during the summer at our field location has previously been shown to increase whole tree sap flow and leaf transpiration on some measurement dates in young olive trees miserere et al 2019a 2021 which would lead to lower ψs once the irrigation was restored and trees were returned to ambient temperature conditions the ψs recovered to control values as has been observed in several studies agüero alcaras et al 2016 ahumada orellana et al 2017 martín palomo et al 2021 when expressed as water stress integral sψ the greatest sψ tended to be found in the 50 t treatment combination with about two thirds of the greater sψ being due to warming and only about one third being due to deficit irrigation table 2 the large response of sψ to warming shows the potential importance of warming 4 c with climate change under both well watered and water deficit conditions stomatal control regulates both water and co2 exchange in plants damour et al 2010 chaves et al 2016 and reductions in gs and amax have often been shown in olive leaves under deficit irrigation fernández et al 1997 moriana et al 2002 ahumada orellana et al 2019 as expected the gs and amax were consistently reduced in the latter half of the treatment period in both years at the 50 irrigation level fig 6 interestingly warming appeared to increase gs as well as amax and e near the beginning of spring on days with moderate ambient temperatures fig 5b 6 at this time it is likely that the air temperature in tc of slightly above 20 c was sub optimal for photosynthesis bongi et al 1987 diaz espejo et al 2006 later in the spring under higher temperatures the responses to warming showed both an increase in gs on one date in 2018 and some lower values in gs and amax in 2019 using gs values for an entire experimental period gs was not significantly related to air temperature in either year in the summer at our field location gs also did not show a consistent response to warming 4 c and amax was little affected miserere et al 2021 in contrast gs decreased in cv coratina above 30 c under controlled laboratory conditions but little decrease even up to 40 c was found in some other cultivars bongi et al 1987 a natural heat wave in italy with maximum temperatures about 10 c above normal drastically reduced gs and net photosynthesis under well watered conditions however they were not reduced when already low due to severe water stress haworth et al 2018 these results emphasize that the magnitude and duration of temperature increases as well as cultivar characteristics are likely to strongly affect plant responses as suggested by jagadish et al 2021 leaf age should also be carefully considered in further studies lastly in contrast to ψs the recovery of the gas exchange variables in 2019 eight days after irrigation and ambient temperature were restored was not complete for the water deficit trees which has also been reported by other authors see review by fernández et al 2014 ahumada orellana et al 2022 the use of thermal imagery as an indirect measurement of stress in olive trees is of considerable interest because of its potential use to monitor olive orchards by remote sensing sepulcre cantó et al 2006 berni et al 2009 when deficit irrigation leads to severe reductions in gs in olive leaves stomatal closure has been shown to result in an increase of about 2 c in the tree canopy temperature relative to the air temperature because leaf cooling is reduced garcía tejero et al 2017 in our study no significant increases in tleaf tair were found when moderate reductions in gs occurred in the 50 irrigation treatments fig 7c d the fairly small size of olive leaves and their lanceolate leaf shape have been suggested to strongly contribute to coupling with the surrounding air villalobos and lópez bernal 2017 thus detecting a moderate level of water stress may prove difficult in olive trees compared to some deciduous fruit trees with larger leaves in contrast the warmed treatments showed a lower tleaf tair than the near ambient temperature level in late winter and early spring when gs and e were sometimes greater in t fig 5b 6c d which could have contributed to leaf cooling in t later in the spring no clear differences between treatments in tleaf tair were apparent in either year understanding the relationships between environmental variables such as air temperature and plant water status is critical for crop water management in mediterranean spain a significant negative relationship was found between maximum daily air temperature and midday ψs in two out of three experimental orchards corell et al 2016 a recent study using a survey approach with data from several continents observed a similar negative relationship between midday vpd and ψs when soil moisture was not limiting shackel et al 2021 such relationships allow for scheduling irrigation based on atmospheric conditions in our study midday tair and ψs were also negatively related in both years fig 9 although different ψs vs tair relationships were not detected between temperature levels in 2018 fig 9a the t treatments had more negative values of ψs than the well watered temperature control 100 tc for a given midday tair in 2019 furthermore the tleaf of the warmed treatments was less than that of tc for the same tair in both years fig 8 these results suggest some degree of thermal acclimation to warming during the treatment period it may be that greater leaf cooling occurred for a given tair via leaf level or other adjustments which led to more negative ψs physiological variables have often been reported to acclimate to a new growth temperature in a number of species way et al 2013 vico et al 2019 whole tree sap flow previously showed some degree of thermal acclimation in warmed olive trees at our location with greater sap flow occurring in warmed than in control trees at a given tair after several months of warming in the summer and early fall miserere et al 2019a however it is recognized that increases in leaf transpiration were only detected in this study towards the beginning of spring when air temperatures were still fairly low fig 6b d the simultaneous evaluation of multiple factors such as water deficit and warming under experimental conditions can provide insight into crop function under climate change suzuki et al 2014 jagadish et al 2021 it is important to determine what plant response variables are affected by each factor and what the combined response is for example in our study gs was consistently reduced by a moderate water deficit while warming appeared to have a less pronounced effect on gs in contrast both water deficit and the 4 c warming during the spring combined additively to reduce ψs even though water deficit reduced transpiring plant leaf area in cv arbequina in 2018 in 2019 water deficit did not affect leaf area in cv coratina and warming did not significantly affect leaf area in either year in our study data not shown a temperature increase of 4 c could occur by 2100 if co2 emissions are little controlled ipcc 2021 increased irrigation could be used to mitigate the negative effects of water stress and warming on plant water status fraga et al 2020 but supplemental irrigation is unlikely to be available in all cases the combined responses to water deficit and warming may be most felt in small traditional orchards that are rain fed and do not have the possibility of obtaining supplemental irrigation increasing atmospheric co2 could ameliorate such effects through stomatal closure mairech et al 2021 and experimental studies combining co2 with other climate factors are urgently needed for olive trees 5 conclusions this is the first experimental study to assess the responses of olive trees during the spring to the combination of moderate deficit irrigation and warming 4 c under natural temperature fluctuations the results indicate that modifications in water management with global warming will likely be required given the mostly negative individual or additive effects of irrigation deficit and increased air temperature on ψs and other variables further studies should focus on plant growth reproductive development and oil yield responses to water deficit and warming during the spring declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following
