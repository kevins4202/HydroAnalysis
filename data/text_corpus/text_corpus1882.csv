between means were detected using the least significant difference at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 impact of mps on the depth of the wetting front in soil water infiltration the migration process of the wetting front under different treatments is shown in fig 2 a the depths of the wetting fronts showed no obvious change in the first 30 min with time the depth of the wetting front of t2 was significantly lower than that of the other treatments p 0 05 at the termination of infiltration the difference between the other four treatments was not statistically remarkable when the depth of the wetting front reached 50 cm the consuming times of ck t1 t2 t3 and t4 were 307 5 306 4 348 0 317 1 and 317 3 min respectively their vertical motion rates were calculated as 0 163 0 163 0 144 0 158 and 0 158 cm min respectively to reach the same depth compared with the ck the consuming time of t2 increased evidently p 0 05 the vertical infiltration rates of the other treatments were close to each other except for the t2 treatment as shown in fig 2 c d and e three moments 120 min 210 min and 300 min were chosen to reveal the condition of the depth of the wetting fronts in the early middle and late infiltration stages at three moments the depth of the wetting front of t2 was significantly lower than that of the other treatments p 0 05 while no prominent distinction was found among the remaining treatments 3 2 impact of mps on cumulative infiltration in soil water infiltration the dynamic characteristics of the cumulative infiltrations over time are shown in fig 2 b the dynamics of cumulative infiltration were similar to those of the wetting front depth in the first 30 min the curves of the five treatments almost coincided the cumulative infiltration of t2 over time was notably lower than that of the other treatments p 0 05 when infiltration was over the cumulative infiltration under the five treatments was 18 63 cm 18 86 cm 18 45 cm 18 72 cm and 18 82 cm respectively compared with the ck cumulative infiltrations were not significantly different except in the t2 treatment under the t2 treatment the cumulative infiltration decreased significantly p 0 05 as shown in fig 2 f g and h the same moments 120 210 and 300 min were chosen to exhibit the condition of the cumulative infiltration in the early middle and late infiltration stages the cumulative infiltration of t2 was distinctly lower than that of the other treatments 3 3 soil physical properties under different treatments 3 3 1 changes in swc and ks as shown in fig 3 with the mps content the t2 treatment had the smallest swc value with a trend of first decreasing and then increasing the trend was in agreement with the changes in the depth of the wetting front between treatments the similarity between the trends of ks and swc was high the ks of the other treatments was significantly lower than that of the ck 3 3 2 swcc of different contents of microplastics fig 4 shows the swcc of the different mps contents when the soil water suction was small there was no significance in the dynamic characteristic of the volumetric water content between treatments however it gradually differentiated when the water suction exceeded 500 cm with identical soil water suction the volumetric water content of the t2 treatment was distinctly higher than that of the other treatments correspondingly the infiltration capacity of the t2 treatment was the worst and there was no significance between the other four treatments according to the swcc 3 4 infiltration model under different mps contents 3 4 1 analysis of the wetting front propulsion model according to fig 2 the functional relationship between f z and t conformed to the power function under the different treatments the fitting parameters and their trends are shown in table 1 and fig 5 based on four statistical indexes r 2 rrmse crm and ce the simulated migration of the wetting front was in good agreement with the observed values with the mps content the trend of parameter b in the power function showed no difference with the depth of the wetting front trend the variation in parameter a was consistent with the variation in the vertical motion rate between treatments when the wetting front reached the same location 3 4 2 analysis of the cumulative infiltration model the functional relationship between i and t was expressed by the lewis equation philip model and horton model the fitting parameters and their trends are shown in tables 2 4 and figs 6 8 as table 2 shows except for the t2 treatment the parameter k in the lewis equation was significantly higher than that of the ck while the parameter Î± was significantly smaller than that of the ck p 0 05 according to the four indicators the quality of the simulation was high except for the t2 treatment with the mps content the parameter k in the lewis equation showed an upward trend while the overall trend of parameter Î± was downward fig 6 for the philip model fig 7 shows that except for the t2 treatment the s of the other treatments was significantly higher than that of the ck while the parameter ks was significantly smaller p 0 05 with the mps content the parameter s in the philip model showed an upward trend while the overall trend of the parameter ks was downward with the exception of the t2 treatment as shown in table 3 the philip model had high efficiency in fitting the cumulative infiltration however this result that ks was negative was inconsistent with the fact as shown in fig 8 with the mps content the trends of parameters a b and c in the exponential function were consistent with the trend of the wetting front depth between treatments based on the r 2 rrmse crm and ce table 4 shows that the fitting quality of the horton model was high 4 discussion 4 1 the impact mechanism of mps on soil water infiltration soil water infiltration was affected by the soil texture soil bulk density content of organic matter and water stable macroaggregates michaelides et al 2010 as shown in previous studies a reduction in the flow section will occur when impervious media exist in the soil it also increases the curvature of soil pores and the number of macropores epstein et al 1966 petersen et al 1968 as an impervious medium plastic mulch film more easily blocks water infiltration and reduces ks liu et al 2009 in the first 30 min the impact of mps on infiltration was not distinct this result may be due to the dry surface of the soil large water potential gradient and non saturation of the wetting front at the initial stage of infiltration which resulted in the high vertical infiltration rate regarding the low content of mps t1 treatment a trifling impact was seen in the dynamics of the wetting front and cumulative infiltration over time a similar impact was demonstrated by li et al 2021 there was little effect on infiltration with the 1 earthworm cast treatment in the t1 treatment it was found that the swc was slightly lower than that in the ck but no distinct difference was seen between them this result could explain why their cumulative infiltrations were so close to each other the dynamics of the wetting front showed no difference while the ks of t1 was lower than that of the ck this result may be due to the migration of mps however it was not enough to decrease the infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration under the t2 treatment both the depth of the wetting front and the cumulative infiltration at the same moment decreased significantly p 0 05 which indicated that mps started to take effect several studies have proven that tiny particles can migrate along soil pores through leaching cey et al 2009 grayling et al 2018 li et al 2020 as mentioned above water infiltration is affected by the residue of mulching film in soil cao et al 2021 jiang et al 2017 the accumulation of downward mps acted as mulching film blocking water infiltration according to fig 3 mps reduced the ks and swc which supported the phenomenon of the wetting front depth and cumulative infiltration compared with the t2 treatment there were increases in the depth of the wetting front and the cumulative infiltration at the same moment under the t3 and t4 treatments according to a previous study fine soil particles can contact polyester microfibers efficiently and then form large clods zhang et al 2019 consequently the phenomenon may result from water stable macroaggregates and macropores induced by mps however macropores are considered the most possible mechanism for preferential flow cey et al 2009 thus it could be concluded that the mps used in this experiment could result in the formation of large clods through the interaction of mps and soil fine particles then preferential flow is formed which promotes the water infiltration rate complicated preferential pathways lead to an increase in cumulative infiltration the swc of the t3 and t4 treatments was not significantly different from that of the ck and the t1 treatment however the saturated hydraulic conductivities of t3 and t4 were distinctly lower than that of the ck this result was consistent with the results of biochar addition studied by libutti et al 2021 and residual film in soil jiang et al 2017 4 2 estimate of the infiltration model the residual plastic film decomposes into film mps through physical and chemical actions a previous study demonstrated that residual plastic film affected the water infiltration and parameters of the infiltration model niu et al 2016 in our study several models were adopted to fit the curves of the wetting front and cumulative infiltration which contained the wetting front propulsion model and several cumulative infiltration models the cumulative infiltration models include the lewis equation philip model and horton model based on the parameters r 2 rrmse crm and ce the efficiency of the simulation with the four models was high due to the approach to their optimal values for the wetting front propulsion model based on table 1 and fig 5 with the mps content the trend of parameter b in the power function was consistent with the trend of the wetting front depth between treatments the trend of parameter a was in agreement with the variation in the vertical motion rate between treatments when the depths were the same as shown in tables 2 3 and figs 6 7 for the lewis equation and philip model except for the t2 treatment as the mps content increased an upward trend could be seen in parameter k in the lewis equation and for parameter s in the philip model a downward trend appeared in the overall trend of parameters Î± and k s according to table 4 and fig 8 for the horton model as the mps content increased the trends of parameters a b and c in the power function were consistent with the trend of the wetting front depth between treatments however the value of k s cannot be negative because it is not in line with reality consequently for the wetting front the best applicability existed in the wetting front propulsion model for the infiltration model the priority of the lewis equation was higher than that of the philip model and horton model the abrupt change in the t2 treatment was consistent with the varieties of the wetting front and cumulative infiltration over time which referred to the decrease in permeability as the content of mps reached 0 2 4 3 importance of controlling pollution of soil with mps to improve the soil environment in arid and semiarid areas mulching film is often used in agricultural production qi et al 2018 however due to the deficiency in the recovery of mulch film much residual film plays an important role in becoming a source of mps yu et al 2020 through research of the influence of mps on soil water infiltration this study demonstrated that mps would decrease the soil permeability when the mps content reached a certain value thus mps created barriers to soil water infiltration which greatly affects the growth of animals and crops in soil meanwhile it would contribute to the increases in slope runoff and soil erosion moreover with soil degradation and nutrient loss crop reduction and other hazards occur frequently scheurer and bigalke 2018 the pollution of agroecosystems would be severe with a high content of mps in soil on the one hand due to mps transport into the roots of crops mps enter the human body through the food web huerta lwanga et al 2017b on the other hand a high content of mps would be poisonous to animals and crops yi et al 2020 mps pollution in farmland needs to be controlled from the source the recovery of plastic mulch film is of great importance to agricultural production in the future furthermore the development of degradable mulching film may play a great part in alleviating the pollution from mulching film water use efficiency needs to be elevated to decrease the usage of mulching film 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that the migration rates of the wetting front and cumulative infiltration exhibited nonlinear variation with the mps polyethylene content the two indexes decreased under lower additions while increasing under higher additions there was a significant decrease in the t2 treatment at the same time the water infiltration in the columns was efficiently described by the four models for the wetting front the wetting front propulsion model was the best model fitting the variation in the wetting front over time for cumulative infiltration the lewis equation was the best for matching the infiltration curves mps polluted soil would lead to soil erosion because a low infiltration rate and small cumulative infiltration would occur resulting in an increase in runoff in the slope constriction of mps should be focused on the source of mps such as the adoption of degradable mulch film and the pretreatment of sewage into farmland declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science

water to the columns a ruler was used on the outer surface to record the amount of water infiltration the inner diameter and height of the soil column were 20 cm and 75 cm respectively a ruler was used to locate the depth of the wetting front on the outer surface of the soil column 2 3 experimental design the experiment was initiated on 22 may 2021 at the experimental field at the ansai soil and water conservation station the experiment was designed with five different mps treatments 0 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 mps weight soil weight the five treatments were represented by ck t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively three infiltration experiments were replicated for each treatment 2 3 1 soil and mps preparation column filling was performed carefully to avoid the whirling of fine particles a constant bulk density of 1 35 g cm3 was adjusted by successive filling and compaction of 10 cm layers considering the initial water content the soil of each layer weighed 4 334 kg and the corresponding weights of mps particles were 0 4 334 8 667 17 334 and 26 002 g respectively both the mps and the soil were placed in a blender to mix thoroughly the rotation speed of the blender was controlled at 100 r min and the mixing time was 30 min 2 3 2 soil water infiltration to avoid preferential flow the inner walls of the columns were coated with vaseline before column filling the top of the soil layers was covered with filter paper to avoid surface effects from irrigation at the bottom of the columns filter paper was used to prevent the leakage of fine particles the height of the soil in the column was 50 cm under the condition of a constant head vertical infiltration was carried out the hydraulic head of the mariotte bottle was 0 63 m the water was 3 5 cm above the surface soil the process of the wetting front was recorded by stopwatch subjected to the principle of first dense and then sparse the observation times were 1 min 3 min 5 min 7 min 10 min 15 min 20 min and 30 min for the first 30 min and every 30 min until the depth of the wetting front reached 50 cm meanwhile the scale of the mariotte bottle was recorded to indicate infiltration 2 3 3 test of soil properties to prove the reliability of our experimental results the saturated water content swc saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and soil water characteristic curve swcc were measured the swcc was measured by the centrifuge method reatto et al 2008 ks was measured by the double ring method with a constant head reynolds et al 2000 the swc was tested by the oven drying method perrier and salkini 1991 2 4

of variance anova was used to assess the effect of different treatments on the model parameters the means of three experiments were adopted in this study to avoid contingency significant differences between means were detected using the least significant difference at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 impact of mps on the depth of the wetting front in soil water infiltration the migration process of the wetting front under different treatments is shown in fig 2 a the depths of the wetting fronts showed no obvious change in the first 30 min with time the depth of the wetting front of t2 was significantly lower than that of the other treatments p 0 05 at the termination of infiltration the difference between the other four treatments was not statistically remarkable when the depth of the wetting front reached 50 cm the consuming times of ck t1 t2 t3 and t4 were 307 5 306 4 348 0 317 1 and 317 3 min respectively their vertical motion rates were calculated as 0 163 0 163 0 144 0 158 and 0 158 cm min respectively to reach the same depth compared with the ck the consuming time of t2 increased evidently p 0 05 the vertical infiltration rates of the other treatments were close to each other except for the t2 treatment as shown in fig 2 c d and e three moments 120 min 210 min and 300 min were chosen to reveal the condition of the depth of the wetting fronts in the early middle and late infiltration stages at three moments the depth of the wetting front of t2 was significantly lower than that of the other treatments p 0 05 while no prominent distinction was found among the remaining treatments 3 2 impact of mps on cumulative infiltration in soil water infiltration the dynamic characteristics of the cumulative infiltrations over time are shown in fig 2 b the dynamics of cumulative infiltration were similar to those of the wetting front depth in the first 30 min the curves of the five treatments almost coincided the cumulative infiltration of t2 over time was notably lower than that of the other treatments p 0 05 when infiltration was over the cumulative infiltration under the five treatments was 18 63 cm 18 86 cm 18 45 cm 18 72 cm and 18 82 cm respectively compared with the ck cumulative infiltrations were not significantly different except in the t2 treatment under the t2 treatment the cumulative infiltration decreased significantly p 0 05 as shown in fig 2 f g and h the same moments 120 210 and 300 min were chosen to exhibit the condition of the cumulative infiltration in the early middle and late infiltration stages the cumulative infiltration of t2 was distinctly lower than that of the other treatments 3 3 soil physical properties under different treatments 3 3 1 changes in swc and ks as shown in fig 3 with the mps content the t2 treatment had the smallest swc value with a trend of first decreasing and then increasing the trend was in agreement with the changes in the depth of the wetting front between treatments the similarity between the trends of ks and swc was high the ks of the other treatments was significantly lower than that of the ck 3 3 2 swcc of different contents of microplastics fig 4 shows the swcc of the different mps contents when the soil water suction was small there was no significance in the dynamic characteristic of the volumetric water content between treatments however it gradually differentiated when the water suction exceeded 500 cm with identical soil water suction the volumetric water content of the t2 treatment was distinctly higher than that of the other treatments correspondingly the infiltration capacity of the t2 treatment was the worst and there was no significance between the other four treatments according to the swcc 3 4 infiltration model under different mps contents 3 4 1 analysis of the wetting front propulsion model according to fig 2 the functional relationship between f z and t conformed to the power function under the different treatments the fitting parameters and their trends are shown in table 1 and fig 5 based on four statistical indexes r 2 rrmse crm and ce the simulated migration of the wetting front was in good agreement with the observed values with the mps content the trend of parameter b in the power function showed no difference with the depth of the wetting front trend the variation in parameter a was consistent with the variation in the vertical motion rate between treatments when the wetting front reached the same location 3 4 2 analysis of the cumulative infiltration model the functional relationship between i and t was expressed by the lewis equation philip model and horton model the fitting parameters and their trends are shown in tables 2 4 and figs 6 8 as table 2 shows except for the t2 treatment the parameter k in the lewis equation was significantly higher than that of the ck while the parameter Î± was significantly smaller than that of the ck p 0 05 according to the four indicators the quality of the simulation was high except for the t2 treatment with the mps content the parameter k in the lewis equation showed an upward trend while the overall trend of parameter Î± was downward fig 6 for the philip model fig 7 shows that except for the t2 treatment the s of the other treatments was significantly higher than that of the ck while the parameter ks was significantly smaller p 0 05 with the mps content the parameter s in the philip model showed an upward trend while the overall trend of the parameter ks was downward with the exception of the t2 treatment as shown in table 3 the philip model had high efficiency in fitting the cumulative infiltration however this result that ks was negative was inconsistent with the fact as shown in fig 8 with the mps content the trends of parameters a b and c in the exponential function were consistent with the trend of the wetting front depth between treatments based on the r 2 rrmse crm and ce table 4 shows that the fitting quality of the horton model was high 4 discussion 4 1 the impact mechanism of mps on soil water infiltration soil water infiltration was affected by the soil texture soil bulk density content of organic matter and water stable macroaggregates michaelides et al 2010 as shown in previous studies a reduction in the flow section will occur when impervious media exist in the soil it also increases the curvature of soil pores and the number of macropores epstein et al 1966 petersen et al 1968 as an impervious medium plastic mulch film more easily blocks water infiltration and reduces ks liu et al 2009 in the first 30 min the impact of mps on infiltration was not distinct this result may be due to the dry surface of the soil large water potential gradient and non saturation of the wetting front at the initial stage of infiltration which resulted in the high vertical infiltration rate regarding the low content of mps t1 treatment a trifling impact was seen in the dynamics of the wetting front and cumulative infiltration over time a similar impact was demonstrated by li et al 2021 there was little effect on infiltration with the 1 earthworm cast treatment in the t1 treatment it was found that the swc was slightly lower than that in the ck but no distinct difference was seen between them this result could explain why their cumulative infiltrations were so close to each other the dynamics of the wetting front showed no difference while the ks of t1 was lower than that of the ck this result may be due to the migration of mps however it was not enough to decrease the infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration under the t2 treatment both the depth of the wetting front and the cumulative infiltration at the same moment decreased significantly p 0 05 which indicated that mps started to take effect several studies have proven that tiny particles can migrate along soil pores through leaching cey et al 2009 grayling et al 2018 li et al 2020 as mentioned above water infiltration is affected by the residue of mulching film in soil cao et al 2021 jiang et al 2017 the accumulation of downward mps acted as mulching film blocking water infiltration according to fig 3 mps reduced the ks and swc which supported the phenomenon of the wetting front depth and cumulative infiltration compared with the t2 treatment there were increases in the depth of the wetting front and the cumulative infiltration at the same moment under the t3 and t4 treatments according to a previous study fine soil particles can contact polyester microfibers efficiently and then form large clods zhang et al 2019 consequently the phenomenon may result from water stable macroaggregates and macropores induced by mps however macropores are considered the most possible mechanism for preferential flow cey et al 2009 thus it could be concluded that the mps used in this experiment could result in the formation of large clods through the interaction of mps and soil fine particles then preferential flow is formed which promotes the water infiltration rate complicated preferential pathways lead to an increase in cumulative infiltration the swc of the t3 and t4 treatments was not significantly different from that of the ck and the t1 treatment however the saturated hydraulic conductivities of t3 and t4 were distinctly lower than that of the ck this result was consistent with the results of biochar addition studied by libutti et al 2021 and residual film in soil jiang et al 2017 4 2 estimate of the infiltration model the residual plastic film decomposes into film mps through physical and chemical actions a previous study demonstrated that residual plastic film affected the water infiltration and parameters of the infiltration model niu et al 2016 in our study several models were adopted to fit the curves of the wetting front and cumulative infiltration which contained the wetting front propulsion model and several cumulative infiltration models the cumulative infiltration models include the lewis equation philip model and horton model based on the parameters r 2 rrmse crm and ce the efficiency of the simulation with the four models was high due to the approach to their optimal values for the wetting front propulsion model based on table 1 and fig 5 with the mps content the trend of parameter b in the power function was consistent with the trend of the wetting front depth between treatments the trend of parameter a was in agreement with the variation in the vertical motion rate between treatments when the depths were the same as shown in tables 2 3 and figs 6 7 for the lewis equation and philip model except for the t2 treatment as the mps content increased an upward trend could be seen in parameter k in the lewis equation and for parameter s in the philip model a downward trend appeared in the overall trend of parameters Î± and k s according to table 4 and fig 8 for the horton model as the mps content increased the trends of parameters a b and c in the power function were consistent with the trend of the wetting front depth between treatments however the value of k s cannot be negative because it is not in line with reality consequently for the wetting front the best applicability existed in the wetting front propulsion model for the infiltration model the priority of the lewis equation was higher than that of the philip model and horton model the abrupt change in the t2 treatment was consistent with the varieties of the wetting front and cumulative infiltration over time which referred to the decrease in permeability as the content of mps reached 0 2 4 3 importance of controlling pollution of soil with mps to improve the soil environment in arid and semiarid areas mulching film is often used in agricultural production qi et al 2018 however due to the deficiency in the recovery of mulch film much residual film plays an important role in becoming a source of mps yu et al 2020 through research of the influence of mps on soil water infiltration this study demonstrated that mps would decrease the soil permeability when the mps content reached a certain value thus mps created barriers to soil water infiltration which greatly affects the growth of animals and crops in soil meanwhile it would contribute to the increases in slope runoff and soil erosion moreover with soil degradation and nutrient loss crop reduction and other hazards occur frequently scheurer and bigalke 2018 the pollution of agroecosystems would be severe with a high content of mps in soil on the one hand due to mps transport into the roots of crops mps enter the human body through the food web huerta lwanga et al 2017b on the other hand a high content of mps would be poisonous to animals and crops yi et al 2020 mps pollution in farmland needs to be controlled from the source the recovery of plastic mulch film is of great importance to agricultural production in the future furthermore the development of degradable mulching film may play a great part in alleviating the pollution from mulching film water use efficiency needs to be elevated to decrease the usage of mulching film 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that the migration rates of the wetting front and cumulative infiltration exhibited nonlinear variation with the mps polyethylene content the two indexes decreased under lower additions while increasing under higher additions there was a significant decrease in the t2 treatment at the same time the water infiltration in the columns was efficiently described by the four models for the wetting front the wetting front propulsion model was the best model fitting the variation in the wetting front over time for cumulative infiltration the lewis equation was the best for matching the infiltration curves mps polluted soil would lead to soil erosion because a low infiltration rate and small cumulative infiltration would occur resulting in an increase in runoff in the slope constriction of mps should be focused on the source of mps such as the adoption of degradable mulch film and the pretreatment of sewage into farmland declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9411,a new stochastic weather generator climasg is presented and evaluated under a wide range of climates the model requires monthly means data as inputs to generate daily weather data validation tests revealed that climasg performed well in capturing monthly rainfall variability but showed some limitations for generating extreme temperatures solar radiation air humidity and wind speed were reproduced acceptably the weather generator was particularly accurate in predicting mean and extreme values of et0 which indicates that climasg may be used as the basis for calculating crop water requirements and for irrigation design and planning purposes the suitability of synthetic weather series generated with climasg for crop modelling applications was further assessed by running the model olivecan for low density rainfed ld and super high density irrigated shd olive orchards for several locations in spain yield distributions simulated with synthetic weather rarely differed significantly from those obtained with actual weather data although the coefficient of variation cv was usually underestimated considering its low input requirements and satisfactory performance climasg represents a promising source of weather data for different practical applications keywords weather generator stochastic model overdispersion olea europaea crop modelling data availability data will be available on request the weather generator can be downloaded for free at https www uco es fitotecnia climasg html 1 introduction modelling the productivity and irrigation requirements of agricultural crops is restricted by our ability to develop robust simulation tools but more importantly by the availability of adequate weather data many regions worldwide lack reliable meteorological observation systems which are vital for supplying long term quality meteorological series therefore daily weather data are frequently not available too short in time span or show significant problems related to data quality homogeneity and gaps in data continuity this led to the development of weather generators wgs of various complexities able to synthetically simulate site specific and long term weather data based on historical observations table 1 wgs are used extensively in agricultural hydrological and ecologically related studies paschalis et al 2014 shlabing et al 2014 liben et al 2018 moreover wgs are also used to downscale global or regional circulation model data to local scale for impact assessment studies wilks 1999 fatichi et al 2011 kim and ivanov 2015 weather generators may follow stochastic statistical or physical dynamical approaches and have been developed with different input requirements some require long time series of weather data in order to reproduce natural climate variability and hence approximate actual daily weather patterns most wgs are based on stochastic statistical approaches that simulate actual weather variability by preserving statistical properties of observed weather wgen richardson 1981 is one of the first developed stochastic weather generators swg that has been widely used not only in simulating missing weather data but also in downscaling global circulation models data for impact assessment studies e g wilby et al 1998 wgen has served as the basis for many other swg s e g marksim jones and thornton 2000 geng et al 1998 developed simmeteo an adaptation of wgen that simplifies parameterization using only monthly mean values of rainfall temperature and solar radiation as inputs this program has become a standard for generating weather data for crop simulation since it was adopted as the default in dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer jones et al 2003 high quality weather generators should produce data sets that are statistically equal to real series in many studies only the main statistics mean standard deviation are compared e g hansen and mavromatis 2001 but frequency distributions should also be evaluated soltani and hoogenboom 2003 a common problem of many weather generators is the underestimation of inter annual variance in monthly and annual total rainfall buishand 1978 gregory et al 1993 a phenomenon called overdispersion in statistics e g cox 1983 this is frequently related to the use of a first order markov chain for simulating the occurrence of rainy days and may be mitigated by using a higher order markov chain katz and parlange 1998 chen et al 2012 however more complex models cannot be parameterized with only mean values of monthly rainfall and the number of rainy days as in simmeteo overdispersion has also been found in air temperature mason 2004 this may be caused by the general use of the normal distribution for maximum and minimum temperature in most swg s harmel et al 2002 apart from the direct comparison of real and synthetic weather data the quality of the weather generator should be evaluated on its intended use i e which model will be fed with synthetic weather the sensitivity of the model to each weather variable will determine the tolerance for the weather generator however as the sensitivity is often asymmetric and crop models include so many feedbacks the only way to evaluate the quality of weather generators for crop modelling is to compare the outputs obtained with real and synthetic data soltani et al 2000 in fact the non linearity of interactions in crop climate models highlights the importance of preserving weather patterns since the climatic variability can have a profound effect on the estimation of agricultural production semenov and porter 1995 porter and semenov 2005 van wart et al 2015 moreover the impact of overdispersion of rainfall on crop simulation analyses depends on environmental and management factors for instance in dry rainfed areas the frequency of dry years with very low yield will be underestimated with synthetic weather so average yield will be overestimated and yield variance will be underestimated therefore analyses on yield stability or sustainability using crop models will be biased in simmeteo and wgen maximum tx and minimum temperature tn and solar radiation rs are generated as normal variables with fixed values of cross and auto correlation the result is that generated rs will not be correlated with the temperature range d tx tn which is unrealistic actually the ratio of actual to extraterrestrial radiation is linearly related to d0 5 which is the basis for the hargreaves method for estimating solar radiation hargreaves and samani 1985 the relevance of this problem will depend on the crop simulation model or the process to be considered villalobos and fereres 1989 for a given mean temperature and mean vapor pressure sunny days will have higher temperatures than cloudy days during the daytime when photosynthesis and transpiration occur and vapor pressure deficit will be higher too the expected result would be that the distribution of calculated transpiration will have both smaller mean and variance when generated weather is used simple weather generators like simmeteo provide all the meteorological variables required by the crop models included in dssat e g oilcrop sun villalobos et al 1996 but lack air humidity and wind speed that are required for models that make use of the penman monteith equation e g olivecan lÃ³pez bernal et al 2018 or when calculating crop water requirements villalobos et al 2016 the objectives of this work were a to correct the overdispersion of rainfall in simmeteo b to link the generation of solar radiation to the daily temperature range c to add the generation of air humidity and wind speed to the weather generator and d to test the resulting weather generator the testing included both the comparison of the statistics of actual and synthetic weather and the performance of synthetic weather on crop simulation outputs of a perennial crop olive the new proposed wg is called climasg 2 materials and methods 2 1 theory 2 1 1 statistics of monthly rainfall according to katz 1977 the distribution of total rainfall in a given month of duration n has a mean of 1 Î¼ npf where f is the fraction of wet days and p is mean rainfall per wet day mm during that period while the variance is 2 Ï 2 n p 2 Ï p 2 f p 2 f 2 2 d 1 d p 2 f 1 f where d p ww p dw p ww is the transition probability from wet to wet day p dw is the transition probability from dry to wet day and Ï p 2 is the variance of rainfall per wet day the coefficient of variation of total rainfall during the month will be given by 3 cv 2 1 fn cv p 2 1 d 1 d 1 f where cvp 2 Ïp 2 p2 geng et al 1986 assumed that the distribution of rainfall per wet day follows a gamma distribution with parameters Î± and Î² where the mean is Î± Î² and the variance is Î± Î²2 therefore 4 cv p 2 1 Î± geng et al 1986 found an empirical relationship 5 1 Î± 2 16 p 1 83 and also from the empirical relationships between the transition probabilities and the frequency of rainfall found by geng et al 1986 we may deduce 6 1 d 1 d 5 3 therefore the coefficient of variation of rainfall for the period will be 7 cv 2 1 fn 2 16 p 1 83 5 3 1 f and the variance of monthly rainfall originated by the weather generator will be 8 Ï 2 nf p 2 2 16 p 1 83 5 3 1 f the variance of annual rainfall for the synthetic data will be the sum of the monthly variances 9 Ï ann 2 1 12 Ï i 2 matching the actual variance v2 requires adding an additional variance v2 Ï2 ann to preserve the distribution of rainfall per wet day the variance is increased by adding a low frequency component to the frequency of wet days with a variance 10 Ï f 2 v 2 Ï ann 2 12 n 2 p m 2 hansen and mavromatis 2001 also proposed the addition of a low frequency component to reduce overdispersion which has to be parameterized with the observed monthly time series in our approach only the observed variance of monthly temperature needs to be known see 2 2 2 1 2 simulation of solar radiation and temperature after generating tmax and tmin rs is generated as 11 r s c t max t min Ï Îµ v c d 0 5 Ï Îµ v where c is the ratio between mean solar radiation and the mean d0 5 in this period ÏÎµ is a corrected standard deviation of rs and v is a random standard normal variate to keep the same standard deviation as in the original simmeteo 12 Ï Îµ 2 0 824 sdr 2 1 28 Î³ 2 r sm d 0 5 2 sdt 2 where Î³ is the ratio of the standard deviation of d0 5 and the standard deviation of d sdr is the standard deviation of daily solar radiation and sdt is the standard deviation of temperature as Î³ cannot be determined analytically it is obtained by randomly generating d using the mean d and a standard deviation of 1 13 sdt 2 1 3 simulation of air humidity mean daily vapor pressure e d is assumed to be proportional to saturated vapor pressure at minimum temperature e sn with a coefficient that is calculated using the monthly mean values 13 e d e dm e snm e s n where e dm is the monthly mean vapor pressure and e sdm is the saturated vapor pressure at the mean minimum temperature the only additional input for the weather generator is e dm 2 1 4 simulation of wind speed daily mean wind speed u is generated using the rayleigh distribution hennessey 1978 therefore u is calculated using the inverse cumulative distribution function as 14 u 2 Ï u m ln r 1 where u m is actual mean monthly wind speed and r is a random number from the 0 1 uniform distribution 2 2 data mean monthly values of maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation rainfall vapor pressure and wind speed which are required as inputs for the weather generator were collected from climwat the fao agroclimatic data set smith 1993 which includes 4275 weather stations from all around the world this data set does not provide number of rainy days per month so its value was calculated according to legates 1995 the additional parameter required for rainfall simulation Ïf 2 was calculated for each of the 4275 stations using data from the monthly global precipitation and temperature data set with 0 5Âº resolution of ncar matsuura and ncar 2017 in the period 1988 2017 2 3 software development and availability climasg was produced as a single windows program developed with visual studio 2019 and can be downloaded for free at the official web page of the university of cÃ³rdoba https www uco es fitotecnia climasg html with versions in english spanish french and portuguese the program allows the user to generate weather data from the complete data base 4275 stations of mean monthly values of maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation rainfall number of rainy days vapour pressure and wind speed monthly values of the aforementioned variables are required to generate weather series for a new location additionally the program offers the possibility of perturbing the statistics of temperature and precipitation tutorials for the main versions of climasg are available in youtube channel id ucukxm6rhraelz8 xvpdr1oq 2 4 model testing daily maximum and minimum temperature and rainfall were retrieved from noaa https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web for all the stations in the climwat database that included the period 1988 2017 and had less than 10 missing data totalling 547 stations these stations were used to test generated rainfall and temperatures in this regard the mean and standard deviation of monthly average maximum and minimum temperature number of rainy days and rainfall were computed for the actual and the synthetic data sets generated with both climasg and simmeteo the latter serving as a reference the same was done for annual minimum temperature date of first and last frost and frequency of frost per year the statistic e g mean of synthetic data was regressed against the same statistic of the actual weather series for instance the standard deviation of synthetic minimum temperature in all months and all stations was regressed against the standard deviation of actual tmin the synthetic and actual statistics were also compared using the mean absolute error mae mean bias error mbe and root mean square error rmse a more restricted data set was compiled for testing generated solar radiation vapor pressure and wind speed data from spain 46 stations were downloaded from siar 2022 and data from california 13 stations one per region were taken from cimis 2022 fig 1 the length of the data sets was typically close to 15 years for spain and 30 years for california finally actual and synthetic weather data were used as input for calculating reference evapotranspiration with the penman monteith equation et0 which is a critical factor in the calculation of crop water requirements villalobos et al 2016 maximum mean monthly et0 and maximum daily et0 95 probability value in the month of july northern latitudes were compared for actual and generated data 2 5 model testing for crop simulation to evaluate the suitability of climasg generated data for crop modelling purposes we used olivecan lÃ³pez bernal et al 2018 a process based model of olive trees the model simulates the main components of the water and carbon balances of olive orchards and enables the user to assess the impacts of environmental conditions and management operations on tree growth development and yield both under potential and water limiting conditions the model requires weather soil environmental and orchard management inputs maximum and minimum air temperatures average vapor pressure solar radiation average wind speed and precipitation are inputs at daily time step olivecan was run with either actual or synthetic data from several locations within the main olive growing regions in spain 10 locations with around 15 years of data each the country with the highest acreage devoted to this tree crop two contrasting olive orchards were simulated a rainfed low density orchard ld 100 trees ha 1 with 25 ground cover and b superhigh density drip irrigated orchard shd 1650 trees ha 1 with 45 ground cover we used a medium texture soil of 1 m depth soil water content at the permanent wilting point field capacity and saturation were set to 0 10 0 21 and 0 31 cm3 cm 3 for each location simulated yields using synthetic data were compared to those obtained with actual weather series in terms of average values and coefficient of variation cv furthermore yield distributions were compared using the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test ks at a 5 level for each olive orchard typology and for each station ks is applied on the empirical cumulative distribution function of actual and synthetic yield datasets with the null hypothesis being that the two datasets come from the same distribution 3 results 3 1 variability of mean daily temperature the mae of the standard deviation of mean daily temperature was 0 3Âºc for dry and 0 76Âºc for wet days the frequency distributions show that 63 of errors were positive for dry days fig 2a and 89 for wet days fig 2b 3 2 extreme temperatures descriptive statistics of regression analysis between generated and actual data showed that both climasg and simmeteo were able to reproduce the mean maximum and minimum temperatures presenting high r2 slope near unity and intercept close to zero table 2 the simulation of extreme variables associated with minimum daily air temperature was assessed by analyzing absolute minimum temperature and events of frost in this regard climasg and simmeteo did not reproduce well the variables evaluated showing high bias likewise both weather generators performed poorly in the generation of frost events presenting moderately high errors table 2 3 3 statistics of monthly rainfall on the one hand linear regression

9411,a new stochastic weather generator climasg is presented and evaluated under a wide range of climates the model requires monthly means data as inputs to generate daily weather data validation tests revealed that climasg performed well in capturing monthly rainfall variability but showed some limitations for generating extreme temperatures solar radiation air humidity and wind speed were reproduced acceptably the weather generator was particularly accurate in predicting mean and extreme values of et0 which indicates that climasg may be used as the basis for calculating crop water requirements and for irrigation design and planning purposes the suitability of synthetic weather series generated with climasg for crop modelling applications was further assessed by running the model olivecan for low density rainfed ld and super high density irrigated shd olive orchards for several locations in spain yield distributions simulated with synthetic weather rarely differed significantly from those obtained with actual weather data although the coefficient of variation cv was usually underestimated considering its low input requirements and satisfactory performance climasg represents a promising source of weather data for different practical applications keywords weather generator stochastic model overdispersion olea europaea crop modelling data availability data will be available on request the weather generator can be downloaded for free at https www uco es fitotecnia climasg html 1 introduction modelling the productivity and irrigation requirements of agricultural crops is restricted by our ability to develop robust simulation tools but more importantly by the availability of adequate weather data many regions worldwide lack reliable meteorological observation systems which are vital for supplying long term quality meteorological series therefore daily weather data are frequently not available too short in time span or show significant problems related to data quality homogeneity and gaps in data continuity this led to the development of weather generators wgs of various complexities able to synthetically simulate site specific and long term weather data based on historical observations table 1 wgs are used extensively in agricultural hydrological and ecologically related studies paschalis et al 2014 shlabing et al 2014 liben et al 2018 moreover wgs are also used to downscale global or regional circulation model data to local scale for impact assessment studies wilks 1999 fatichi et al 2011 kim and ivanov 2015 weather generators may follow stochastic statistical or physical dynamical approaches and have been developed with different input requirements some require long time series of weather data in order to reproduce natural climate variability and hence approximate actual daily weather patterns most wgs are based on stochastic statistical approaches that simulate actual weather variability by preserving statistical properties of observed weather wgen richardson 1981 is one of the first developed stochastic weather generators swg that has been widely used not only in simulating missing weather data but also in downscaling global circulation models data for impact assessment studies e g wilby et al 1998 wgen has served as the basis for many other swg s e g marksim jones and thornton 2000 geng et al 1998 developed simmeteo an adaptation of wgen that simplifies parameterization using only monthly mean values of rainfall temperature and solar radiation as inputs this program has become a standard for generating weather data for crop simulation since it was adopted as the default in dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer jones et al 2003 high quality weather generators should produce data sets that are statistically equal to real series in many studies only the main statistics mean standard deviation are compared e g hansen and mavromatis 2001 but frequency distributions should also be evaluated soltani and hoogenboom 2003 a common problem of many weather generators is the underestimation of inter annual variance in monthly and annual total rainfall buishand 1978 gregory et al 1993 a phenomenon called overdispersion in statistics e g cox 1983 this is frequently related to the use of a first order markov chain for simulating the occurrence of rainy days and may be mitigated by using a higher order markov chain katz and parlange 1998 chen et al 2012 however more complex models cannot be parameterized with only mean values of monthly rainfall and the number of rainy days as in simmeteo overdispersion has also been found in air temperature mason 2004 this may be caused by the general use of the normal distribution for maximum and minimum temperature in most swg s harmel et al 2002 apart from the direct comparison of real and synthetic weather data the quality of the weather generator should be evaluated on its intended use i e which model will be fed with synthetic weather the sensitivity of the model to each weather variable will determine the tolerance for the weather generator however as the sensitivity is often asymmetric and crop models include so many feedbacks the only way to evaluate the quality of weather generators for crop modelling is to compare the outputs obtained with real and synthetic data soltani et al 2000 in fact the non linearity of interactions in crop climate models highlights the importance of preserving weather patterns since the climatic variability can have a profound effect on the estimation of agricultural production semenov and porter 1995 porter and semenov 2005 van wart et al 2015 moreover the impact of overdispersion of rainfall on crop simulation analyses depends on environmental and management factors for instance in dry rainfed areas the frequency of dry years with very low yield will be underestimated with synthetic weather so average yield will be overestimated and yield variance will be underestimated therefore analyses on yield stability or sustainability using crop models will be biased in simmeteo and wgen maximum tx and minimum temperature tn and solar radiation rs are generated as normal variables with fixed values of cross and auto correlation the result is that generated rs will not be correlated with the temperature range d tx tn which is unrealistic actually the ratio of actual to extraterrestrial radiation is linearly related to d0 5 which is the basis for the hargreaves method for estimating solar radiation hargreaves and samani 1985 the relevance of this problem will depend on the crop simulation model or the process to be considered villalobos and fereres 1989 for a given mean temperature and mean vapor pressure sunny days will have higher temperatures than cloudy days during the daytime when photosynthesis and transpiration occur and vapor pressure deficit will be higher too the expected result would be that the distribution of calculated transpiration will have both smaller mean and variance when generated weather is used simple weather generators like simmeteo provide all the meteorological variables required by the crop models included in dssat e g oilcrop sun villalobos et al 1996 but lack air humidity and wind speed that are required for models that make use of the penman monteith equation e g olivecan lÃ³pez bernal et al 2018 or when calculating crop water requirements villalobos et al 2016 the objectives of this work were a to correct the overdispersion of rainfall in simmeteo b to link the generation of solar radiation to the daily temperature range c to add the generation of air humidity and wind speed to the weather generator and d to test the resulting weather generator the testing included both the comparison of the statistics of actual and synthetic weather and the performance of synthetic weather on crop simulation outputs of a perennial crop olive the new proposed wg is called climasg 2 materials and methods 2 1 theory 2 1 1 statistics of monthly rainfall according to katz 1977 the distribution of total rainfall in a given month of duration n has a mean of 1 Î¼ npf where f is the fraction of wet days and p is mean rainfall per wet day mm during that period while the variance is 2 Ï 2 n p 2 Ï p 2 f p 2 f 2 2 d 1 d p 2 f 1 f where d p ww p dw p ww is the transition probability from wet to wet day p dw is the transition probability from dry to wet day and Ï p 2 is the variance of rainfall per wet day the coefficient of variation of total rainfall during the month will be given by 3 cv 2 1 fn cv p 2 1 d 1 d 1 f where cvp 2 Ïp 2 p2 geng et al 1986 assumed that the distribution of rainfall per wet day follows a gamma distribution with parameters Î± and Î² where the mean is Î± Î² and the variance is Î± Î²2 therefore 4 cv p 2 1 Î± geng et al 1986 found an empirical relationship 5 1 Î± 2 16 p 1 83 and also from the empirical relationships between the transition probabilities and the frequency of rainfall found by geng et al 1986 we may deduce 6 1 d 1 d 5 3 therefore the coefficient of variation of rainfall for the period will be 7 cv 2 1 fn 2 16 p 1 83 5 3 1 f and the variance of monthly rainfall originated by the weather generator will be 8 Ï 2 nf p 2 2 16 p 1 83 5 3 1 f the variance of annual rainfall for the synthetic data will be the sum of the monthly variances 9 Ï ann 2 1 12 Ï i 2 matching the actual variance v2 requires adding an additional variance v2 Ï2 ann to preserve the distribution of rainfall per wet day the variance is increased by adding a low frequency component to the frequency of wet days with a variance 10 Ï f 2 v 2 Ï ann 2 12 n 2 p m 2 hansen and mavromatis 2001 also proposed the addition of a low frequency component to reduce overdispersion which has to be parameterized with the observed monthly time series in our approach only the observed variance of monthly temperature needs to be known see 2 2 2 1 2 simulation of solar radiation and temperature after generating tmax and tmin rs is generated as 11 r s c t max t min Ï Îµ v c d 0 5 Ï Îµ v where c is the ratio between mean solar radiation and the mean d0 5 in this period ÏÎµ is a corrected standard deviation of rs and v is a random standard normal variate to keep the same standard deviation as in the original simmeteo 12 Ï Îµ 2 0 824 sdr 2 1 28 Î³ 2 r sm d 0 5 2 sdt 2 where Î³ is the ratio of the standard deviation of d0 5 and the standard deviation of d sdr is the standard deviation of daily solar radiation and sdt is the standard deviation of temperature as Î³ cannot be determined analytically it is obtained by randomly generating d using the mean d and a standard deviation of 1 13 sdt 2 1 3 simulation of air humidity mean daily vapor pressure e d is assumed to be proportional to saturated vapor pressure at minimum temperature e sn with a coefficient that is calculated using the monthly mean values 13 e d e dm e snm e s n where e dm is the monthly mean vapor pressure and e sdm is the saturated vapor pressure at the mean minimum temperature the only additional input for the weather generator is e dm 2 1 4 simulation of wind speed daily mean wind speed u is generated using the rayleigh distribution hennessey 1978 therefore u is calculated using the inverse cumulative distribution function as 14 u 2 Ï u m ln r 1 where u m is actual mean monthly wind speed and r is a random number from the 0 1 uniform distribution 2 2 data mean monthly values of maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation rainfall vapor pressure and wind speed which are required as inputs for the weather generator were collected from climwat the fao agroclimatic data set smith 1993 which includes 4275 weather stations from all around the world this data set does not provide number of rainy days per month so its value was calculated according to legates 1995 the additional parameter required for rainfall simulation Ïf 2 was calculated for each of the 4275 stations using data from the monthly global precipitation and temperature data set with 0 5Âº resolution of ncar matsuura and ncar 2017 in the period 1988 2017 2 3 software development and availability climasg was produced as a single windows program developed with visual studio 2019 and can be downloaded for free at the official web page of the university of cÃ³rdoba https www uco es fitotecnia climasg html with versions in english spanish french and portuguese the program allows the user to generate weather data from the complete data base 4275 stations of mean monthly values of maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation rainfall number of rainy days vapour pressure and wind speed monthly values of the aforementioned variables are required to generate weather series for a new location additionally the program offers the possibility of perturbing the statistics of temperature and precipitation tutorials for the main versions of climasg are available in youtube channel id ucukxm6rhraelz8 xvpdr1oq 2 4 model testing daily maximum and minimum temperature and rainfall were retrieved from noaa https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web for all the stations in the climwat database that included the period 1988 2017 and had less than 10 missing data totalling 547 stations these stations were used to test generated rainfall and temperatures in this regard the mean and standard deviation of monthly average maximum and minimum temperature number of rainy days and rainfall were computed for the actual and the synthetic data sets generated with both climasg and simmeteo the latter serving as a reference the same was done for annual minimum temperature date of first and last frost and frequency of frost per year the statistic e g mean of synthetic data was regressed against the same statistic of the actual weather series for instance the standard deviation of synthetic minimum temperature in all months and all stations was regressed against the standard deviation of actual tmin the synthetic and actual statistics were also compared using the mean absolute error mae mean bias error mbe and root mean square error rmse a more restricted data set was compiled for testing generated solar radiation vapor pressure and wind speed data from spain 46 stations were downloaded from siar 2022 and data from california 13 stations one per region were taken from cimis 2022 fig 1 the length of the data sets was typically close to 15 years for spain and 30 years for california finally actual and synthetic weather data were used as input for calculating reference evapotranspiration with the penman monteith equation et0 which is a critical factor in the calculation of crop water requirements villalobos et al 2016 maximum mean monthly et0 and maximum daily et0 95 probability value in the month of july northern latitudes were compared for actual and generated data 2 5 model testing for crop simulation to evaluate the suitability of climasg generated data for crop modelling purposes we used olivecan lÃ³pez bernal et al 2018 a process based model of olive trees the model simulates the main components of the water and carbon balances of olive orchards and enables the user to assess the impacts of environmental conditions and management operations on tree growth development and yield both under potential and water limiting conditions the model requires weather soil environmental and orchard management inputs maximum and minimum air temperatures average vapor pressure solar radiation average wind speed and precipitation are inputs at daily time step olivecan was run with either actual or synthetic data from several locations within the main olive growing regions in spain 10 locations with around 15 years of data each the country with the highest acreage devoted to this tree crop two contrasting olive orchards were simulated a rainfed low density orchard ld 100 trees ha 1 with 25 ground cover and b superhigh density drip irrigated orchard shd 1650 trees ha 1 with 45 ground cover we used a medium texture soil of 1 m depth soil water content at the permanent wilting point field capacity and saturation were set to 0 10 0 21 and 0 31 cm3 cm 3 for each location simulated yields using synthetic data were compared to those obtained with actual weather series in terms of average values and coefficient of variation cv furthermore yield distributions were compared using the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test ks at a 5 level for each olive orchard typology and for each station ks is applied on the empirical cumulative distribution function of actual and synthetic yield datasets with the null hypothesis being that the two datasets come from the same distribution 3 results 3 1 variability of mean daily temperature the mae of the standard deviation of mean daily temperature was 0 3Âºc for dry and 0 76Âºc for wet days the frequency distributions show that 63 of errors were positive for dry days fig 2a and 89 for wet days fig 2b 3 2 extreme temperatures descriptive statistics of regression analysis between generated and actual data showed that both climasg and simmeteo were able to reproduce the mean maximum and minimum temperatures presenting high r2 slope near unity and intercept close to zero table 2 the simulation of extreme variables associated with minimum daily air temperature was assessed by analyzing absolute minimum temperature and events of frost in this regard climasg and simmeteo did not reproduce well the variables evaluated showing high bias likewise both weather generators performed poorly in the generation of frost events presenting moderately high errors table 2 3 3 statistics of monthly rainfall on the one hand linear regression analysis between synthetic and actual series of monthly rainfall data revealed much better results lower bias slope closer to unity and intercept closer to zero for climasg with respect to simmeteo table 3 on the other both weather generators led to similarly good results when reproducing the number of rainy days 3 4 statistics of solar radiation wind speed vapor pressure and et0 climasg showed good results in generating mean values of solar radiation wind speed vapor pressure and et0 with high r2 slope near unity and intercept close to zero table 4 but it did not reproduce these parameters standard deviations robustly 3 5 extreme values of et0 climasg showed a good performance in reproducing extremes of et0 in terms of mean and standard deviation with low errors for the studied locations of spain and california table 5 3 6 olive yield in general the ks tests showed that simulated yield distributions using synthetic data did not differ significantly from those obtained using actual weather series there was only one exception in the simulations of the shd orchard in sevilla tablada with synthetic data leading to statistically different yield distributions table 6 the use

the orchard typology for the remaining locations relative differences in average yields among weather sets were lower than 10 table a 1 finally the box plots presented in fig 3 show that the interquartile range box is often narrower for synthetic yield compared to actual yield on average the cvs of yield in ld orchards were 32 and 24 for simulations with actual and synthetic weather sets respectively table a 2 cvs were a bit lower for shd simulations which is mainly attributed to the fact that irrigation reduces the yield dependence from rainfall the latter presenting a high

9412,production of vegetables for fresh consumption in arid regions is usually done in greenhouses fitted with evaporative cooling which does strain the scarce water resource in those areas so much that lack of water frequently becomes the limiting factor greenhouses fit with sufficient mechanical cooling capacity closed semi closed greenhouses not only dispose of the need for evaporative cooling but also allow for recovery of the water transpired by the crop as condense on the mechanical cooling and dehumidification system the purpose of this paper is to investigate the trade off between resources water and electricity within a closed greenhouse and evaluate its potential as the ultimate water saving production system after a series of 8 closed greenhouse trials in a desert environment in riyadh ksa benchmark numbers on water and energy use of such a system were established thanks to the recollection of more than 80 of the water supplied to the crop production of 1 kg of fresh tomatoes was achieved at the expense of 4 2 l of water which is 10 times lower that the lowest reported in evaporatively cooled greenhouses and 40 times lower than commercial practice in similar weather conditions on the other hand the required electricity use was about 8 kwh per kg of fresh produced tomatoes from energy point of view it is shown that using desalinated water for evaporative cooling reduces the electricity consumption of fresh tomato production to about 1 kwh kg 1 from economic point of view a closed greenhouse might only result in lower variable costs when 10 liters of desalinated water costs more than 1 75 kwh of electricity keywords closed greenhouse product water use water saving water recovery energy use data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction arid and semi arid regions largely depend on imports of fresh vegetables to meet the domestic needs as their local production is not enough fiaz et al 2018 there are numerous reasons varying from vulnerability of transportation routes and fragile international relations elmi 2017 to the environmental impact of food transportation bonÄa et al 2017 indicating that import based food security is far from ideal for any country gulf cooperation countries gcc are a representative example currently importing 80 90 of consumed food is not an issue due to their high buying power but the importance of increasing local production is appreciated and efforts to that direction are made alas without the desired success ben hassen and el bilali 2019 one of the limiting factors for local agricultural production in these regions is water scarcity ben hassen and el bilali 2019 the kingdom of saudi arabia is no exception tomato is the most commonly grown vegetable filling about 40 of the greenhouse area of the country yet in 2018 the quantity of imported tomatoes was 1 9 times the locally produced amount morci et al 2020 meaning that only 34 of the consumed tomatoes is produced locally currently vegetable production in arid and semi arid regions mainly takes place in evaporatively cooled greenhouses however this is only achieved at the expense of large amounts of water cooling water accounts for more than 50 of the total water use in such systems fuchs et al 2006 an evaporative cooling system in mexico area of huejulta consumes 68 and 93 l of water per kg of tomato to limit greenhouse air temperature below 30 and 27 c respectively van kooten et al 2006 in arizona usa 1 kg of fresh tomatoes is produced at the expense of 77 l of water of which more than 80 62 l is used for evaporative cooling kubota et al 2006 sabeh et al 2011 2007 commercial growers in saudi arabia report that about 170 l of water are used for the production of 1 kg tomatoes grown in plastic tunnels cooled with pad and fan systems communication of estidamah with local commercial growers a combination of high cooling demand and low production water use could be the main criterion to evaluate production systems for arid areas the volume of water necessary to produce 1 kg of fresh product is defined as product water use pwu hoekstra and hung 2005 theoretically in a perfectly closed loop when no water escapes to the environment the pwu of a vegetable crop should be the reciprocal of its harvest index in case of long season indetermined round tomatoes fruits represent about 80 of the total fresh plant weight de koning 1994 heuvelink 2018 this is translated to a theoretical minimum pwu of 1 25 l of water for each kg of fresh tomatoes however as greenhouses are generally not closed and in arid countries use additional water for evaporative cooling the pwu realised in commercial greenhouses is much higher in dutch greenhouses with and without re use of drain water 1 kg of fresh tomatoes is produced in expense of 15 and 22 l of water respectively namely the amount of water used by the fertigation system van kooten et al 2008 the larger amount by far of the difference between theoretical and practically achieved pwu is explained by crop transpiration which consumes about 90 of the water taken up by the crop stanghellini 2014 in arid and semi arid regions where evaporative cooling is commonly applied the water use for cooling is added to the irrigation in order to compute the total water use obviously pwu can be largely reduced by targeting the aforementioned major components of water consumption namely crop transpiration and water use in evaporative cooling katsoulas et al 2015 computed the water saving achieved thanks to reduced ventilation and recapturing of transpired water vapor as a function of installed cooling capacity in semi closed greenhouses they reported that up to about 2 and 4 times lower pwu can be achieved for the production of tomatoes in the netherlands and in the mediterranean greece and algeria respectively when cooling with capacity of 700 w m 2 was applied compared to natural ventilation as the one cooling process the closed greenhouse concept allows for recapture of crop transpiration through a dehumidification system and or a mechanical cooling system this is the ultimate water saving greenhouse design as it prevents water leakage outside the greenhouse system research trials in closed greenhouses in the netherlands wageningen ur reported that 40 50 of the water supplied to the crop was recovered as condensation of transpired vapor from the greenhouse air de gelder et al 2012 opdam schoonderbeek heller de gelder 2005 similar amounts of recovered water were also reported by commercial closed greenhouses in the netherlands themato bv resulting to a final pwu of about 4 l kg 1 van kooten et al 2008 additional advantages of the closed greenhouse compared to ventilated greenhouses include a the low presence of pests and diseases due to the little connection with the outside environments which can then reduce the use of pesticides by up to 80 opdam et al 2005 and b the possibility of maintaining elevated co2 concentrations resulting in higher crop growth and production however a mechanical cooling and dehumidification system is much more energy demanding in comparison to an evaporative cooling system in arid or semi arid regions water is scarce but there is potentially an abundance of sustainable energy due to the large amount of sun shine moreover electricity demand for cooling largely lines up with electricity produced by solar panels therefore the closed greenhouse concept seems a good match to the knowledge of the authors there is not yet scientific literature providing quantitative understanding of the water and energy flows involved in closed greenhouses in arid regions nor of the trade off involved the current study aims to close this gap by quantifying and evaluating the operation and resource use of a closed greenhouse in an urban desert area in saudi arabia information from multiple research trials are collected and presented in order to quantify the pwu that can be achieved in practice in a mechanically cooled greenhouse and the amount of electricity required for cooling the mass balance of water is computed in order to estimate accurately the pwu and quantify every flow finally the energy use required to support the achieved water savings is presented and the closed greenhouse is compared with evaporatively cooled greenhouses in terms of water use energy use and productivity 2 materials and methods the data presented in the current study were collected during four tomato experiments from now on indicated as a b c and d of various nature at the national research and development center for sustainable agriculture estidamah in riyadh 24 7 n 46 7 e saudi arabia all experiments were carried out in two identical greenhouse compartments with only one factor treatment different co2 concentration use of artificial illumination crop protection during each experiment the present study does not focus on the different treatments but only on the water and energy balances and the resource use per compartment so the collected data set includes data from 8 different tomato cultivations grown for periods varying from 6 to 12 5 months table 1 2 1 greenhouses and climate control equipment the greenhouse is a venlo type glasshouse gutter height of 6 5 m and span width of 4 m covered with tempered diffuse glass each compartment is 25 m x 16 m of which 336 mÂ² is growing area equipped with heating rail and grow pipes high pressure fogging system 0 4 l m 2 h 1 shading screen 50 shading percentage enrichment with liquid co2 and mechanical cooling the air conditioning consists of 10 air treatment units thermokey per compartment with a total capacity of around 700 w m 2 placed close to the greenhouse cover and a dehumidification system condensation on cold surface with capacity 4000 m3 h 1 with a maximum condensation discharge rate of 16 l h 1 that distributes the treated air through five ducts placed under the growing gutters this therefore provides a dehumidification capacity of 48 g per mÂ² growing area per hour the condensate from all coolers and dehumidification is collected and reused in the greenhouse system as fresh water for irrigation the cooling capacity was sufficient for the greenhouses to operate fully closed that is no air exchange with the outside environment except for some inevitable leakage nevertheless in three of the four trials night time ventilation was applied for 1 2 h for crop management purposes in all experiments the crop was round tomato harvested as loose the tomatoes were transplanted about 30 days after sowing and they were grown on stone wool in hanging gutters fitted with recollection of drain the plant density was 2 5 stems per mÂ² and additional stems were kept in order to end up with a stem density of 4 5 stems per mÂ² in each trial the fresh yield per crop row was weighted and recorded at each harvest usually twice per week and the average of all crop rows excluding the side rows was used as greenhouse yield although the cultivars varied somehow among experiments it was always the same combination of cultivar s in each one of the two compartments 2 2 climate and fertigation settings the climate and fertigation control as well as the data collection were arranged through a greenhouse process control computer ridder multima in each greenhouse there were 3 ventilated measuring boxes to record the temperature and humidity values and one measuring box to record co2 concentration all measuring boxes were placed in the central crop row and they were maintained at the height of the top of the crop the average of all 3 measurements was used for climate control purposes the temperature was maintained between 25 and 28 c during the day and between 18 and 20 c during the night the relative humidity was fluctuating between 80 and 95 the cooling setpoint was set at 26 c during the day and 19 c during the night period with small variations for crop steering purposes fogging was used only at the beginning of the growing season to increase humidity later on it was hardly required as the transpiration of the crop was sufficient to prevent too low humidity values in the greenhouse the shading screen was used during the first two months of each trial whenever global radiation exceeded 800 w m 2 the irrigation water including liquid fertilizers was supplied through drip irrigation the ph and ec of the irrigation and drain as well as the concentration of each individual macro and micro nutrient were monitored on a regular basis to ensure that the crop would not face any deficiency the irrigation supply was optimized during all trials to ensure that it would not hamper the plant growth and production specifically the irrigation was controlled automatically based on external sun radiation in order to match crop s needs starting with smaller amounts about 0 5 cc per joule for young crops and increasing gradually to follow the growth of the crop reaching about 4 cc per joule for a fully grown crop while maintaining a drain percentage of 25 30 the source of irrigation water and the water used in the fogging system was the municipal supply and it was first treated with a reverse osmosis ro unit the water collected by the cooling dehumidification units as well as the drain from the greenhouses was reused the latter after uv disinfection as shown schematically in fig 1 2 3 calculation of water flows the detailed recording of water supply irrigation fogging and water recovery drain condensation allows the computation of water use and also water mass balance to get insight into the water use of the crop in general as well as individual crop processes specifically the amount of water taken up by the crop can be computed and it is also possible to estimate how much of this water was transpired and how much was invested in fresh weight growth this information enlightens the achieved pwu and how it is affected by the used technological equipment 2 3 1 water use the water use wu of each compartment was calculated as the water input to the system minus the amount of water that was collected and reused eq 1 specifically the water input consisted of the water supplied for irrigation wi and the water used by the fogging system wf which were individually measured the reused water consisted of the drain water wd which was measured and the condensed water collected by the mechanical cooling and the dehumidification system which were measured together wc 1 wu wi wf wd wc the condensation on greenhouse cover is not included in the computations as given the high outside air temperature usually warmer than inside the temperature of the cover hardly ever would fall below dewpoint temperature so the amount of condense on the cover would be anyhow small and was never enough to run off therefore any condensed water is re evaporated and either condensed again on the dehumidification or cooling system where it would be measured or it escapes via leakage or ventilation adding to the water use 2 3 2 water leakage the wu as computed in eq 1 consists of the water stored in the crop as fresh weight growth and the water vapor escaped from the greenhouse through leakage and or ventilation greenhouse leakage air exchange in absence of intentional ventilation was estimated based on the decay method described by baptista bailey randall and meneses baptista et al 1999 and by using co2 as tracer gas according to this method the tracer gas co2 in our case is injected until a certain concentration is reached and then the decay of its concentration is monitored until the latter reaches about 80 of its initial value the leakage ventilation can be determined by fitting a linear regression to the time interval that the natural logarithm of the difference of the concentration of the tracer gas inside and outside the greenhouse decreases linearly with time eq 2 the regression coefficient equals the air exchange rate 2 ln co 2 in co 2 out l h t a where co2 in and co2 out is the concentration of co2 inside the greenhouse and outside respectively l is the greenhouse leakage in mÂ³ mÂ² hr h is the height of the greenhouse 6 75 m t is the time in hours and a is a regression constant air leakage changes may be affected by wind speed therefore to account for variable weather conditions the described method was repeated for several days obviously in the absence of a crop in the greenhouse during a period of 10 days in may 2018 the greenhouse was kept closed and the co2 concentration was raised to 1200 ppm then the rate of concentration drop was calculated until the concentration reached 800 ppm the same trial was repeated for 10 days in april 2021 to assess the possible effect of greenhouse aging on leakage ventilation as a difference increased leakage was indeed observed for the trials performed between 2018 and 2021 the leakage was estimated through interpolation to calculate leakage at any moment leakage ventilation was assumed to increase linearly with wind speed as described by baptista et al baptista et al 1999 and calculated to increase with a rate of 0 095 mÂ³ mÂ² hr for every 1 m s 1 increase in wind speed 2 3 3 water loss through ventilation for the time period when the windows were opened the vapor loss through ventilation was computed via the air exchange rate and the difference of the absolute humidity between greenhouse air and outside air for the computation of air exchange rate the ventilation model described by de zwart 1996 was used according to this model the air exchange rate consists of 2 components namely the wind driven Ïwind and temperature difference driven Ïtemp air exchange these components of air exchange were computed separately also separate computations were performed for the leeward and windward side of vents and finally all components were combined into one using a vector like summation eq 3 3 Ï v e n t Ï w i n d 2 Ï t e m p w Ï t e m p l 2 m 3 s 1 w i n d o w 1 the components of air exchange are calculated based on the window opening angle on the windward Î¸w and leeward side Î¸l the dimensions of the window length l width w the slope of greenhouse roof s the temperature difference between greenhouse air and outside environment Î´t and the wind speed u as follows 4 Ï w i n d 2 29 10 2 1 e x p Î¸ l 21 1 1 2 10 3 Î¸ w e x p Î¸ w 211 l w u m 3 s 1 w i n d o w 1 5 Ï t e m p c f l 3 g Î² Î´ t 0 5 w sin Î¸ sin s Î¸ 1 5 m 3 s 1 w i n d o w 1 where cf is a constant related to the energy discharge caused by friction value of 0 6 used g is the gravitational acceleration ms 2 and Î² is the thermal expansion coefficient 3 3 10 3 k 1 eq 4 computes the sum of leeward first part and windward second part wind driven air exchange obviously by applying the window opening angle on the windward Î¸w and leeward side Î¸l on eq 5 the temperature driven air exchange on the windward Ïtemp w and leeward Ïtemp l side respectively can be calculated 2 4 energy use estimation of energy use for cooling and dehumidification is crucial as this is the resource with the highest consumption in exchange for the achieved water saving the amount of heat removed from the greenhouse is computed based on the temperatures of the supplied and return water to from the cooling and dehumidification system and the flow of water going through the system these data are recorded in the process control computer although the cooling and dehumidification are two independent systems that can be also operated independently in the present paper they are mostly discussed together as under the conditions used they are mainly operating complementary to each other in other words the dehumidification system also acts as a cooling system unless the dehumidified air is reheated which was not the case for the vast majority of the analyzed period and the cooling system also obviously acts as a dehumidification system finally the computed heat removal from both systems was transformed to electricity consumption by using an estimated coefficient of performance cop value this cop considers the electricity use of the chillers the fans of the heat exchanger and the water circulation pumps on top of that an additional electricity use of some 20 w m 2 is added to account for the electricity use of the air conditioning units in the greenhouse this value is obtained from measurements performed in the greenhouse the computation of cop is based on the carnot efficiency using as inputs the temperature at the warm side of the chiller twarm and the cooled water temperature tcool eq 6 the latter tcool is measured and recorded in the process control computer while the former twarm is estimated by assuming that the warm side of the chiller is some 10 c above outside air temperature this temperature difference results in computed cop values well in agreement with reference values provided by chiller manufacturers as soon as real systems cannot operate at the ideal carnot cycle and they operate at some fraction of it an efficiency term e is also included in the cop computation for the computation of cop the efficiency of the cooling system e was assumed equal to 0 4 meggers et al 2012 6 cop cooling e t cool t warm t cool since the outside temperature fluctuates over the day also the cop does the cop is calculated on 5 min basis to capture the natural temperature variation 3 results 3 1 crop yield the achieved crop yield varied among the different trials between 28 and 86 kg mÂ² fig 2 the larger part of this difference was caused by the different length of the trials table 1 therefore the average productivity of each crop in kg of fresh product per week is also presented the different treatments applied as well as factors such as presence of diseases affected to some extent the crop productivity with the average production per week varying between 1 5 and 2 2 kg m 2 per week the season in the year also influenced the weekly yield as a result of different amount of solar radiation fig 3 the highest yield and highest average productivity were achieved in trial d 3 2 water use 3 2 1 water input and water recovery the absolute amount of water input to the greenhouses varied between the different trials sum of the bars at the left part of fig 4 in all trials the contribution of fogging to the total water use was negligible 1 or less therefore the water input to the greenhouses was equal to the irrigation water the difference among the four trials can be mainly explained by the different duration of the trails as well as the season of the year each trial was done the duration of trials a and b was less than c and d and not done during the whole summer season which is the most water demanding due to the higher amount of solar radiation fig 3 if the total water input is expressed in relation to the amount of radiation then it was similar in the first three trials and it was higher in the fourth trial due to higher maintained leaf area index resulting in higher crop transpiration specifically during trials a b and c irrigation was about 270 ml per mj of sun radiation of which about 200 ml were taken up by the crop in trial d the irrigation was about 370 ml per mj but the drain percentage was comparable to the previous trials meaning that the crop uptake was also higher reaching 270 ml per mj the vast majority 85 on average of the water input to the greenhouse was recovered and re used resulting in a final water use which represents on average only 15 of the water applied by the irrigation system blue bars in fig 4 water recollected as drain bars with diagonal stripes was about 25 of the irrigation supply year round the latter was dependent on radiation as described above and varied from about 4 l m 2 d 1 in the winter to 11 l m 2 d 1 in summer the water recovered via condensation bars with vertical stripes was on average 60 of the initial water supply fig 4 cooling and dehumidification is needed year round and water recovery varied from about 3 l m 2 d 1 in the winter to 7 l m 2 d 1 in summer since the crop transpires constantly the dehumidification system was almost continuously in operation according to its specifications it should recapture some 1 15 l m 2 d 1 water at full power the rest of the vapor was collected by the cooling system 3 2 2 water loss through leakage and ventilation water use the water that is not recollected solid blue bars at the bottom in fig 4 is the water stored in the fresh biomass and the vapor lost via ventilation and leakage the amount of final water use as a percentage of the total water input in the system was higher in trials c and d than in trials a and b the major reason for this difference is that starting from trials c and d the vents were opened each night for 1 2 h in order to prevent harmful volatiles ethylene or other gases to accumulate in addition leakage also increased fig 5 the estimated air exchange under low wind conditions less than 1 m s 1 was found to be about 0 24 mÂ³ mÂ² hr in 2018 and 1 7 mÂ³ mÂ² hr in 2021 fig 5 or in other words the aging of the greenhouse resulted in about 7 times more air and vapor losses via leakage in 2021 compared to 2018 such rapid aging can be explained by the extreme weather conditions direct radiation and heat fig 3 to which the rubber sealing of the windows was exposed 3 2 3 product water use combining the water use fig 4 and productivity fig 2 data the pwu for each trial was calculated the pwu varied between the different trials from 2 to 7 4 l kg 1 fig 6 with an average of 4 2 l kg 1 as explained above section 1 the theoretical minimum pwu is the reverse of the harvest index of the crop and for the case of long season indetermined round tomatoes it is about 1 25 l kg m 1 therefore the theoretically minimum required total water use per greenhouse trial can be computed by multiplying the achieved yield with 1 25 in all trials the achieved pwu exceeded the theoretical minimum however for trial a that lasted only about 6 months the harvest index was probably lower than 80 so that in trial a the achieved pwu is very close to what could theoretically have been attained the achieved pwu increases with increasing air exchange fig 7 this air exchange results in vapor loss to the outside environment which explains well why the achieved pwu is higher than the theoretical minimum it can be concluded that for the analyzed greenhouse systems under the weather conditions of riyadh pwu increases by more than 1 l kg 1 for each additional 10 000 m3 m 2 of air exchange fig 7 this is not strange considering that 14 2 gr of water vapor are lost each time that 1 m3 of greenhouse air at 27 c and 80 relative humidity is replaced by 1 m3 of outside air at 37 c and 10 relative humidity 3 2 4 crop transpiration estimating crop transpiration as the amount of vapor collected as condense and the vapor escaped the greenhouse through ventilation and leakage ventilation results in 600 2000 l water per mÂ² depending on the trial this amount equals on average 67 of the water supplied to the crop via irrigation and 91 of the water taken up by the crop or in other words the difference between irrigation and drain only the remaining 9 was used in the biomass the used system of recollecting crop transpiration managed to recover through condensation 82 on average of the transpired water vapor in all trials it is clear that recapturing crop transpiration allows tremendous reduction of water use in a ventilated greenhouse the transpired water would have been released to the environment increasing the water use multiple times 3 3 electricity use the aforementioned water savings can only be achieved at the expense of energy in the form of electricity required to operate the cooling and dehumidification system the cooling energy use varied throughout the year from 25 mj m 2 d 1 in summer to 5 mj m 2 d 1 in winter given the fact that dehumidification is required year round the energy consumption of the dehumidification system was fluctuating less between different months of the year namely between 1 2 and 2 mj m 2 d 1 based on the computed cop the installed cooling and dehumidification equipment consumes from 0 4 to 3 kwh m 2 d 1 depending on the month of the year fig 8 in the performed trials the estimated total electricity use for cooling and dehumidification purposes varied between 230 trial a and 725 trial d kwh m 2 the differences between the trials were obviously predominantly caused by the different length and season of the trials thanks to the condensation on the cooling and dehumidification systems about 500 1500 l m 2 water were recovered and reused on average for every kwh of electricity spent about 2 l of water were recovered fig 9 if the electricity use is expressed in relation to the production of each trial and cultivar the product electricity use peu is calculated in the same way as the pwu the production of each kg of fresh tomatoes was achieved in expense of in average 8 kwh of electricity fig 8 4 discussion after completing a number of different research trials in closed greenhouses in arid conditions over a period of four years benchmark numbers describing the productivity and more importantly the water and electricity use of such a production system under the specified weather conditions are established the detailed recording of the major water flows enabled the accurate estimation of water use crop transpiration and possibilities for water recollection the achieved pwu of 2 7 4 l kg 1 is to the knowledge of the authors the lowest ever reported in an arid environment and the average of 4 2 l kg 1 is some 40 times lower than the reported pwu that commercial growers in the area achieve this number is also similar to the pwu achieved in closed greenhouses in northern latitudes although cooling energy requirements differ of course a lot de gelder et al 2012 opdam et al 2005 the observed range in the achieved pwu was explained by the different ventilation and leakage ventilation of the different trials rather than different varieties or treatments the latter was also ensured by the well controlled factors affecting crop growth such as greenhouse climate fertigation substrate and crop handling which were all optimized and repeatable among the different trials the very small improvement of pwu that could have been attained by allowing the removed leaves to dry in the greenhouse was not deemed worth the increased potential for infection of the removed parts the realized pwu was still above the theoretical minimum as no greenhouse can be completely air tight and vapor losses to the outside cannot be avoided even without any ventilation trial a vapor leakage cannot be completely avoided however the achieved pwu was 10 times lower than the lowest reported in an evaporatively cooled greenhouse in similar climate conditions tsafaras et al 2021 due to i no water used for cooling ii recollection and re use of crop transpiration and iii higher yield due to elevated co2 concentration according to the presented data 91 of the irrigation water consumed by the crop was used for crop transpiration the latter is in agreement with published research stanghellini 2014 confirming the accuracy of the measurements and computations of the water balances recollecting condensation on cooling and dehumidification system allowed the recovery and re use of more than 80 of transpired water with higher values achieved at the trials without any ventilation the achieved pwu was directly related to the amount of air exchange via ventilation and leakage with higher pwu values realized with increased air exchange this finding is well in agreement with the simulation results reported by katsoulas et al 2015 on the other hand mechanical cooling and dehumidification of the closed greenhouse come with an increased electricity use the latter was estimated during the described trials to be on average about 600 kwh m 2 y 1 in the described trials 1 kg of fresh tomatoes was produced at the expense of 8 kwh on average the latter is translated to costs of about 1 6 sar in saudi arabia against a grower price of tomatoes of 3 sar per kg although a detailed economic evaluation of the semi closed greenhouse is outside the scope of the current study it is safe to conclude that it is hardly applicable on a commercial scale the presented results focus on tomato crop but they can be potentially applied to some extent in other greenhouse vegetables as well in that case the cooling requirements and therefore the relative electricity use would not differ a lot given the fact that similar greenhouse climate would be required additionally the pwu would also remain similar as it is mainly dependent on the harvest index of the crop and the vapor leakages of the greenhouse however the computed peu might differ as it largely depends on the yield one can argue that potentially the high electricity demand could be fulfilled from renewable resources the latter is also well in line with country s goals saudi arabia planned an investment of about 109 billion for the installation of some 54 gw of renewable power capacity by 2032 with almost 76 of these capacity generated by solar power taking advantage of the plentiful solar radiation available in the country pazheri 2014 however given that both greenhouses that is vegetable production and photovoltaics pv make use of the sun radiation they cannot be combined in the same area under the weather conditions of riyadh area 1 mÂ² of pv panel can produce about 280 kwh per year pazheri 2014 therefore more than 2 mÂ² of pv panel and the associated additional land surface are required to supply the electricity requirements for cooling and dehumidifying 1 mÂ² of the described greenhouse the high electricity use of the closed greenhouse minimizes its commercial applicability unless water saving becomes extremely valuable even then there might be other alternatives such as using desalinized sea water in an evaporative cooling system desalinisation of sea water using reverse osmosis ro consumes some 5 kwh per m3 incoming water but the actual electricity use to produce 1 m3 desalinised water is at least double as the recovery rate for seawater in ro cannot exceed 50 altaee et al 2014 liu et al 2011 therefore a grower who uses 170 l for the production of 1 kg tomatoes in a pad and fan greenhouse would spend about 1 7 kwh for seawater desalinisation in other words with the same amount of electricity one can produce 4 7 times more fresh tomatoes in an evaporatively cooled greenhouse with sea water desalinisation than in a closed greenhouse moreover there is definitely a lot of room for improvement of the pwu of evaporatively cooled greenhouse for instance tsafaras et al tsafaras et al 2021 reported pwu of around 45 l kg 1 in greenhouses with improved pad and fan cooling system in saudi arabia such an amount of water can be obtained from desalinized sea water at the expense of 0 45 kwh to which another 0 5 kwh per kg of produced tomato should be added as the estimated electricity consumption of the fans not published data from previous greenhouse trials in estidamah that is a well designed pad and fan system could produce 8 4 times more tomatoes with a given amount of electricity than the closed greenhouse of course a larger greenhouse area would be required to account for the lower productivity of a pad and fan greenhouse compared to a closed greenhouse nevertheless land is not scarce in saudi arabia as well as in other arid or semi arid areas therefore efforts in improving the efficient use of water in evaporatively cooled greenhouses can result in more valuable and commercially applicable results than the closed greenhouse concept one should not forget however that such a competitive advantage of evaporatively cooled greenhouse hold only for dry climates the current study took place in riyadh area in saudi arabia where the climate is arid and therefore the results are only valid for similar arid climates evaporative cooling has lower cooling capacity and becomes less water efficient with increasing humidity of the outside environment due to the increase in wet bulb temperature therefore it can be hardly operated in a very warm and humid area e g coastal areas at low latitudes on the contrary the performance of the described closed greenhouse is hardly affected by external humidity and water losses through leakage and ventilation would be reduced resulting in higher water savings therefore the pwu and peu calculated here would apply to closed greenhouses in any similarly warm but then humid region in conclusion the closed greenhouse was proven to achieve tremendous water saving but this is achieved at the expense of so high electricity use that makes it commercially applicable only in case water is much more valuable than electricity water savings in commercial practice in places whose climate allows for evaporative cooling can be more easily achieved by improving the efficient use of cooling water rather than with closed greenhouses 5 conclusion after a series of trials in closed greenhouses in arid climate central of saudi arabia the production of 1 kg fresh tomatoes was achieved with the average use of 4 2 l of water ranging from 2 l to 7 4 l kg 1 this is 10 times lower than the water used in a very efficient evaporatively cooled greenhouse and 40 times lower than commercial practice for average saudi tomato growers this was achieved by installing sufficient cooling capacity to minimize ventilation so that the majority of crop transpiration could be recollected also the drainage from the soilless cultivation system was collected and reused the effect of air exchange on product water use was also quantified explaining why the amount of water used per unit of produced yield was higher than the theoretical minimum value this low use of water comes at the cost of large amounts of electricity for cooling from energy point of view producing fresh vegetables in a closed greenhouse requires 8 times more electricity than for a pad and fan greenhouse using desalinated sea water in the dry arid climate of central saudi arabia only when 10 liters of desalinated water costs more than 1 75 kwh of electricity the variable costs of a closed greenhouse might drop below the variable costs of a pad and fan greenhouse in conclusion the trade off between water and electricity use is presented and it is the cost of these resources that will predominantly define whether a closed greenhouse would be preferred over an evaporatively cooled greenhouse or not finally the costs of water and or electricity can change over time while the presented trade off not therefore the presented approach can be used to indicate the most suitable greenhouse design for a specific area and moment in time declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9412,production of vegetables for fresh consumption in arid regions is usually done in greenhouses fitted with evaporative cooling which does strain the scarce water resource in those areas so much that lack of water frequently becomes the limiting factor greenhouses fit with sufficient mechanical cooling capacity closed semi closed greenhouses not only dispose of the need for evaporative cooling but also allow for recovery of the water transpired by the crop as condense on the mechanical cooling and dehumidification system the purpose of this paper is to investigate the trade off between resources water and electricity within a closed greenhouse and evaluate its potential as the ultimate water saving production system after a series of 8 closed greenhouse trials in a desert environment in riyadh ksa benchmark numbers on water and energy use of such a system were established thanks to the recollection of more than 80 of the water supplied to the crop production of 1 kg of fresh tomatoes was achieved at the expense of 4 2 l of water which is 10 times lower that the lowest reported in evaporatively cooled greenhouses and 40 times lower than commercial practice in similar weather conditions on the other hand the required electricity use was about 8 kwh per kg of fresh produced tomatoes from energy point of view it is shown that using desalinated water for evaporative cooling reduces the electricity consumption of fresh tomato production to about 1 kwh kg 1 from economic point of view a closed greenhouse might only result in lower variable costs when 10 liters of desalinated water costs more than 1 75 kwh of electricity keywords closed greenhouse product water use water saving water recovery energy use data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction arid and semi arid regions largely depend on imports of fresh vegetables to meet the domestic needs as their local production is not enough fiaz et al 2018 there are numerous reasons varying from vulnerability of transportation routes and fragile international relations elmi 2017 to the environmental impact of food transportation bonÄa et al 2017 indicating that import based food security is far from ideal for any country gulf cooperation countries gcc are a representative example currently importing 80 90 of consumed food is not an issue due to their high buying power but the importance of increasing local production is appreciated and efforts to that direction are made alas without the desired success ben hassen and el bilali 2019 one of the limiting factors for local agricultural production in these regions is water scarcity ben hassen and el bilali 2019 the kingdom of saudi arabia is no exception tomato is the most commonly grown vegetable filling about 40 of the greenhouse area of the country yet in 2018 the quantity of imported tomatoes was 1 9 times the locally produced amount morci et al 2020 meaning that only 34 of the consumed tomatoes is produced locally currently vegetable production in arid and semi arid regions mainly takes place in evaporatively cooled greenhouses however this is only achieved at the expense of large amounts of water cooling water accounts for more than 50 of the total water use in such systems fuchs et al 2006 an evaporative cooling system in mexico area of huejulta consumes 68 and 93 l of water per kg of tomato to limit greenhouse air temperature below 30 and 27 c respectively van kooten et al 2006 in arizona usa 1 kg of fresh tomatoes is produced at the expense of 77 l of water of which more than 80 62 l is used for evaporative cooling kubota et al 2006 sabeh et al 2011 2007 commercial growers in saudi arabia report that about 170 l of water are used for the production of 1 kg tomatoes grown in plastic tunnels cooled with pad and fan systems communication of estidamah with local commercial growers a combination of high cooling demand and low production water use could be the main criterion to evaluate production systems for arid areas the volume of water necessary to produce 1 kg of fresh product is defined as product water use pwu hoekstra and hung 2005 theoretically in a perfectly closed loop when no water escapes to the environment the pwu of a vegetable crop should be the reciprocal of its harvest index in case of long season indetermined round tomatoes fruits represent about 80 of the total fresh plant weight de koning 1994 heuvelink 2018 this is translated to a theoretical minimum pwu of 1 25 l of water for each kg of fresh tomatoes however as greenhouses are generally not closed and in arid countries use additional water for evaporative cooling the pwu realised in commercial greenhouses is much higher in dutch greenhouses with and without re use of drain water 1 kg of fresh tomatoes is produced in expense of 15 and 22 l of water respectively namely the amount of water used by the fertigation system van kooten et al 2008 the larger amount by far of the difference between theoretical and practically achieved pwu is explained by crop transpiration which consumes about 90 of the water taken up by the crop stanghellini 2014 in arid and semi arid regions where evaporative cooling is commonly applied the water use for cooling is added to the irrigation in order to compute the total water use obviously pwu can be largely reduced by targeting the aforementioned major components of water consumption namely crop transpiration and water use in evaporative cooling katsoulas et al 2015 computed the water saving achieved thanks to reduced ventilation and recapturing of transpired water vapor as a function of installed cooling capacity in semi closed greenhouses they reported that up to about 2 and 4 times lower pwu can be achieved for the production of tomatoes in the netherlands and in the mediterranean greece and algeria respectively when cooling with capacity of 700 w m 2 was applied compared to natural ventilation as the one cooling process the closed greenhouse concept allows for recapture of crop transpiration through a dehumidification system and or a mechanical cooling system this is the ultimate water saving greenhouse design as it prevents water leakage outside the greenhouse system research trials in closed greenhouses in the netherlands wageningen ur reported that 40 50 of the water supplied to the crop was recovered as condensation of transpired vapor from the greenhouse air de gelder et al 2012 opdam schoonderbeek heller de gelder 2005 similar amounts of recovered water were also reported by commercial closed greenhouses in the netherlands themato bv resulting to a final pwu of about 4 l kg 1 van kooten et al 2008 additional advantages of the closed greenhouse compared to ventilated greenhouses include a the low presence of pests and diseases due to the little connection with the outside environments which can then reduce the use of pesticides by up to 80 opdam et al 2005 and b the possibility of maintaining elevated co2 concentrations resulting in higher crop growth and production however a mechanical cooling and dehumidification system is much more energy demanding in comparison to an evaporative cooling system in arid or semi arid regions water is scarce but there is potentially an abundance of sustainable energy due to the large amount of sun shine moreover electricity demand for cooling largely lines up with electricity produced by solar panels therefore the closed greenhouse concept seems a good match to the knowledge of the authors there is not yet scientific literature providing quantitative understanding of the water and energy flows involved in closed greenhouses in arid regions nor of the trade off involved the current study aims to close this gap by quantifying and evaluating the operation and resource use of a closed greenhouse in an urban desert area in saudi arabia information from multiple research trials are collected and presented in order to quantify the pwu that can be achieved in practice in a mechanically cooled greenhouse and the amount of electricity required for cooling the mass balance of water is computed in order to estimate accurately the pwu and quantify every flow finally the energy use required to support the achieved water savings is presented and the closed greenhouse is compared with evaporatively cooled greenhouses in terms of water use energy use and productivity 2 materials and methods the data presented in the current study were collected during four tomato experiments from now on indicated as a b c and d of various nature at the national research and development center for sustainable agriculture estidamah in riyadh 24 7 n 46 7 e saudi arabia all experiments were carried out in two identical greenhouse compartments with only one factor treatment different co2 concentration use of artificial illumination crop protection during each experiment the present study does not focus on the different treatments but only on the water and energy balances and the resource use per compartment so the collected data set includes data from 8 different tomato cultivations grown for periods varying from 6 to 12 5 months table 1 2 1 greenhouses and climate control equipment the greenhouse is a venlo type glasshouse gutter height of 6 5 m and span width of 4 m covered with tempered diffuse glass each compartment is 25 m x 16 m of which 336 mÂ² is growing area equipped with heating rail and grow pipes high pressure fogging system 0 4 l m 2 h 1 shading screen 50 shading percentage enrichment with liquid co2 and mechanical cooling the air conditioning consists of 10 air treatment units thermokey per compartment with a total capacity of around 700 w m 2 placed close to the greenhouse cover and a dehumidification system condensation on cold surface with capacity 4000 m3 h 1 with a maximum condensation discharge rate of 16 l h 1 that distributes the treated air through five ducts placed under the growing gutters this therefore provides a dehumidification capacity of 48 g per mÂ² growing area per hour the condensate from all coolers and dehumidification is collected and reused in the greenhouse system as fresh water for irrigation the cooling capacity was sufficient for the greenhouses to operate fully closed that is no air exchange with the outside environment except for some inevitable leakage nevertheless in three of the four trials night time ventilation was applied for 1 2 h for crop management purposes in all experiments the crop was round tomato harvested as loose the tomatoes were transplanted about 30 days after sowing and they were grown on stone wool in hanging gutters fitted with recollection of drain the plant density was 2 5 stems per mÂ² and additional stems were kept in order to end up with a stem density of 4 5 stems per mÂ² in each trial the fresh yield per crop row was weighted and recorded at each harvest usually twice per week and the average of all crop rows excluding the side rows was used as greenhouse yield although the cultivars varied somehow among experiments it was always the same combination of cultivar s in each one of the two compartments 2 2 climate and fertigation settings the climate and fertigation control as well as the data collection were arranged through a greenhouse process control computer ridder multima in each greenhouse there were 3 ventilated measuring boxes to record the temperature and humidity values and one measuring box to record co2 concentration all measuring boxes were placed in the central crop row and they were maintained at the height of the top of the crop the average of all 3 measurements was used for climate control purposes the temperature was maintained between 25 and 28 c during the day and between 18 and 20 c during the night the relative humidity was fluctuating between 80 and 95 the cooling setpoint was set at 26 c during the day and 19 c during the night period with small variations for crop steering purposes fogging was used only at the beginning of the growing season to increase humidity later on it was hardly required as the transpiration of the crop was sufficient to prevent too low humidity values in the greenhouse the shading screen was used during the first two months of each trial whenever global radiation exceeded 800 w m 2 the irrigation water including liquid fertilizers was supplied through drip irrigation the ph and ec of the irrigation and drain as well as the concentration of each individual macro and micro nutrient were monitored on a regular basis to ensure that the crop would not face any deficiency the irrigation supply was optimized during all trials to ensure that it would not hamper the plant growth and production specifically the irrigation was controlled automatically based on external sun radiation in order to match crop s needs starting with smaller amounts about 0 5 cc per joule for young crops and increasing gradually to follow the growth of the crop reaching about 4 cc per joule for a fully grown crop while maintaining a drain percentage of 25 30 the source of irrigation water and the water used in the fogging system was the municipal supply and it was first treated with a reverse osmosis ro unit the water collected by the cooling dehumidification units as well as the drain from the greenhouses was reused the latter after uv disinfection as shown schematically in fig 1 2 3 calculation of water flows the detailed recording of water supply irrigation fogging and water recovery drain condensation allows the computation of water use and also water mass balance to get insight into the water use of the crop in general as well as individual crop processes specifically the amount of water taken up by the crop can be computed and it is also possible to estimate how much of this water was transpired and how much was invested in fresh weight growth this information enlightens the achieved pwu and how it is affected by the used technological equipment 2 3 1 water use the water use wu of each compartment was calculated as the water input to the system minus the amount of water that was collected and reused eq 1 specifically the water input consisted of the water supplied for irrigation wi and the water used by the fogging system wf which were individually measured the reused water consisted of the drain water wd which was measured and the condensed water collected by the mechanical cooling and the dehumidification system which were measured together wc 1 wu wi wf wd wc the condensation on greenhouse cover is not included in the computations as given the high outside air temperature usually warmer than inside the temperature of the cover hardly ever would fall below dewpoint temperature so the amount of condense on the cover would be anyhow small and was never enough to run off therefore any condensed water is re evaporated and either condensed again on the dehumidification or cooling system where it would be measured or it escapes via leakage or ventilation adding to the water use 2 3 2 water leakage the wu as computed in eq 1 consists of the water stored in the crop as fresh weight growth and the water vapor escaped from the greenhouse through leakage and or ventilation greenhouse leakage air exchange in absence of intentional ventilation was estimated based on the decay method described by baptista bailey randall and meneses baptista et al 1999 and by using co2 as tracer gas according to this method the tracer gas co2 in our case is injected until a certain concentration is reached and then the decay of its concentration is monitored until the latter reaches about 80 of its initial value the leakage ventilation can be determined by fitting a linear regression to the time interval that the natural logarithm of the difference of the concentration of the tracer gas inside and outside the greenhouse decreases linearly with time eq 2 the regression coefficient equals the air exchange rate 2 ln co 2 in co 2 out l h t a where co2 in and co2 out is the concentration of co2 inside the greenhouse and outside respectively l is the greenhouse leakage in mÂ³ mÂ² hr h is the height of the greenhouse 6 75 m t is the time in hours and a is a regression constant air leakage changes may be affected by wind speed therefore to account for variable weather conditions the described method was repeated for several days obviously in the absence of a crop in the greenhouse during a period of 10 days in may 2018 the greenhouse was kept closed and the co2 concentration was raised to 1200 ppm then the rate of concentration drop was calculated until the concentration reached 800 ppm the same trial was repeated for 10 days in april 2021 to assess the possible effect of greenhouse aging on leakage ventilation as a difference increased leakage was indeed observed for the trials performed between 2018 and 2021 the leakage was estimated through interpolation to calculate leakage at any moment leakage ventilation was assumed to increase linearly with wind speed as described by baptista et al baptista et al 1999 and calculated to increase with a rate of 0 095 mÂ³ mÂ² hr for every 1 m s 1 increase in wind speed 2 3 3 water loss through ventilation for the time period when the windows were opened the vapor loss through ventilation was computed via the air exchange rate and the difference of the absolute humidity between greenhouse air and outside air for the computation of air exchange rate the ventilation model described by de zwart 1996 was used according to this model the air exchange rate consists of 2 components namely the wind driven Ïwind and temperature difference driven Ïtemp air exchange these components of air exchange were computed separately also separate computations were performed for the leeward and windward side of vents and finally all components were combined into one using a vector like summation eq 3 3 Ï v e n t Ï w i n d 2 Ï t e m p w Ï t e m p l 2 m 3 s 1 w i n d o w 1 the components of air exchange are calculated based on the window opening angle on the windward Î¸w and leeward side Î¸l the dimensions of the window length l width w the slope of greenhouse roof s the temperature difference between greenhouse air and outside environment Î´t and the wind speed u as follows 4 Ï w i n d 2 29 10 2 1 e x p Î¸ l 21 1 1 2 10 3 Î¸ w e x p Î¸ w 211 l w u m 3 s 1 w i n d o w 1 5 Ï t e m p c f l 3 g Î² Î´ t 0 5 w sin Î¸ sin s Î¸ 1 5 m 3 s 1 w i n d o w 1 where cf is a constant related to the energy discharge caused by friction value of 0 6 used g is the gravitational acceleration ms 2 and Î² is the thermal expansion coefficient 3 3 10 3 k 1 eq 4 computes the sum of leeward first part and windward second part wind driven air exchange obviously by applying the window opening angle on the windward Î¸w and leeward side Î¸l on eq 5 the temperature driven air exchange on the windward Ïtemp w and leeward Ïtemp l side respectively can be calculated 2 4 energy use estimation of energy use for cooling and dehumidification is crucial as this is the resource with the highest consumption in exchange for the achieved water saving the amount of heat removed from the greenhouse is computed based on the temperatures of the supplied and return water to from the cooling and dehumidification system and the flow of water going through the system these data are recorded in the process control computer although the cooling and dehumidification are two independent systems that can be also operated independently in the present paper they are mostly discussed together as under the conditions used they are mainly operating complementary to each other in other words the dehumidification system also acts as a cooling system unless the dehumidified air is reheated which was not the case for the vast majority of the analyzed period and the cooling system also obviously acts as a dehumidification system finally the computed heat removal from both systems was transformed to electricity consumption by using an estimated coefficient of performance cop value this cop considers the electricity use of the chillers the fans of the heat exchanger and the water circulation pumps on top of that an additional electricity use of some 20 w m 2 is added to account for the electricity use of the air conditioning units in the greenhouse this value is obtained from measurements performed in the greenhouse the computation of cop is based on the carnot efficiency using as inputs the temperature at the warm side of the chiller twarm and the cooled water temperature tcool eq 6 the latter tcool is measured and recorded in the process control computer while the former twarm is estimated by assuming that the warm side of the chiller is some 10 c above outside air temperature this temperature difference results in computed cop values well in agreement with reference values provided by chiller manufacturers as soon as real systems cannot operate at the ideal carnot cycle and they operate at some fraction of it an efficiency term e is also included in the cop computation for the computation of cop the efficiency of the cooling system e was assumed equal to 0 4 meggers et al 2012 6 cop cooling e t cool t warm t cool since the outside temperature fluctuates over the day also the cop does the cop is calculated on 5 min basis to capture the natural temperature variation 3 results 3 1 crop yield the achieved crop yield varied among the different trials between 28 and 86 kg mÂ² fig 2 the larger part of this difference was caused by the different length of the trials table 1 therefore the average productivity of each crop in kg of fresh product per week is also presented the different treatments applied as well as factors such as presence of diseases affected to some extent the crop productivity with the average production per week varying between 1 5 and 2 2 kg m 2 per week the season in the year also influenced the weekly yield as a result of different amount of solar radiation fig 3 the highest yield and highest average productivity were achieved in trial d 3 2 water use 3 2 1 water input and water recovery the absolute amount of water input to the greenhouses varied between the different trials sum of the bars at the left part of fig 4 in all trials the contribution of fogging to the total water use was negligible 1 or less therefore the water input to the greenhouses was equal to the irrigation water the difference among the four trials can be mainly explained by the different duration of the trails as well as the season of the year each trial was done the duration of trials a and b was less than c and d and not done during the whole summer season which is the most water demanding due to the higher amount of solar radiation fig 3 if the total water input is expressed in relation to the amount of radiation then it was similar in the first three trials and it was higher in the fourth trial due to higher maintained leaf area index resulting in higher crop transpiration specifically during trials a b and c irrigation was about 270 ml per mj of sun radiation of which about 200 ml were taken up by the crop in trial d the irrigation was about 370 ml per mj but the drain percentage was comparable to the previous trials meaning that the crop uptake was also higher reaching 270 ml per mj the vast majority 85 on average of the water input to the greenhouse was recovered and re used resulting in a final water use which represents on average only 15 of the water applied by the irrigation system blue bars in fig 4 water recollected as drain bars with diagonal stripes was about 25 of the irrigation supply year round the latter was dependent on radiation as described above and varied from about 4 l m 2 d 1 in the winter to 11 l m 2 d 1 in summer the water recovered via condensation bars with vertical stripes was on average 60 of the initial water supply fig 4 cooling and dehumidification is needed year round and water recovery varied from about 3 l m 2 d 1 in the winter to 7 l m 2 d 1 in summer since the crop transpires constantly the dehumidification system was almost continuously in operation according to its specifications it should recapture some 1 15 l m 2 d 1 water at full power the rest of the vapor was collected by the cooling system 3 2 2 water loss through leakage and ventilation water use the water that is not recollected solid blue bars at the bottom in fig 4 is the water stored in the fresh biomass and the vapor lost via ventilation and leakage the amount of final water use as a percentage of the total water input in the system was higher in trials c and d than in trials a and b the major reason for this difference is that starting from trials c and d the vents were opened each night for 1 2 h in order to prevent harmful volatiles ethylene or other gases to accumulate in addition leakage also increased fig 5 the estimated air exchange under low wind conditions less than 1 m s 1 was found to be about 0 24 mÂ³ mÂ² hr in 2018 and 1 7 mÂ³ mÂ² hr in 2021 fig 5 or in other words the aging of the greenhouse resulted in about 7 times more air and vapor losses via leakage in 2021 compared to 2018 such rapid aging can be explained by the extreme weather conditions direct radiation and heat fig 3 to which the rubber sealing of the windows was exposed 3 2 3 product water use combining the water use fig 4 and productivity fig 2 data the pwu for each trial was calculated the pwu varied between the different trials from 2 to 7 4 l kg 1 fig 6 with an average of 4 2 l kg 1 as explained above section 1 the theoretical minimum pwu is the reverse of the harvest index of the crop and for the case of long season indetermined round tomatoes it is about 1 25 l kg m 1 therefore the theoretically minimum required total water use per greenhouse trial can be computed by multiplying the achieved yield with 1 25 in all trials the achieved pwu exceeded the theoretical minimum however for trial a that lasted only about 6 months the harvest index was probably lower than 80 so that in trial a the achieved pwu is very close to what could theoretically have been attained the achieved pwu increases with increasing air exchange fig 7 this air exchange results in vapor loss to the outside environment which explains well why the achieved pwu is higher than the theoretical minimum it can be concluded that for the analyzed greenhouse systems under the weather conditions of riyadh pwu increases by more than 1 l kg 1 for each additional 10 000 m3 m 2 of air exchange fig 7 this is not strange considering that 14 2 gr of water vapor are lost each time that 1 m3 of greenhouse air at 27 c and 80 relative humidity is replaced by 1 m3 of outside air at 37 c and 10 relative humidity 3 2 4 crop transpiration estimating crop transpiration as the amount of vapor collected as condense and the vapor escaped the greenhouse through ventilation and leakage ventilation results in 600 2000 l water per mÂ² depending on the trial this amount equals on average 67 of the water supplied to the crop via irrigation and 91 of the water taken up by the crop or in other words the difference between irrigation and drain only the remaining 9 was used in the biomass the used system of recollecting crop transpiration managed to recover through condensation 82 on average of the transpired water vapor in all trials it is clear that recapturing crop transpiration allows tremendous reduction of water use in a ventilated greenhouse the transpired water would have been released to the environment increasing the water use multiple times 3 3 electricity use the aforementioned water savings can only be achieved at the expense of energy in the form of electricity required to operate the cooling and dehumidification system the cooling energy use varied throughout the year from 25 mj m 2 d 1 in summer to 5 mj m 2 d 1 in winter given the fact that dehumidification is required year round the energy consumption of the dehumidification system was fluctuating less between different months of the year namely between 1 2 and 2 mj m 2 d 1 based on the computed cop the installed cooling and dehumidification equipment consumes from 0 4 to 3 kwh m 2 d 1 depending on the month of the year fig 8 in the performed trials the estimated total electricity use for cooling and dehumidification purposes varied between 230 trial a and 725 trial d kwh m 2 the differences between the trials were obviously predominantly caused by the different length and season of the trials thanks to the condensation on the cooling and dehumidification systems about 500 1500 l m 2 water were recovered and reused on average for every kwh of electricity spent about 2 l of water were recovered fig 9 if the electricity use is expressed in relation to the production of each trial and cultivar the product electricity use peu is calculated in the same way as the pwu the production of each kg of fresh tomatoes was achieved in expense of in average 8 kwh of electricity fig 8 4 discussion after completing a number of different research trials in closed greenhouses in arid conditions over a period of four years benchmark numbers describing the productivity and more importantly the water and electricity use of such a production system under the specified weather conditions are established the detailed recording of the major water flows enabled the accurate estimation of water use crop transpiration and possibilities for water recollection the achieved pwu of 2 7 4 l kg 1 is to the knowledge of the authors the lowest ever reported in an arid environment and the average of 4 2 l kg 1 is some 40 times lower than the reported pwu that commercial growers in the area achieve this number is also similar to the pwu achieved in closed greenhouses in northern latitudes although cooling energy requirements differ of course a lot de gelder et al 2012 opdam et al 2005 the observed range in the achieved pwu was explained by the different ventilation and leakage ventilation of the different trials rather than different varieties or treatments the latter was also ensured by the well controlled factors affecting crop growth such as greenhouse climate fertigation substrate and crop handling which were all optimized and repeatable among the different trials the very small improvement of pwu that could have been attained by allowing the removed leaves to dry in the greenhouse was not deemed worth the increased potential for infection of the removed parts the realized pwu was still above the theoretical minimum as no greenhouse can be completely air tight and vapor losses to the outside cannot be avoided even without any ventilation trial a vapor leakage cannot be completely avoided however the achieved pwu was 10 times lower than the lowest reported in an evaporatively cooled greenhouse in similar climate conditions tsafaras et al 2021 due to i no water used for cooling ii recollection and re use of crop transpiration and iii higher yield due to elevated co2 concentration according to the presented data 91 of the irrigation water consumed by the crop was used for crop transpiration the latter is in agreement with published research stanghellini 2014 confirming the accuracy of the measurements and computations of the water balances recollecting condensation on cooling and dehumidification system allowed the recovery and re use of more than 80 of transpired water with higher values achieved at the trials without any ventilation the achieved pwu was directly related to the amount of air exchange via ventilation and leakage with higher pwu values realized with increased air exchange this finding is well in agreement with the simulation results reported by katsoulas et al 2015 on the other hand mechanical cooling and dehumidification of the closed greenhouse come with an increased electricity use the latter was estimated during the described trials to be on average about 600 kwh m 2 y 1 in the described trials 1 kg of fresh tomatoes was produced at the expense of 8 kwh on average the latter is translated to costs of about 1 6 sar in saudi arabia against a grower price of tomatoes of 3 sar per kg although a detailed economic evaluation of the semi closed greenhouse is outside the scope of the current study it is safe to conclude that it is hardly applicable on a commercial scale the presented results focus on tomato crop but they can be potentially applied to some extent in other greenhouse vegetables as well in that case the cooling requirements and therefore the relative electricity use would not differ a lot given the fact that similar greenhouse climate would be required additionally the pwu would also remain similar as it is mainly dependent on the harvest index of the crop and the vapor leakages of the greenhouse however the computed peu might differ as it largely depends on the yield one can argue that potentially the high electricity demand could be fulfilled from renewable resources the latter is also well in line with country s goals saudi arabia planned an investment of about 109 billion for the installation of some 54 gw of renewable power capacity by 2032 with almost 76 of these capacity generated by solar power taking advantage of the plentiful solar radiation available in the country pazheri 2014 however given that both greenhouses that is vegetable production and photovoltaics pv make use of the sun radiation they cannot be combined in the same area under the weather conditions of riyadh area 1 mÂ² of pv panel can produce about 280 kwh per year pazheri 2014 therefore more than 2 mÂ² of pv panel and the associated additional land surface are required to supply the electricity requirements for cooling and dehumidifying 1 mÂ² of the described greenhouse the high electricity use of the closed greenhouse minimizes its commercial applicability unless water saving becomes extremely valuable even then there might be other alternatives such as using desalinized sea water in an evaporative cooling system desalinisation of sea water using reverse osmosis ro consumes some 5 kwh per m3 incoming water but the actual electricity use to produce 1 m3 desalinised water is at least double as the recovery rate for seawater in ro cannot exceed 50 altaee et al 2014 liu et al 2011 therefore a grower who uses 170 l for the production of 1 kg tomatoes in a pad and fan greenhouse would spend about 1 7 kwh for seawater desalinisation in other words with the same amount of electricity one can produce 4 7 times more fresh tomatoes in an evaporatively cooled greenhouse with sea water desalinisation than in a closed greenhouse moreover there is definitely a lot of room for improvement of the pwu of evaporatively cooled greenhouse for instance tsafaras et al tsafaras et al 2021 reported pwu of around 45 l kg 1 in greenhouses with improved pad and fan cooling system in saudi arabia such an amount of water can be obtained from desalinized sea water at the expense of 0 45 kwh to which another 0 5 kwh per kg of produced tomato should be added as the estimated electricity consumption of the fans not published data from previous greenhouse trials in estidamah that is a well designed pad and fan system could produce 8 4 times more tomatoes with a given amount of electricity than the closed greenhouse of course a larger greenhouse area would be required to account for the lower productivity of a pad and fan greenhouse compared to a closed greenhouse nevertheless land is not scarce in saudi arabia as well as in other arid or semi arid areas therefore efforts in improving the efficient use of water in evaporatively cooled greenhouses can result in more valuable and commercially applicable results than the closed greenhouse concept one should not forget however that such a competitive advantage of evaporatively cooled greenhouse hold only for dry climates the current study took place in riyadh area in saudi arabia where the climate is arid and therefore the results are only valid for similar arid climates evaporative cooling has lower cooling capacity and becomes less water efficient with increasing humidity of the outside environment due to the increase in wet bulb temperature therefore it can be hardly operated in a very warm and humid area e g coastal areas at low latitudes on the contrary the performance of the described closed greenhouse is hardly affected by external humidity and water losses through leakage and ventilation would be reduced resulting in higher water savings therefore the pwu and peu calculated here would apply to closed greenhouses in any similarly warm but then humid region in conclusion the closed greenhouse was proven to achieve tremendous water saving but this is achieved at the expense of so high electricity use that makes it commercially applicable only in case water is much more valuable than electricity water savings in commercial practice in places whose climate allows for evaporative cooling can be more easily achieved by improving the efficient use of cooling water rather than with closed greenhouses 5 conclusion after a series of trials in closed greenhouses in arid climate central of saudi arabia the production of 1 kg fresh tomatoes was achieved with the average use of 4 2 l of water ranging from 2 l to 7 4 l kg 1 this is 10 times lower than the water used in a very efficient evaporatively cooled greenhouse and 40 times lower than commercial practice for average saudi tomato growers this was achieved by installing sufficient cooling capacity to minimize ventilation so that the majority of crop transpiration could be recollected also the drainage from the soilless cultivation system was collected and reused the effect of air exchange on product water use was also quantified explaining why the amount of water used per unit of produced yield was higher than the theoretical minimum value this low use of water comes at the cost of large amounts of electricity for cooling from energy point of view producing fresh vegetables in a closed greenhouse requires 8 times more electricity than for a pad and fan greenhouse using desalinated sea water in the dry arid climate of central saudi arabia only when 10 liters of desalinated water costs more than 1 75 kwh of electricity the variable costs of a closed greenhouse might drop below the variable costs of a pad and fan greenhouse in conclusion the trade off between water and electricity use is presented and it is the cost of these resources that will predominantly define whether a closed greenhouse would be preferred over an evaporatively cooled greenhouse or not finally the costs of water and or electricity can change over time while the presented trade off not therefore the presented approach can be used to indicate the most suitable greenhouse design for a specific area and moment in time declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9413,water scarcity and high evaporation are critical factors affecting crop growth and yield sustainable production of jujube ziziphus jujuba mill plantations is essential for economic development and environmental protection in arid desert areas of northwest china however few studies have investigated how plastic film mulching combined with sand tube irrigation sti affects soil surface wetted area soil water indices crop water consumption yield water use efficiency wue and fruit quality in jujube plantations in arid desert areas therefore a 2 year field experiment was conducted with three levels of sti sw1 300 m3 ha 1 sw2 375 m3 ha 1 sw3 450 m3 ha 1 and surface drip irrigation as a control dw3 450 m3 ha 1 compared with surface drip irrigation sti significantly decreased p 0 05 surface wetted area and sw3 significantly increased soil water storage in the 60 100 cm layer as well as the 0 100 cm soil layer sand tube irrigation also alleviated the soil water deficit in the 60 100 cm soil layer and each soil layer before irrigation and increased yield by 0 6 and wue by 27 3 on average the highest yield and wue were in sw3 in both years crop water consumption of jujube trees increased and then decreased during the growth period in both years and reached a maximum in the fruit swelling period with sti vitamin c content increased by 9 8 soluble protein content by 15 6 and the sugar to acid ratio by 12 2 in both years overall application of sti increased jujube yields and wue and improved fruit quality by increasing soil water storage and reducing soil water deficit thus this study demonstrates sti can increase economic and ecological benefits and also provides guidelines to apply sti and improve agricultural water productivity graphical abstract ga1 keywords sand tube irrigation soil water deficit jujube yield water use efficiency fruit quality arid desert area data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drought is an abiotic stress that decreases the water available for plant growth verslues et al 2006 and desertification is one of the major ecological and environmental problems worldwide vieira et al 2021 agriculture is the largest user of freshwater consuming more than two thirds of total freshwater worldwide gan et al 2014 kang et al 2017 water scarcity is the primary factors limiting sustainable agricultural development rosa et al 2020 according to food and agriculture organization of the united nations statistics fao 2021 between 720 and 811 million people experienced hunger in 2020 and projections are that approximately 660 million people will continue to face hunger in 2030 therefore crop improvement techniques and efficient cultivation practices that increase agricultural water productivity are essential to address the problem of water scarcity bailey serres et al 2019 kang et al 2017 kourgialas et al 2019 postel et al 2001 soil water deficit is one of the critical factors affecting stable growth of plantation forests moretti et al 2015 wu et al 2021 soil desiccation and soil water depletion are associated with decreases in soil water storage and soil water content huang et al 2021 however in arid areas irrigation is the dominant water supply for soil water replenishment and plant growth because of insufficient effective precipitation therefore irrigation water is a critical component in the terrestrial water cycle tang et al 2015 furthermore because of the conflict between water supply and demand water saving irrigation techniques are being promoted widely by governments to effectively ensure soil moisture is maintained in the rooting zone in order to increase yields and water use efficiency wue dai et al 2019 however such water saving irrigation techniques may reduce replenishment of subsoil moisture compared with that with conventional irrigation smith et al 2005 in addition long term deep soil water deficit may eventually lead to formation of a dry soil layer and soil environmental problems tang et al 2021a therefore identifying novel comprehensive water saving irrigation technology that can effectively replenish subsoil moisture is the key to solve the problem of water scarcity in arid areas drip irrigation is one of the most efficient water saving technologies and therefore has widespread application in agricultural production surendran et al 2016 yang et al 2020 however because of high irrigation frequency large surface wetted area and saturated areas under emitters surface drip irrigation can easily become ineffective surface evaporation in arid areas hao et al 2007 meshkat et al 2000 in addition because of high evaporation and low precipitation salinization is also a common problem under drip irrigation in arid areas burt et al 2003 wang et al 2019 subsurface drip irrigation is effective in reducing surface evaporation and is widely recognized to improve crop yields and wue colak et al 2018 payero et al 2008 valentin et al 2020 however clogged emitters and water leakage caused by rodent damage are prominent problems that currently need to be addressed lamm 2009 oliver et al 2014 yavuz et al 2010 conventional subsurface drip irrigation directly infiltrates deep well or reservoir water into crop root systems resulting in low temperatures and high soil water contents which may lead to undesirable soil hydrothermal environments and decreases in root enzyme and beneficial microorganism activities in the root zone pendergast et al 2019 sand tube irrigation sti is an indirect subsurface drip irrigation method that increases efficient soil water infiltration and decreases soil evaporation compared with surface drip irrigation meshkat et al 1998 2000 sun et al 2016 yanni et al 2003 moreover sti pipelines are above the surface which results in slow increases in water temperature and oxygen content while irrigation water infiltrates into root systems in addition sti emitters are less susceptible to clogging because of the relatively high flow rate thus application of sti can be highly advantageous in forestry cultivation in arid areas jujube trees are indigenous to china and have been one of the most common and preferred trees for over 4000 years because of their economic and ecological value li et al 2011 song et al 2019 the fruit has both nutritional and health care benefits and large areas of jujube trees are cultivated in arid regions of northwest china bai et al 2021 wang et al 2020a in the minqin oasis irrigation district in particular with little rainfall and high evaporation jujube has become the main economic and ecological tree species because of its tolerance of drought and degraded land and ecological benefits in addition to strong government support wang et al 2022 in recent years especially since 2018 jujube fruit prices have also fallen dramatically because increases jujube production exceeded demand as a result benefits to jujube farmers have fallen dramatically because of lower fruit prices and higher water prices in some arid regions leading farmers to decrease water irrigation for jujube trees in some areas to ensure only tree survival rather than to pursue benefits in some areas jujube trees have been cut down and replaced with other field crops to ensure profitability which may negatively affect the local ecology film mulching is an effective agronomic measure used to conserve moisture and improve wue jin et al 2016 liang et al 2018 combined film mulching and drip irrigation is widely used in arid areas to improve water productivity nouri et al 2019 generally in local areas traditional irrigation methods for jujube trees are furrow irrigation and surface drip irrigation wang et al 2022 the similar method of sti has also been investigated for effects on soil temperature and water transportation in soil evaporation indoor simulation experiments and in field trials on jujube trees olive trees and grape vines ben gal et al 2004 meshkat et al 1998 2000 sun et al 2016 yanni et al 2003 overall plastic film mulching with drip irrigation has been widely used in field crops and single sti has also been extended to some sparsely planted forestry systems however application of plastic film mulching combined with sti has not been reported for jujube in arid desert areas a novel comprehensive irrigation approach that saves water has low evaporation can effectively replenish soil layer water and improve jujube water productivity is needed in jujube cultivation therefore the objectives of this study were the following 1 investigate effects of sti and surface drip irrigation on surface soil wetted area after irrigation and changes in soil water storage 2 evaluate average water deficits in different treatments in different growth periods and variations in soil water deficits before irrigation in each soil layer and 3 compare effects of sti and surface drip irrigation on water consumption characteristics yield wue and quality of jujube fruit 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of study site the experiment was conducted at the qinfeng forestry experimental station 38 63 n 103 08 e in minqin county wuwei city gansu province china fig 1 the site is on the edge of tengger and badain jaran deserts the area climate is temperate continental and extremely arid annual mean precipitation is 110 mm annual mean temperature is 7 8 average annual evaporation is 2644 mm and sunshine time is 3134 5 h groundwater depth is below 40 m soil type soil dry bulk density and field water capacity mass are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design soil moisture status and growth characteristics of 7 year old jujube trees ziziphus jun jujube with heights from 2 5 to 3 0 m were monitored from may to october in 2020 and 2021 spacing of rows was 3 5 m and that of trees was 1 5 m a cylindrical sand tube 10 cm in diameter and 20 cm in depth filled with 2 3 mm fine gravel was placed 30 cm from jujube trees on both sides fig 2 each sand tube was equipped with a small tube and a drip emitter and the flow rate of the drip emitter was 4 l h 1 jujube trees were planted in a furrow rows of jujube trees were covered with film and a rain collection ditch was set up between two adjacent films to prevent damage and deterioration of the film a 2 4 mm soil layer was placed on top of the mulch groundwater electrical conductivity 6 2 Î¼s cm 1 salinity 2 9 ppt ph 7 2 was used as the irrigation source ball valves filters and water meters were installed on the water supply pipes filters were 80 mesh and accuracy of water meters was 0 0001 m3 according to physiological and growth characteristics of jun jujube five growing periods were identified 1 leafing emergence early may to late may 2 blossom and young fruit early june to late june 3 fruit swelling early july to mid august 4 fruit maturation late august to late september and 5 dormancy early october to next late april to investigate water saving characteristics of sti irrigation management strategies in 2020 and 2021 were selected according to irrigation experience and surface drip irrigation amounts with local jujube trees table 2 sand tube irrigation was examined at three levels low sw1 300 m3 ha 1 medium sw2 375 m3 ha 1 and high sw3 450 m3 ha 1 and surface drip irrigation was used as the control dw3 450 m3 ha 1 one water meter controlled one irrigation level in four rows and each row was 72 m long and included 78 trees hence 12 rows of jujube trees were used as test plots and one tree per row was selected for low and medium irrigation levels sw1 sw2 and two trees per row were selected for the high irrigation levels sw3 dw3 in addition the same emitter with a flow rate of 4 l h 1 was used with sti and surface drip irrigation moreover an impermeable separation zone was set to a depth of 60 cm in the middle of two jujube trees to prevent transfer of soil water between trees all jujube trees in the experiment grew well were of the same size and had the same management measures such as fertilization co nh2 2 0 43 kg plant 1 46 6 n kh2po4 0 29 kg plant 1 52 p2o5 34 k2o trimming ring cutting spraying and weeding 2 3 test items and calculation methods 2 3 1 meteorological data an automated weather station at the experimental site recorded rainfall air temperature wind velocity relative air humidity atmospheric pressure and solar radiation every 30 min during all jujube growth stages rainfall during the entire growth period of jujube trees was 59 5 mm in 2020 and 82 5 mm in 2021 and the effective rainfall 5 mm was 27 6 mm in 2020 and 50 2 mm in 2021 mean temperature was 19 1 in 2020 and 20 4 in 2021 and maximum and minimum temperatures were 27 4 2020 and 27 4 2021 and 10 8 2020 and 14 0 2021 respectively fig 3 2 3 2 soil wetted area and soil water storage the soil wetted area was calculated according to the method of guan et al 2016 with the following specific steps after irrigation dry and wet areas were clearly separated on the soil surface a plastic film was laid flat on the soil surface and the outline of the wetted area was drawn with a signature pen the area outlined on the plastic film was then photographed and imported into the auto cad 2020 software autodesk san rafael california usa to calculate the area according to the scale fine roots diameter 2 mm are the dominant organs for water and nutrient uptake in forest trees montagnoli et al 2012 the main absorbent roots 2 mm in diameter of jujube trees are distributed in the 0 60 cm soil layer ma et al 2017 therefore soil samples to 100 cm were obtained using a soil auger inner diameter 40 mm with samples collected every 10 cm soils were sampled before and after irrigation during jujube growth periods soils were oven dried to determine gravimetric soil water content and then soil water storage sws mm was calculated according to the following equation liu et al 2018 1 sws i 10 n d i b i swc i 10 1 i 10 20 100 where swc i is the soil water content gravimetric of the ith soil layer b i is the soil bulk density g cm 3 of the ith soil layer and d i is the soil depth cm of the ith soil layer 2 3 3 soil water deficit to quantify the degree of soil water deficit between soils the soil water deficit index dsw which is below management allowed soil water deficit was used dsw was calculated according to the following equation wang et al 2015 2 dsw 0 6 f c sws i 0 6 f c 100 where f c is the field moisture capacity mm and sws i is the sws of the ith soil layer values of dsw 0 0 25 25 50 and 50 were considered to indicate no soil water deficit slight water deficit moderate water deficit and severe water deficit respectively previous works have found that the soil water content at about 60 field capacity f c can be regarded as the point of water holding capacity for plant growth retardation and 0 6 f c can be regarded as the lower limit of soil water content can increase crop yield and wue liu and wang 1990 jha et al 2019 therefore 0 6f c can be used to be a specific soil moisture to evaluate the soil water deficit in this study 2 3 4 crop water consumption water consumption of jujube trees was obtained from a water balance formula for different treatments for the entire growth period crop water consumption etc mm was calculated according to the following equation li et al 2022 3 e t c p i u r d Î´ w where p i u d r and Î´w are the effective rainfall irrigation water amount recharge of underground water runoff deep seepage and sws depletion by jujube trees in the growth period mm respectively groundwater depth at the experimental site was greater than 40 m and no runoff was generated during the growing season therefore u and r were not included in the formula in addition there was no deep seepage because drip irrigation was applied according to soil texture and sampling data during tests however wild animals chewed on pipes which caused leakage and loss of irrigation water that water loss was defined as wa therefore the water consumption formula eq 3 was adjusted as follows eqs 4 7 4 e t c p i Î´ w wa 5 wa i 1 n w ai 6 w ai q i t i 7 e t c p i Î´ w i 1 n q i t i the theoretical irrigation water amount i was determined by transforming eq 7 to eq 8 8 i e t c p Î´ w i 1 n q i t i in the equations w a is the additional water loss including the loss of animal chewed pipes the animal trampled pipes and other water loss n is the total number of wild animals chewed on pipes q i is the water loss of damaged pipes each time and t i is the time of damaged pipes each time in this experiment when a pipe is damaged by wild animals it is usually repaired immediately so w a is neglected in the calculation 2 3 5 yield water use efficiency and fruit quality harvests occurred october 3 4 2020 and october 7 8 2021 plant yield y kg plant 1 was calculated as the weight of all the trees after harvesting the wue was calculated as follows 9 wue y et c where wue is the water use efficiency kg m 3 y is the jujube yield kg plant 1 and et c is the crop water consumption m3 plant 1 after harvest fruit samples were selected from each of the four directions of east west south and north on a jujube tree soluble protein was measured by the bradford method with coomassie brilliant blue g 250 and titration with 2 6 dichlorophenol indophenol sodium was used to determine vitamin c vc wang et al 2021 soluble solid content was determined using a pocket refractometer pal 1 0 53 atago tokyo japan organic acid content was determined using an acid base titration method soluble total sugar content was measured using the anthrone colorimetric method cui et al 2008 2 3 6 economic analysis the economic benefit was calculated as follows 10 e n t o t i where e n is the net income t o is the total output ha 1 t i is the total input ha 1 including irrigation pipe material cost irrigation water cost fertilizer cost labor cost and others in addition coarse sand can be sourced locally and its cost is mainly for labor 2 4 statistical analyses data processing was conducted in excel 2019 microsoft corp raymond washington usa figures were plotted using originpro 2018 origin lab corp hampton massachusetts usa one way anova was performed to analyze effects of different treatments and the least significant difference lsd method was used to compare differences in means at a 5 level of significance analyses were conducted using spss 22 statistical software ibm inc new york usa 3 results 3 1 soil surface wetted area soil surface wetted area of each treatment after irrigation in the growth periods is presented in fig 4 during irrigation of jujube trees the largest surface wetted area was in dw3 which was significantly different p 0 05 compared with areas in other treatments in 2020 and 2021 in addition surface wetted area increased with the increase in irrigation water in sti treatments the surface wetted area in dw3 was 2 0 2020 and 2 1 2021 times larger than that in sw3 in 2020 surface wetted area in sw3 was significantly different compared with that in sw2 and sw1 but there was no significant difference between sw2 and sw3 after the second irrigation in 2021 surface wetted area in sw3 was also significantly different compared with that in sw2 and sw1 but after the 5th and 6th irrigations there was no significant difference between sw2 and sw3 3 2 average soil water storage and soil water deficit 3 2 1 average soil water storage in 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers table 3 shows changes in average sws in 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers in different growth periods there were no significant differences among treatments in the main root layer 0 60 cm with the exception of significant difference between sw3 and sw1 treatments in the blossom and young fruit period in 2020 however in the 60 100 cm soil layer sws in sw3 increased significantly p 0 05 by 34 3 48 3 in 2020 and by 22 3 40 3 in 2021 from the blossom and young fruit period to the fruit maturation period compared with dw3 in the average growth period sw3 significantly increased sws by 34 7 2020 and 30 3 2021 compared with that in dw3 in addition compared with dw3 sw2 increased sws by 21 0 2020 and 16 1 2021 during fruit swelling and fruit maturation periods although there was no significant difference between dw3 and sw2 during leaf emergence and blossom and young fruit periods average sws increased by 18 4 2020 and 7 7 2021 in dw3 compared with that in sw2 in the average growth period of jujube trees sti tended to increase with the increase in irrigation water addition both in the entire soil layer and in the 0 60 cm soil layer in addition although sws was not significantly different between sw1 and dw3 in the 60 100 cm soil layer table 3 it increased by 16 2 2020 and 5 4 2021 in the key water demand period blossom and young fruit period of jujube trees in the average growth period sti significantly increased p 0 05 sws in the 0 60 cm layer and the entire soil profile compared with that with surface drip irrigation under equivalent irrigation water conditions thus sti could store more soil water than surface drip irrigation and sws in the 0 100 cm soil layer increased by 5 0 12 4 in 2020 and by 3 1 11 5 in 2021 3 2 2 comparison of the soil water deficit soil water deficit was compared between sti and surface drip irrigation in the 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers fig 5 there was no soil water deficit dsw 0 in the 0 60 cm soil layer in the different treatments during the entire growth period in either year in 2020 a moderate water deficit 0 dsw 25 was observed in dw3 but not in sw2 and sw3 in the 60 100 cm soil layer during each growth period soil water deficit decreased significantly p 0 05 in sw3 compared with that in dw3 from the blossom and young fruit period to the fruit maturation period the dsw was significantly lower in sw3 than in dw3 in sw2 irrigation water decreased by one sixth compared with that in dw3 but there was no water deficit throughout the growth period in the 60 100 cm soil layer in 2021 the dsw was significantly different between dw3 and sw3 with a dsw in dw3 during leaf emergence and fruit maturation periods in addition although there was a dsw in the leaf emergence period in sw1 and there was no water deficit in other growth periods in the 60 100 cm soil layer in 2021 according to two years of data on the entire soil profile 0 100 cm there was no water deficit in either sw2 or sw3 whereas in dw3 there was a dsw in 75 of the growth periods 3 2 3 dynamics of mean soil water deficit before irrigation in the 0 100 cm soil layer all treatments showed a moderate water deficit dsw 25 in the 0 20 cm soil layer from leaf emergence period to fruit swelling period in both years with the exception of a slight water deficit in the 0 10 cm layer during fruit expansion in sw1 in 2020 fig 6 many wilted and dead roots were observed in the 0 20 cm layer during the experiment which indicated the 0 20 cm soil layer was most susceptible to meteorological conditions however during fruit ripening a moderate water deficit in the 0 20 cm soil layer and a slight water deficit in the 20 30 cm soil layer were observed in all treatments in both years which were associated with a decrease in temperatures during that growth period fig 3 there was no dsw in sw1 and sw2 in the 40 80 cm soil layer in the blossom and young fruit period whereas in sw3 there was a dsw in some layers from 40 cm to 80 cm which might be related to increased water consumption by jujube trees in sw3 figs 4 and 8 the increase in water consumption also associated with increases in yield in sw3 fig 10 in dw3 there was a dsw throughout the soil profile from the blossom and young fruit period to the fruit maturation period in 2020 and in leaf emergence fruit swelling and fruit maturation periods in 2021 by contrast in sw3 there was no water deficit in the 40 90 cm soil layer during the entire growth period in 2020 and no water deficit in the 50 100 cm soil layer in 2021 in addition an increase in rainfall during the fruit maturation period reduced the water deficit in the 0 20 cm soil layer figs 3 and 6 3 3 crop water consumption 3 3 1 wild animal water consumption chewing on irrigation pipes by wild animals is a normal event in this area number of times damaged and leakage flow rates l h 1 from irrigation pipes chewed on by wild animals are shown in table 4 irrigation pipes were damaged three times in 2020 and four times in 2021 leakage flow rate was monitored in 2021 and it was different each time pipes were damaged because of different shapes and sizes of small holes in a pipe teeth marks of animals were observed on pipes fig 7 notably because of the small area of the experimental field 3 024 m2 and the need to monitor the irrigation process damaged pipes were easily detected and repaired in a timely fashion therefore w a was not considered in etc further because any water seepage was short term 3 3 2 variations in crop water consumption during the growth period of jujube trees in both years etc increased and then decreased fig 8 the maximum etc in each treatment was observed during the fruit swelling period the lowest etc was in sw1 in all stages which might be related to slowed growth and reduction in yield due to less irrigation fig 10 in addition etc in the fruit swelling period increased by 2 6 15 9 in 2021 compared with that in 2020 except in sw1 which was associated with an average temperature increase of 3 2 c in july fig 3 with sti over the entire growth period etc gradually increased as the amount of irrigation water increased and etc in sw1 was significantly different from that in other treatments except sw2 in 2020 fig 9 the highest etc in 2020 was 418 2 mm in dw3 and in 2021 it was 401 5 mm in sw3 and there was no significant difference between the treatments the etc in sw1 was significantly different from that in sw3 and dw3 which was related to the reduction in irrigation water however compared with dw3 the surface wetted area with sti decreased significantly p 0 05 fig 4 3 4 yield and water use efficiency effects of sti and surface drip irrigation on jujube yield and wue in the 2 years are shown in fig 10 yield increased with the increase in irrigation amount and with sti the relation was linear in both years fig 11 in 2020 yield increased significantly p 0 05 in sw1 sw2 and sw3 whereas sw3 has no significant difference with dw3 compared with dw3 sw3 increased yield by 13 3 in 2020 and 58 0 p 0 05 in 2021 respectively in 2021 yield was not significantly different between sw1 and dw3 compared with dw3 yields in sw1 and sw2 decreased by 41 0 and 13 3 respectively in 2020 whereas in 2021 yields in sw1 and sw2 increased by 3 0 and 15 3 respectively the highest yields were in sw3 in both years with 7 1 kg plant 1 in 2020 and 6 6 kg plant 1 in 2021 however the lowest yields were 3 7 kg plant 1 in sw1 in 2020 and 4 2 kg plant 1 in dw3 in 2021 the highest wues were in sti treatments in both years the highest wue was in sw3 in 2020 and in sw1 in 2021 compared with dw3 wue was significantly higher in sw3 in 2020 whereas in 2021 there was no significant difference between the two treatments on average sti increased yield by 0 6 and wue by 27 3 in both years 3 5 quality indices of jujube quality after fruit maturation in each treatment are shown in table 5 the highest vc content was in sw3 with 50 0 mg 100 g 1 in 2020 and 43 8 mg 100 g 1 in 2021 which were significant increases p 0 05 of 23 9 and 58 1 respectively compared with values in dw3 compared with surface drip irrigation average fruit vc content in sti treatments decreased by 4 2 in 2020 but increased by 30 2 in 2021 compared with dw3 soluble protein content increased significantly 28 6 in sw3 in 2020 in 2021 the increase in sw3 was 14 7 but the difference compared with dw3 was not significant there were no significant differences in soluble solids between the treatments in either year the highest organic acid content was in dw3 at 0 9 in 2020 and 0 5 in 2021 and it differed significantly from content in sw1 but not from that in sw3 the highest soluble total sugar content was in sw3 in 2020 but content did not differ among treatments in 2021 the highest soluble total sugar content was in dw3 in a comparison of the 2 years average total soluble sugar content in each treatment was 3 1 times higher in 2021 than in 2020 the sugar acid ratio is an important indicator of fruit flavor and the highest values were in sw1 at 39 8 2020 and 76 5 2021 there was no difference in the ratio among treatments in 2020 in 2021 the ratio was not significantly different between sw1 and sw3 although the ratio in sw1 increased significantly p 0 05 compared with that in sw2 and dw3 on average with sti vc content increased by 9 8 soluble protein content by 15 6 and the sugar to acid ratio by 12 2 3 6 correlation analyses between soil water yield and water use efficiency correlations were performed between soil water indicators irrigation water amount etc yield and wue with sti in both years fig 12 yield was strongly positively correlated with irrigation amount etc and wue in both years soil water storage was strongly 2020 and weakly 2021 positively correlated with irrigation water amount soil water deficit was negatively correlated with irrigation amount etc and yield in addition irrigation water amount was significantly positively correlated with etc in both years 2020 p 0 01 2021 p 0 05 irrigation water amount and wue were strongly positively correlated in 2020 and weakly positively correlated in 2021 3 7 comprehensive economic benefit analysis jujube trees provide both economic and ecological benefits in this area as shown in table 6 net income increased in sw3 compared with that in dw3 in both years although sti required sand and gravel filler the study area has abundant sand and gravel resources that can be locally sourced in addition a sand tube can be used for more than 1 year compared with dw3 net income decreased by 1949 ha 1 in sw2 although one sixth less water was used the above analysis showed that sti could improve net income compared with that with surface drip irrigation under the same irrigation water amount and the reduction in net benefit was not substantial with sti at lower irrigation water amounts unfortunately the price of water has increased in the study region because of the water shortage whereas the price of jujube has fallen because of oversupply when farmers compare the high yields and increasing prices of maize table 6 they are not very motivated to cultivate jujube forests in this region however failure to cultivate jujube may lead to a potential ecological crisis because jujube forests are also a barrier against wind and sand in this desert oasis region therefore in a comprehensive evaluation of benefits sti can improve net income compared with that with surface drip irrigation and also play a very important role in maintaining forests to protect the ecology 4 discussion 4 1 effects of two irrigation patterns on soil infiltration and soil water indicators surface soil moisture is highly susceptible to meteorological conditions after irrigation soil water is gradually dissipated by surface evaporation and plant transpiration colak et al 2017 with drip irrigation soil water is lost in soil surface evaporation from wetted areas below drip emitters and excessive downward infiltration from wetted areas hao et al 2007 in this study sti significantly reduced the average surface wetted area by 50 6 compared with that with surface drip irrigation in two years fig 4 this indicated that sti shifted water from the wetted surface to subsurface infiltration which is beneficial because soil surface evaporation decreases and effectiveness of soil water in the rhizosphere increases in a similar study sti reduced evaporation by approximately 26 within 4 days after irrigation compared with evaporation with surface drip irrigation meshkat et al 1999 thus sti effectively reduced surface evaporation which in turn increased soil water content and sws in the subsoil adequate soil moisture content contributes to growth of crop roots increases in yield and improvement in quality dong et al 2022 hu et al 2009 cui et al 2021 found that downward extension of a root system increases soil porosity and water transport channels which contribute to increased subsoil water storage and alleviate dry soil layers in this study sti can increase 60 100 cm sws in the root zone of jujube trees and thereby may increase root content such improvement in the root soil system can establish preferential flow and large soil pore spaces which in turn provide a good soil water air environment similarly wang et al 2020b found that increases in infiltration holes significantly increase average soil water content 0 100 cm soil layer and mitigate soil desiccation 220 cm depth in a shrubland in addition this study showed that sti slowed down the mean dsw at 60 100 cm fig 5 and the pre irrigation dsw during parts of the growing periods fig 6 the results may be explained by sti increasing soil infiltration and reducing soil evaporation and thus increasing the yield and improving the wue fig 10 unfortunately despite reductions in surface wetted area using sti there was still water loss due to evaporation compared with surface drip irrigation further reductions in soil evaporation by addition of mulch materials e g straw mulch to the soil surface will be investigated in future studies 4 2 variations in crop water consumption in arid agroecosystems growth of vegetation consumes much of irrigation water however wild animals are essential members in many arid agroecosystems and may influence distribution and management of agricultural water tang et al 2021b both small bodied rodents and large hoofed animals can damage irrigation pipes the former by gnawing and the latter by stomping and cutting the pipes which results in wasted irrigation water economic losses and increased labor costs and even soil erosion bengson 1977 lamm et al 2021 sorensen et al 2007 in the 2 years of this study wild rabbits chewed through the pipes and repaired them in time fig 7 some measures to address the problem of pipeline damage by rodents have included shallow burial insecticides and edible rodenticides sorensen et al 2007 in this study when animals chewed through pipe water flowed onto the surface the crop could not absorb much of this surface water because it was shallow and evaporated quickly however with timely management of the small test plot damaged and leaking pipes were quickly repaired and thus losses were minimized in addition wild hares tended to chew through pipes in the hot summer months june to august whereas during autumn they chewed on fallen fruits and pipes were not damaged therefore in the absence of an alternative source of drinking water during the dry summer rabbits found residual irrigation water by searching for surface pipes because many wild rabbits may have mastered the trick of chewing through pipes to drink water regardless of whether water is available or the weather is hot costs to agriculture may be incalculable moreover according to eq 8 and assuming that crop demand is certain any water leakage will increase the amount of irrigation water which cannot be ignored in arid regions when irrigating relatively large areas therefore a special water supplier needs to be installed to provide drinking water for wildlife and the amount of water used should be included in the calculation of water consumption for agricultural irrigation providing a water source for animals is one measure that can ensure agroecosystem stability and accounting for such water use also contributes to accurate estimates of agricultural and ecological water demand in a vegetation soil compound system pathways of water consumption are considered as either effective water use by physiological components e g transpiration or ineffective water loss e g evaporation runoff deep seepage bouman and tuong 2001 jin et al 2016 in this study because of timely detection and repair of animal damage to pipelines water consumption of animals could be ignored therefore evapotranspiration was the primary water consumption with jujube trees in a study on alfalfa subsurface drip irrigation effectively increased crop production by increasing crop transpiration while reducing soil water evaporation and surface water catchment lamm 2016 in this study sti significantly reduced p 0 05 the soil wetted area compared with that with surface drip irrigation fig 4 thus sti reduced ineffective water loss while increasing physiological water consumption of jujube trees which was also a key factor in yield increases fig 10 the etc increased in 2021 compared with that in 2020 except in sw1 in the fruit swelling period which might be because the average temperature increased 3 2 c in july this finding is consistent with that of bai et al 2021 who reported that an increase in average daily temperature of almost 0 8 c resulted in greater evapotranspiration under jujube 4 3 effects of two irrigation patterns on jujube water productivity and quality effective use of soil moisture is an overwhelming factor affecting fruit yield and quality dong et al 2022 providing a good environment for root growth is a major advantage with vertical tube irrigation and indirect subsurface drip irrigation and both types of irrigation increase jujube yield and water use compared with surface drip irrigation sun et al 2016 wang et al 2021 sti likely provided a good water temperature gas environment for root growth that was conducive to yield formation fig 10 with sti in this study jujube yields were positively correlated with the increase in irrigation water figs 11 12 the result is consistent with the findings of sun et al 2016 who showed that jujube yield increases with increasing irrigation amount moreover in this study there was no significant difference in wue with increases in irrigation water and even a tendency to decrease which is consistent with results reported by bai et al 2021 with sti jujube vc content increased significantly compared with that with surface drip irrigation under the same irrigation table 5 which is consistent with the conclusions of wang et al 2021 this result may be because in dw3 there was a dsw in the entire soil profile before irrigation in both fruit swelling and fruit maturation periods fig 6 and also a significant dsw p 0 05 in the 60 100 cm soil layer at fruit maturation fig 5 in addition with sti organic acid content decreased 7 0 2020 and 18 8 2021 and the sugar acid ratio increased 6 6 2020 and 16 0 2021 although yields in sw1 and sw2 decreased wue and sugar to acid ratio increased on average this result might be because sti reduced surface evaporation and increased effective use of moisture a limitation of this study was that the experiment was conducted under specific soil and meteorological conditions whereas if imposed under other conditions there may be problems such as insufficient irrigation amounts deep seepage of water and reduced water productivity despite possible limitations under the conditions of this study sti increased sws and soil water productivity and improve fruit quality 5 conclusion in the arid desert area of this study application of sand tube irrigation sti significantly reduced surface wetted area and thereby reduced evaporation from surface soil in a jujube plantation furthermore sti increased soil water storage in the entire soil profile and also the 60 100 cm soil layer and effectively mitigated soil water deficit with the same irrigation water used with surface drip irrigation sti increased jujube yield and water use efficiency and decreased fruit organic acid content while increasing the sugar acid ratio to improve jujube fruit quality because of limited availability of agricultural water as trees age and root systems are continuously extended some soil environmental problems may develop ultimately threatening the stability of sustainable jujube production to address problems of water scarcity the results of this study indicate that sti may be one of the more promising measures in addition a special drinking water source is recommended for wild animals in the dry season with the water used accounted for in agricultural irrigation demand future research will evaluate the effects of coupling water and fertilizer on jujube and the soil environment under mulched

9413,water scarcity and high evaporation are critical factors affecting crop growth and yield sustainable production of jujube ziziphus jujuba mill plantations is essential for economic development and environmental protection in arid desert areas of northwest china however few studies have investigated how plastic film mulching combined with sand tube irrigation sti affects soil surface wetted area soil water indices crop water consumption yield water use efficiency wue and fruit quality in jujube plantations in arid desert areas therefore a 2 year field experiment was conducted with three levels of sti sw1 300 m3 ha 1 sw2 375 m3 ha 1 sw3 450 m3 ha 1 and surface drip irrigation as a control dw3 450 m3 ha 1 compared with surface drip irrigation sti significantly decreased p 0 05 surface wetted area and sw3 significantly increased soil water storage in the 60 100 cm layer as well as the 0 100 cm soil layer sand tube irrigation also alleviated the soil water deficit in the 60 100 cm soil layer and each soil layer before irrigation and increased yield by 0 6 and wue by 27 3 on average the highest yield and wue were in sw3 in both years crop water consumption of jujube trees increased and then decreased during the growth period in both years and reached a maximum in the fruit swelling period with sti vitamin c content increased by 9 8 soluble protein content by 15 6 and the sugar to acid ratio by 12 2 in both years overall application of sti increased jujube yields and wue and improved fruit quality by increasing soil water storage and reducing soil water deficit thus this study demonstrates sti can increase economic and ecological benefits and also provides guidelines to apply sti and improve agricultural water productivity graphical abstract ga1 keywords sand tube irrigation soil water deficit jujube yield water use efficiency fruit quality arid desert area data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drought is an abiotic stress that decreases the water available for plant growth verslues et al 2006 and desertification is one of the major ecological and environmental problems worldwide vieira et al 2021 agriculture is the largest user of freshwater consuming more than two thirds of total freshwater worldwide gan et al 2014 kang et al 2017 water scarcity is the primary factors limiting sustainable agricultural development rosa et al 2020 according to food and agriculture organization of the united nations statistics fao 2021 between 720 and 811 million people experienced hunger in 2020 and projections are that approximately 660 million people will continue to face hunger in 2030 therefore crop improvement techniques and efficient cultivation practices that increase agricultural water productivity are essential to address the problem of water scarcity bailey serres et al 2019 kang et al 2017 kourgialas et al 2019 postel et al 2001 soil water deficit is one of the critical factors affecting stable growth of plantation forests moretti et al 2015 wu et al 2021 soil desiccation and soil water depletion are associated with decreases in soil water storage and soil water content huang et al 2021 however in arid areas irrigation is the dominant water supply for soil water replenishment and plant growth because of insufficient effective precipitation therefore irrigation water is a critical component in the terrestrial water cycle tang et al 2015 furthermore because of the conflict between water supply and demand water saving irrigation techniques are being promoted widely by governments to effectively ensure soil moisture is maintained in the rooting zone in order to increase yields and water use efficiency wue dai et al 2019 however such water saving irrigation techniques may reduce replenishment of subsoil moisture compared with that with conventional irrigation smith et al 2005 in addition long term deep soil water deficit may eventually lead to formation of a dry soil layer and soil environmental problems tang et al 2021a therefore identifying novel comprehensive water saving irrigation technology that can effectively replenish subsoil moisture is the key to solve the problem of water scarcity in arid areas drip irrigation is one of the most efficient water saving technologies and therefore has widespread application in agricultural production surendran et al 2016 yang et al 2020 however because of high irrigation frequency large surface wetted area and saturated areas under emitters surface drip irrigation can easily become ineffective surface evaporation in arid areas hao et al 2007 meshkat et al 2000 in addition because of high evaporation and low precipitation salinization is also a common problem under drip irrigation in arid areas burt et al 2003 wang et al 2019 subsurface drip irrigation is effective in reducing surface evaporation and is widely recognized to improve crop yields and wue colak et al 2018 payero et al 2008 valentin et al 2020 however clogged emitters and water leakage caused by rodent damage are prominent problems that currently need to be addressed lamm 2009 oliver et al 2014 yavuz et al 2010 conventional subsurface drip irrigation directly infiltrates deep well or reservoir water into crop root systems resulting in low temperatures and high soil water contents which may lead to undesirable soil hydrothermal environments and decreases in root enzyme and beneficial microorganism activities in the root zone pendergast et al 2019 sand tube irrigation sti is an indirect subsurface drip irrigation method that increases efficient soil water infiltration and decreases soil evaporation compared with surface drip irrigation meshkat et al 1998 2000 sun et al 2016 yanni et al 2003 moreover sti pipelines are above the surface which results in slow increases in water temperature and oxygen content while irrigation water infiltrates into root systems in addition sti emitters are less susceptible to clogging because of the relatively high flow rate thus application of sti can be highly advantageous in forestry cultivation in arid areas jujube trees are indigenous to china and have been one of the most common and preferred trees for over 4000 years because of their economic and ecological value li et al 2011 song et al 2019 the fruit has both nutritional and health care benefits and large areas of jujube trees are cultivated in arid regions of northwest china bai et al 2021 wang et al 2020a in the minqin oasis irrigation district in particular with little rainfall and high evaporation jujube has become the main economic and ecological tree species because of its tolerance of drought and degraded land and ecological benefits in addition to strong government support wang et al 2022 in recent years especially since 2018 jujube fruit prices have also fallen dramatically because increases jujube production exceeded demand as a result benefits to jujube farmers have fallen dramatically because of lower fruit prices and higher water prices in some arid regions leading farmers to decrease water irrigation for jujube trees in some areas to ensure only tree survival rather than to pursue benefits in some areas jujube trees have been cut down and replaced with other field crops to ensure profitability which may negatively affect the local ecology film mulching is an effective agronomic measure used to conserve moisture and improve wue jin et al 2016 liang et al 2018 combined film mulching and drip irrigation is widely used in arid areas to improve water productivity nouri et al 2019 generally in local areas traditional irrigation methods for jujube trees are furrow irrigation and surface drip irrigation wang et al 2022 the similar method of sti has also been investigated for effects on soil temperature and water transportation in soil evaporation indoor simulation experiments and in field trials on jujube trees olive trees and grape vines ben gal et al 2004 meshkat et al 1998 2000 sun et al 2016 yanni et al 2003 overall plastic film mulching with drip irrigation has been widely used in field crops and single sti has also been extended to some sparsely planted forestry systems however application of plastic film mulching combined with sti has not been reported for jujube in arid desert areas a novel comprehensive irrigation approach that saves water has low evaporation can effectively replenish soil layer water and improve jujube water productivity is needed in jujube cultivation therefore the objectives of this study were the following 1 investigate effects of sti and surface drip irrigation on surface soil wetted area after irrigation and changes in soil water storage 2 evaluate average water deficits in different treatments in different growth periods and variations in soil water deficits before irrigation in each soil layer and 3 compare effects of sti and surface drip irrigation on water consumption characteristics yield wue and quality of jujube fruit 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of study site the experiment was conducted at the qinfeng forestry experimental station 38 63 n 103 08 e in minqin county wuwei city gansu province china fig 1 the site is on the edge of tengger and badain jaran deserts the area climate is temperate continental and extremely arid annual mean precipitation is 110 mm annual mean temperature is 7 8 average annual evaporation is 2644 mm and sunshine time is 3134 5 h groundwater depth is below 40 m soil type soil dry bulk density and field water capacity mass are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design soil moisture status and growth characteristics of 7 year old jujube trees ziziphus jun jujube with heights from 2 5 to 3 0 m were monitored from may to october in 2020 and 2021 spacing of rows was 3 5 m and that of trees was 1 5 m a cylindrical sand tube 10 cm in diameter and 20 cm in depth filled with 2 3 mm fine gravel was placed 30 cm from jujube trees on both sides fig 2 each sand tube was equipped with a small tube and a drip emitter and the flow rate of the drip emitter was 4 l h 1 jujube trees were planted in a furrow rows of jujube trees were covered with film and a rain collection ditch was set up between two adjacent films to prevent damage and deterioration of the film a 2 4 mm soil layer was placed on top of the mulch groundwater electrical conductivity 6 2 Î¼s cm 1 salinity 2 9 ppt ph 7 2 was used as the irrigation source ball valves filters and water meters were installed on the water supply pipes filters were 80 mesh and accuracy of water meters was 0 0001 m3 according to physiological and growth characteristics of jun jujube five growing periods were identified 1 leafing emergence early may to late may 2 blossom and young fruit early june to late june 3 fruit swelling early july to mid august 4 fruit maturation late august to late september and 5 dormancy early october to next late april to investigate water saving characteristics of sti irrigation management strategies in 2020 and 2021 were selected according to irrigation experience and surface drip irrigation amounts with local jujube trees table 2 sand tube irrigation was examined at three levels low sw1 300 m3 ha 1 medium sw2 375 m3 ha 1 and high sw3 450 m3 ha 1 and surface drip irrigation was used as the control dw3 450 m3 ha 1 one water meter controlled one irrigation level in four rows and each row was 72 m long and included 78 trees hence 12 rows of jujube trees were used as test plots and one tree per row was selected for low and medium irrigation levels sw1 sw2 and two trees per row were selected for the high irrigation levels sw3 dw3 in addition the same emitter with a flow rate of 4 l h 1 was used with sti and surface drip irrigation moreover an impermeable separation zone was set to a depth of 60 cm in the middle of two jujube trees to prevent transfer of soil water between trees all jujube trees in the experiment grew well were of the same size and had the same management measures such as fertilization co nh2 2 0 43 kg plant 1 46 6 n kh2po4 0 29 kg plant 1 52 p2o5 34 k2o trimming ring cutting spraying and weeding 2 3 test items and calculation methods 2 3 1 meteorological data an automated weather station at the experimental site recorded rainfall air temperature wind velocity relative air humidity atmospheric pressure and solar radiation every 30 min during all jujube growth stages rainfall during the entire growth period of jujube trees was 59 5 mm in 2020 and 82 5 mm in 2021 and the effective rainfall 5 mm was 27 6 mm in 2020 and 50 2 mm in 2021 mean temperature was 19 1 in 2020 and 20 4 in 2021 and maximum and minimum temperatures were 27 4 2020 and 27 4 2021 and 10 8 2020 and 14 0 2021 respectively fig 3 2 3 2 soil wetted area and soil water storage the soil wetted area was calculated according to the method of guan et al 2016 with the following specific steps after irrigation dry and wet areas were clearly separated on the soil surface a plastic film was laid flat on the soil surface and the outline of the wetted area was drawn with a signature pen the area outlined on the plastic film was then photographed and imported into the auto cad 2020 software autodesk san rafael california usa to calculate the area according to the scale fine roots diameter 2 mm are the dominant organs for water and nutrient uptake in forest trees montagnoli et al 2012 the main absorbent roots 2 mm in diameter of jujube trees are distributed in the 0 60 cm soil layer ma et al 2017 therefore soil samples to 100 cm were obtained using a soil auger inner diameter 40 mm with samples collected every 10 cm soils were sampled before and after irrigation during jujube growth periods soils were oven dried to determine gravimetric soil water content and then soil water storage sws mm was calculated according to the following equation liu et al 2018 1 sws i 10 n d i b i swc i 10 1 i 10 20 100 where swc i is the soil water content gravimetric of the ith soil layer b i is the soil bulk density g cm 3 of the ith soil layer and d i is the soil depth cm of the ith soil layer 2 3 3 soil water deficit to quantify the degree of soil water deficit between soils the soil water deficit index dsw which is below management allowed soil water deficit was used dsw was calculated according to the following equation wang et al 2015 2 dsw 0 6 f c sws i 0 6 f c 100 where f c is the field moisture capacity mm and sws i is the sws of the ith soil layer values of dsw 0 0 25 25 50 and 50 were considered to indicate no soil water deficit slight water deficit moderate water deficit and severe water deficit respectively previous works have found that the soil water content at about 60 field capacity f c can be regarded as the point of water holding capacity for plant growth retardation and 0 6 f c can be regarded as the lower limit of soil water content can increase crop yield and wue liu and wang 1990 jha et al 2019 therefore 0 6f c can be used to be a specific soil moisture to evaluate the soil water deficit in this study 2 3 4 crop water consumption water consumption of jujube trees was obtained from a water balance formula for different treatments for the entire growth period crop water consumption etc mm was calculated according to the following equation li et al 2022 3 e t c p i u r d Î´ w where p i u d r and Î´w are the effective rainfall irrigation water amount recharge of underground water runoff deep seepage and sws depletion by jujube trees in the growth period mm respectively groundwater depth at the experimental site was greater than 40 m and no runoff was generated during the growing season therefore u and r were not included in the formula in addition there was no deep seepage because drip irrigation was applied according to soil texture and sampling data during tests however wild animals chewed on pipes which caused leakage and loss of irrigation water that water loss was defined as wa therefore the water consumption formula eq 3 was adjusted as follows eqs 4 7 4 e t c p i Î´ w wa 5 wa i 1 n w ai 6 w ai q i t i 7 e t c p i Î´ w i 1 n q i t i the theoretical irrigation water amount i was determined by transforming eq 7 to eq 8 8 i e t c p Î´ w i 1 n q i t i in the equations w a is the additional water loss including the loss of animal chewed pipes the animal trampled pipes and other water loss n is the total number of wild animals chewed on pipes q i is the water loss of damaged pipes each time and t i is the time of damaged pipes each time in this experiment when a pipe is damaged by wild animals it is usually repaired immediately so w a is neglected in the calculation 2 3 5 yield water use efficiency and fruit quality harvests occurred october 3 4 2020 and october 7 8 2021 plant yield y kg plant 1 was calculated as the weight of all the trees after harvesting the wue was calculated as follows 9 wue y et c where wue is the water use efficiency kg m 3 y is the jujube yield kg plant 1 and et c is the crop water consumption m3 plant 1 after harvest fruit samples were selected from each of the four directions of east west south and north on a jujube tree soluble protein was measured by the bradford method with coomassie brilliant blue g 250 and titration with 2 6 dichlorophenol indophenol sodium was used to determine vitamin c vc wang et al 2021 soluble solid content was determined using a pocket refractometer pal 1 0 53 atago tokyo japan organic acid content was determined using an acid base titration method soluble total sugar content was measured using the anthrone colorimetric method cui et al 2008 2 3 6 economic analysis the economic benefit was calculated as follows 10 e n t o t i where e n is the net income t o is the total output ha 1 t i is the total input ha 1 including irrigation pipe material cost irrigation water cost fertilizer cost labor cost and others in addition coarse sand can be sourced locally and its cost is mainly for labor 2 4 statistical analyses data processing was conducted in excel 2019 microsoft corp raymond washington usa figures were plotted using originpro 2018 origin lab corp hampton massachusetts usa one way anova was performed to analyze effects of different treatments and the least significant difference lsd method was used to compare differences in means at a 5 level of significance analyses were conducted using spss 22 statistical software ibm inc new york usa 3 results 3 1 soil surface wetted area soil surface wetted area of each treatment after irrigation in the growth periods is presented in fig 4 during irrigation of jujube trees the largest surface wetted area was in dw3 which was significantly different p 0 05 compared with areas in other treatments in 2020 and 2021 in addition surface wetted area increased with the increase in irrigation water in sti treatments the surface wetted area in dw3 was 2 0 2020 and 2 1 2021 times larger than that in sw3 in 2020 surface wetted area in sw3 was significantly different compared with that in sw2 and sw1 but there was no significant difference between sw2 and sw3 after the second irrigation in 2021 surface wetted area in sw3 was also significantly different compared with that in sw2 and sw1 but after the 5th and 6th irrigations there was no significant difference between sw2 and sw3 3 2 average soil water storage and soil water deficit 3 2 1 average soil water storage in 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers table 3 shows changes in average sws in 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers in different growth periods there were no significant differences among treatments in the main root layer 0 60 cm with the exception of significant difference between sw3 and sw1 treatments in the blossom and young fruit period in 2020 however in the 60 100 cm soil layer sws in sw3 increased significantly p 0 05 by 34 3 48 3 in 2020 and by 22 3 40 3 in 2021 from the blossom and young fruit period to the fruit maturation period compared with dw3 in the average growth period sw3 significantly increased sws by 34 7 2020 and 30 3 2021 compared with that in dw3 in addition compared with dw3 sw2 increased sws by 21 0 2020 and 16 1 2021 during fruit swelling and fruit maturation periods although there was no significant difference between dw3 and sw2 during leaf emergence and blossom and young fruit periods average sws increased by 18 4 2020 and 7 7 2021 in dw3 compared with that in sw2 in the average growth period of jujube trees sti tended to increase with the increase in irrigation water addition both in the entire soil layer and in the 0 60 cm soil layer in addition although sws was not significantly different between sw1 and dw3 in the 60 100 cm soil layer table 3 it increased by 16 2 2020 and 5 4 2021 in the key water demand period blossom and young fruit period of jujube trees in the average growth period sti significantly increased p 0 05 sws in the 0 60 cm layer and the entire soil profile compared with that with surface drip irrigation under equivalent irrigation water conditions thus sti could store more soil water than surface drip irrigation and sws in the 0 100 cm soil layer increased by 5 0 12 4 in 2020 and by 3 1 11 5 in 2021 3 2 2 comparison of the soil water deficit soil water deficit was compared between sti and surface drip irrigation in the 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers fig 5 there was no soil water deficit dsw 0 in the 0 60 cm soil layer in the different treatments during the entire growth period in either year in 2020 a moderate water deficit 0 dsw 25 was observed in dw3 but not in sw2 and sw3 in the 60 100 cm soil layer during each growth period soil water deficit decreased significantly p 0 05 in sw3 compared with that in dw3 from the blossom and young fruit period to the fruit maturation period the dsw was significantly lower in sw3 than in dw3 in sw2 irrigation water decreased by one sixth compared with that in dw3 but there was no water deficit throughout the growth period in the 60 100 cm soil layer in 2021 the dsw was significantly different between dw3 and sw3 with a dsw in dw3 during leaf emergence and fruit maturation periods in addition although there was a dsw in the leaf emergence period in sw1 and there was no water deficit in other growth periods in the 60 100 cm soil layer in 2021 according to two years of data on the entire soil profile 0 100 cm there was no water deficit in either sw2 or sw3 whereas in dw3 there was a dsw in 75 of the growth periods 3 2 3 dynamics of mean soil water deficit before irrigation in the 0 100 cm soil layer all treatments showed a moderate water deficit dsw 25 in the 0 20 cm soil layer from leaf emergence period to fruit swelling period in both years with the exception of a slight water deficit in the 0 10 cm layer during fruit expansion in sw1 in 2020 fig 6 many wilted and dead roots were observed in the 0 20 cm layer during the experiment which indicated the 0 20 cm soil layer was most susceptible to meteorological conditions however during fruit ripening a moderate water deficit in the 0 20 cm soil layer and a slight water deficit in the 20 30 cm soil layer were observed in all treatments in both years which were associated with a decrease in temperatures during that growth period fig 3 there was no dsw in sw1 and sw2 in the 40 80 cm soil layer in the blossom and young fruit period whereas in sw3 there was a dsw in some layers from 40 cm to 80 cm which might be related to increased water consumption by jujube trees in sw3 figs 4 and 8 the increase in water consumption also associated with increases in yield in sw3 fig 10 in dw3 there was a dsw throughout the soil profile from the blossom and young fruit period to the fruit maturation period in 2020 and in leaf emergence fruit swelling and fruit maturation periods in 2021 by contrast in sw3 there was no water deficit in the 40 90 cm soil layer during the entire growth period in 2020 and no water deficit in the 50 100 cm soil layer in 2021 in addition an increase in rainfall during the fruit maturation period reduced the water deficit in the 0 20 cm soil layer figs 3 and 6 3 3 crop water consumption 3 3 1 wild animal water consumption chewing on irrigation pipes by wild animals is a normal event in this area number of times damaged and leakage flow rates l h 1 from irrigation pipes chewed on by wild animals are shown in table 4 irrigation pipes were damaged three times in 2020 and four times in 2021 leakage flow rate was monitored in 2021 and it was different each time pipes were damaged because of different shapes and sizes of small holes in a pipe teeth marks of animals were observed on pipes fig 7 notably because of the small area of the experimental field 3 024 m2 and the need to monitor the irrigation process damaged pipes were easily detected and repaired in a timely fashion therefore w a was not considered in etc further because any water seepage was short term 3 3 2 variations in crop water consumption during the growth period of jujube trees in both years etc increased and then decreased fig 8 the maximum etc in each treatment was observed during the fruit swelling period the lowest etc was in sw1 in all stages which might be related to slowed growth and reduction in yield due to less irrigation fig 10 in addition etc in the fruit swelling period increased by 2 6 15 9 in 2021 compared with that in 2020 except in sw1 which was associated with an average temperature increase of 3 2 c in july fig 3 with sti over the entire growth period etc gradually increased as the amount of irrigation water increased and etc in sw1 was significantly different from that in other treatments except sw2 in 2020 fig 9 the highest etc in 2020 was 418 2 mm in dw3 and in 2021 it was 401 5 mm in sw3 and there was no significant difference between the treatments the etc in sw1 was significantly different from that in sw3 and dw3 which was related to the reduction in irrigation water however compared with dw3 the surface wetted area with sti decreased significantly p 0 05 fig 4 3 4 yield and water use efficiency effects of sti and surface drip irrigation on jujube yield and wue in the 2 years are shown in fig 10 yield increased with the increase in irrigation amount and with sti the relation was linear in both years fig 11 in 2020 yield increased significantly p 0 05 in sw1 sw2 and sw3 whereas sw3 has no significant difference with dw3 compared with dw3 sw3 increased yield by 13 3 in 2020 and 58 0 p 0 05 in 2021 respectively in 2021 yield was not significantly different between sw1 and dw3 compared with dw3 yields in sw1 and sw2 decreased by 41 0 and 13 3 respectively in 2020 whereas in 2021 yields in sw1 and sw2 increased by 3 0 and 15 3 respectively the highest yields were in sw3 in both years with 7 1 kg plant 1 in 2020 and 6 6 kg plant 1 in 2021 however the lowest yields were 3 7 kg plant 1 in sw1 in 2020 and 4 2 kg plant 1 in dw3 in 2021 the highest wues were in sti treatments in both years the highest wue was in sw3 in 2020 and in sw1 in 2021 compared with dw3 wue was significantly higher in sw3 in 2020 whereas in 2021 there was no significant difference between the two treatments on average sti increased yield by 0 6 and wue by 27 3 in both years 3 5 quality indices of jujube quality after fruit maturation in each treatment are shown in table 5 the highest vc content was in sw3 with 50 0 mg 100 g 1 in 2020 and 43 8 mg 100 g 1 in 2021 which were significant increases p 0 05 of 23 9 and 58 1 respectively compared with values in dw3 compared with surface drip irrigation average fruit vc content in sti treatments decreased by 4 2 in 2020 but increased by 30 2 in 2021 compared with dw3 soluble protein content increased significantly 28 6 in sw3 in 2020 in 2021 the increase in sw3 was 14 7 but the difference compared with dw3 was not significant there were no significant differences in soluble solids between the treatments in either year the highest organic acid content was in dw3 at 0 9 in 2020 and 0 5 in 2021 and it differed significantly from content in sw1 but not from that in sw3 the highest soluble total sugar content was in sw3 in 2020 but content did not differ among treatments in 2021 the highest soluble total sugar content was in dw3 in a comparison of the 2 years average total soluble sugar content in each treatment was 3 1 times higher in 2021 than in 2020 the sugar acid ratio is an important indicator of fruit flavor and the highest values were in sw1 at 39 8 2020 and 76 5 2021 there was no difference in the ratio among treatments in 2020 in 2021 the ratio was not significantly different between sw1 and sw3 although the ratio in sw1 increased significantly p 0 05 compared with that in sw2 and dw3 on average with sti vc content increased by 9 8 soluble protein content by 15 6 and the sugar to acid ratio by 12 2 3 6 correlation analyses between soil water yield and water use efficiency correlations were performed between soil water indicators irrigation water amount etc yield and wue with sti in both years fig 12 yield was strongly positively correlated with irrigation amount etc and wue in both years soil water storage was strongly 2020 and weakly 2021 positively correlated with irrigation water amount soil water deficit was negatively correlated with irrigation amount etc and yield in addition irrigation water amount was significantly positively correlated with etc in both years 2020 p 0 01 2021 p 0 05 irrigation water amount and wue were strongly positively correlated in 2020 and weakly positively correlated in 2021 3 7 comprehensive economic benefit analysis jujube trees provide both economic and ecological benefits in this area as shown in table 6 net income increased in sw3 compared with that in dw3 in both years although sti required sand and gravel filler the study area has abundant sand and gravel resources that can be locally sourced in addition a sand tube can be used for more than 1 year compared with dw3 net income decreased by 1949 ha 1 in sw2 although one sixth less water was used the above analysis showed that sti could improve net income compared with that with surface drip irrigation under the same irrigation water amount and the reduction in net benefit was not substantial with sti at lower irrigation water amounts unfortunately the price of water has increased in the study region because of the water shortage whereas the price of jujube has fallen because of oversupply when farmers compare the high yields and increasing prices of maize table 6 they are not very motivated to cultivate jujube forests in this region however failure to cultivate jujube may lead to a potential ecological crisis because jujube forests are also a barrier against wind and sand in this desert oasis region therefore in a comprehensive evaluation of benefits sti can improve net income compared with that with surface drip irrigation and also play a very important role in maintaining forests to protect the ecology 4 discussion 4 1 effects of two irrigation patterns on soil infiltration and soil water indicators surface soil moisture is highly susceptible to meteorological conditions after irrigation soil water is gradually dissipated by surface evaporation and plant transpiration colak et al 2017 with drip irrigation soil water is lost in soil surface evaporation from wetted areas below drip emitters and excessive downward infiltration from wetted areas hao et al 2007 in this study sti significantly reduced the average surface wetted area by 50 6 compared with that with surface drip irrigation in two years fig 4 this indicated that sti shifted water from the wetted surface to subsurface infiltration which is beneficial because soil surface evaporation decreases and effectiveness of soil water in the rhizosphere increases in a similar study sti reduced evaporation by approximately 26 within 4 days after irrigation compared with evaporation with surface drip irrigation meshkat et al 1999 thus sti effectively reduced surface evaporation which in turn increased soil water content and sws in the subsoil adequate soil moisture content contributes to growth of crop roots increases in yield and improvement in quality dong et al 2022 hu et al 2009 cui et al 2021 found that downward extension of a root system increases soil porosity and water transport channels which contribute to increased subsoil water storage and alleviate dry soil layers in this study sti can increase 60 100 cm sws in the root zone of jujube trees and thereby may increase root content such improvement in the root soil system can establish preferential flow and large soil pore spaces which in turn provide a good soil water air environment similarly wang et al 2020b found that increases in infiltration holes significantly increase average soil water content 0 100 cm soil layer and mitigate soil desiccation 220 cm depth in a shrubland in addition this study showed that sti slowed down the mean dsw at 60 100 cm fig 5 and the pre irrigation dsw during parts of the growing periods fig 6 the results may be explained by sti increasing soil infiltration and reducing soil evaporation and thus increasing the yield and improving the wue fig 10 unfortunately despite reductions in surface wetted area using sti there was still water loss due to evaporation compared with surface drip irrigation further reductions in soil evaporation by addition of mulch materials e g straw mulch to the soil surface will be investigated in future studies 4 2 variations in crop water consumption in arid agroecosystems growth of vegetation consumes much of irrigation water however wild animals are essential members in many arid agroecosystems and may influence distribution and management of agricultural water tang et al 2021b both small bodied rodents and large hoofed animals can damage irrigation pipes the former by gnawing and the latter by stomping and cutting the pipes which results in wasted irrigation water economic losses and increased labor costs and even soil erosion bengson 1977 lamm et al 2021 sorensen et al 2007 in the 2 years of this study wild rabbits chewed through the pipes and repaired them in time fig 7 some measures to address the problem of pipeline damage by rodents have included shallow burial insecticides and edible rodenticides sorensen et al 2007 in this study when animals chewed through pipe water flowed onto the surface the crop could not absorb much of this surface water because it was shallow and evaporated quickly however with timely management of the small test plot damaged and leaking pipes were quickly repaired and thus losses were minimized in addition wild hares tended to chew through pipes in the hot summer months june to august whereas during autumn they chewed on fallen fruits and pipes were not damaged therefore in the absence of an alternative source of drinking water during the dry summer rabbits found residual irrigation water by searching for surface pipes because many wild rabbits may have mastered the trick of chewing through pipes to drink water regardless of whether water is available or the weather is hot costs to agriculture may be incalculable moreover according to eq 8 and assuming that crop demand is certain any water leakage will increase the amount of irrigation water which cannot be ignored in arid regions when irrigating relatively large areas therefore a special water supplier needs to be installed to provide drinking water for wildlife and the amount of water used should be included in the calculation of water consumption for agricultural irrigation providing a water source for animals is one measure that can ensure agroecosystem stability and accounting for such water use also contributes to accurate estimates of agricultural and ecological water demand in a vegetation soil compound system pathways of water consumption are considered as either effective water use by physiological components e g transpiration or ineffective water loss e g evaporation runoff deep seepage bouman and tuong 2001 jin et al 2016 in this study because of timely detection and repair of animal damage to pipelines water consumption of animals could be ignored therefore evapotranspiration was the primary water consumption with jujube trees in a study on alfalfa subsurface drip irrigation effectively increased crop production by increasing crop transpiration while reducing soil water evaporation and surface water catchment lamm 2016 in this study sti significantly reduced p 0 05 the soil wetted area compared with that with surface drip irrigation fig 4 thus sti reduced ineffective water loss while increasing physiological water consumption of jujube trees which was also a key factor in yield increases fig 10 the etc increased in 2021 compared with that in 2020 except in sw1 in the fruit swelling period which might be because the average temperature increased 3 2 c in july this finding is consistent with that of bai et al 2021 who reported that an increase in average daily temperature of almost 0 8 c resulted in greater evapotranspiration under jujube 4 3 effects of two irrigation patterns on jujube water productivity and quality effective use of soil moisture is an overwhelming factor affecting fruit yield and quality dong et al 2022 providing a good environment for root growth is a major advantage with vertical tube irrigation and indirect subsurface drip irrigation and both types of irrigation increase jujube yield and water use compared with surface drip irrigation sun et al 2016 wang et al 2021 sti likely provided a good water temperature gas environment for root growth that was conducive to yield formation fig 10 with sti in this study jujube yields were positively correlated with the increase in irrigation water figs 11 12 the result is consistent with the findings of sun et al 2016 who showed that jujube yield increases with increasing irrigation amount moreover in this study there was no significant difference in wue with increases in irrigation water and even a tendency to decrease which is consistent with results reported by bai et al 2021 with sti jujube vc content increased significantly compared with that with surface drip irrigation under the same irrigation table 5 which is consistent with the conclusions of wang et al 2021 this result may be because in dw3 there was a dsw in the entire soil profile before irrigation in both fruit swelling and fruit maturation periods fig 6 and also a significant dsw p 0 05 in the 60 100 cm soil layer at fruit maturation fig 5 in addition with sti organic acid content decreased 7 0 2020 and 18 8 2021 and the sugar acid ratio increased 6 6 2020 and 16 0 2021 although yields in sw1 and sw2 decreased wue and sugar to acid ratio increased on average this result might be because sti reduced surface evaporation and increased effective use of moisture a limitation of this study was that the experiment was conducted under specific soil and meteorological conditions whereas if imposed under other conditions there may be problems such as insufficient irrigation amounts deep seepage of water and reduced water productivity despite possible limitations under the conditions of this study sti increased sws and soil water productivity and improve fruit quality 5 conclusion in the arid desert area of this study application of sand tube irrigation sti significantly reduced surface wetted area and thereby reduced evaporation from surface soil in a jujube plantation furthermore sti increased soil water storage in the entire soil profile and also the 60 100 cm soil layer and effectively mitigated soil water deficit with the same irrigation water used with surface drip irrigation sti increased jujube yield and water use efficiency and decreased fruit organic acid content while increasing the sugar acid ratio to improve jujube fruit quality because of limited availability of agricultural water as trees age and root systems are continuously extended some soil environmental problems may develop ultimately threatening the stability of sustainable jujube production to address problems of water scarcity the results of this study indicate that sti may be one of the more promising measures in addition a special drinking water source is recommended for wild animals in the dry season with the water used accounted for in agricultural irrigation demand future research will evaluate the effects of coupling water and fertilizer on jujube and the soil environment under mulched

9414,water availability is the most limiting factor for the crop production sector and one of the main regulators of the spatial distribution of plants agriculture consumes more than two thirds of the planet s total fresh water this high consumption causes significant conflicts in terms of freshwater allocation between agriculture and other economic sectors in addition conventional irrigation cannot be sustained in many parts of the world due to rapid depletion of water resources thus it is considered a luxury use of water it is noted that in recent years the methods of irrigation water application have been improved currently research has been directed towards irrigation strategies that reduce water applications deficit irrigation strategies di and allowing the efficiency of its use to be increased without affecting plant growth or yield partial root zone drying prd is an effective irrigation method that saves water although it can affect the root activity of plants through the heterogeneous distribution of moisture in the soil indeed the basic underlying theory of this technique is the use of the hormonal response of the roots to water stress which can induce physiological reactions in the aerial parts of the plant by a reduction in stomatal conductance and transpiration hence the plant can limit its water losses due to transpiration with a non significant reduction in yield moreover this irrigation technique is of paramount importance in terms of minimizing groundwater pollution by reducing the return flow of irrigation water and consequently significantly reducing the leaching of agrochemical inputs to groundwater this work aims to clarify the origin of prd irrigation and to analyze some physiological aspects of plants grown under this technique as well as its environmentally friendly aspect then to synthesize some research work on improving water productivity and its efficiency in citrus crops keywords water stress deficit irrigation partial root zone drying conventional irrigation stomatal conductance water productivity yield pollution leaching citrus data availability all data are able to be used by scientific readers 1 introduction several countries around the world are facing the issue of freshwater availability where agriculture is highly dependent on irrigation consuming 70 of this vital resource fao 2017 the world food situation has steadily improved due to various factors including high yielding seed varieties irrigation plant nutrition and pest control fao 2004 indeed food security can only be ensured to a large extent by irrigated agriculture which makes it possible to achieve yields twice as high as those of rainfed crops sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 to feed and meet the needs of the population of 9 1 billion in 2050 global food production must increase by around 70 between 2005 07 and 2050 fao 2009 furthermore it is due to irrigation that agricultural yields and production have been able to achieve a rapid increase over the past three decades as well as it has contributed to reducing poverty and food prices while leading to the improved health and nutrition rosegrant et al 2009 according to unesco in 2017 irrigated agriculture represented 20 of cultivated land and contributed to 40 of world food production unlike rainfed agriculture which covers 80 of cultivated land in the world and is responsible for only 60 of plant production un water 2021 however agriculture is considered a major source of water pollution through the use of agrochemical inputs fertilizers pesticides etc and irrigation singh and craswell 2021 which are on the one hand necessary for the growth and improvement of crop production but on the other hand if they are not managed can lead to significant social economic and environmental costs fao 2017 traditional methods of irrigation such as gravity irrigation or surface irrigation would result in excessive water supply but applying too much water to the root zone is not only a waste of water but also a factor of leaching of chemicals and nutrients from the root zone of the crop and consequently an increased risk of groundwater pollution siyal et al 2012 kambou et al 2014 in addition traditional irrigation methods are very inefficient since they are characterized by low water productivity and cannot ensure long term sustainable food security sidhu et al 2021 moreover reduced irrigation water supplies during the growing season reduces nutrient leaching from the root zone resulting in reduced groundwater contamination alrajhi et al 2017 indeed irrigation has more influence than fertilization on the quality of leaching water hence adequate irrigation associated with optimal fertilization was effective in reducing the potential environmental risk caused by excessive fertilization in intensive crop production systems li et al 2018 it is therefore important to use suitable irrigation systems and management techniques that both save water and reduce leaching by reducing deep percolation deficit irrigation di is a water saving technique used in recent years in many parts of the world and especially in areas where water supply is limited leads to improved water productivity and water use efficiency since the amount of water applied is less than the total water needs of the crop without compromising production fereres and soriano 2007 asrey et al 2018 sidhu et al 2021 whereas partial root zone drying prd is a new form of di that has significantly improved yield per unit of water applied compared to conventional irrigation sadras 2009 ahmadi et al 2010 as well as improved water use efficiency without significant reduction in yield kang and zhang 2004 ben nouna et al 2016 besides it is considered an environmentally friendly irrigation strategy that can reduce the leaching of pollutants to the receiving environment kirda et al 2005 barzegari et al 2017 in recent years many advances have been made around the world to provide more efficient storage and distribution of irrigation water as well as improved application methods through the shift from flood to overhead sprinkler to low level sprinkler microjet and drip kriedemann et al 2003 regarding the prd technique it can be achieved through different irrigation methods among which we find drip furrow micro sprinkler depending on the crop species soil texture or climatic variables kang et zhang 2004 on the one hand hedley et al 2014 reported that prd and rdi strategies are difficult to apply in furrow irrigation systems and prd is difficult to implement in sprinkler irrigation systems unlike drip irrigation which allows the implementation of this prd technique on the other hand wang et al 2006 reported that the prd could not be applied to energy crops with sprinkler or drip irrigation methods due to the high costs whereas it is possible to use furrow irrigation practical limitations in the application of prd and rdi are related to the soil hydraulic properties the volume and frequency of irrigation water applications and the occurrence of seasonal precipitation hedley et al 2014 as reported by ben nouna et al 2016 the application of prd with a soil drying threshold and an alternating frequency of irrigation that is incompatible with the soil typology and also the with crop vegetative stage can have a significant reduction effect on biomass production through the allocation of the non astomatic component responsible for co2 fixation andersen et al 2008 concluded that prd during the tuber growth stage reduced tuber yield and quality the objective of this work is to carry out a bibliographical synthesis of the works having treated the prd irrigation technique by analyzing its main physiological and agronomic effects on crops and especially on citrus fruits given the economic importance of this sector at the global level and its sensitivity to water stress without forgetting the essential role of this irrigation in preserving the sustainability of the environment 2 the concept of partial root zone drying irrigation the use of deficit irrigation di techniques for preserving and saving water in agricultural production is crucial and indispensable in areas where drought is prevalence as a result it reduces the vegetative growth of trees subsequently reduces its ability to compete with reproductive growth and significantly reduces the cost of agricultural management measures chalmers 1981 furthermore the amount of soil moisture available for plant growth is significantly decreased by low rainfall paired with high rates of evapotranspiration consequently the amount of soil water that is available to plants is drastically reduced in regions with low annual precipitation less than 300 mm and high evapotranspiration rates durÃ¡n zuazo and rodrÃ­guez pleguezuelo 2008 furthermore crop production in most of west africa is primarily rain fed and agricultural development is hampered by both heat and water stress indeed warming in the future climate will exacerbate crop heat stress and accelerate evapotranspiration further reducing moisture availability in the soil and shortening the suitable growing season according to studies using the regcm4 modeling method cook and vizy 2013 besides to mitigate runoff farmers should plan irrigations using new scientific techniques that account for evapotranspiration losses since the last irrigation and apply no more water than is required for maximum economic yield and an adequate leaching fraction lehrsch et al 2014 hence the di approaches are helpful to reduce irrigation water loss through evapotranspiration especially in semi arid and arid areas fathian et al 2015 as the partial root zone drying prd is a modified technique of deficit irrigation di ahmadi et al 2010 which consists in irrigating the entire root zone with a quantity of water less than that lost by the phenomenon of evapotranspiration liu et al 2006 indeed prd could be used as a water saving strategy particularly in water scarce areas to mitigate the impact of climate change on decreasing precipitation and rising temperatures li et al 2018 however future predictions in a climate change scenario included an increase in greenhouse gases so elevated co2 concentrations in conjunction with water scarcity will be an additional challenge for prd experiments with elevated co2 concentrations recently revealed that photosynthetic rate grain yield and water productivity in maize plants were higher under deficit irrigation than under full irrigation li et al 2018 these findings point in a new direction for testing the performance of prd techniques in specific agro ecological conditions and when different environmental variables interact jovanovic et stikic 2018 the practices of partial drying of the root zone and as the name suggests include 2 types fixed partial drying or fixed prd which consists of irrigating half of the root system while exposing the other half to desiccation throughout the growing season and alternating partial drying in which the irrigation of both sides of the plant is done alternately to allow the wet side of the root to dry and the dry side to be fully irrigated chai et al 2016 jovanovic and stikic 2018 grimes et al 1968 are the first to apply the concept of prd irrigation in the field on cotton by alternating furrow irrigation in the usa then it was realized in iran on the bean crop through two types of irrigation furrow irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation by sepaskhah et al 1976 then and always to iran and on the bean crops samadi and sepaskhah 1984 have applied this technique through fixed and alternate furrow irrigation again and in order to fully understand the process of this irrigation method blackman and davies 1985 and zhang et al 1987 tried this technique in the laboratory by dividing the roots between two soil compartments and applying irrigation to only one compartment after further extensive studies on prd were done in australia and prd irrigation was exploited and developed for vineyards dry et al 1996 dry et al 2000a dry et al 2000b loveys et al 2000 kriedemann and goodwin 2003 indeed this irrigation technique allows to mitigate against water shortages by conserving soil humidity minimizing water loss through transpiration and increasing water use efficiency of crops while ensuring yields little or not affected ahmad et al 2020 contrary to conventional irrigation which is considered as a luxury irrigation and consists of wetting the entire root zone of the plant in order to satisfy the water needs of the crops under a high evapotranspiration regime in order to guarantee a maximum yield ben nouna et al 2016 fig 1 the frequency of alternating wet and dry sides of the root system is generally determined by the water requirements of the crop species growth stages soil water holding capacity at the time of irrigation chai et al 2016 as well as other factors such as precipitation temperature and soil type stikiÄ et al 2003 saeed et al 2008 according to ben nouna et al 2016 the success of deficit irrigation is more favorable in fine textured soils since they allow sufficient time for plants to adjust to the water status of the soil as opposed to light textured soils which can lead to rapid water stress as well as kriedemann and goodwin 2003 mentioned that light sandy loam and deep porous soils offer the best prospects for successful partial drying of the root zone since shallow sandy soils put crops under chronic stress and deep clay soils are slow wetting and allow too much lateral spread of wetted areas 3 irrigation principle prd and its physiological effects roots play an important role as a production site for plant growth regulators these affect many physiological functions of the whole plant by producing growth regulators such as cytokinins and abscisic acid aba bravdo 2005 under dry soil roots produce more aba than under normal conditions davies and zhang 1991 and it is moved as an anti stress chemical signal from the root to the shoots by transpiration and limits stomatal conductance sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 under moderate water stress aba acts earlier than the hydraulic signal sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 which represents the transmission of reduced soil water availability through changes in xylem sap tension stikiÄ et al 2003 when prd irrigation is applied to a crop the roots on the non irrigated side cause aba secretion while the fully hydrated roots maintain a favorable water status of the aerial part of the plant stikiÄ et al 2003 dodd et al 2008 it should be noted that aba induces the expression of a group of genes that increase drought tolerance bray 2002 as well as a partial closure of the stomata zhang and davies 1989 which in turn causes a decrease in leaf transpiration without limiting the co2 assimilation this hormone allows the reduction of water loss by transpiration without affecting photosynthesis and therefore it induces an increase in water use efficiency taiz and zeiger 2006 romero conde et al 2014 this irrigation system would separate some of the positive effects of water deficit better fruit quality limitation of lateral shoot growth and reduction of transpiration losses from the negative ones such as reduction of fruit yield sirigu et al 2007 actually this technique allows to create a controlled water deficit in terms of space irrigate a part of the roots and time alternation of irrigation between wet and dry side fig 2 4 gas exchange and stomatal regulation in the prd it has long been known that water deficits induce changes in the gas exchange characteristics of a plant that result in reduced water loss el sadek 2014 the moment when plants open their stomata for co2 absorption and carbon gain they lose a significant amount of their internal water du et al 2015 stomata are microscopic pores positioned on the aerial parts of plants casson and hetherington 2010 each pore is surrounded by a pair of oblong jointed cells slightly curved in the shape of a kidney called guard cells which modify the size of the pore according to their state of turgidity leung et al 2012 more than 98 of the water absorbed by the roots of many plant species is lost to the atmosphere through the stomata lugassi et al 2019 and any variation in the opening of these stomata affects the stomatal conductance and the photosynthetic rate sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 water stress generally reduces the photosynthetic capacity of plants which leads to a decrease in the rate of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance as well as affecting the production of matter and the formation of plant yield shen et al 2020 in fact the stomata of fully irrigated plants open widely and any small narrowing of their opening can cause a considerable reduction in water loss with little effect on photosynthesis kang and zhang 2004 in a study done on potato leaves in the prd treatment had smaller stomata and lower stomatal density compared to those in the di treatment which is due to the modulation of stomatal morphology by the prd treatment to effectively reduce transpiration rates and conserve plant water yan et al 2012 also on potato sun et al 2014 found that prd plants had smaller and denser stomata compared to fi and di which could have allowed the plants to optimize leaf gas exchange and lead to improved wue the mechanism responsible for the stomatal opening is based on the accumulation in particular of potassium anions chloride malate and sucrose at the level of the guard cells belin 2006 this accumulation of solutes in the guard cell cytoplasm causes an increase in the osmotic potential of this cell consequently an initial decrease in water potential roelfsema and hedrich 2005 to achieve equilibrium water will flow into the guard cell and the turgor pressure increases causing a swelling of the guard cells and subsequently the opening of the stomatal pore roelfsema and hedrich 2005 however the closing processes involve an efflux of potassium and anions and a decrease in the concentration of osmotically active sugars belin 2006 when aba is perceived at increased levels by the guard cells the latter reduce their turgidity and volume through the efflux of anions and potassium ions and by the gluconeogenesis conversion of malate into starch which leads to the closure of stomata kim et al 2010 fig 3 aba causes cytosolic calcium increase in guard cells through activation of the ca2 permeable cation channel virlouvet 2011 munemasa et al 2015 and improves ca2 cytosolic sensitivity siegel et al 2009 wich results in the activation of two types of channels are anion channels s type with slow voltage dependent activation and r type with rapid activation schroeder and keller 1992 s type anion channels considered a key step in stomatal closure munemasa et al 2015 generate slow and prolonged anion efflux and r type anion channels are transiently activated in less than 50 ms as interpreted by kim et al 2010 this anion efflux via the anion channels causes membrane depolarization which is also facilitated by the inhibition of h atpase pumps in plasma membranes as clarified by belin 2006 this depolarization leads to the activation of outgoing potassium channels which allow the efflux of k schroeder et al 1987 this output exerts a decrease in osmotic pressure as well as it triggers an outflow of water from the cells accompanied by a decrease in turgidity virlouvet 2011 in addition aba is capable on the one hand of inhibiting the inward k channels in order to reinforce the closing of the stomatal pores and on the other hand of activating the outgoing k channels to inhibit the opening of the stomatal pores virlouvet 2011 stomatal closure at the onset of water stress may increase water use efficiency since it inhibits transpiration without decreasing intercellular co2 concentrations however when the stress becomes severe the dehydration of the mesophyll cells inhibits photosynthesis which induces the alteration of its metabolism and the decrease of the water use efficiency taiz and zeiger 2006 as long as the transpiration rate is in the initial stages of water stress the intercellular concentration of co2 which is considered the main factor in the formation of organic compounds photosynthesis is not affected iqbal et al 2020 several experiments carried out by all over the world under different environmental conditions and on several types of vegetable crops and fruit trees have demonstrated that prd irrigation led to a decrease in stomatal conductance without having a significant effect on photosynthesis compared to conventional irrigation contrariwise others show that prd irrigation significantly affected photosynthesis the case of potato and maize table 1 from this table it can be seen that the crops did not react in the same way to prd irrigation in effect the photosynthesis of most of these crops was not significantly affected by the prd these contradictory results may be associated with the degree of water deficit the more severe the water stress becomes the more photosynthesis will be affected angelopoulos et al 1996 reported that the potential for photosynthesis is limited by stomatal conductance under moderate water stress conditions however under severe stress conditions it becomes limited by biochemical factors haouari 2013 as they may be due to the types of soil ahmadi et al 2010 to the type of species studied bourgault et al 2010 depending on the weather conditions during the experiment zegbe and behboudian 2008 or because of methodological problems in the application of the prd de lahera et al 2007 5 prd and increasing water use efficiency and productivity in recent years improving the water use efficiency of crops has become an issue of concern for researchers and agronomists due to water scarcity and increasing competition for water resources among agriculture and other sectors without forgetting the gradual increase in water prices costa et al 2007 to that end numerous research projects have been carried out to improve irrigation strategies and to adopt low water consumption systems to improve water use efficiency water productivity wp and move from increasing the yield per planted area to increasing the yield per amount of water applied abdalhi and jia 2018 the terms water use efficiency wue and water productivity wp are not identical with wue being a relationship between two physiological processes transpiration and photosynthesis i e say carbon assimilation or between agronomic parameters i e crop yield and water use jovanovic and stikic 2018 and water productivity is the amount of water needed per unit of yield tahi et al 2007 in this direction several researchers working on different crops found that the prd strategy increased the water use efficiency of prd compared to fully irrigated treatments fi table 2 indeed with prd irrigation deep percolation and superficial evaporation are reduced and therefore the amount of water used is reduced tafteh and sepaskhakh 2012 furthermore during root dehydration aba sent to leaves and shoots causes reduction of stomatal conductance transpiration and vegetative growth de la hera et al 2007 this reduction in surface leaf area and partial closure of stomata allowing an increase in water productivity davies et al 2002 according to these studies it is observed that prd irrigation induced the improvement of water use efficiency and productivity without or with a minimal and insignificant impact on the crop yield this is due on the one hand to the plant s long distance signaling system aba as physiological response which is notably translated by reduction of water loss via regulation behaviors at the level of stomata guard cells and by the reduction of the plant s foliage formation likewise by the improvement of the photosynthesis transpiration s ratio chai et al 2016 iqbal et al 2020 and on the other hand through the soil s evaporation surface reduction xie et al 2012 6 root development water and nitrogen uptake in prd irrigation the root systems of plants irrigated by prd have an improved growth activation with greater ability to explore deeper soils dry et al 2001 dos santos et al 2007 abrisqueta et al 2008 hence the prd technique improves the root biomass kang et al 2000 2001 mingo et al 2004 wang et al 2012 qi et al 2019 the emission of secondary roots kang et al 2000 du et al 2008a and the water absorption kang et al 2004 romero et al 2012 li et al 2014 in addition it increases roots hydraulic conductivity thompson et al 2007 hu et al 2011 zhenchang et al 2016 as well as their nutrient absorption efficiency kang and zhang 2004 chai et al 2016 jovanovic and stikic 2018 rodrigues et al 2008 and kang et al 2003 found that the irrigated side of the prd improved water use efficiency compared to the same amount of water supplied to control plants green et al 1997 found that after irrigation of previously dehydrated roots in mature apple trees an increase in sap flow rates over those that usually occur when the entire root zone is watered according to kang and zhang 2004 the new roots induced by the prd technique are sufficiently succulent to detect further soil drying as they can also improve nutrient uptake from this soil zone otherwise skinner et al 1999 indicated that alternate furrow irrigation was successful in increasing nitrogen uptake and reduce the leaching potential of no3 similarly kirda et al 2005 reported that prd furrow irrigation reduced residual mineral nitrogen left in the soil for a maize crop since the nature of prd is frequent wetting and drying of the soil profile in the root zone this alternation could stimulate the mineralization of soil organic nitrogen and increase the mineral nitrogen available to plants a phenomenon demonstrated by birch 1958 and confirmed by numerous experimental studies which have been known collectively as birch effect ceesay et al 2006 jarvis et al 2007 dodd et al 2015 moreover li et al 2007 reported that prd irrigation improved the ratio of nitrogen uptake in plants to nitrogen supplied by 16 4 compared to fully irrigated control likewise wang et al 2012 showed that prd irrigation resulted in more significant nitrogen accumulation in maize leaves compared to that in the case of conventional irrigation and prd irrigation was proven to promote the increase in nitrogen availability at soil level likewise fu et al 2017 concluded that prd irrigation improved the apparent nitrogen recovery fraction and its agronomic efficiency 7 prd and polluants leaching achieving the highest levels of production has been the main objective of human society in recent decades in order to guarantee enough food for an ever growing world population in this respect the extension of irrigated agriculture has been among the main drivers of food security ringler et al 2020 it is simple to develop a productive agriculture where the agricultural inputs water and nutrients are unlimited but this leads to the leaching of excess water of inferior quality under the root zone towards the unsaturated zone and eventually to the groundwater dahan et al 2014 indeed the use of agrochemical inputs such as pesticides and chemical fertilizers is unavoidable in agriculture with as a corollary their transfer into water resources fao 2017 in this regard agriculture is currently found to be the currently cause of worrying water pollution in many regions of the world boxall 2012 fao 2017 and it is considered the main diffuse polluter of groundwater in irrigated areas chowdary et al 2005 observations and field studies have indicated a strong link between irrigation practices and groundwater pollution power and schepers 1989 sharmasarkar et al 2001 feng et al 2005 jalali 2005 fetouani et al 2008 siyal et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 indeed the leaching of agrochemical inputs fertilizers and pesticides increases in direct relation to the increase in the amount of percolating water produced by irrigation asare et al 2001 letey and vaughan 2013 hatiye et al 2018 according to lage et al 2004 to produce a single ton of rice the amount of flooded irrigation water applied reaches more than 2000 tons while rice only needs 800 tons of water for its own physiological needs from which a large part of the applied water is lost in infiltration and percolation all the same manipulation of too low flow rates of water results in large infiltration losses during transport while applying too much water per plant results in drainage losses feltz 2016 in reality traditional methods of irrigation which consist of gravity fed systems where water transport from surface sources is through small canals to furrow or flood cultivated land induce penetration of nutrients and active ingredients of pesticides into deeper soil layers baldock et al 2000 and therefore an increased risk of groundwater pollution benjamin et al 1997 costa et al 2002 alhammadi and al shrouf 2013 in localized irrigation systems drip water is applied to the root zone in small droplets resulting in less water loss improvement of water use efficiency and reduction of evaporation losses and water infiltration outside the root zone feltz 2016 fertilizer application through drip irrigation fertigation can reduce fertilizer use and minimize groundwater pollution due to minimal irrigation fertilizer leaching badr and el yazied 2007 shedeed et al 2009 elasbah et al 2019 therefore it can concluded that the use of large quantities of water for irrigation has a double negative effect on water resources on the one hand it causes a huge consumption of fresh water and on the other hand it contributes to the degradation of the remaining water resources then decreasing irrigation applications during the growing season promotes reduced nutrient leaching from the root zone resulting in less groundwater contamination alrajhi et al 2017 as for prd irrigation the percolation of water in depth and its evaporation at the surface are reduced and consequently less water is used tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 barideh et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 kirda et al 2005 reported that prd irrigation is not only effective in saving water but it should also be considered an environmentally friendly irrigation practice since it leaves low residues of mineral nitrogen in the soil numerous studies have shown that prd has reduced losses of agrochemical inputs by leaching and percolation compared to conventional irrigation slatni et al 2011 ebrahimian et al 2012 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 wang et al 2019 qi et al 2020 thereby barzegari et al 2017 considered that prd irrigation constitutes a control measure of groundwater contamination by nitrogen it was also noted that prd should be valued for its environmental friendliness since it requires less fertilizer and less chemical spraying if widely adopted bacon 2003 furthermore alrajhi et al 2017 found that prd irrigation could be applied with recycled wastewater in order to minimize its negative impact on the soil environment on the one hand and on surface and ground water sources on the other hand since it contributes to the reduction of nutrient loading hence these studies showed that the prd is a promising irrigation technique which consists in guaranteeing a sustainable use of water resources since it allows the reduction of water inputs in relation to a maximum level of cultivation as it makes it possible to produce enough food without harming the environment by helping to minimize leaching and the migration of agrochemical inputs to groundwater 8 prd and soil salinity maintaining soil fertility is a major global concern kaman et al 2006 however salinization has long been a problem that threatens both soil fertility and crop productivity thompson et al 2020 in fact it mainly affects arable land that is irrigated with poor quality water nachshon and levy 2022 in addition to leaks from irrigation canals wells as well as the elevation of the saline water table due to excessive irrigation thompson et al 2020 moreover the poor management of irrigation systems is among the most important factors that lead to a continuous loss of soil fertility in the absence of timely corrective measures kaman et al 2006 according to the fao 2022 20 50 of irrigated land on all continents is too salty meaning that more than 1 5 billion people around the world face significant challenges in growing food due to soil degradation in order to control the soil salinity the management of water and the execution of measures that allow managing its movements determine the possibility to remedy this problem thompson et al 2020 therefore in addition to optimizing irrigation water needs through the use of new technologies kaman et al 2006 compared to other irrigation methods the drip system has specific advantages in saline conditions on the one hand through strong leaching of the soil near the drippers an area where root density is often highest on the other hand due to the relatively constant maintenance of soil salinity over time and near drippers under high frequency irrigation multiple irrigations per week similarly drip irrigation has the potential to increase yield in saline soils hanson and may 2010 as for deficit irrigation di prathapar and qureshi 2010 reported that it can be practiced up to a minimum threshold of 80 of potential evapotranspiration without reducing crop yields or increasing soil salinity however further reduction of irrigation water can allows good crop yields whereas there will be a serious risk of soil salinization in the long term abd el wahed et al 2017 they found that the average salinity of the soil under irrigation to 70 etc was increased by 28 26 and 13 50 compared to those of 100 and 85 etc respectively and they explained this increase by the sufficient availability of water at the root zone under 100 irrigation compared to that of the 70 zhang et al 2017 reported that salt concentration varied inversely to the amount of irrigation water this means that in cases of high water stress the soil salinity was high conversely to that in the case of complete irrigation as for prd abdelraouf and ragab 2018 showed via field and modeling results that salinity was lower for 100 complete irrigation if 75 if and 50 if treatments under groove and drip irrigation systems than when applying prd 50 under the same treatments but with mulch the observed and simulated soil salinity was lower compared to those without mulch similarly they recommended the use of prd under a localized drip system while using organic mulch as a good irrigation management practice to save fresh water and reduce salt concentration in the root zone of plants the results of another study by kaman et al 2006 where they showed that soil salinity at harvest under prd irrigation was 35 higher than under full irrigation for tomatoes and cotton and the accumulation of salt resulting from the prd in the soil of the field was in no way greater than the tolerance level of cereals cotton and other vegetable crops in general even more according to alrajhi et al 2015 the soil salinity increases remarkably in the case of irrigation with recycled wastewater than with fresh water with a low salt concentration this salinization becomes more pronounced when combined with a deficit irrigation system di prd irrigation could also be a promising method to reduce the negative impacts of using recycled wastewater for irrigation water supply additionally it has been found that mixing recycled wastewater with stormwater can reduce soil salinity and sodicity however ghrab et al 2013 reported that rainfall and soil texture were important factors affecting the movement and accumulation of salt in the soil profile and that the prd strategy seems to ensure long term sustainable olive yield by using saline water for irrigation 9 application of prd to citrus the current work focuses on studies that have treated the citrus cultivation irrigated with prd given the importance of this culture indeed the citrus fruit is considered an important product for human nutrition and health as it is cultivated in more than 80 countries gross et al 2014 moreover citrus production ranks first among fruits worldwide and in addition to the enormous economy of its industry which is estimated at more than 10 billion us dollars per year it contributes to the creation of jobs for millions people worldwide through several operations harvesting handling transport storage and marketing ladaniya 2008 the main producing regions include the arid and semi arid areas of the mediterranean basin such as spain italy greece egypt turkey and morocco romero conde et al 2014 in these regions the annual rainfall is generally lower and does not meet the water needs of the crops or its temporal distribution does not meet the seasonal demands during fruit growth consoli et al 2017 in morocco the citrus sector occupies an area estimated at 125 000 ha with a production of around 2 3 million tons as well as it plays a very important socio economic role as it is considered an important source of currency and a great generator of employment inra 2017 in 2017 morocco exported more than one million tons of fruit for a value of 917 million dollars in 2019 it was considered the 8th largest citrus exporter in the world with 681 000 tones including nearly 360 000 tons of clementines which makes it the second largest supplier in the world after spain harbouze et al 2019 however citrus growing is a major consumer of water and fertilizers and the current and future water resources of this country are under pressure hence the need for a powerful and sustainable tactic to properly manage the main irrigated perimeters of this sector inra 2017 according to chetto 2020 reduction of irrigation water consumption in citrus farms while maintaining the average yield is possible however severe water deficit negatively affects the productivity of citrus plants at different levels romero conde et al 2014 as such several works have taken the prd irrigation technique as their objective in order to have its effect on this citrus crop table 2 it is found that prd irrigation is an effective technique in terms of saving irrigation water allowing a considerable improvement in the efficiency of its use in citrus species generally these water savings are without or with an insignificant reduction in yield or sometimes an increase in yield apart from a few cases where these reductions were significant this difference in reaction between one crop and another as mentioned above is perhaps due to the type of soil or to the weather conditions during the experimentation as well as to methodological problems in the application of the prd among the cited negative impacts of prd is a decrease in the weight or size of the fruit kirda et al 2007 hutton and loveys 2011 consoli et al 2014 consoli et al 2017 slamini et al 2022 kirda et al 2007 reported that fruit size was strongly correlated with the amount of irrigation water applied in return the prd allowed an improvement in the quality of the fruit with increasing levels of tss and at consoli et al 2014 hutton and loveys 2011 consoli et al 2017 slamini et al 2022 as such hutton and loveys 2011 proposed prd irrigation as an advantageous technique for fruit juice production since juice quality attributes increased as well as indicated that fruit yield and quality are not closely related to the levels of water available to plants providing the ability to use mild water stress through prd to stimulate physiological mechanisms that reduce the relationship between stomatal conductance and ambient evaporative conditions however kirda et al 2007 reported that a further reduction in irrigation water resulted in a decrease in fruit quality with a reduction in size and weight moreover consoli et al 2017 concluded that when water resources are limited the prd at 50 etc is an effective water saving strategy to increase water use efficiency while physiological and growth parameters are practically unchanged it can be seen that prd irrigation has been able to achieve advantages especially in the water saving aspect by increasing the productivity and efficiency of the use of this water with negligible and non significant losses in yield in most cases on the other hand this technique can have limits which are manifested through climatic and edaphic conditions as well as by the sensitivity of species to water stress table 4 other studies conducted by nelson and melgar 2016 have clearly shown that during drought growers can grow citrus with low amounts of water while maintaining citrus yields and tree health at least during two consecutive years of extreme drought nevertheless consoli et al 2017 mentioned that this technique pushes cultivation to its limits and should only be applied to well established healthy trees in addition kirda et al 2007 cited that deficit irrigation whether through prd or conventional di must consider and balance water savings and impairment of marketable fruit quality melgar et al 2010 concluded that the prd technique could be used to increase root growth at the expense of shoot growth since this technique promotes root growth according to this analysis it can be said that significant water savings have been made thanks to prd irrigation without significant impact on the physiological parameters on the yield and on the quality of the fruits with sometimes an improvement in this one 10 conclusion irrigation has had a severe impact on the environment due to inappropriate water management practices developing productive agriculture while maintaining the quality of groundwater is one of the most important challenges in the sustainability of water resources to meet this challenge and to ensure the sustainable use of water resources it is therefore important to reconcile the demands for water and to use adequate irrigation systems to preserve the sustainability of the environment and increase agricultural productivity to achieve this the use of irrigation systems that allow good efficiency is of paramount importance in terms of minimizing the pollution of groundwater while saving water rates brought to the plot effective irrigation systems will reduce the return of water flows and can significantly reduce the migration of fertilizers and pesticides to water bodies prd irrigation technic is a new strategy that has been adapted during the last decade to a wide range of agronomic and horticultural crops allowing the increase of water productivity the possibility of increasing the efficiency of water and nutrient use and the improvement of the nutritional and health attributes of different agricultural species and in some cases the maintenance or even increase of their yield and the improvement of fruit quality on the environmental front it has shown good potential for controlling the leaching of agrochemical pollutants and protecting groundwater resources this will not only save water but will help minimize the adverse effects of excess irrigation water on water resources in addition this technique allows changing the growth and development of cultures which is due to the stimulation of physiological responses associated with water stress and these results in a significant reduction in water consumption through the production of chemical signals in the dry part of the roots which rapidly translates into a reduction in plant transpiration overall the results showed that prd is a successful alternative irrigation compared to conventional irrigation that can save up to 50 irrigation water without significant loss of yield therefore this irrigation technique may be a promising alternative for citrus under limited water availability in arid and semi arid agricultural areas without affecting the yield and quality of the fruit prd is a very promising irrigation technique that has several prospects of application in the future however additional research is needed to extend successfully perform this technique under different types of soils climates and cultivars thus to determine the duration of alternation of dry and wet sides the age of the cultivar and the phenological stage which will allow a judicious application of this irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9414,water availability is the most limiting factor for the crop production sector and one of the main regulators of the spatial distribution of plants agriculture consumes more than two thirds of the planet s total fresh water this high consumption causes significant conflicts in terms of freshwater allocation between agriculture and other economic sectors in addition conventional irrigation cannot be sustained in many parts of the world due to rapid depletion of water resources thus it is considered a luxury use of water it is noted that in recent years the methods of irrigation water application have been improved currently research has been directed towards irrigation strategies that reduce water applications deficit irrigation strategies di and allowing the efficiency of its use to be increased without affecting plant growth or yield partial root zone drying prd is an effective irrigation method that saves water although it can affect the root activity of plants through the heterogeneous distribution of moisture in the soil indeed the basic underlying theory of this technique is the use of the hormonal response of the roots to water stress which can induce physiological reactions in the aerial parts of the plant by a reduction in stomatal conductance and transpiration hence the plant can limit its water losses due to transpiration with a non significant reduction in yield moreover this irrigation technique is of paramount importance in terms of minimizing groundwater pollution by reducing the return flow of irrigation water and consequently significantly reducing the leaching of agrochemical inputs to groundwater this work aims to clarify the origin of prd irrigation and to analyze some physiological aspects of plants grown under this technique as well as its environmentally friendly aspect then to synthesize some research work on improving water productivity and its efficiency in citrus crops keywords water stress deficit irrigation partial root zone drying conventional irrigation stomatal conductance water productivity yield pollution leaching citrus data availability all data are able to be used by scientific readers 1 introduction several countries around the world are facing the issue of freshwater availability where agriculture is highly dependent on irrigation consuming 70 of this vital resource fao 2017 the world food situation has steadily improved due to various factors including high yielding seed varieties irrigation plant nutrition and pest control fao 2004 indeed food security can only be ensured to a large extent by irrigated agriculture which makes it possible to achieve yields twice as high as those of rainfed crops sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 to feed and meet the needs of the population of 9 1 billion in 2050 global food production must increase by around 70 between 2005 07 and 2050 fao 2009 furthermore it is due to irrigation that agricultural yields and production have been able to achieve a rapid increase over the past three decades as well as it has contributed to reducing poverty and food prices while leading to the improved health and nutrition rosegrant et al 2009 according to unesco in 2017 irrigated agriculture represented 20 of cultivated land and contributed to 40 of world food production unlike rainfed agriculture which covers 80 of cultivated land in the world and is responsible for only 60 of plant production un water 2021 however agriculture is considered a major source of water pollution through the use of agrochemical inputs fertilizers pesticides etc and irrigation singh and craswell 2021 which are on the one hand necessary for the growth and improvement of crop production but on the other hand if they are not managed can lead to significant social economic and environmental costs fao 2017 traditional methods of irrigation such as gravity irrigation or surface irrigation would result in excessive water supply but applying too much water to the root zone is not only a waste of water but also a factor of leaching of chemicals and nutrients from the root zone of the crop and consequently an increased risk of groundwater pollution siyal et al 2012 kambou et al 2014 in addition traditional irrigation methods are very inefficient since they are characterized by low water productivity and cannot ensure long term sustainable food security sidhu et al 2021 moreover reduced irrigation water supplies during the growing season reduces nutrient leaching from the root zone resulting in reduced groundwater contamination alrajhi et al 2017 indeed irrigation has more influence than fertilization on the quality of leaching water hence adequate irrigation associated with optimal fertilization was effective in reducing the potential environmental risk caused by excessive fertilization in intensive crop production systems li et al 2018 it is therefore important to use suitable irrigation systems and management techniques that both save water and reduce leaching by reducing deep percolation deficit irrigation di is a water saving technique used in recent years in many parts of the world and especially in areas where water supply is limited leads to improved water productivity and water use efficiency since the amount of water applied is less than the total water needs of the crop without compromising production fereres and soriano 2007 asrey et al 2018 sidhu et al 2021 whereas partial root zone drying prd is a new form of di that has significantly improved yield per unit of water applied compared to conventional irrigation sadras 2009 ahmadi et al 2010 as well as improved water use efficiency without significant reduction in yield kang and zhang 2004 ben nouna et al 2016 besides it is considered an environmentally friendly irrigation strategy that can reduce the leaching of pollutants to the receiving environment kirda et al 2005 barzegari et al 2017 in recent years many advances have been made around the world to provide more efficient storage and distribution of irrigation water as well as improved application methods through the shift from flood to overhead sprinkler to low level sprinkler microjet and drip kriedemann et al 2003 regarding the prd technique it can be achieved through different irrigation methods among which we find drip furrow micro sprinkler depending on the crop species soil texture or climatic variables kang et zhang 2004 on the one hand hedley et al 2014 reported that prd and rdi strategies are difficult to apply in furrow irrigation systems and prd is difficult to implement in sprinkler irrigation systems unlike drip irrigation which allows the implementation of this prd technique on the other hand wang et al 2006 reported that the prd could not be applied to energy crops with sprinkler or drip irrigation methods due to the high costs whereas it is possible to use furrow irrigation practical limitations in the application of prd and rdi are related to the soil hydraulic properties the volume and frequency of irrigation water applications and the occurrence of seasonal precipitation hedley et al 2014 as reported by ben nouna et al 2016 the application of prd with a soil drying threshold and an alternating frequency of irrigation that is incompatible with the soil typology and also the with crop vegetative stage can have a significant reduction effect on biomass production through the allocation of the non astomatic component responsible for co2 fixation andersen et al 2008 concluded that prd during the tuber growth stage reduced tuber yield and quality the objective of this work is to carry out a bibliographical synthesis of the works having treated the prd irrigation technique by analyzing its main physiological and agronomic effects on crops and especially on citrus fruits given the economic importance of this sector at the global level and its sensitivity to water stress without forgetting the essential role of this irrigation in preserving the sustainability of the environment 2 the concept of partial root zone drying irrigation the use of deficit irrigation di techniques for preserving and saving water in agricultural production is crucial and indispensable in areas where drought is prevalence as a result it reduces the vegetative growth of trees subsequently reduces its ability to compete with reproductive growth and significantly reduces the cost of agricultural management measures chalmers 1981 furthermore the amount of soil moisture available for plant growth is significantly decreased by low rainfall paired with high rates of evapotranspiration consequently the amount of soil water that is available to plants is drastically reduced in regions with low annual precipitation less than 300 mm and high evapotranspiration rates durÃ¡n zuazo and rodrÃ­guez pleguezuelo 2008 furthermore crop production in most of west africa is primarily rain fed and agricultural development is hampered by both heat and water stress indeed warming in the future climate will exacerbate crop heat stress and accelerate evapotranspiration further reducing moisture availability in the soil and shortening the suitable growing season according to studies using the regcm4 modeling method cook and vizy 2013 besides to mitigate runoff farmers should plan irrigations using new scientific techniques that account for evapotranspiration losses since the last irrigation and apply no more water than is required for maximum economic yield and an adequate leaching fraction lehrsch et al 2014 hence the di approaches are helpful to reduce irrigation water loss through evapotranspiration especially in semi arid and arid areas fathian et al 2015 as the partial root zone drying prd is a modified technique of deficit irrigation di ahmadi et al 2010 which consists in irrigating the entire root zone with a quantity of water less than that lost by the phenomenon of evapotranspiration liu et al 2006 indeed prd could be used as a water saving strategy particularly in water scarce areas to mitigate the impact of climate change on decreasing precipitation and rising temperatures li et al 2018 however future predictions in a climate change scenario included an increase in greenhouse gases so elevated co2 concentrations in conjunction with water scarcity will be an additional challenge for prd experiments with elevated co2 concentrations recently revealed that photosynthetic rate grain yield and water productivity in maize plants were higher under deficit irrigation than under full irrigation li et al 2018 these findings point in a new direction for testing the performance of prd techniques in specific agro ecological conditions and when different environmental variables interact jovanovic et stikic 2018 the practices of partial drying of the root zone and as the name suggests include 2 types fixed partial drying or fixed prd which consists of irrigating half of the root system while exposing the other half to desiccation throughout the growing season and alternating partial drying in which the irrigation of both sides of the plant is done alternately to allow the wet side of the root to dry and the dry side to be fully irrigated chai et al 2016 jovanovic and stikic 2018 grimes et al 1968 are the first to apply the concept of prd irrigation in the field on cotton by alternating furrow irrigation in the usa then it was realized in iran on the bean crop through two types of irrigation furrow irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation by sepaskhah et al 1976 then and always to iran and on the bean crops samadi and sepaskhah 1984 have applied this technique through fixed and alternate furrow irrigation again and in order to fully understand the process of this irrigation method blackman and davies 1985 and zhang et al 1987 tried this technique in the laboratory by dividing the roots between two soil compartments and applying irrigation to only one compartment after further extensive studies on prd were done in australia and prd irrigation was exploited and developed for vineyards dry et al 1996 dry et al 2000a dry et al 2000b loveys et al 2000 kriedemann and goodwin 2003 indeed this irrigation technique allows to mitigate against water shortages by conserving soil humidity minimizing water loss through transpiration and increasing water use efficiency of crops while ensuring yields little or not affected ahmad et al 2020 contrary to conventional irrigation which is considered as a luxury irrigation and consists of wetting the entire root zone of the plant in order to satisfy the water needs of the crops under a high evapotranspiration regime in order to guarantee a maximum yield ben nouna et al 2016 fig 1 the frequency of alternating wet and dry sides of the root system is generally determined by the water requirements of the crop species growth stages soil water holding capacity at the time of irrigation chai et al 2016 as well as other factors such as precipitation temperature and soil type stikiÄ et al 2003 saeed et al 2008 according to ben nouna et al 2016 the success of deficit irrigation is more favorable in fine textured soils since they allow sufficient time for plants to adjust to the water status of the soil as opposed to light textured soils which can lead to rapid water stress as well as kriedemann and goodwin 2003 mentioned that light sandy loam and deep porous soils offer the best prospects for successful partial drying of the root zone since shallow sandy soils put crops under chronic stress and deep clay soils are slow wetting and allow too much lateral spread of wetted areas 3 irrigation principle prd and its physiological effects roots play an important role as a production site for plant growth regulators these affect many physiological functions of the whole plant by producing growth regulators such as cytokinins and abscisic acid aba bravdo 2005 under dry soil roots produce more aba than under normal conditions davies and zhang 1991 and it is moved as an anti stress chemical signal from the root to the shoots by transpiration and limits stomatal conductance sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 under moderate water stress aba acts earlier than the hydraulic signal sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 which represents the transmission of reduced soil water availability through changes in xylem sap tension stikiÄ et al 2003 when prd irrigation is applied to a crop the roots on the non irrigated side cause aba secretion while the fully hydrated roots maintain a favorable water status of the aerial part of the plant stikiÄ et al 2003 dodd et al 2008 it should be noted that aba induces the expression of a group of genes that increase drought tolerance bray 2002 as well as a partial closure of the stomata zhang and davies 1989 which in turn causes a decrease in leaf transpiration without limiting the co2 assimilation this hormone allows the reduction of water loss by transpiration without affecting photosynthesis and therefore it induces an increase in water use efficiency taiz and zeiger 2006 romero conde et al 2014 this irrigation system would separate some of the positive effects of water deficit better fruit quality limitation of lateral shoot growth and reduction of transpiration losses from the negative ones such as reduction of fruit yield sirigu et al 2007 actually this technique allows to create a controlled water deficit in terms of space irrigate a part of the roots and time alternation of irrigation between wet and dry side fig 2 4 gas exchange and stomatal regulation in the prd it has long been known that water deficits induce changes in the gas exchange characteristics of a plant that result in reduced water loss el sadek 2014 the moment when plants open their stomata for co2 absorption and carbon gain they lose a significant amount of their internal water du et al 2015 stomata are microscopic pores positioned on the aerial parts of plants casson and hetherington 2010 each pore is surrounded by a pair of oblong jointed cells slightly curved in the shape of a kidney called guard cells which modify the size of the pore according to their state of turgidity leung et al 2012 more than 98 of the water absorbed by the roots of many plant species is lost to the atmosphere through the stomata lugassi et al 2019 and any variation in the opening of these stomata affects the stomatal conductance and the photosynthetic rate sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 water stress generally reduces the photosynthetic capacity of plants which leads to a decrease in the rate of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance as well as affecting the production of matter and the formation of plant yield shen et al 2020 in fact the stomata of fully irrigated plants open widely and any small narrowing of their opening can cause a considerable reduction in water loss with little effect on photosynthesis kang and zhang 2004 in a study done on potato leaves in the prd treatment had smaller stomata and lower stomatal density compared to those in the di treatment which is due to the modulation of stomatal morphology by the prd treatment to effectively reduce transpiration rates and conserve plant water yan et al 2012 also on potato sun et al 2014 found that prd plants had smaller and denser stomata compared to fi and di which could have allowed the plants to optimize leaf gas exchange and lead to improved wue the mechanism responsible for the stomatal opening is based on the accumulation in particular of potassium anions chloride malate and sucrose at the level of the guard cells belin 2006 this accumulation of solutes in the guard cell cytoplasm causes an increase in the osmotic potential of this cell consequently an initial decrease in water potential roelfsema and hedrich 2005 to achieve equilibrium water will flow into the guard cell and the turgor pressure increases causing a swelling of the guard cells and subsequently the opening of the stomatal pore roelfsema and hedrich 2005 however the closing processes involve an efflux of potassium and anions and a decrease in the concentration of osmotically active sugars belin 2006 when aba is perceived at increased levels by the guard cells the latter reduce their turgidity and volume through the efflux of anions and potassium ions and by the gluconeogenesis conversion of malate into starch which leads to the closure of stomata kim et al 2010 fig 3 aba causes cytosolic calcium increase in guard cells through activation of the ca2 permeable cation channel virlouvet 2011 munemasa et al 2015 and improves ca2 cytosolic sensitivity siegel et al 2009 wich results in the activation of two types of channels are anion channels s type with slow voltage dependent activation and r type with rapid activation schroeder and keller 1992 s type anion channels considered a key step in stomatal closure munemasa et al 2015 generate slow and prolonged anion efflux and r type anion channels are transiently activated in less than 50 ms as interpreted by kim et al 2010 this anion efflux via the anion channels causes membrane depolarization which is also facilitated by the inhibition of h atpase pumps in plasma membranes as clarified by belin 2006 this depolarization leads to the activation of outgoing potassium channels which allow the efflux of k schroeder et al 1987 this output exerts a decrease in osmotic pressure as well as it triggers an outflow of water from the cells accompanied by a decrease in turgidity virlouvet 2011 in addition aba is capable on the one hand of inhibiting the inward k channels in order to reinforce the closing of the stomatal pores and on the other hand of activating the outgoing k channels to inhibit the opening of the stomatal pores virlouvet 2011 stomatal closure at the onset of water stress may increase water use efficiency since it inhibits transpiration without decreasing intercellular co2 concentrations however when the stress becomes severe the dehydration of the mesophyll cells inhibits photosynthesis which induces the alteration of its metabolism and the decrease of the water use efficiency taiz and zeiger 2006 as long as the transpiration rate is in the initial stages of water stress the intercellular concentration of co2 which is considered the main factor in the formation of organic compounds photosynthesis is not affected iqbal et al 2020 several experiments carried out by all over the world under different environmental conditions and on several types of vegetable crops and fruit trees have demonstrated that prd irrigation led to a decrease in stomatal conductance without having a significant effect on photosynthesis compared to conventional irrigation contrariwise others show that prd irrigation significantly affected photosynthesis the case of potato and maize table 1 from this table it can be seen that the crops did not react in the same way to prd irrigation in effect the photosynthesis of most of these crops was not significantly affected by the prd these contradictory results may be associated with the degree of water deficit the more severe the water stress becomes the more photosynthesis will be affected angelopoulos et al 1996 reported that the potential for photosynthesis is limited by stomatal conductance under moderate water stress conditions however under severe stress conditions it becomes limited by biochemical factors haouari 2013 as they may be due to the types of soil ahmadi et al 2010 to the type of species studied bourgault et al 2010 depending on the weather conditions during the experiment zegbe and behboudian 2008 or because of methodological problems in the application of the prd de lahera et al 2007 5 prd and increasing water use efficiency and productivity in recent years improving the water use efficiency of crops has become an issue of concern for researchers and agronomists due to water scarcity and increasing competition for water resources among agriculture and other sectors without forgetting the gradual increase in water prices costa et al 2007 to that end numerous research projects have been carried out to improve irrigation strategies and to adopt low water consumption systems to improve water use efficiency water productivity wp and move from increasing the yield per planted area to increasing the yield per amount of water applied abdalhi and jia 2018 the terms water use efficiency wue and water productivity wp are not identical with wue being a relationship between two physiological processes transpiration and photosynthesis i e say carbon assimilation or between agronomic parameters i e crop yield and water use jovanovic and stikic 2018 and water productivity is the amount of water needed per unit of yield tahi et al 2007 in this direction several researchers working on different crops found that the prd strategy increased the water use efficiency of prd compared to fully irrigated treatments fi table 2 indeed with prd irrigation deep percolation and superficial evaporation are reduced and therefore the amount of water used is reduced tafteh and sepaskhakh 2012 furthermore during root dehydration aba sent to leaves and shoots causes reduction of stomatal conductance transpiration and vegetative growth de la hera et al 2007 this reduction in surface leaf area and partial closure of stomata allowing an increase in water productivity davies et al 2002 according to these studies it is observed that prd irrigation induced the improvement of water use efficiency and productivity without or with a minimal and insignificant impact on the crop yield this is due on the one hand to the plant s long distance signaling system aba as physiological response which is notably translated by reduction of water loss via regulation behaviors at the level of stomata guard cells and by the reduction of the plant s foliage formation likewise by the improvement of the photosynthesis transpiration s ratio chai et al 2016 iqbal et al 2020 and on the other hand through the soil s evaporation surface reduction xie et al 2012 6 root development water and nitrogen uptake in prd irrigation the root systems of plants irrigated by prd have an improved growth activation with greater ability to explore deeper soils dry et al 2001 dos santos et al 2007 abrisqueta et al 2008 hence the prd technique improves the root biomass kang et al 2000 2001 mingo et al 2004 wang et al 2012 qi et al 2019 the emission of secondary roots kang et al 2000 du et al 2008a and the water absorption kang et al 2004 romero et al 2012 li et al 2014 in addition it increases roots hydraulic conductivity thompson et al 2007 hu et al 2011 zhenchang et al 2016 as well as their nutrient absorption efficiency kang and zhang 2004 chai et al 2016 jovanovic and stikic 2018 rodrigues et al 2008 and kang et al 2003 found that the irrigated side of the prd improved water use efficiency compared to the same amount of water supplied to control plants green et al 1997 found that after irrigation of previously dehydrated roots in mature apple trees an increase in sap flow rates over those that usually occur when the entire root zone is watered according to kang and zhang 2004 the new roots induced by the prd technique are sufficiently succulent to detect further soil drying as they can also improve nutrient uptake from this soil zone otherwise skinner et al 1999 indicated that alternate furrow irrigation was successful in increasing nitrogen uptake and reduce the leaching potential of no3 similarly kirda et al 2005 reported that prd furrow irrigation reduced residual mineral nitrogen left in the soil for a maize crop since the nature of prd is frequent wetting and drying of the soil profile in the root zone this alternation could stimulate the mineralization of soil organic nitrogen and increase the mineral nitrogen available to plants a phenomenon demonstrated by birch 1958 and confirmed by numerous experimental studies which have been known collectively as birch effect ceesay et al 2006 jarvis et al 2007 dodd et al 2015 moreover li et al 2007 reported that prd irrigation improved the ratio of nitrogen uptake in plants to nitrogen supplied by 16 4 compared to fully irrigated control likewise wang et al 2012 showed that prd irrigation resulted in more significant nitrogen accumulation in maize leaves compared to that in the case of conventional irrigation and prd irrigation was proven to promote the increase in nitrogen availability at soil level likewise fu et al 2017 concluded that prd irrigation improved the apparent nitrogen recovery fraction and its agronomic efficiency 7 prd and polluants leaching achieving the highest levels of production has been the main objective of human society in recent decades in order to guarantee enough food for an ever growing world population in this respect the extension of irrigated agriculture has been among the main drivers of food security ringler et al 2020 it is simple to develop a productive agriculture where the agricultural inputs water and nutrients are unlimited but this leads to the leaching of excess water of inferior quality under the root zone towards the unsaturated zone and eventually to the groundwater dahan et al 2014 indeed the use of agrochemical inputs such as pesticides and chemical fertilizers is unavoidable in agriculture with as a corollary their transfer into water resources fao 2017 in this regard agriculture is currently found to be the currently cause of worrying water pollution in many regions of the world boxall 2012 fao 2017 and it is considered the main diffuse polluter of groundwater in irrigated areas chowdary et al 2005 observations and field studies have indicated a strong link between irrigation practices and groundwater pollution power and schepers 1989 sharmasarkar et al 2001 feng et al 2005 jalali 2005 fetouani et al 2008 siyal et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 indeed the leaching of agrochemical inputs fertilizers and pesticides increases in direct relation to the increase in the amount of percolating water produced by irrigation asare et al 2001 letey and vaughan 2013 hatiye et al 2018 according to lage et al 2004 to produce a single ton of rice the amount of flooded irrigation water applied reaches more than 2000 tons while rice only needs 800 tons of water for its own physiological needs from which a large part of the applied water is lost in infiltration and percolation all the same manipulation of too low flow rates of water results in large infiltration losses during transport while applying too much water per plant results in drainage losses feltz 2016 in reality traditional methods of irrigation which consist of gravity fed systems where water transport from surface sources is through small canals to furrow or flood cultivated land induce penetration of nutrients and active ingredients of pesticides into deeper soil layers baldock et al 2000 and therefore an increased risk of groundwater pollution benjamin et al 1997 costa et al 2002 alhammadi and al shrouf 2013 in localized irrigation systems drip water is applied to the root zone in small droplets resulting in less water loss improvement of water use efficiency and reduction of evaporation losses and water infiltration outside the root zone feltz 2016 fertilizer application through drip irrigation fertigation can reduce fertilizer use and minimize groundwater pollution due to minimal irrigation fertilizer leaching badr and el yazied 2007 shedeed et al 2009 elasbah et al 2019 therefore it can concluded that the use of large quantities of water for irrigation has a double negative effect on water resources on the one hand it causes a huge consumption of fresh water and on the other hand it contributes to the degradation of the remaining water resources then decreasing irrigation applications during the growing season promotes reduced nutrient leaching from the root zone resulting in less groundwater contamination alrajhi et al 2017 as for prd irrigation the percolation of water in depth and its evaporation at the surface are reduced and consequently less water is used tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 barideh et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 kirda et al 2005 reported that prd irrigation is not only effective in saving water but it should also be considered an environmentally friendly irrigation practice since it leaves low residues of mineral nitrogen in the soil numerous studies have shown that prd has reduced losses of agrochemical inputs by leaching and percolation compared to conventional irrigation slatni et al 2011 ebrahimian et al 2012 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 wang et al 2019 qi et al 2020 thereby barzegari et al 2017 considered that prd irrigation constitutes a control measure of groundwater contamination by nitrogen it was also noted that prd should be valued for its environmental friendliness since it requires less fertilizer and less chemical spraying if widely adopted bacon 2003 furthermore alrajhi et al 2017 found that prd irrigation could be applied with recycled wastewater in order to minimize its negative impact on the soil environment on the one hand and on surface and ground water sources on the other hand since it contributes to the reduction of nutrient loading hence these studies showed that the prd is a promising irrigation technique which consists in guaranteeing a sustainable use of water resources since it allows the reduction of water inputs in relation to a maximum level of cultivation as it makes it possible to produce enough food without harming the environment by helping to minimize leaching and the migration of agrochemical inputs to groundwater 8 prd and soil salinity maintaining soil fertility is a major global concern kaman et al 2006 however salinization has long been a problem that threatens both soil fertility and crop productivity thompson et al 2020 in fact it mainly affects arable land that is irrigated with poor quality water nachshon and levy 2022 in addition to leaks from irrigation canals wells as well as the elevation of the saline water table due to excessive irrigation thompson et al 2020 moreover the poor management of irrigation systems is among the most important factors that lead to a continuous loss of soil fertility in the absence of timely corrective measures kaman et al 2006 according to the fao 2022 20 50 of irrigated land on all continents is too salty meaning that more than 1 5 billion people around the world face significant challenges in growing food due to soil degradation in order to control the soil salinity the management of water and the execution of measures that allow managing its movements determine the possibility to remedy this problem thompson et al 2020 therefore in addition to optimizing irrigation water needs through the use of new technologies kaman et al 2006 compared to other irrigation methods the drip system has specific advantages in saline conditions on the one hand through strong leaching of the soil near the drippers an area where root density is often highest on the other hand due to the relatively constant maintenance of soil salinity over time and near drippers under high frequency irrigation multiple irrigations per week similarly drip irrigation has the potential to increase yield in saline soils hanson and may 2010 as for deficit irrigation di prathapar and qureshi 2010 reported that it can be practiced up to a minimum threshold of 80 of potential evapotranspiration without reducing crop yields or increasing soil salinity however further reduction of irrigation water can allows good crop yields whereas there will be a serious risk of soil salinization in the long term abd el wahed et al 2017 they found that the average salinity of the soil under irrigation to 70 etc was increased by 28 26 and 13 50 compared to those of 100 and 85 etc respectively and they explained this increase by the sufficient availability of water at the root zone under 100 irrigation compared to that of the 70 zhang et al 2017 reported that salt concentration varied inversely to the amount of irrigation water this means that in cases of high water stress the soil salinity was high conversely to that in the case of complete irrigation as for prd abdelraouf and ragab 2018 showed via field and modeling results that salinity was lower for 100 complete irrigation if 75 if and 50 if treatments under groove and drip irrigation systems than when applying prd 50 under the same treatments but with mulch the observed and simulated soil salinity was lower compared to those without mulch similarly they recommended the use of prd under a localized drip system while using organic mulch as a good irrigation management practice to save fresh water and reduce salt concentration in the root zone of plants the results of another study by kaman et al 2006 where they showed that soil salinity at harvest under prd irrigation was 35 higher than under full irrigation for tomatoes and cotton and the accumulation of salt resulting from the prd in the soil of the field was in no way greater than the tolerance level of cereals cotton and other vegetable crops in general even more according to alrajhi et al 2015 the soil salinity increases remarkably in the case of irrigation with recycled wastewater than with fresh water with a low salt concentration this salinization becomes more pronounced when combined with a deficit irrigation system di prd irrigation could also be a promising method to reduce the negative impacts of using recycled wastewater for irrigation water supply additionally it has been found that mixing recycled wastewater with stormwater can reduce soil salinity and sodicity however ghrab et al 2013 reported that rainfall and soil texture were important factors affecting the movement and accumulation of salt in the soil profile and that the prd strategy seems to ensure long term sustainable olive yield by using saline water for irrigation 9 application of prd to citrus the current work focuses on studies that have treated the citrus cultivation irrigated with prd given the importance of this culture indeed the citrus fruit is considered an important product for human nutrition and health as it is cultivated in more than 80 countries gross et al 2014 moreover citrus production ranks first among fruits worldwide and in addition to the enormous economy of its industry which is estimated at more than 10 billion us dollars per year it contributes to the creation of jobs for millions people worldwide through several operations harvesting handling transport storage and marketing ladaniya 2008 the main producing regions include the arid and semi arid areas of the mediterranean basin such as spain italy greece egypt turkey and morocco romero conde et al 2014 in these regions the annual rainfall is generally lower and does not meet the water needs of the crops or its temporal distribution does not meet the seasonal demands during fruit growth consoli et al 2017 in morocco the citrus sector occupies an area estimated at 125 000 ha with a production of around 2 3 million tons as well as it plays a very important socio economic role as it is considered an important source of currency and a great generator of employment inra 2017 in 2017 morocco exported more than one million tons of fruit for a value of 917 million dollars in 2019 it was considered the 8th largest citrus exporter in the world with 681 000 tones including nearly 360 000 tons of clementines which makes it the second largest supplier in the world after spain harbouze et al 2019 however citrus growing is a major consumer of water and fertilizers and the current and future water resources of this country are under pressure hence the need for a powerful and sustainable tactic to properly manage the main irrigated perimeters of this sector inra 2017 according to chetto 2020 reduction of irrigation water consumption in citrus farms while maintaining the average yield is possible however severe water deficit negatively affects the productivity of citrus plants at different levels romero conde et al 2014 as such several works have taken the prd irrigation technique as their objective in order to have its effect on this citrus crop table 2 it is found that prd irrigation is an effective technique in terms of saving irrigation water allowing a considerable improvement in the efficiency of its use in citrus species generally these water savings are without or with an insignificant reduction in yield or sometimes an increase in yield apart from a few cases where these reductions were significant this difference in reaction between one crop and another as mentioned above is perhaps due to the type of soil or to the weather conditions during the experimentation as well as to methodological problems in the application of the prd among the cited negative impacts of prd is a decrease in the weight or size of the fruit kirda et al 2007 hutton and loveys 2011 consoli et al 2014 consoli et al 2017 slamini et al 2022 kirda et al 2007 reported that fruit size was strongly correlated with the amount of irrigation water applied in return the prd allowed an improvement in the quality of the fruit with increasing levels of tss and at consoli et al 2014 hutton and loveys 2011 consoli et al 2017 slamini et al 2022 as such hutton and loveys 2011 proposed prd irrigation as an advantageous technique for fruit juice production since juice quality attributes increased as well as indicated that fruit yield and quality are not closely related to the levels of water available to plants providing the ability to use mild water stress through prd to stimulate physiological mechanisms that reduce the relationship between stomatal conductance and ambient evaporative conditions however kirda et al 2007 reported that a further reduction in irrigation water resulted in a decrease in fruit quality with a reduction in size and weight moreover consoli et al 2017 concluded that when water resources are limited the prd at 50 etc is an effective water saving strategy to increase water use efficiency while physiological and growth parameters are practically unchanged it can be seen that prd irrigation has been able to achieve advantages especially in the water saving aspect by increasing the productivity and efficiency of the use of this water with negligible and non significant losses in yield in most cases on the other hand this technique can have limits which are manifested through climatic and edaphic conditions as well as by the sensitivity of species to water stress table 4 other studies conducted by nelson and melgar 2016 have clearly shown that during drought growers can grow citrus with low amounts of water while maintaining citrus yields and tree health at least during two consecutive years of extreme drought nevertheless consoli et al 2017 mentioned that this technique pushes cultivation to its limits and should only be applied to well established healthy trees in addition kirda et al 2007 cited that deficit irrigation whether through prd or conventional di must consider and balance water savings and impairment of marketable fruit quality melgar et al 2010 concluded that the prd technique could be used to increase root growth at the expense of shoot growth since this technique promotes root growth according to this analysis it can be said that significant water savings have been made thanks to prd irrigation without significant impact on the physiological parameters on the yield and on the quality of the fruits with sometimes an improvement in this one 10 conclusion irrigation has had a severe impact on the environment due to inappropriate water management practices developing productive agriculture while maintaining the quality of groundwater is one of the most important challenges in the sustainability of water resources to meet this challenge and to ensure the sustainable use of water resources it is therefore important to reconcile the demands for water and to use adequate irrigation systems to preserve the sustainability of the environment and increase agricultural productivity to achieve this the use of irrigation systems that allow good efficiency is of paramount importance in terms of minimizing the pollution of groundwater while saving water rates brought to the plot effective irrigation systems will reduce the return of water flows and can significantly reduce the migration of fertilizers and pesticides to water bodies prd irrigation technic is a new strategy that has been adapted during the last decade to a wide range of agronomic and horticultural crops allowing the increase of water productivity the possibility of increasing the efficiency of water and nutrient use and the improvement of the nutritional and health attributes of different agricultural species and in some cases the maintenance or even increase of their yield and the improvement of fruit quality on the environmental front it has shown good potential for controlling the leaching of agrochemical pollutants and protecting groundwater resources this will not only save water but will help minimize the adverse effects of excess irrigation water on water resources in addition this technique allows changing the growth and development of cultures which is due to the stimulation of physiological responses associated with water stress and these results in a significant reduction in water consumption through the production of chemical signals in the dry part of the roots which rapidly translates into a reduction in plant transpiration overall the results showed that prd is a successful alternative irrigation compared to conventional irrigation that can save up to 50 irrigation water without significant loss of yield therefore this irrigation technique may be a promising alternative for citrus under limited water availability in arid and semi arid agricultural areas without affecting the yield and quality of the fruit prd is a very promising irrigation technique that has several prospects of application in the future however additional research is needed to extend successfully perform this technique under different types of soils climates and cultivars thus to determine the duration of alternation of dry and wet sides the age of the cultivar and the phenological stage which will allow a judicious application of this irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
